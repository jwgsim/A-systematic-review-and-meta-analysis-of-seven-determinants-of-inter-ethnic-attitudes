AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to changes in health service utilization patterns and a rapid rise in care being delivered remotely. However, there has been little published research examining patients' experiences of accessing remote consultations since COVID-19. Such research is important as remote methods for delivering some care may be maintained in the future.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to use content from Twitter to understand discourse around health and care delivery in the United Kingdom as a result of COVID-19, focusing on Twitter users' views on and attitudes toward care being delivered remotely.
   Methods: Tweets posted from the United Kingdom between January 2018 and October 2020 were extracted using the Twitter application programming interface. A total of 1408 tweets across three search terms were extracted into Excel; 161 tweets were removed following deduplication and 610 were identified as irrelevant to the research question. The remaining relevant tweets (N=637) were coded into categories using NVivo software, and assigned a positive, neutral, or negative sentiment. To examine views of remote care over time, the coded data were imported back into Excel so that each tweet was associated with both a theme and sentiment.
   Results: The volume of tweets on remote care delivery increased markedly following the COVID-19 outbreak. Five main themes were identified in the tweets: access to remote care (n=267), quality of remote care (n=130), anticipation of remote care (n=39), online booking and asynchronous communication (n=85), and publicizing changes to services or care delivery (n=160). Mixed public attitudes and experiences to the changes in service delivery were found. The proportion of positive tweets regarding access to, and quality of, remote care was higher in the immediate period following the COVID-19 outbreak (March-May 2020) when compared to the time before COVID-19 onset and the time when restrictions from the first lockdown eased (June-October 2020).
   Conclusions: Using Twitter data to address our research questions proved beneficial for providing rapid access to Twitter users' attitudes to remote care delivery at a time when it would have been difficult to conduct primary research due to COVID-19. This approach allowed us to examine the discourse on remote care over a relatively long period and to explore shifting attitudes of Twitter users at a time of rapid changes in care delivery. The mixed attitudes toward remote care highlight the importance for patients to have a choice over the type of consultation that best suits their needs, and to ensure that the increased use of technology for delivering care does not become a barrier for some. The finding that overall sentiment about remote care was more positive in the early stages of the pandemic but has since declined emphasizes the need for a continued examination of people's preference, particularly if remote appointments are likely to remain central to health care delivery.

AB  - Background: Although patients with epilepsy (PWE) constitute a considerable sector of the population in Benghazi, there is no adequate knowledge about this disease. Objectives: To assess knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy among Libyan people who live in Benghazi city. Methods: A cross-sectional prospective hospital-based study was conducted in the year 2020, from June to August. The participants were adults, PWE were included as well as people without epilepsy (NEP). Participants were interviewed through a twelve-item questionnaire related to knowledge which included definition, causes, manifestations, first aids, treatment options, and curability. In addition, attitudes toward epilepsy were tested by questions that include immediate actions when seeing a patient seizing, and whether or not PWE can drive, work, marry, and conceive). Data analysis: Data were processed by the statistical software (SPSS) version 18.0. Differences between categorical variables were tested by Chi square and P value at 0.05, which has been considered statistically significant. Results: The total number of the interviewees was 156. The mean age was 43 +/- 14 SD years (18-76 years), 105 (67%) were males. Twenty-eight (18%) of the participants were PWE, while the remaining 128 (82%) were NEP. Ninetynine (64%) and 145 (92%) of the participants answered correctly regarding definition and manifestations of epilepsy, respectively. The participants with Bachelor degree and post graduate level have shown a better understanding of definitions and treatments of epilepsy (P = 0.000). They also had better attitudes toward PWE in terms of their ability to conceive (P = 0.002).PWE had better knowledge about manifestations and first aids of epilepsy compared to NEP, though they did not have differences in attitude compared to NEP. Participants' knowledge about epilepsy was mainly obtained from friends (41; 26%), patients (40; 26%), and media (37; 24%). A major portion of participants 94 (60%) did not feel satisfactory about their own information about epilepsy. Conclusion: Knowledge and attitudes toward epilepsy were generally satisfactory. Participants with Bachelor degree or higher level of education had better knowledge and positive attitudes toward PWE. Patients and media are important tools to improve knowledge and attitudes about epilepsy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Recruitment to psychiatry is insufficient to meet projected mental health service needs world-wide. We report on the career plans of final year medical students from 20 countries, investigating factors identified from the literature which influence psychiatric career choice.
   Methods: Cross sectional electronic or paper survey. Subjects were final year medical students at 46 medical schools in participating countries. We assessed students' career intentions, motivations, medical school teaching and exposure to psychiatry. We assessed students' attitudes and personality factors. The main outcome measure was likelihood of specializing in psychiatry. Multilevel logistic regression was used to examine the joint effect of factors upon the main outcome.
   Results: 2198 of 9135 (24%) of students responded (range 4 to 91%) across the countries. Internationally 4.5% of students definitely considered psychiatry as a career (range 1 to 12%). 19% of students (range 0 to 33%) were "quite likely", and 25% were "definitely not" considering psychiatry. Female gender, experience of mental/physical illness, media portrayal of doctors, and positive attitudes to psychiatry, but not personality factors, were associated with choosing psychiatry. Quality of psychiatric placement (correlation coefficient = 0.22, p < 0.001) and number of placements (correlation coefficient = 0.21, p < 0.001) were associated with higher ATP scores. During medical school, experience of psychiatric enrichment activities (special studies modules and university psychiatry clubs), experience of acutely unwell patients and perceived clinical responsibility were all associated with choice of psychiatry. Multilevel logistic regression revealed six factors associated with students choosing psychiatry: importance of own vocation, odds ratio (OR) 3.01, 95% Cl 1.61 to 5.91, p < 0.001); interest in psychiatry before medical school, OR 10.8 (5.38 to 21.8, p < 0.001); undertaking a psychiatry special study module, OR 1.45 (1.05 to 2.01, p = 0.03) or elective OR 4.28 (2.87-6.38, p < 0.001); membership of a university psychiatry club, OR 3.25 (2.87 to 6.38, p < 0.001); and exposure to didactic teaching, OR 0.54 (0.40 to 0.72, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: We report factors relevant to medical student selection and psychiatry teaching which affect career choice. Addressing these factors may improve recruitment to psychiatry internationally.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine the knowledge and attitude of secondary school students to epilepsy and its treatment that could pose as barriers in the treatment and care of epilepsy patients within the community.
   Methods: This study was cross-sectional and descriptive in design using a self administered custom designed multiple choice questionnaire with sections on general information on epilepsy, awareness and perception of epilepsy, treatment of epilepsy/seizures and attitude towards people living with epilepsy.
   Results: Out of 969 questionnaires analyzed, the majority of the students (87.6%) had heard of epilepsy as a disease. The commonest sources of information were the electronic media (36.4%) and family members (25.6%). More than half (59.4%) had witnessed a convulsion in the past and 8.9% had a family member with epilepsy. jerking (50.6%) and loss of consciousness (47.4%) were identified as the commonest manifestations of epilepsy. Epilepsy was considered a psychiatric disorder by 51.9% and as an infectious disease by 40.6%. About 39.3% considered epilepsy to be due to spiritual causes, old age or poisoning/bad blood. A total of 63.1% regarded orthodox medicine and prayers as the best means to treat epilepsy, while 6.8% chose herbal remedies. Concerning first aid treatment, 50.6% agreed that an object should be inserted into the mouth, while 49.5% Would call for medical help and 28.8% would remove the person from harm. On attitude, 64.9% would not keep a friend with epilepsy, 69.1% would not play with someone with epilepsy, 84.2% would not marry someone with epilepsy. 41.1% of the students said that people with epilepsy should neither marry while 42.2% say they should not have children. Only 39.1.5% had an overall positive attitude towards people living with epilepsy.
   Conclusions: There is a persisting poor knowledge, attitude and practice of epilepsy among secondary school students in SE Nigeria. Efforts should be made to include basic facts about disorders with social consequences such as epilepsy in school health education curriculum. (C) 2013 British Epilepsy Association.

AB  - Unlike many species that enact social behaviour in loose aggregations (such as swarms or herds), humans form groups comprising many long-term, intense, non-reproductive bonds with non-kin(1). The cognitive demands of navigating such groups are thought to have significantly influenced human brain evolution(2). Yet little is known about how and to what extent the human brain encodes the structure of the social networks in which it is embedded. We characterized the social network of an academic cohort (N = 275); a subset (N = 21) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study involving viewing individuals who varied in terms of 'degrees of separation' from themselves (social distance), the extent to which they were well-connected to well-connected others (eigenvector centrality) and the extent to which they connected otherwise unconnected individuals (brokerage). Understanding these characteristics of social network position requires tracking direct relationships, bonds between third parties and the broader network topology. Pairing network data with multi-voxel pattern analysis, we show that information about social network position is accurately perceived and spontaneously activated when encountering familiar individuals. These findings elucidate how the human brain encodes the structure of its social world and underscore the importance of integrating an understanding of social networks into the study of social perception.

AB  - The political backlash against multiculturalism alongside the media portrayal of the global refugee crisis would suggest that the spaces for cultural difference have contracted and moved into a mode of transnational crisis management. This article addresses the moral panic over cultural difference by challenging some of the philosophical frameworks that have justified naturalized negative attitudes towards migrants and dismissed the viability of cosmopolitan perspectives. In particular, the author will critically evaluate the antagonistic perspective developed in Peter Sloterdijk's writings and Chantal Mouffe's theory of agonism. To grasp the complex and hybrid forms of cross-cultural exchanges, the author argues that a more robust vision of cosmopolitanism is necessary.

AB  - Background Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and Western medicine are available and have a long history in Hong Kong. Little is known on the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong. In this study, the intention to use TCM was examined by the extended theory of planned behavior. Methods An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 15 and 29 November 2021. Respondents' attitude towards using TCM, intention to use TCM, knowledge, perceived behavioral control, perceived service quality, satisfaction, subjective norms and demographic characteristics were collected from the survey. To examine the conceptual framework in this study, partial least square structural equation model (PLS-SEM) was adopted. Results In total, 446 responses (completion rate = 74.3%) were analysed. Attitude towards TCM was the strongest predictor to the intention to use TCM followed by satisfaction and subjective norms. Attitude had a partial mediating effect on the relationship between subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intention to use TCM. Attitude had a full mediating effect on the relationship between knowledge and intention to use TCM. Satisfaction had a full mediating effect on the relationship between perceived service quality and intention to use TCM. Conclusions This is the first study to investigate the predictors of the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong by using TPB. Individuals' attitude towards TCM has showed stronger effect to the intention to use TCM than other predictors, such as satisfaction, perceived behavioral control and subjective norms. To enhance the intention to use TCM in Hong Kong, key stakeholders, including TCM professional organisations, health professionals and policymakers, should develop a positive attitude towards TCM among Hong Kong population.

AB  - Greece exhibits the lowest seafood per capita consumption amongst European Mediterranean countries, and the investigation of consumer attitudes to new seafood products would bridge the gap among producers and consumers by promoting the vertical integration of the supply chain. However, limited information exists about consumer preferences for bivalves in the Mediterranean and for wild bivalves in particular. The present study aims to investigate, for the first time, consumers' attitudes towards the purchase and consumption of bivalves, and more specifically, towards the edible pearl oyster Pinctada imbricata radiata, in the Greek shellfish market. Adult participants from the entire country completed a questionnaire covering the basic marketing aspects of bivalve and pearl oyster consumption, such as choice, purchase, reasons for consuming bivalves, confidence in product's hygiene certification, media influence, etc. Data analysis included uni- and multi-variate statistics to examine the possible relations between the consumers' demographics and socio-economic characteristics, and bivalve marketing aspects. Results showed that the majority of Greek consumers chooses traditional shellfish shops for purchasing pearl oysters, prefers a certification of quality, and trusts the confirmation provided by the veterinary authorities. Consumers' attitudes vary considerably according to their demographics and socio-economic characteristics. Multivariate models revealed that the married, highly educated consumers that live in urban places were more reluctant to try new shellfish products and to accept an innovative way of market supply. The results reflect the positive attitude of Greek consumers towards the consumption of pearl oyster, a fact that would be helpful for decision makers in the planning of production, which in turn would promote bivalve consumption in the Greek shellfish market.

AB  - Purpose Booming mobile shopping has resulted in an increase use of m-payment. Although m-payment is still in its infancy in Thailand, it has started to affect the daily lives of Thai people. This study aims to understand the role of perceive risks in influencing millennials' intention to use m-payment for mobile shopping. Design/methodology/approach The sample covers 250 millennials in Bangkok who were surveyed between February to May 2019. Purposive sampling and convenient sampling were applied to collect data. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was applied for statistical analysis. Further, mediation effect of attitude was studied. Findings The results showed that only perceived time risk significantly but negatively affect millennials' attitude towards using m-payment. Moreover, mediation test confirms that the relationship between perceived time risk and intention to use m-payment is mediated by attitude. Research limitations/implications First, limited number of respondents cannot be a representative of millennials as a whole. Second, the study is limited to a general study, in which the results of m-payment might not be effectual to explain other scenarios (e.g. offline setting) and the market situation in another cultural context. Practical implications It is important that business practitioners should formulate less complicated system under the most decent transaction time to elicit positive attitude towards m-payment. Also, message should emphasize on the time being saved and simplicity of the m-payment. Originality/value Since the study of how perceived risks influence millennials intention to m-payment remains insufficient in Southeast Asian context especially in Thailand, this paper contributes to the updating of empirical findings to the existing literatures.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a deadly virus that continues to afflict many countries worldwide. The development of a COVID-19 vaccine to combat the disease's spread and devastating effects is still ongoing, and as the pandemic progresses, new, more effective vaccines are likely to be created. The aim of this study was to assess awareness and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination in Ethiopia.
   Methods: A population-based cross-sectional e-survey was conducted among 425 participants from March 13, 2021 to April 10, 2021. The survey was conducted using a structured and self-reported questionnaire containing informed consent along with three sections (socio-demographic, awareness, and attitude); a multivariable logistic regression model was performed to determine the variables predicting awareness towards COVID-19 vaccinations.
   Results: The mean score of awareness was 4.3 (SD=1.1) out of 7, with the overall awareness of 40.8%, and the mean score of attitudes was 4.09 (SD=2.16) out of 9, with an overall "positive attitude" score of 24.2%. College and above educational level (AOR=2.21, 95% CI=1.32, 4.62), had access to mass media (AOR=4.75, 95% CI=2.74, 8.24), and urban residency (AOR=2.83, 95% C.I = 1.57, 5.09) were significantly associated with awareness towards COVID-19 vaccination.
   Conclusion: In Ethiopia, there is a poor knowledge toward COVID-19 vaccines, according to the current report. The findings indicate that authorities should implement an urgent health education program and disseminate more reliable information. Using the media, policymakers should take measures to ensure adequate awareness of COVID-19 vaccinations with various stakeholders.

AB  - Purpose: The study aimed to find out about the knowledge, attitudes, and preventative practices of COVID-19 among international students in China during the pandemic.
   Material and Methods: A cross-section survey was conducted among 300 international students from 13 different universities in Hubei province of China between March and April 2020 which relied upon convenience sampling method.
   Results: Out of 300 respondents, 153 (51%) of the respondents were female students, of which the majority were single, undergraduate students who were doing medicine (163, 54.3%) and engineering programs (68, 22.7%). The majority of international students had an impressive knowledge on the causes, risks, and spread of COVID-19, and that they were no misconception of the pandemic 229 (76%) to 281 (98%) respectively. These students also demonstrated a markedly positive attitude towards the virus and a feeling that they were almost completely safe being in China (264, 84%). Variations were found on Knowledge scores in age group (P<0.01) and majors (P=0.025), attitude scores on major of study (P=0.015), and experience (P<0.01). Furthermore, the results revealed that all the students (300, 100%) adhered to and practiced set preventive measures against COVID-19 and that there was a positive correlation between attitudes and preventative practices (r=0.219, P<0.01).
   Conclusion: This study found that social media platform was contributing enormously towards information dissemination and Chinese universities were commended for their continuous notifications on COVID-19 which helped students to have full knowledge. This, in turn, was instrumental in helping students to form good attitudes and practices towards COVID-19.

AB  - Amidst a global pandemic, survival needs become salient and the ability of individuals to regulate feelings and actions might be particularly relevant to protecting themselves from harm. Drawing from Regulatory Focus Theory individuals who are more focused on prevention are also more likely to enact health-protective behaviours, including sexual health behaviours, because they are more aware of threats. Extending this reasoning to the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a pre-registered longitudinal study with 174 individuals from 23 countries (M-age = 30.66, SD = 11.81; 77.6% women), to examine the role of regulatory focus in predicting the sexual activity of single individuals. We assessed demographic information, regulatory focus, and personality traits at baseline (T1), perceived threats two weeks later (T2), and sexual activity indicators two weeks later (T3). As hypothesised, results showed that single individuals who reported a greater focus on prevention at the onset of the pandemic perceived more pandemic-related threats and, in turn, reported less frequent sexual activity. These effects were consistent even when controlling for promotion (i.e. pleasure motives), personality, geographic location, local social distancing policies, gender, and sexual orientation. Findings are discussed considering their implications for the sexual functioning and sexual health of single individuals.

AB  - Purpose As self-service technologies (SSTs) become more prevalent, service providers are actively encouraging customers' involvement with these technologies, sometimes even forcing their customers to use SSTs. This paper aims to examine the influence of the SST-only (vs full-service) mode on customers' negative attitude toward SST providers through the mediating mechanism of powerlessness and explores how SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism moderate the impacts of the SST-only mode on powerlessness. Design/methodology/approach Three experiments were performed, study 1 tested the main and mediating effect and studies 2 and 3 verified the moderating effects. Findings The results suggest that customer perceived powerlessness mediates the relationship between SST-only (vs full-service) mode and negative attitude toward SST providers. When the levels of SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism are high, the impacts of SST-only on powerlessness are attenuated. Alternative mediating mechanism of powerlessness is examined and ruled out. Research limitations/implications Future research should investigate other moderators that may reduce the impacts of SST on customer powerlessness. These moderators could be service-operating procedures, SST interface design, types of service situations and customer characteristics. In addition, other consequences of powerlessness, other than the negative attitude toward SST providers and intention to switch investigated here, should be investigated as well. Practical implications This research provides guidelines helping service providers to improve their customers' SST usage experience by showing both SST familiarity and SST anthropomorphism may alleviate the negative effects of SST-only mode on customer perceived powerlessness more effectively. Originality/value This research examines the role of customers' psychological reactions toward the SST-only mode, particularly from the perspective of power and control.

AB  - Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, mass media play a vital role in containing the outbreak of the virus by quickly and effectively delivering risk communication messages to the public. This research examines the effects of risk communication exposure on public understanding and risk perception of COVID-19 and public compliance with health preventive measures. Design/methodology/approach Data from Vietnam during COVID-19 social distancing and path analysis model are used for empirical analysis. Findings This analysis finds that exposure to risk communication in mass media encourages public compliance directly and indirectly through the mediating roles of public understanding and risk perception. Further investigations also find that exposure to risk communication in both online media and traditional media facilitates public compliance. In addition, exposure to risk communication in online media only raises public risk perception, whereas exposure to risk communication in traditional media only raises public understanding. Research limitations/implications This research implies that traditional and online media should be combined to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of government risk communication work. Originality/value This research is among the first attempts that examine the role of mass media (both traditional and online) in enhancing public compliance with preventive measures directly and indirectly through the mediating roles of public risk perception and understanding.

AB  - Background Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer globally among women in incidence and mortality. Women living with HIV (WLHIV) are disproportionately at a higher risk of developing the disease.
   Aim To determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of cervical cancer screening among WLHIV in the Kilimanjaro region, northern Tanzania, following the integration of these services in routine HIV care in the country.
   Methods and results A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kilimanjaro region among 297 WLHIV attending care and treatment centers (CTC) in Hai district and Mawenzi regional hospitals in northern Tanzania between 21 August and 3 September 2020. A questionnaire was used for data collection using face-to-face interviews. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20.0. Frequencies and percentages summarized categorical variables and numerical variables summarized using median and interquartile range (IQR). About half (50.2%) of 297 WLHIV in this study had ever screened for cervical cancer, and 64% screened within the past 12 months preceding the survey. Although 90% ever heard of cervical cancer screening, only 20.5% knew when WLHIV should start screening. Over half (52.5%) had adequate knowledge of prevention, 38.4% on risk factors, and 27.9% of cervical cancer signs and symptoms. Two-thirds (66.7%) had positive attitudes toward cervical cancer screening. A major source of cervical cancer screening information was the health care providers (80.1%) and the mass media (66%), particularly radio.
   Conclusions The WLHIV in this study had inadequate knowledge but favorable attitudes toward cervical cancer screening, while half had screened for cervical cancer. Efforts should be directed to capacity building of health care providers at CTC and scaling up the mass media campaigns as relevant interventions to promote the uptake of cervical cancer screening programs among WLHIV in Tanzania.

AB  - Effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic is dependent on individual understanding of the disease and compliance to prevention measures. Early media depiction of health information about COVID-19 may influence public perceptions and behaviour. Media should ensure coverage is relevant, timely and actionable to encourage individuals to respond appropriately. India has been particularly affected by a large COVID-19 caseload. We analysed online reporting in India to assess how well the media represented health information about COVID-19 as per the World Health Organization's Strategic Risk Communications guidelines. This included media coverage of symptoms, transmission and prevention. We found that limited articles (18.8%) provided actionable suggestions to readers, including urging people to stay at home and social distance. Most articles were relevant as per WHO COVID-19 updates, accurately covering symptoms, risk factors for severe symptoms, transmission and prevention. However, 40% of media coverage of treatments options provided misleading information, such as suggesting plasma therapy or chloroquine, were effective. In addition, only 1.9% of articles included discussion of equity issues, where many prevention activities such as distancing are less applicable in lower-income households. Sixty-seven per cent of articles quoting sources of information quoted credible sources such as public health agencies and researchers. Media coverage also did not appear to reflect WHO updates in a timely manner, with most of the coverage preceding these updates. The findings show that Indian media should focus on actionable and relevant reporting that provides guidance for individual response. Media should also endeavour to report on evidence-based prevention and treatment options to avert the spread of misinformation.
   Lay Summary The way media represents health information about COVID-19 may influence public understanding of the virus and behaviours they take to contain its spread. Therefore, media coverage should be accurate, timely and provide specific actions. India has been particularly affected by COVID-19. Based on the World Health Organization's Strategic Risk Communications guidelines, we analysed online reporting in India to assess how well the media represented COVID-19 health information. This included media coverage of symptoms, transmission and prevention. We found that very few articles provided direct suggestions to readers on prevention behaviours, such as staying at home. Most articles accurately covered symptoms, risk factors for severe symptoms, transmission and prevention. However, there was limited coverage of equity issues that affect low-income households, such as their ability to social distance or hand wash. In addition, treatment options not known to be effective received high coverage, such as plasma therapy. Only some articles included credible sources of information such as quoting public health agencies and researchers. Media coverage also usually preceding official updates from WHO, rather than waiting and responding to validated information. The Media should report on evidence-based prevention and treatment options to avert the spread of misinformation and encourage appropriate behaviours.

AB  - Media plays an integral role in informing the public of wildlife management decisions and stakeholder perceptions. We analyzed the presence of different cognitions via a quantitative content analysis (QCA) of print news media surrounding Maine's bear hunting referendums. In Maine, there were two referendums to ban baiting, hounding, and trapping that narrowly failed. This article investigated the representation of debate themes in public discourse. We examined key cognitions toward baiting, hounding, and trapping in 247 newspaper articles concerning the referendums. Results showed that pro-referendum entities frequently express negative attitudes toward baiting, hounding, and trapping, while, conversely, anti-referendum entities argue Maine needs these methods to control the population and that they benefit humans. Results suggested implications for future black bear hunting policy and represented a critical step toward developing communication strategies among government officials, animal welfare advocates, and the hunting community.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a global problem since first appearing in 2020. Not only does it heavily affect the health sector, but it also spreads to other sectors such as social, economic, and education. Studies have shown that many global companies, including those based in Indonesia, contribute to the global pandemic mitigation by implementing Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programs. So far, the implementation of CSR is mainly focused on providing food, medicines, and vitamins, as well as medical facilities and equipment. On the other hand, other reviewed studies showed that the pandemic has transformed the CSR implementation from offline to online, also known as CSR digitalization. The limitation in mobility and strict social distancing rules by the government have resulted in this emergence of CSR digitalization initiatives. Although CSR digitalization is still relatively rare, several technology companies have started implementing it. CSR digitalization practices aim to empower micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) to master digital competencies and increase their economic condition affected by the pandemic. Companies implementing CSR digitalization reported a more efficient and effective CSR implementation. This article can potentially introduce a new paradigm to the industry players on the importance of CSR digitalization and future opportunities due to the changes in the behavior of society post-pandemic.

AB  - Childhood undernutrition coupled with poor feeding practices continues to be public health problems in many parts of the world and efforts to address them remain elusive. We tested the hypothesis that women who are exposed to radio health/nutrition education will demonstrate greater nutrition and health knowledge, positive attitudes towards preventive health and better dietary diversity practices for improved child growth. We used a two-arm, quasi-experimental, non-equivalent comparison group design with pre- and post-test observations to evaluate the intervention. The study population comprised 712 mothers with children aged 6-36 months who were randomly selected from five intervention districts and one comparison district in Northern Ghana. Difference-in-difference (DID) analysis was performed to assess study outcomes. After 12-month implementation of intervention activities, the minimum dietary diversity and the minimum acceptable diet improved significantly (DID 9.7 percentage points, P 0.014 and DID 12.1 percentage points, P 0.001, respectively) in the intervention study group, compared with the comparison group. Mothers in the intervention communities had a nutritionrelated knowledge, attitudes and practices score that was significantly higher than their colleagues in the comparison communities (DID 0.646, P < 0.001). The intervention did not have significant effects on the nutritional status as measured by height-for-age Z-score or weight-for-height Z-score. The data provide evidence that health and nutrition education using radio drama significantly increased health-/nutrition-related knowledge but had little effect on nutritional status.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been an ideal breeding ground for conspiracy theories. Yet, different beliefs could have different implications for individuals' emotional responses, which in turn could relate to different behaviours and specifically to either a greater or lesser compliance with social distancing and health-protective measures. In the present research, we investigated the links between COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, emotions (anger, anxiety, and hope), attitudes towards government restrictions, and self-reported compliant behaviour. Results of a cross-sectional survey amongst a large UK sample (N = 1,579) provided support for the hypothesis that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs showed a polarizing relationship with compliant behaviour through opposing emotional pathways. The relation was mediated by higher levels of anger, themselves related to a lesser perceived importance of government restrictions, and simultaneous higher levels of anxiety, related to a greater perceived importance. Hope was also related to conspiracy beliefs and to greater perceived importance but played a weaker role in the mediational model. Results suggest that the behavioural correlates of conspiracy beliefs might not be straightforward, and highlight the importance of considering the emotional states such beliefs might elicit when investigating their potential impact.

AB  - Introduction: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing and shelter-at-home have become necessary for public health and safety in the United States. This period of social isolation may be a risk factor for mental health problems, particularly among young adults for whom rates of loneliness are already high. Young adults also engage in more social media use than other age groups, a form of socialization associated with adverse effects on mental health, including loneliness and depression. Methods: The current study examined potential mediating roles of social media use and social support seeking on the relationship between age and loneliness symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants included 1,674 adults who completed an online survey regarding depressive symptoms, loneliness, coping strategies, and changes to their daily lives as a result of the pandemic. Results: Results indicated that young adults were lonelier than older adults during the pandemic, showed a greater increase in social media use, and lower social support seeking. Higher increases in social media use and lower social support seeking mediated the relationship between age group and loneliness. Discussion: Findings are discussed in context of prior research and potential effects of stress and isolation during the pandemic. Clinical implications and suggestions for intervention are elaborated.

AB  - Background Pediatric dental radiography is a field with numerous uses as well as concerns regarding radiation safety. This study was undertaken to assess the knowledge that parents have regarding the same. This questionnaire survey was conducted with the aim of assessing the knowledge, attitude, and practices of parents toward pediatric dental radiography. Material and Methods In total, 280 questionnaires were answered by parents of children visiting the Pediatric Dental Department. The first 10 questions served to evaluate the knowledge and attitude of parents toward pediatric dental radiography. The last three questions were designed to assess the practices of parents in relation to dental radiography and protective gear. The answers were collected and analyzed. Results From the survey it was seen that most parents were aware that the harmful effects from dental radiography were minimal (51%). A fairly significant number of parents lacked the knowledge regarding the harmful effects of dental radiography in children compared to adults (63%), in comparison to the harmful effects from cell phones (66%) and in comparison to harmful effects of medical radiography (42%). A fair number of parents seemed to be aware of the detrimental cumulative nature (47%) of radiation. It was found that a large number of parents do not ask for an explanation regarding the need for the dental radiograph for their children before the dental treatment (50%). Most parents (64%) were not aware of the availability of protective gear and very few (16%) requested for it. Conclusion The parents considered in this study had appreciable knowledge and a positive attitude toward dental radiography. However, a significant lack of knowledge regarding protective gear used for dental radiography among these parents was identified from this study.

AB  - Purpose- The purpose of this study is to investigate consumers' buying intentions (BIs) towards sustainable properties with green living concept (GLC). It also aims to examine the dynamic relationships between environmental advertisements (EAd), green brand positioning (GBP), attitude towards environmental responsibility (ER) and consumers' sustainable properties BI in the Malaysian context.
   Design/methodology/approach- Data were collected via online questionnaire survey, which yielded 143 completed usable responses. Structural equation modelling-partial least squares (Smart PLS, version 3) was used to analyse the data.
   Findings- The findings of this study revealed that EAd and GBP significantly affect consumers' attitude towards ER, which in turn affects consumers' BI of the sustainable properties with GLC.
   Practical implications - This study suggests that without inculcating a positive attitude towards the environment among consumers, it becomes a daunting task to drive consumers to purchase sustainable properties in Malaysia. Thus, the marketers should focus on green promotional activities to attract more customers to buy sustainable properties with GLCs. Moreover, it is suggested to target the right market segment to secure more sales.
   Social implications- The findings of this study will enable the government and the social marketers to understand the drivers of buying sustainable properties with GLC, which in turn will contribute to the higher environmental welfare.
   Originality/value- This study is among the pioneers to examine consumers' sustainable property purchase intention. It provides significant insights for the social marketers and policymakers to understand how to motivate consumers to purchase sustainable properties with GLCs. Moreover, this study has investigated few comparatively new links such as the direct effect of EAd and GBP on attitude towards environmental responsibility and the mediating effect of attitude towards environmental responsibility between environmental stimuli and consumer's sustainable properties BI.

AB  - Aims and objectives: This study examines intra-speaker variation in code-switching (CS) by comparing the frequency and pattern of CS across two different interaction modes (interview speech and online posting) based on the same individuals. This study also explores the reasons why these speakers exploit their linguistic repertoire variably in different modes. Methodology: I interviewed 40 Chinese-English bilinguals based in London and collected their speech data by recording the semi-structured interviews. Written data were obtained by collecting the participants' posts on Sinaweibo, a popular Chinese social media. A detailed questionnaire was also administered among the participants to gather information on their language attitudes and other social backgrounds. Data and analysis: For each participant, 30 minutes of the interview were analyzed and 50 posts were chosen for written CS analysis. Quantitative analyses were performed to describe the frequency and pattern of CS. The use of CS across interaction modes was further compared and analyzed against the specific characteristics of each mode and also against the participants' language attitudes. Findings: Results of quantitative analyses show that these participants used significantly more amount and more complex pattern of CS in their online posting. The suggested reason points to an elevated processing demand which is related to the nature of bilingualism and the level of synchronicity of interaction mode. Results of qualitative analyses also suggest that the participants' positive attitudes towards CS and English language, both overtly expressed and covertly implied, contributed to the varying degree of CS use. Originality: This study is among the first attempts to compare CS data across different interaction modes based on same individuals. Comparative data of this kind are quite scarce in the international literature. Significance/implications: The findings highlight and provide insights into the dynamic interactions between social, cognitive, and situational factors under the surface of linguistic practice.

AB  - Purpose - Eating patterns around the world have changed considerably, including food choices and preparation. One of these alterations in food consumption patterns is an increase in desire for fast-food consumption, which has been associated with poor diet quality. In order to analyze consumers' food consumption behaviors, it is necessary to account for psychological factors (e.g. attitudes) that shape behaviors. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to explore influencing factors on the attitudes of consumers in Isfahan City toward fast-food consumption, so as to understand why consumers use fast-food despite widespread knowledge of the negative health consequences.
   Design/methodology/approach - The predominant paradigm of the present study was quantitative, in that it was a correlational survey. The population of this study consisted of consumers who lived in Isfahan city in June 2015. A total sample of 350 people was selected using convenience sampling. Data were collected through a face-to-face interview with the consumers using a researcher-made questionnaire. Analysis was conducted using SPSS (V20) and AMOS (V20) software and a set of correlation and differential tests.
   Findings - The results revealed that "health consciousness" and "trust" are the main effective factors on the attitudes of the respondents. The results also revealed that the elder and married respondents have more positive attitudes toward fast-food consumption.
   Originality/value - It is worth mentioning that fast-food has become an important part of the Iranian diet. These findings have both academic and policy implications. The results showed that the need for much more consumer education regarding fast-food and mass media could effectively be used. Further, the government should support and subsidize fast-food restaurants so that they may produce healthier food options.

AB  - Consumers have described retargeted ads as "creepy," possibly because these ads cue consumers that marketers are collecting personal data. Participants (N = 280) were either exposed to an ad that was targeted to past online behaviors or a general product ad. Behavioral targeting had a positive direct effect on purchase intent, but it also set off a negative indirect effect. Those exposed to behavioral targeting experienced increased perceived marketing surveillance, which led to increased threat, increased psychological reactance, negative attitudes toward the ad, and negative purchase intention. The indirect cost of perceived marketing surveillance on purchase intent was 4.5 percent.

AB  - In the wake of COVID-19, virtual platforms of contact have reimagined trans-of-color knowledge and intimacy despite social distance. The "digital," whether cybernetic or handcrafted, has Long pervaded trans and queer-of-color artistic innovation and even informed their critical responses to the AIDS crisis. None have a better grasp of the virtuosity of virtual interfaces than mixed-media artist Olivero Rodriguez. Drawing on his Literary and image-based art piece entitled The Papi Project (2010-18), this essay articulates how he works in tandem with speculation and archiving. The result is a life support system reviving dormant erotic networks and complex familial relations central to his reclusive Late father, Peter. By chasing Papi, Rodriguez empowers an archival art strategy to visually reconcile a trans-of-color childhood and patrilineal relations with a virus. Furthermore, by contesting the way AIDS narratives eclipse children's perspectives on disease, Rodriguez's intervention has consequence for trans-of-color historical critique, breathing new life into an "epidemic child, not birthed but raised by AIDS."

AB  - Objective: Unintended pregnancy has become a substantially growing reproductive health concern in South Asian region. The objective of this survey was to assess the magnitude of unintended pregnancy along with its correlates among currently pregnant women residing in Karachi.
   Methods: A community based, multistage, cross-sectional study was carried out among 612 currently pregnant women from squatter settlements of Karachi, inquiring for "unintended pregnancy", outcome of interest. Multivariable logistic analysis was done using SPSS v.19 to determine associated factors.
   Results: Of 612 pregnant women interviewed, 168(27.4%) reported their pregnancies as unintended. The multivariable regression identified a high likelihood of unintended pregnancy among females aged >= 35 years (adjusted odds ratio =3.0, 95% Confidence Interval =1.2 to 4.9)), having: ideal family structure perceived as <= two children (Adj. OR=2.3, CI=1.3 - 4.5), no media exposure (Adj. OR=2.9, CI=1.7 to 5.0), no inter-spousal communication about planning a family (Adj. OR=1.5, CI=1.1 - 2.3), >= 5 children (Adj. OR=7.2, CI: 3.4 to 15.1), more sons than daughters (Adj. OR=4.0, CI=1.7 to 6.7), and positive attitude towards using family planning method (Adj. OR=1.8, CI=1.2 to 2.8). Unintended pregnancy decreased with increased age at marriage (Adj. OR= 0.8, CI=0.8, 0.7 - 0.9) and with use of contraceptive methods ever in life (Adj. OR=0.7, CI=0.5 - 0.9).
   Conclusion: We found important predictors which suggest policy measures for enhancing media exposure, promoting effective family planning usage, and incorporating behaviour change models in reproductive health clinics to modify fertility intentions of couples.

AB  - Objectives: Medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) in the criminal justice setting is an effective way to address opioid use disorder and prevent associated deaths in the community. The Rhode Island Department of Corrections (RIDOC) is the first statewide correctional system in the United States to offer comprehensive MOUD services to incarcerated individuals.However, due to stigma, eligible individuals may be reluctant to engage with MOUD. This study aims to 1) evaluate the efficacy of an educational video intervention about MOUD and 2) characterize MOUD-related attitudes in a general incarcerated population.
   Methods: Participants were recruited from eight elective classes offered to soon-to-be-released incarcerated individuals at RIDOC. Participants viewed an eight-minute video featuring incarcerated individuals speaking about their experiences using MOUD, designed to reduce MOUD-related stigma. Participants were administered surveys prior to and after watching the video to assess changes in MOUD knowledge (MOUD-K) and MOUD attitudes (MOUD-A).
   Results: This evaluation of the intervention included 80 incarcerated participants (median age = 35, 93% male, 36% non-Hispanic White, and 26% non-Hispanic Black). Forty percent indicated non-medical opioid use within six months prior to incarceration; 13% had previously used MOUD. Significant improvements in MOUD-K scores (t(65) = -7.0, p < 0.0001) and MOUD-A scores (t(69) = -5.8, p < 0.0001) were detected after participants viewed the video. The intervention yielded greater Delta MOUD-A scores among those identifying as non-Hispanic Black, compared to non-Hispanic Whites (beta = 2.6, CI = 0.4, 4.8).
   Conclusion: The educational video improved both knowledge and positive attitudes towards MOUD, with changes in MOUD attitudes being influenced by race. These findings may inform future MOUD educational programs, thereby helping to reduce opioid use disorder-related morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Background: Children's exposure to unhealthy food marketing influences their food knowledge, preferences and consumption. Sport sponsorship by food companies is widespread and industry investment in this marketing is increasing. This study aimed to assess children's awareness of sport sponsors and their brand-related attitudes and purchasing intentions in response to this marketing.
   Methods: Sports clubs known to have food sponsors and representing the most popular sports for Australian children across a range of demographic areas were recruited. Interview-based questionnaires were conducted at clubs with children aged 10-14 years (n = 103) to examine their recall of local sports club and elite sport sponsors, and their attitudes towards sponsors and sponsorship activities.
   Results: Most children (68%) could recall sponsors of their sports club, naming a median of two sponsors, including a median of one food company sponsor each. Almost half (47%) of children could recall any sponsors of their favourite elite sporting team. Children aged 10-11 years were more likely than older children to report that they thought about sponsors when buying something to eat or drink (P < 0.01); that they liked to return the favour to sponsors by buying their products (P < 0.01); and that sponsors were 'cool' (P = 0.02). Most children had received a voucher or certificate from a food or beverage company to reward sport performance (86% and 76%, respectively). Around one-third of children reported liking the company more after receiving these rewards.
   Conclusions: Children's high recall of food and beverage company sport sponsors and their positive attitudes towards these sponsors and their promotions is concerning as this is likely to be linked to children's food preferences and consumption. Limiting children's exposure to this marketing is an important initiative to improve children's nutrition.

TI  - Responding to Precarity: Beddawi Camp in the Era of Covid-19
T2  - JOURNAL OF PALESTINE STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - How are refugees responding to protect themselves and others in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic? How do these responses relate to diverse local, national, and international structures of inequality and marginalization? Drawing on the case of Beddawi camp in North Lebanon, I argue that local responses-such as sharing information via print and social media, raising funds for and preparing iftar baskets during Ramadan, and distributing food and sanitation products to help people practice social distancing-demonstrate how camp residents have worked individually and collectively to find ways to care for Palestinian, Syrian, Iraqi, Kurdish, and Lebanese residents alike, thereby transcending a focus on nationality-based identity markers. However, state, municipal, international, and media reports pointing to Syrian refugees as having imported the virus into Beddawi camp place such local modes of solidarity and mutuality at risk. This article thus highlights the importance of considering how refugee-refugee assistance initiatives relate simultaneously to: the politics of the self and the other, politically produced precarity, and multi-scalar systems that undermine the potential for solidarity in times of overlapping precarities.

AB  - Background In the past three decades, the role of pharmacists has evolved toward working with other health professionals and the public in a patient-centered model of practice, which is called pharmaceutical care. This model has been implemented for most physical illnesses but in relation to mental health, pharmacists' role is still evolving. Objective The objective of this study was to evaluate pharmacists' attitudes, current practice, perceived barriers and training needs concerning pharmaceutical care for people with depression. Setting All pharmacists attending obligatory regional meetings of the Surplus Network (a Flemish community pharmacy chain) during April and May 2009. Method Written survey consisting of questions on (1) pharmacists' attitude and current practice in depression care and pharmaceutical care for people with other illnesses; (2) potential barriers in providing pharmaceutical care for people with depression; and (3) training needs. Paired samples T tests and Wilcoxon-tests were used to analyze the data. Main outcome measure Attitude and current practice in depression care versus care for other illnesses. Results Although the results show no difference in the attitude of pharmacists toward providing care for people with depression versus other illnesses (p = 0.315), pharmacists report to provide significantly less care to people with depression compared to people with other illnesses (p < 0.05). Perceived barriers toward providing depression care were the lack of information about the person and their treatment, the fact that depression is a difficult condition, the lack of education in mental health and the lack of time and privacy in the pharmacy. These, and the reported training needs, may limit the self-efficacy of pharmacists and hence influence current practice. Conclusion In spite of pharmacists' positive attitude toward depression care, current practice displays actionable flaws. Barriers and training needs should be addressed in order to improve pharmaceutical care for people with depression.

AB  - Background: Bhutan lacks a medical school and all medical students are trained in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and India. When the COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of medical schools in these countries in March-April 2020, the medical students were repatriated to Bhutan. Upon return, they were kept in government-sponsored facility quarantine for 21 days. This study assessed their knowledge on COVID-19 as a part of self-learning and their attitude towards participation in government's health response to COVID-19.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among medical students who had returned to the country. The survey was conducted through an online questionnaire while the students were in facility quarantine. The sample size calculated was 129 and convenient sampling was used. Knowledge was assessed using 20 questions, each scored 1/20. Knowledge was considered "good" if the cumulative score was >= 80%, "satisfactory" if >= 60-79% and "poor" if <60%. Correlation between knowledge score and duration of clinical clerkship was tested using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Attitude of students towards their willingness to participate in the national COVID-19 response was tested using rating scales. Data were analysed using Stata 13.1.
   Results: 120 medical students responded to the survey (response rate = 93%). Eighty-eight (74%) had good knowledge, 28 (23%) had satisfactory knowledge and only four (3%) had poor knowledge on COVID-19. The students scored high on the symptomatology, mode of transmission, prevention and treatment options and on local epidemiology; and scored low on the forms of mechanical ventilation and on home-management of non-critical cases. The knowledge score correlated with the duration of clinical clerkship they had undertaken (r = 0.326, p = 0.001). The primary source of information were social media sites (102, 85%), television (94, 78%) and newspapers (76, 63%). The majority (78, 65%) were willing to participate in the government's COVID-19 response but could not identify what roles they could play. The fear of contracting COVID-19 was reported by eight students (7%).
   Conclusions: Medical students had good knowledge on COVID-19 and had self-learned through social media, television and newspapers. The students held positive attitude towards participation in the government's COVID-19 response.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to nationwide lockdowns and rigid measures of social distancing in Denmark. Such a situation provides the unique opportunity to study interruptions in training routines and scrutinise the significance of physical attendance, face-to-face interactions and collective engagement for sport and leisure-time physical activity. Drawing on Randall Collins' micro-sociological theory of 'Interaction Ritual Chains', this article focuses on CrossFit - an activity, which is not only known for members' high-intensity workouts but also for a tight-knit community. Specifically, we explored how CrossFitters in Denmark made sense of and experienced the changes of their leisure practices throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Semi-structured interviews with 20 CrossFitters recruited from different CrossFit boxes showed that not only activity levels but also emotional energy and group solidarity dropped considerably during COVID-19 as members lacked interactions within the CrossFit boxes which had been crucial for their participation before the pandemic. Notably, new training situations, specifically online workouts, could not replace the highly successful interaction rituals in the CrossFit box, which stresses the significance of face-to-face interactions for continuous leisure-time physical activity. In so doing, this article contributes to discussions about whether online workouts and digitally mediated communities can complement or replace physical training.

TI  - Improving sexual and reproductive health knowledge and practice in Mozambican families with media campaign and volunteer family health champions
T2  - FAMILY MEDICINE AND COMMUNITY HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Objective To increase knowledge, attitudes and practice of sexual and reproductive health and family planning and to reduce maternal and neonatal mortality rates in Mozambique.
   Design An implementation research project's intermediate evaluation, applying two cross-sectional surveys. The surveys were planned for 316 subjects before and after interventions.
   Setting Research performed in Natikiri district of Nampula province in northern Mozambique, targeting a suburban and rural populations in their homes.
   Participants 452 people were surveyed (91 before, 361 after), all belonging to the Macua ethnic group.
   Interventions A media campaign (2 weekly radio spots, bimonthly theatre performances) was performed for 8 months (2017 to 2018) and family health champions' teachings (monthly home visits) performed for 3 months, on sexual and reproductive health and family planning. Outcome measures planned and measured were adolescent's and adult's knowledge, attitudes and practice about those. Data were analysed by gender, age group and frequencies, using a CI of 95% (p<0.5 statistically significant).
   Results Radio spots, community theatre and volunteer champions increased population's knowledge about sexual and reproductive health and led to a more positive attitude toward family planning. Concerning attitude, results show differences between adults' proportions before and after: (1) did you hear about sexual and reproductive health (p=0.0425); (2) knows project key messages (p<0.001); (3) knows prenatal visits importance (p=0.0301); (4) access to contraceptives was easy (p<0.001). Adolescents showed statistically significant differences before and after: (1) knows project key messages (p<0.001); (2) access to contraceptives was easy (p=0.0361). Family planning practice did not increase in both groups.
   Conclusion A health education intervention, using a media campaign and local volunteers, is useful to promote mother and child health. There is an unmet need for family planning and the use of modern contraception is below desired practice, needing further research about cultural barriers. Communication for behaviour change activities will pursue and impact will be assessed to document family planning practice improvement.

AB  - Purpose The importance of psychological capital (PsyCap) and perceived organizational support (POS) have been identified over the years, however, the underlying relationship of both constructs with different employee outcomes is still a subject of research. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether POS helps in mediating the effect of PsyCap on employee engagement (EE). Design/methodology/approach In total, 420 samples (middle-level information technology (IT) professionals) were collected from different IT industry located in India by using online survey questionnaires. The collected data were further analyzed using regression analysis, factor analysis, structural equation modeling, reliability and validity analysis, mediation analysis and model fit indices analysis. Findings The results of the present study confirmed the full mediating effect of POS on the PsyCap-EE relationship and demonstrated that employees with a higher level of PsyCap, contribute more positively to the POS level which further enhances the employee's level of engagement at the workplace. Research limitations/implications The samples collected for the current study included only middle-level IT professionals of the IT industry in India; therefore, the present study results have limited general applicability. The results and findings of the current study are only on the basis of inferential statistical analysis, and descriptive analysis was not performed on the collected data. Further, the study does not investigate the influence of time. Practical implications This study would assist practitioners of human resources in organizational development by enhancing the employee's positive attitude and commitment toward their study. Further, EE can also be improved by enhancing the levels of POS and PsyCap of employees, which is in line with the findings of the current study. Originality/value The current study examines the mediating effect of POS on psychological capital and EE the relationship for the first time.

TI  - Mohamed Hassanein Heikal on the United States: The Critical Discourse of a Leading Arab Intellectual
T2  - MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The renowned Egyptian journalist and commentator Mohamed Hassanein Heikal (b. 1923) is arguably the doyen of Arab writers critical of the United States. Heikal's career as an author spans more than half a century and his access to regional and international audiences has been greatly enhanced in recent years by his regular appearances on the al-Jazeera television station. Drawing on Heikal's extensive published work, this paper offers a detailed treatment of his views on US politics, society and especially foreign policy in order to highlight the elements constituting the image of the United States that he projects. The article argues that Heikal''s critical representation of the United States has been central to the discourse of Arab nationalists since the late 1950s and their reconstruction of Arab nationalist ideology along anti-American lines. It further argues that Arab nationalists and Islamists subscribe to essentially the same critical reading of the United States and its foreign policy, especially towards the Middle East. Because intellectuals help shape public opinion, this convergence of views between nationalists and Islamists represents a principal source of the negative image of the United States among Arab publics. Understanding the discourse of Arab intellectuals is thus instrumental for comprehending Arab views of the United States. The Arab Spring, with its tribulations and promises of change, brings an urgent need to properly understand and contextualize the discourse of Arab intellectuals, both nationalists and Islamists.

AB  - BackgroundIn Palestine, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a rapidly growing health concern. This study evaluated knowledge, attitude, and practice of patients with T2DM with regard to their disease. The study also investigated association and correlation between knowledge, attitude, and practice with sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of the patients. Predictors of higher knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice were also identified.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in primary healthcare facilities frequently visited by patients with T2DM across the West Bank of Palestine in the period of October 2018 to January 2019. An interviewer administered questionnaire was used to determine knowledge, attitude and practice of patients with T2DM with regard to their disease.ResultsOut of 300 patients invited, 220 (73.3%) patients responded. In this study, the median age was 57.0years (51.0, 65.0), the median time elapsed since diagnosis with T2DM was 7.0years (4.0, 14.0), the median fasting blood glucose was 150.0mg/dL (128.8, 180.0), the median postprandial glucose was 230.0mg/dL (200.0, 270.0), the median HbA(1c) was 7.8% (7.0, 8.53), and the median BMI was 28.8kg/m(2) (25.5, 33.1). The median knowledge score was 6.0/13.0 (4.5/13.0, 7.5/13.0), the median attitude score was 3.0/4.0 (2.0/4.0, 4.0/4.0), and the median practice score was 3.0 (1.0/5.0, 4.0/5.0). Having university education was strongly associated with having higher knowledge scores (p-value=0.001). Additionally, having attended an educational program on diabetes was moderately associated with higher practice scores (p-value=0.026).ConclusionsFindings of this study highlighted the need for appropriately designed interventions to increase knowledge about T2DM among patients with low educational level. Well-designed educational programs might promote healthy practice among patients with T2DM. Future studies are still needed to assess if such interventions could be effective in improving health outcomes and quality of life of patients with T2DM in Palestine.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to identify the psychosocial factors involved in Italian parents' intentions not to vaccinate their children. For this purpose, we used an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, which included both proximal and distal factors influencing intention not to vaccinate children. Design Participants included 447 Italian parents, each completed an online questionnaire, which measured intention not to vaccinate children, attitude toward not vaccinating, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, anticipated regret, negative attitude toward vaccines, risk perception, trust in healthcare institutions, trust in science and religious morality. Results Results showed that attitude toward not vaccinating was strongly associated with intention not to vaccinate children. Furthermore, attitude toward not vaccinating was associated with negative attitude toward vaccines, which in turn was affected by all the distal factors considered (risk perception, trust in healthcare institutions, trust in science, religious morality). Finally, negative attitude toward vaccines fully mediated the effect of the distal factors on attitude toward not vaccinating children. Conclusion These findings provide support for the validity of the proposed extended TPB model in explaining parents' intention not to vaccinate children. Theoretical and practical implications, in terms of understanding and promoting vaccination behaviour, are discussed.

AB  - Hoarding disorder (HD) has been newly classified as a distinct mental disorder and is a considerable public health concern. Treatment ambivalence is a problem in this clinical population, and stigma of HD may be one potential factor contributing to an unwillingness to seek treatment. Stigma of HD is understudied, despite the media often perpetuating severe and negative representations of individuals with HD. This study is the first to investigate experimentally the impact of a popular reality television show on attitudes and beliefs about individuals with HD. Participants were assigned to one of three conditions that randomized them to watch television shows with either low, medium, or high clutter depictions. Participant attitudes were evaluated before and after viewing. Results showed that participants who viewed A&E's Hoarders had higher increases in indices of stigma, including social distance (d = 1.18), difference (d = 0.63), and social restrictiveness (d = 0.94) when compared to the control group. Overall, these findings suggest that these types of television portrayals might produce more stigmatizing attitudes.

AB  - Scientists designing network-based interventions intending to improve the adoption or maintenance ofhealthy behaviors are well-advised to classify potential adopters into network roles, such as opinion leaders, brokers, members, and isolates, and to work closely with existing opinion leaders. In past studies focusing on HIV, opinion-leader interventions have had mixed results. This may be addressed, in part, by empirically validating these network roles. To this end, we used latent class analysis to test whether people's social connections fall into mutually exclusive and exhaustive subgroups of social capital that represent theorized network roles well with a dataset collected in Nyangana, Namibia (n = 400). A four-class model best fits the dataset, but the categories identified do not clearly represent the theorized roles. Rather, this study revealed the following four network classes: single-group members (59%), connectors (24%), single-group loyalists (15%), and selective connectors (2%). The implications of their findings for opinion-leader interventions focused on HIV are discussed.

KW  - Spain
AB  - Since Ancient Greece satirists are feared figures in any group articulation. Often protected by anonymity, authors have defied political and social order with a harsh and unpleasant sense of humour, which pushes the limits of political correction. This form based in breaking news and everyday life has a particularly suitable space in new media. Twitter, by means of its promptness and need for concision, could be considered a perfect ground for this kind of humour. Provocation and censorship of political attitudes are the objectives of many twitter accounts whose followers echo by commenting and retweeting. Interactivity allows the production of a text without closure which interweaves a myriad of positions, different from the voice of the satirist. My case study is the Twitter account Masa Enfurecida, which targeted for five years the Spanish political and social everyday life by quoting and reversing public messages. With close to 124.000 followers, @ masaenfurecida, an anonymous account, impacts political debate and influences popular communication as some repeated expressions become part of the talk of the day. The tweets of Masa Enfurecida are brief pieces that can be considered a pure form of satire, which is transformed in the chains of answers and retweets of the followers.

AB  - Purpose To report the results of a nationwide online survey on artificial intelligence (AI) among radiologist members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM). Methods and materials All members were invited to the survey as an initiative by the Imaging Informatics Chapter of SIRM. The survey consisted of 13 questions about the participants' demographic information, perceived advantages and issues related to AI implementation in radiological practice, and their overall opinion about AI. Results In total, 1032 radiologists (equaling 9.5% of active SIRM members for the year 2019) joined the survey. Perceived AI advantages included a lower diagnostic error rate (750/1027, 73.0%) and optimization of radiologists' work (697/1027, 67.9%). The risk of a poorer professional reputation of radiologists compared with non-radiologists (617/1024, 60.3%), and increased costs and workload due to AI system maintenance and data analysis (399/1024, 39.0%) were seen as potential issues. Most radiologists stated that specific policies should regulate the use of AI (933/1032, 90.4%) and were not afraid of losing their job due to it (917/1032, 88.9%). Overall, 77.0% of respondents (794/1032) were favorable to the adoption of AI, whereas 18.0% (186/1032) were uncertain and 5.0% (52/1032) were unfavorable. Conclusions Radiologists had a mostly positive attitude toward the implementation of AI in their working practice. They were not concerned that AI will replace them, but rather that it might diminish their professional reputation.

AB  - Background: Marital satisfaction is one of the main factors affecting the quality of life in marital relationships. It refers to individuals' positive attitudes toward their marital relationship, and marital dissatisfaction is a negative and displeased attitude toward various aspects of marital relationship.
   Objectives: The present study aimed to explore the causal relationship between attachment styles and marital satisfaction regarding the mediating role of Gottman's marital communication model.
   Methods: The statistical population encompassed all university students in Ahvaz in the academic year 2019 - 2020. The multi-stage random sampling method was used, and 230 persons were selected as the study samples. Hudson's Index of Marital Satisfaction (IMS), Coolins and Reed's Revised Adult Attachment Scale (RAAS), and Gottman's Communication Skills Scale (FHS) were also used to collect the data. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software version 26 and AMOS software version 24.
   Results: The results indicated that the study model well-fitted the study population, and all direct paths were statistically significant. Moreover, there was a significant relationship between secure attachment, anxiety-insecure attachment, and avoidance-insecure attachment with marital satisfaction mediated by Gottman's communication skills (P <= 0.001).
   Conclusions: Given the effect of Gottman's couple attachment styles and four communication skills on marital satisfaction, their effectiveness in marital satisfaction is proved. Accordingly, therapists are recommended to implement educational and treatment programs containing cognitive and preventive attachment styles and Gottman's communication skills to promote couples' marital satisfaction.

AB  - Despite scientific consensus, consumers' misperceptions about the risks of genetically modified (GM) food influence product rejection and the persistence of negative attitudes. Building on the mental models approach for risk communication and the Elaboration Likelihood Model for attitude change, a two-wave repeated measures randomized controlled experiment on a representative sample of Swedish consumers was used to test the effectiveness of tailored (to consumers' mental models of GM food) and persuasive (strong vs. weak) communication for attitudes and product preferences change. In wave 1 (N = 3,243) and wave 2 (N = 1,554), we measured consumers' attitudes and elicited product preferences using a discrete choice experiment. We found a positive effect of communication on attitudes and product preferences in two out of the four treatment groups, one of which initially held a negative attitude and perceived GM food as very risky.

AB  - Background: The quality of communication and collaboration with colleagues, managers, and physicians affects the intention to leave a job and the profession for new graduate nurses (NGNs). New graduates have difficulties communicating and collaborating with physicians, especially.
   Aim: This study aimed to determine the relationship between the attitudes of nurse-physician collaboration and the levels of intention to leave the current job and professional commitment among NGNs.
   Methodology: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was carried out with 231 NGNs in four private hospitals affiliated with an university. Data were collected by using a self-administered questionnaire, including a personal information form, the Jefferson Scale of Attitudes towards Physician-Nurse Collaboration, Intention to Leave Scale, and Nursing Professional Commitment Scale. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients.
   Results: NGNs had a high positive attitude towards nurse-physician collaboration with a median score of 49 (45-54). The professional commitment of NGNs was high level with a median score of 75 (69-86). The intention to leave the current job median score was 3 (2.3-3.6) out of 5. There was a statistically significant correlation between attitudes towards nurse-physician collaboration and the levels of intention to leave the current job (r(s) = -0.22; p < 0.01) and professional commitment (r(s )= 0.42; p < 0.01).
   Conclusion: The results showed that improving NGNs' attitudes towards nurse-physician collaboration increases the professional commitment and reduces turnover intention.

AB  - Hazardous waste management (HWM) in chemical industrial parks is an important issue related to sustainable development. Previous researches concentrations on HWM have been transferred from technologies, economic, and ecological benefits to social relations because the coordination and cooperation among different stakeholders determine the efficiency of HWM. To analyze stakeholder coordination in HWM, this paper employed a mixed-method combined with stakeholder analysis(SA) and social network analysis(SNA), for analyzing interests, powers, attitudes, knowledge of different stakeholders, and the characteristics, power quantification of the stakeholders' coordination network, by chosen Shanghai Hangzhou bay economic and technical development park(SHDP) as a case study area. In hazardous waste management, governmental supervision has enough interest but less power and with the complete knowledge on, third-party supervision has a medium interest but less knowledge to support their supervision, firms have the lowest power but interest, waste treatment and disposal company have most power and interest but limited knowledge. NGOs, research institutes and media have interest and knowledge but less power. Most stakeholders have positive attitude. We also find that local supervisions play an important role in stakeholder coordination, and NGOs and research institutes have the most potential to push stakeholder coordination by improving information exchange. Therefore, policy recommendations are proposed, including the establishment of communication mechanisms, the adoption of hazardous treatment regulations and economic instruments, the application of a platform for information exchange, and the encouragement of stakeholders' engagement and public participation.

AB  - Introduction: This cross-sectional descriptive study aimed to use the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) model as a framework to assess compliance with preventive measures against COVID-19 among residents of the city of Riyadh.
   Methodology: In May 2020, electronic study questionnaires on Microsoft Forms were distributed to a sample of 886 Riyadh residents via social media and WhatsApp groups.
   Results: We found that the participants had good knowledge. However, less than half of the participants exhibited positive attitudes and good practices toward COVID-19. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between their practices, attitudes, and knowledge. The most practiced behaviours among the participants were (1) a commitment to home quarantine, (2) the use of a tissue or the inside of an elbow when coughing or sneezing, (3) hand washing for a minimum of 20 seconds, and (4) sterilization of surfaces/equipment and wearing masks in public places. Regression analysis showed that knowledge, attitudes, and age were the three factors that could predict the practices of preventive behaviours against COVID-19.
   Conclusions: A higher likelihood of practicing preventive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly associated with one's total knowledge and attitude scores. Future educational campaigns are recommended to focus on residents' susceptibility to COVID-19, its severity, mask wearing, and the disinfection of surfaces and appliances when targeting public audiences. In addition to raising awareness, public policies that support preventive practices would improve the likelihood of compliance.

AB  - Nearly three billion people worldwide burn solid fuels and kerosene in open fires and inefficient stoves to cook, light, and heat their homes. Cleaner-burning stoves reduce emissions and can have positive health, climate, and women's empowerment benefits. This article reports on the protocol and baseline data from the evaluation of four behavior change communication (BCC) campaigns carried out in lower to middle income countries aimed at promoting the sale and use of cleaner-burning stoves. Interventions implemented in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Nigeria are using a range of BCC methods including mass media, digital media, outdoor advertising, and inter-personal communication. The mixed methods evaluation comprises three large-scale surveys: one pre-BCC and two follow-ups, along with smaller scale assessments of stove uptake and patterns of use. Baseline results revealed varying levels of awareness of previous promotions and positive attitudes and beliefs about modern (i.e., relatively clean-burning) cookstoves. Differences in cookstove preferences and behaviors by gender, socio-demographics, media use, and country/region were observed that may affect outcomes. Across all three countries, cost (lack of funds) a key perceived barrier to buying a cleaner-burning stove. Future multivariate analyses will examine potential dose-response effects of BCC on cookstove uptake and patterns of use. BCC campaigns have the potential to promote modern cookstoves at scale. More research on campaign effectiveness is needed, and on how to optimize messages and channels. This evaluation builds on a limited evidence base in the field.

AB  - As policies are adjusted throughout the COVID-19 pandemic according to public health best practices, there is a need to balance the importance of social distancing in preventing viral spread with the strain that these governmental public safety mandates put on public mental health. Thus, there is need for continuous observation of public sentiment and deliberation to inform further adaptation of mandated interventions. In this study, we explore how public response may be reflected in Massachusetts (MA) via social media by specifically exploring temporal patterns in Twitter posts (tweets) regarding sentiment and discussion of topics. We employ interrupted time series centered on (1) Massachusetts State of Emergency declaration (March 10), (2) US State of Emergency declaration (March 13) and (3) Massachusetts public school closure (March 17) to explore changes in tweet sentiment polarity (net negative/positive), expressed anxiety and discussion on risk and health topics on a random subset of all tweets coded within Massachusetts and published from January 1 to May 15, 2020 (n = 2.8 million). We find significant differences between tweets published before and after mandate enforcement for Massachusetts State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, decreased polarity and increased anxiety expression), US State of Emergency (increased discussion of risk and health, and increased anxiety expression) and Massachusetts public school closure (increased discussion of risk and decreased polarity). Our work further validates that Twitter data is a reasonable way to monitor public sentiment and discourse within a crisis, especially in conjunction with other observation data.

AB  - While previous research has generally found that religiosity is associated with negative attitudes toward sexually explicit material (SEM) and a lower frequency of SEM use, no studies have examined the relationship between SEM type and religiosity. In addition, it is unknown how the interrelations between religiosity and type and frequency of SEM use influence the relationship between SEM use and sexual satisfaction. Here, associations among a multi-item religiosity scale (consisting of measures of self-reported faith in God, religious services attendance, and the religiosity of the respondent's social network), SEM use, type of preferred SEM, and sexual satisfaction were explored using a large online sample of Croatian adults (N=2,580). In both men and women, religiosity was associated with less frequent SEM use and more SEM-negative attitudes. Guilty feelings following SEM use and SEM-negative attitudes fully mediated the association between religiosity and SEM use among women and partially mediated the relationship for men. Religiosity was also negatively correlated with women's nonmainstream SEM use. For women, religiosity significantly moderated the association between SEM use and sexual satisfaction, as well as the relationship between nonmainstream SEM use and sexual satisfaction. In line with the erotic plasticity theory, the findings suggest that religiosity affects SEM use and related sexual satisfaction more substantially among women than men.

AB  - In light of the global crisis created by the outbreak of the coronavirus and the disease it causes, coronavirus disease 2019, the goal of the study was to detect factors that might enhance people's ability to experience positive psychological change during traumatic events. As such, this study examined the relationship between social participation and posttraumatic growth (PTG) during the coronavirus outbreak and tested the mediating role of hope, social support, and cognitive reappraisal in explaining this relationship. The sample consisted of 275 participants (21.8% male, and 78.2% female, with an average age of 33.42, SD = 13.63), subjected to social-distancing regulations during this period. Results demonstrated a serial mediation model in which social participation predicted PTG directly and indirectly through hope (pathways and agency), social support, and cognitive reappraisal. The importance of social participation in nourishing personal resources and practical implications including the need for prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - Two approaches that may be particularly well suited for mass media (large scale) stigma interventions are video-recorded social contact and simulations, but research is rather limited. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two potential mass media interventions on different facets of stigma. Participants (N = 244) completed stigma measures prior to, immediately following, and 1 week following the random assignment of: (1) video-recorded social contact, (2) an audio/visual simulation, or (3) no intervention. The video-recorded social contact led to decreases on preference for social distance and negative emotions across 1 week, but only a temporary decrease on perceptions of dangerousness. In contrast, no significant changes in stigma were noted following the simulation. In sum, video-recorded social contact appears promising and offers many advantages for mass media implementation including low cost, minimal resources, and ease of dissemination. In contrast, further evaluation of audio/visual simulations is warranted before implementation.

Structural equation modeling (SEM) is therefore utilized to analyze these constructs. The study results show that the pathway coefficient for the parameters, such as health awareness, naturalism, mediation, personal development, sustainability, sociability, empathy, and cooperation, illustrates that the parameters directly impact pandemic control and management. At the same time, the lockdown and social distance rules attain dire consequences on the "conventional" retail property sector. It might speed up the evolution procedure of different conduits retail plus the channel coupling performance of physical stores and, hence, cause changes in urban areas-retail sector. The pandemic isn't necessarily leading to the shutdown of retail stores. Nonetheless, it might have a meaningful effect on the retail estate enterprise business. The results show a requirement for the rapid physical shop repositioning performance of different channels firms. The study presents a meaningful understanding and demonstrates many consequences for the retailers, Landlords, and equally policy crafting components tackling urban regeneration plus local economic advancement within the post-covid phase.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a suspected surge of ageism in America and has imposed critical health and safety behavior modifications for people of all ages (Ayalon et al., 2020; Lichtenstein, 2020). Given that older adults are a high-risk group, maintaining their safety has been paramount in implementing preventive measures (i.e., more handwashing, social distancing); however, making such behavior modifications might be contingent on how one views older adults (i.e., ageist stereotypes). Therefore, the goal of the current pre-registered study was to explore if hostile and benevolent ageism relate to pandemic-related fear and behavior change. An online survey assessing responses to the pandemic was taken by 164 younger and 171 older adults. Higher hostile ageism predicted lower pandemic-related behavior modification. Those high in benevolent ageism reported lower behavior change, but also reported higher pandemic-related fear; however, when pandemic-related fear was considered a mediator between the two, the directionality between benevolent ageism and behavior change switched, indicating a suppression effect. These findings highlight that ageist attitudes do predict responses to the pandemic and that hostile and benevolent ageism are distinct facets that have unique implications during a health pandemic.

AB  - We advocate the widespread use of UV-C light as a short-term, easily deployable, and affordable way to limit virus spread in the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Radical social distancing with the associated shutdown of schools, restaurants, sport clubs, workplaces, and traveling has been shown to be effective in reducing virus spread, but its economic and social costs are unsustainable in the medium term. Simple measures like frequent handwashing, facial masks, and other physical barriers are being commonly adopted to prevent virus transmission. However, their efficacy may be limited, particularly in shared indoor spaces, where, in addition to airborne transmission, elements with small surface areas such as elevator buttons, door handles, and handrails are frequently used and can also mediate transmission. We argue that additional measures are necessary to reduce virus transmission when people resume attending schools and jobs that require proximity or some degree of physical contact. Among the available alternatives, UV-C light satisfies the requirements of rapid, widespread, and economically viable deployment. Its implementation is only limited by current production capacities, an increase of which requires swift intervention by industry and authorities.

AB  - This research examines the impact of short-term study abroad on a travel-specific psychographic manifestation of intercultural competence, Plog's concept of venturesomeness. It also assesses the moderating effect of cultural distance on students' development of venturesomeness. Using a pre-post longitudinal design, research found that the intercultural and personal development benefits acquired during study abroad had a significant mediating effect on student venturesomeness; i.e., students became more likely to pursue travel that facilitates immersion in and reflection on the host culture's way of life. Consistent with social distance and expectancy value theory, this effect was found for students who traveled to culturally proximate countries and not for those who traveled to countries with a higher cultural distance from the U.S. Given that this was the first study abroad experience for a majority of the sample, we suggest the need for a phase-based program of study abroad experientiation to optimize study abroad effects and facilitate more holistic student development. The intricacies of study abroad as a specific form of facilitated travel have certain implications for study abroad program administrators and the travel and tourism industry.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) concerning malaria and malaria prevention among rural populations residing in the southwestern region of Saudi Arabia. This was a household-based cross-sectional survey, using structured questionnaire that was developed and distributed among households selected randomly from 19 villages (clusters) located in a southwwestern region of Saudi Arabia, north of the border with Yemen. The data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 20. A majority of respondents (98.4%) reported that they had heard about malaria, but only 21.7% reported that they had sufficient information about the disease. Surprisingly, the most popular source of information was the internet and social media (proportion responding positively in parenthesis) (25.5%), followed by family (21.7%), while information from health facilities contributed only 12.4%. A majority of respondents were aware that malaria is a communicable (89.1%) and deadly (70%) disease; however, only 30.2% of the respondents responded that malaria is a treatable disease. Almost all of the aware respondents (97.5%) were inclined to seek treatment from health facilities, and 63.2% preferred to seek treatment within 24 h of presenting with symptoms. Regarding personal precautions, the most common practice adopted by respondents was indoor residual spraying IRS (47.3%), followed by anti-mosquito spraying (29.8%), mosquito bed nets (13.2%) and combined anti-mosquito sprays and nets on windows( 4.7%). This KAP study did not show any statistically significant differences in KAP due to age; however the practices of preventive measures against malaria differed significantly by nationality (Saudi versus non-Saudi). We conclude that most populations living in the villages have an acceptable level of knowledge and awareness about malaria and seek timely treatment. However, the positive attitudes and practices in relation to personal protection and prevention measures against malaria require marked improvement. The obvious gap between the knowledge and practice related to malaria prevention requires innovative strategies based on local evidence that well suits the local circumstances to promote and encourage the adoption and practice of personal protective measures.

AB  - Conservation Agriculture (CA) has been widely promoted as an agro-ecological approach to sustainable production intensification. Despite numerous initiatives promoting CA across Sub-Saharan Africa there have been low rates of adoption. Furthermore, there has been strong debate concerning the ability of CA to provide benefits to smallholder farmers regarding yield, labour, soil quality and weeding, particularly where farmers are unable to access external inputs such as herbicides. This research finds evidence that CA, using no external inputs, is most attractive among the very poor and that farmers are driven primarily by strong motivational factors in the key areas of current contention, namely yield, labour, soil quality and weeding time benefits. This study is the first to incorporate a quantitative socio-psychological model to understand factors driving adoption of CA. Using the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), it explores farmers' intention to use CA (within the next 12 months) in Cabo Delgado, Mozambique where CA has been promoted for almost a decade. The study site provides a rich population from which to examine farmers' decision making in using CA. Regression estimates show that the TPB provides a valid model of explaining farmers' intention to use CA accounting for 80% of the variation in intention. Farmers' attitude is found to be the strongest predictor of intention. This is mediated through key cognitive drivers present that influence farmers' attitude such as increased yields, reduction in labour, improvement in soil quality and, reduction in weeds. Subjective norm (i.e. social pressure from referents) and perceived behavioural control also significantly influenced farmers' intention. Furthermore, path analysis identifies farmers that are members of a Farmer Field School or participants of other organisations (e.g. savings group, seed multiplication group or a specific crop/livestock association) have a significantly stronger positive attitude towards CA with the poorest the most likely users and the cohort that find it the easiest to use. This study provides improved understanding relevant to many developing countries, of smallholder farmers' adoption dynamics related-to CA, and of how farmers may approach this and other 'new' management systems.

AB  - Purpose Sponsored social media content is one of the advertising strategies that companies implement so that ads appear as native to the delivery platform without making consumers feel that they are directly targeted. Hence, the current study examines whether prominently featuring corporate information on social media ads affects how consumers perceive them. It also investigates whether an ad's evaluation metrics on Twitter (e.g. number of likes/comments) influence its persuasiveness and consumers' behavioral intentions towards the sponsoring company. Underlying cognitive and affective mechanisms through which sponsored content operates are also investigated. Design/methodology/approach A 2 (corporate credibility: low vs high) by 2 (bandwagon cues: low vs high) between-subjects experiment was conducted. Findings The findings showed that corporate credibility and bandwagon cues can influence social media ad effectiveness. Sponsored content from high-credibility companies - evoked more favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions - is perceived as less intrusive, and elicits less anger than equivalent posts from low-credibility companies. Furthermore, it was found that bandwagon cues work via different pathways. For high-credibility corporations, a high number of bandwagon cues improved ad persuasiveness by mitigating consumers' anger towards intrusive sponsored content. Conversely, for low-credibility corporations high bandwagon cues enhanced ad persuasiveness, and this triggered more positive attitudes towards it. Originality/value This paper is the first to test corporate credibility and bandwagon effects in social media ads, while also exploring consumers' cognitive and affective responses to sponsored content. Implications for how companies with varying popularity levels should promote products on social media are discussed.

AB  - ObjectivesThe objective of the current study is to examine the determinants of wage floors set by state governments in the United States, with a particular focus on the effects of income inequality and ethnic diversity.
   MethodWe estimate the effects of income inequality, ethnic diversity, and their interaction on real state minimum wages using a state-level panel of Census demographic data from 1981 to 2010. We also control for state-level demographics and additional state-level information, such as measures of voter and government liberalism, along with time and state fixed effects.
   ResultsWe find that the impact of income inequality is mediated by ethnic diversity. When states are highly ethnically homogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with higher state minimum wages. When states are highly ethnically heterogeneous, increases in income inequality are associated with lower state minimum wages. The impact of income inequality lacks statistical significance when levels of ethnic diversity are either average or somewhat below average.
   ConclusionsOverall, our results suggest that the negative impact on state minimum wages in heterogeneous states could stem from rising income inequality, which increases the social distance between whites and other ethnic groups and weakens mass support for wage policies that are believed by the public to be beneficial to the poor.

AB  - Background:
   Cross infection control, to reduce the incidence of disease transmission between patients and dental team personnel, is an integral part of good clinical practice.
   Objective:
   To assess knowledge, attitude and practice of cross infection control among dental, dental hygiene, and dental technology students.
   Methods:
   Data were collected by a self-administrated questionnaire assessing knowledge, attitude, and practice of infection control measures. The questionnaire was published electronically to final year dental, dental hygiene, and dental technology students through student's official social media groups .
   Results:
   Statistically significant difference was found in relation to students' specialization (p-value <= 0.05). None of the dental hygienist students had a negative attitude about infection control, while most of participants with a negative attitude were dental technology students (84.6%). No statistically significant difference (p>0.05) was found between groups in regard to cross-infection knowledge, where the level of knowledge ranged from moderate to good.
   Conclusion:
   Good knowledge, attitude, and practice were reported for dental and dental hygiene students, while good knowledge with a negative attitude was found amongst dental technology students. Specialty affected the practice of infection control measures, yet gender was not a significant variable. Improvement of the university curriculum, particularly for dental technology students, to increase awareness and knowledge of cross infection control is highly recommended.

AB  - Objectives This study aimed at examining the extent of turnover intention among the Chinese resident physicians who entered the newly established national standardised residency training programme (SRTP), and exploring factors associated with their turnover intention. Design Cross-sectional survey. Setting Ten institutions from five geographical areas in China. Methods 1414 residents were surveyed using paper-based questionnaires and scales regarding their demographics, work situation, attitudes towards SRTP, job satisfaction, psychological resilience, burnout and turnover intention in 2017. The turnover intention was described and compared between categorical groups. Linear regressions were used to select the factors associated with turnover intention. The structural equation model was used to capture the potential mediating effects. Results The mean turnover intention score was 12.45 (SD=4.47). Nearly half (47.87%) of the residents had a high and very high level of turnover intention. Psychological resilience (beta=0.066), burnout (beta=0.141) and job satisfaction (beta=0.022) were positively associated with turnover intention, while specialty (beta=-0.135), year of training (beta=-0.687), career in medicine (beta=-2.191), necessity of training (beta=-0.695) and satisfaction with income (beta=-1.215) had negative associations with turnover intention. Working hours and nightshift interval indirectly were associated with turnover intention through the mediating effects of burnout. Career in medicine, necessity of training, satisfaction with income, and psychological resilience showed direct effects and indirect effects on turnover intention through burnout and job satisfaction as mediators. Conclusions The turnover intention among Chinese residents was prevalent and unignorable. Burnout was the major contributing factor, while year of training and positive attitudes towards training were protective factors. Burnout and job satisfaction also served as mediators. Interventions targeting these factors should be incorporated in the training programmes to keep a prosperous physician workforce.

AB  - Purpose The authors investigated the role of cultural (i.e. traditional and religious) values in predicting the relationships between the attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and the purchase intention for sustainable apparel. Design/methodology/approach An online survey was conducted in Amazon Mechanical Turk with the millennials of the US (n = 317). The data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings The connection with indigenous cultural values in terms of the (1) traditional values positively influenced attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion; (2) religious values positively influenced attitude toward slow fashion but did not influence attitude toward the environment. (3) Both attitudes towards environment and slow fashion positively influenced purchase intention for sustainable apparel. (4) The connection with cultural values did not influence purchase intention toward sustainable apparel directly; however, (5) attitude toward slow fashion mediated the relationship between connection with cultural values and purchase intention for sustainable apparel both in terms of traditional and religious values, and (6) attitude toward the environment mediated the relationship between connection with traditional values and purchase intention for sustainable apparel. Practical implications Instead of focusing only on pro-environmental messages, marketers should use culture-specific cues to evoke favorable attitudinal and behavioral responses toward sustainable apparel. Social implications Advertisement cues of sustainable apparel imbuing the target market's cultural values could help in protecting culturally significant elements of nature in the long-term by evoking positive attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and encouraging purchase intention for sustainable apparel in the short-term. Originality/value The authors indicated the importance of indigenous cultural values in shaping favorable attitudes toward the environment and slow fashion and purchase intention for sustainable apparel.

AB  - Purpose: Patients with depression are in high need of optimal pharmaceutical care as they have poor quality of life and functioning. However, little is known about the delivery of pharmaceutical care to patients with depression in Egypt. This study aimed to detect pharmacists' stigma of patients with depression, assess attitudes toward providing depression care, evaluate pharmacists' confidence with depression medication consultation, and identify barriers in providing pharmaceutical care to patients with depression.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was posted on the social media websites of Egyptian pharmacists' groups and associations. The survey collected pharmacists' demographic information, then measured their confidence in medication consultation through the Pharmacists' Confidence scale about Medication Consultation for Depressive Patients (PCMCD), with items to assess stigma of patients with depression and attitudes toward providing care to patients with depression compared with other physical conditions. The pharmacists were also asked about the barriers to providing pharmaceutical care to patients with depression.
   Results: Totally, 86 pharmacists completed the survey: 56 (65.1%) were aged 30 years or older, and 64 (74.6%) had more than five years of experience. The stigma of patients with depression was generally low. The mean (SD) PCMCD score was 51.4 (6.6), reflecting that most pharmacists were confident about medication consultation for patients with depression. Attitudes toward providing pharmaceutical care to patients with depression were generally positive but significantly lower than those reported for patients with other conditions. Lack of education on mental health was the most commonly reported barrier (81.2%) to providing pharmaceutical care to patients with depression.
   Conclusion: Participants were confident about medication consultation with a positive attitude toward providing pharmaceutical care. Frequent mental health educational courses, tools, and other methods of consistent engagement that enhance practice, behaviors, and outcomes should be considered for Egyptian pharmacists to improve pharmaceutical care provided to patients with depression.

AB  - Background: Balanced and sufficient maternal nutritional intake ensures not only the wellbeing of pregnant mother, fetus, and newborn (protection of life) but also her future health and her three generations (protection of progeny). Nutritional inadequacies during pregnancy have been reported and several factors were attributed. The objectives were to measure nutritional knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) during pregnancy and the relationship with socio-demographic characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 320 antenatal and postnatal mothers in Hospital Tengku Ampuan Afzan (HTAA), Pahang, Malaysia from 18th July to 27th August 2016. A pre-tested self-constructed, interview-guided questionnaire was used. Independent variables were age, ethnicity, educational level, marital status, and monthly household income. Outcomes were nutritional KAP-level with median used for the categorization. The relationship between independent variables and outcomes was obtained by logistic regression with significance at p<0.05. Results: Sixty-five percent aged from 25 to 34, 84% Malays, 37% completed secondary education with SPM/O-level, 96% married, 48% from middle-income family, 52% had a good nutritional knowledge, 67% with a positive attitude and 55% with good practice. Age and educational level were significantly related to knowledge. The only educational level was significantly related to practice. Less than 70% of respondents have good nutritional KAP, reflected by educational level with more than half of them received up to secondary education. Hence, the rights of mothers in getting a necessary and adequate education should be fulfilled. Conclusion: Results emphasize the importance of empowering girls and women with adequate educations and to strengthen the nutritional and health education of our educational system. It is for them to be knowledgeable with good attitude and practicing healthy nutritional lifestyle as they entering reproductive life, maintaining and transferring at least optimum healthy life to their progenies.

AB  - Sanfu acupoint herbal patching (SAHP) is a unique traditional Chinese medicine therapy, which has become popular for preventing acute attack of respiratory diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, in many regions of mainland China. However, the knowledge about its users is lacking, especially the characteristics of the users and their experience and perspectives.
   To investigate the demographics of users, conditions for its use and the previous experience of SAHP, as well as users' perspectives to provide baseline information for its practice.
   A cross-sectional consecutive-sample survey was conducted at outpatient departments from 3 traditional Chinese medicine hospitals in northern China. Each participant completed a questionnaire, after informed consent. Data description and analyses were done using SPSS 20.0.
   Among 949 SAHP users from 3 hospitals, female was predominant (n = 592; 62.4%), aged from 2 to 96 years (median = 52 years). 64.7% (380/587) of regular users have applied consecutively for 3 years or over, and the self-perceived satisfaction rates of respiratory diseases were from 45.9% to 77.7%. Positive attitude toward traditional Chinese medicine was the top reason for choosing SAHP. 42.4% of users held a motivation of being cured by SAHP and with great outcome expectancy on SAHP (70.8%).
   SAHP users were mainly female adults or elderly population; more than half were regular users, who predominantly used SAHP for various chronic respiratory diseases during their stable stage. The majority of users expressed satisfaction to previous SAHP for their respiratory diseases. 42.4% of users held a motivation of being cured by SAHP and with great outcome expectancy on SAHP (70.8%). The findings from this survey deserve further clinical trials for their clinical effectiveness.

AB  - Objectives Current literature emphasises that clinical leaders are in a position to enable a culture of safety, and that the safety culture is a performance mediator with the potential to influence patient outcomes. This paper aims to investigate staff's perceptions of patient safety culture in a Danish psychiatric department before and after a leadership intervention.
   Methods A repeated cross-sectional experimental study by design was applied. In 2 surveys, healthcare staff were asked about their perceptions of the patient safety culture using the 7 patient safety culture dimensions in the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire. To broaden knowledge and strengthen leadership skills, a multicomponent programme consisting of academic input, exercises, reflections and discussions, networking, and action learning was implemented among the clinical area level leaders.
   Results In total, 358 and 325 staff members participated before and after the intervention, respectively. 19 of the staff members were clinical area level leaders. In both surveys, the response rate was >75%. The proportion of frontline staff with positive attitudes improved by 5% for 5 of the 7 patient safety culture dimensions over time. 6 patient safety culture dimensions became more positive (increase in mean) (p<0.05). Frontline staff became more positive on all dimensions except stress recognition (p<0.05). For the leaders, the opposite was the case (p<0.05). Staff leaving the department after the first measurement had rated job satisfaction lower than the staff staying on (p<0.05).
   Conclusions The improvements documented in the patient safety culture are remarkable, and imply that strengthening the leadership can act as a significant catalyst for patient safety culture improvement. Further studies using a longitudinal study design are recommended to investigate the mechanism behind leadership's influence on patient safety culture, sustainability of improvements over time, and the association of change in the patient safety culture measures with change in psychiatric patient safety outcomes.

AB  - From time immemorial, transhumant livestock farmers have continued to work in the countryside, living an intense and symbolic form of social distancing. Their work consists of moving around with their herd or flock, mainly sheep, so they can provide their animals with the best pastures. This research study, using ethnographic techniques, located and interviewed a group of livestock farmers to understand how the use of smartphones has changed their professional and social habits. Even now in modern times, this group still lives in isolation, working alone in the mountains. However, they have also been undergoing profound change due to the development of virtual social networks and information channels, mainly through groups in online applications. This enables them to keep fully up to date with all the topics they are interested in. This new connectivity has allowed them to make better-informed financial decisions based on more and better information. It has also meant they can produce proposals for joint action when faced with problems that affect them as a group. Lastly, the widespread use of mobile phones has increased their ability to communicate with friends and family, breaking previously held social taboos and barriers.

AB  - Many changes were thrust upon families by the COVID-19 pandemic, including mandated quarantines, social distancing, transitions to distance learning for children, and remote work. The current study used mixed methods to examine the challenges and resilience of families in the United States during the pandemic (May-July 2020), as well as predictors and moderators of parent/child psychological distress. Our sample included 469 parents (459 mothers) of children aged similar to 2-13 years (239 girls, 228 boys, one nonbinary child, one "prefer not to answer" selection), who completed an online survey with closed-ended and open-ended portions. The sample had middle-to-high socioeconomic status and 86% of families were White/non-Hispanic. Qualitative (content and thematic analyses) and quantitative (descriptive statistics and regressions) findings revealed that, even in this relatively privileged sample, parents and families were experiencing struggles in many life domains (e.g., family, school) and shifts in family dynamics and routines, which were related to emotional and mental health. Families experienced many changes in their lives, some positive and some negative, and often exhibited resilience through managing these changes. Our moderation analyses indicated that COVID-19's daily impact was significantly associated with psychological distress for children and parents, and this association was stronger for older versus younger children. Less active/instructive parental media mediation was also related to less child psychological distress. Moving forward, practitioners can focus on preventive efforts including psychoeducation regarding healthy outlets for negative emotions during COVID-19, and practical help troubleshooting childcare and health care challenges impacting many families.

AB  - OBJECTIVE
   This study evaluated the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of day-and-night hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery in adolescents with type 1 diabetes under free-living conditions.
   RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
   In an open-label randomized crossover study, 12 suboptimally controlled adolescents on insulin pump therapy (mean +/- SD age 14.6 +/- 3.1 years; HbA(1c) 69 8 mmol/mol [8.5 +/- 0.7%]; duration of diabetes 7.8 +/- 3.5 years) underwent two 21-day periods in which hybrid closed-loop insulin delivery was compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy in random order. During the closed-loop intervention, a model predictive algorithm automatically directed insulin delivery between meals and overnight. Participants used a bolus calculator to administer prandial boluses.
   RESULTS
   The proportion of time that sensor glucose was in the target range (3.9-10 mmol/L; primary end point) was increased during the closed-loop intervention compared with sensor-augmented insulin pump therapy by 18.8 +/- 9.8 percentage points (mean +/- SD; P < 0.001), the mean sensor glucose level was reduced by 1.8 +/- 1.3 mmol/L (P = 0.001), and the time spent above target was reduced by 19.3 +/- 11.3 percentage points (P < 0.001). The time spent with sensor glucose levels below 3.9 mmol/L was low and comparable between interventions (median difference 0.4 [interquartile range 2.2 to 1.3] percentage points; P = 0.33). Improved glucose control during closed-loop was associated with increased variability of basal insulin delivery (P <0.001) and an increase in the total daily insulin dose (53.5 [39.5-72.1] vs. 51.5 [37.6-64.3] units/day; P = 0.006). Participants expressed positive attitudes and experience with the closed-loop system.
   CONCLUSIONS
   Free-living home use of day-and-night closed-loop in suboptimally controlled adolescents with type 1 diabetes is safe, feasible, and improves glucose control without increasing the risk of hypoglycemia. Larger and longer studies are warranted.

KW  - QUESTIONNAIRE
KW  - CONSEQUENCES
AB  - Background
   Mental illness is stigmatized in most of the communities and people with such illness are often subjected to defame. Stigma impairs an individual's and their caregiver's physical, social and emotional wellbeing, and health-seeking behavior. Sufficient literature on how often the caregivers of people with mental illness from low and middle-income countries are stigmatized and how they perceive people with mental illness is unavailable. In this study, we examined caregivers' attitude towards people with mental illness and perceived stigma.
   Methods
   We conducted face-to-face interviews with 170 caregivers in an outpatient clinic of a hospital in Nepal using a structured questionnaire. We calculated median and inter-quartile range of the attitude and perceived stigma scores. To assess the correlates, Kruskal Wallis H test and Mann Whitney U test were carried out.
   Results
   Overall median score for the domains: attitude (score range: 18-90) and perceived stigma (score range: 12-60) were 42 and 28 respectively, inter-quartile range being 8 each. Attitude score differed significantly by the sex of caregiver (p < 0.05), educational status of caregiver (p < 0.001), sex of patient (p < 0.05) and type of mental illness (p < 0.05). Perceived stigma score varied significantly by caregiver's sex (p < 0.05), marital status (p < 0.001), educational status (p < 0.001), occupation (p < 0.05), relation with the patient (p < 0.005) and use of alternative treatment modalities (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion
   Sex of participant, educational status, sex of patient and type of mental illness were the correlates of attitude towards mental illness. Similarly, sex of participant, marital status, educational status, occupation, caregiver's relation with patient and use of alternative treatment modalities were correlates of perceived stigma. Findings of this study suggest that interventions targeting these high-risk populations might be beneficial to help build a positive attitude and overcome the perceived social stigma.

AB  - Background: Vaccines are among the most effective and cost-efficient public health interventions for promoting child health. However, uptake is considerably affected by vaccine hesitancy. An example is Malawi, with a decline in second vaccine doses and the highest cervical cancer incidence and mortality rate in Sub-Saharan Africa. Understanding vaccine hesitancy is especially important when new vaccines are introduced. This study explores factors contributing to vaccine hesitancy for routine childhood immunization and the human papillomavirus vaccine in Malawi. Methods: The study used a cross-sectional survey design targeting caregivers of children under five years old and adolescent girls. The sample population was derived using three inclusion criteria: one district with low vaccine uptake (Dowa), one district with high vaccine uptake (Salima), and one district where human papillomavirus vaccine was piloted earlier (Zomba). A convenience sample of one primary and one secondary health facility was selected within each district, and participants were systematically included (n = 600). The measures were based on 5C scale for measuring vaccine hesitancy. Multiple regression analyses were performed to explore vaccination intention predictors. Results: Confidence in vaccine safety was the strongest predictor of routine childhood immunization, followed by constraints due to everyday stress. Caregivers had lower confidence in vaccine safety and efficacy when they believed rumors and misinformation and were unemployed. Confidence was higher for those who had more trust in healthcare workers. Age, gender, religion, education, employment, belief in rumors, and trust in healthcare workers were considered predictors of vaccination intention. A husband's positive attitude (approval) increased childhood vaccination intention. For human papillomavirus, vaccination intentions were higher for those with lower education, more trust in healthcare workers, lower complacency, and a lower tendency toward calculating the benefits and risks of vaccination. Knowledge of human papillomavirus did not increase vaccination intention, but the need to attain a husband's approval did. Being a young adult and unemployed increased belief in rumors, while trust in healthcare workers reduced the belief. Conclusions: This study provides good insights into the drivers of vaccine hesitancy across different contexts in Malawi. However, further studies are necessary to understand low risk perception among elderly people and the declining trend in second vaccine doses.

We hypothesized that locus of control would serve as a mediator for victim precipitation rape myths, and negative attitudes toward women would serve as a mediator for victim masochism and victim fabrication rape myths. Using a sample of 100 male college students, the results indicated that negative attitudes toward women mediated the relationship between traditional masculine ideologies and all 3 types of rape myths, but locus of control did not serve as a mediator for any. Implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - Many military veterans face considerable challenges reintegrating into civilian life. Evidence suggests the general public holds conflicting attitudes toward veterans. This study examines how perceived public attitudes play a role in veterans' mental health and well-being. Drawing from and extending interactionist theories of self-concept, stigma, and mental health recovery, we develop and estimate models for the relationships between internalized public attitudes toward veterans (perceived public regard), military identity-related self-worth (private regard), and well-being (depression, self-efficacy, and life satisfaction). Using survey data from the Chicagoland Veterans Study, we found that perceived public regard is negatively related to depression and positively related to self-efficacy and life satisfaction. The relationship between public regard and self-efficacy is fully mediated by private regard, and a significant part of the relationship between perceived public regard and both depression and life satisfaction is mediated by private regard. The study suggests avenues for extending theory and research related to military identity and public understanding of veterans as well as other groups where there may be conflicting public sentiment toward them.

AB  - Right-wing populist parties portray immigrants as economic or symbolic threats in their political advertisements by constructing a moral divide between the good ordinary people and bad immigrants. Yet, it remains unclear how these different threat appeals contribute to the formation of anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens and what role visual elements play in producing these effects. A survey-experiment with a quota sample of 471 participants reveals that, overall, symbolic threat appeals exert stronger effects on anti-immigrant attitudes than economic ones. When presented via text alone, only symbolicnot economicthreat appeals increased anti-immigrant attitudes via the activation of heuristic processing such as the reliance on negative stereotypes or feelings of anxiety, in particular among lower-educated citizens. When visuals were present, both types of threat appeals enhanced anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens across all education levels based on heuristic processing. Additionally, high image-text congruency induced cognitive argument approval resulting in higher anti-immigrant attitudes.

AB  - This study examined the predictive role of attention deficit disorders (ADHD) on the experience of loneliness among college students during the move to distance learning and social distancing policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study examined a serial multiple mediation of students' experiences with distance learning, perceived social support, and hope. We hypothesised that students with ADHD would experience social distress in addition to struggling with distance learning. However, we expect that social support and hope may mediate their loneliness. The sample consisted of 648 students (Mean age 27.99, SD - 7.08), in a medium size college in the centre of Israel. Participants were divided into two groups: 529 typical students and 119 students with ADHD. Loneliness, negative experiences during the use of distance learning, perceptions of social support, and hope were examined. Students with ADHD reported higher levels of loneliness and more negative experiences with distance learning than their peers. Results demonstrated that ADHD and negative experiences with distance learning predicted higher levels of loneliness, while college support and peer support in addition to hopeful thinking mediated these relations. The discussion focuses on the theoretical and practical aspects of loneliness and support while emphasising the therapeutic implications of hope.

AB  - Background As more young patients with breast cancer undergo treatments and obtain good prognoses, the issue of postoperative reproduction in breast cancer patients has attracted more attention. Methods We conducted a prospective, cross-sectional survey of 2000 breast cancer-associated physicians using a 24-items questionnaire adapted from prior guides. Then we used a multivariable linear regression model to confirm independent associations between the propensity of physicians' attitudes toward reproduction and physicians' specific demographic characteristics. Results A total of 911/1249 (72.93%) eligible physicians completed the questionnaire. Regarding the most concerning topic of whether breast cancer patients could conceive, 65 (7.1%) physicians having low and 457 (50.2%) physicians having high propensity for recommending reproduction. For ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) after surgery and radiotherapy, 599 (65.8%) physicians did not agree with the recommendation to conceive. 231 (25.4%) highly agree with the recommendation of reproduction for 2 years after surgery in invasive breast cancer patients with lymph nodes-negative. Only 140 (15.4%) physicians did not agree with the recommendation for 5 years after surgery in invasive breast cancer patients with lymph nodes-positive. A total of 861 (94.5%) physicians stated that they advised the patients to consult experts from other disciplines, such as gynecology, oncology, genetic and psychology disciplines. In multivariable analysis, more positive attitude toward reproduction was significantly associated with male, more than 11 times of participating in academic forum on breast cancer, 1-2 times of consulting about reproduction problems after breast cancer surgery per outpatient service and more than 11 min spending on solving the problem about reproduction in early breast cancer. Conclusion This study showed that attitudes towards reproduction of young breast cancer patients from physicians in China. Physicians had a high propensity for recommending reproduction. Compared with the two reproduction guidelines recommendation when to reproduce in different circumstances for breast cancer patients, physicians from China remained a relatively conservative attitude. Most physicians advised the patients to consult experts from other disciplines, such as gynecology, oncology, genetic and psychology disciplines.

AB  - Background
   Opioid agonist treatment (OAT) is an important pillar in the treatment of individuals using opioids and its continuation during imprisonment is recommended. Despite this knowledge access to and continuation of OAT is still limited in many countries. The forced discontinuation during pre-trial detention can cause severe withdrawal symptoms, which in turn may significantly impair the defendant's ability to exercise granted procedural participation rights. Furthermore, it can be argued that forced discontinuation of a desired treatment represents a form of a compulsory intervention.
   Aims
   The present study was developed against the backdrop of a recent ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (Wenner vs. Germany). It intended to examine how defense lawyers dealing with detained persons using opioids view and assess the accessibility of OAT in pre-trial detention as well as during imprisonment in different parts of Switzerland.
   Methods
   Using a qualitative approach, we interviewed 11 defense lawyers from three different cantons of Switzerland with multiple years of experience in providing legal representation to more than 220 defendants using heroin. The interviews were analyzed with QSR NVIVO 11 for Windows. A qualitative content analysis approach was used to evaluate findings.
   Results
   Defenders who had been exposed to the opioid crisis during the course of their legal career had adopted a positive attitude towards OAT and associated it with a stabilizing influence on their clients, an improvement in criminal prognosis, and a reduction in recidivism. They were generally of the opinion that access to OAT had improved, however identified a considerable variance in different penitentiaries, which were mediated by attitudes of staff and authorities. Based on the assessments of the defense lawyers, it can be estimated that the initiation of OAT especially during pre-trial detention is challenging. The predominant aim of OAT in a variety of Swiss prisons still seems to focus on a discontinuation, mediated by a forced reduction of medication. Some of the interventions reported are not in line with the principle of equivalence and strongly contrast the recommendations of the Council of Europe.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine how corporate reputation interacts with corporate social responsibility (CSR) fit and affects stakeholders' skeptical attribution (SA) of CSR motives, as well as their attitudes, supportive communication intent and purchase intent. This study proposes that a high-fit CSR program does not necessarily engender more favorable outcomes, nor does it stimulate SA. The study proposes the effects of CSR fit differ by corporate reputation. For bad-reputation companies, low-fit is anticipated to generate more desirable CSR outcomes than high-fit initiatives. Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were conducted. The first experiment employed a randomized 2 (CSR fit: high fit vs low fit) x 2 (good reputation vs bad reputation) x 2 (Industry: food retailing and insurance) full factorial design to examine the suggested hypotheses. The second study employed a randomized 2 (CSR fit: high fit vs low fit) x 2 (good reputation vs bad reputation) full factorial design with consumer samples to replicate the conceptual relationships among variables in the first study. Findings While reputation plays a dominant role in influencing stakeholders' CSR-related responses across both CSR fit situations, a SA partially mediates the relationship between reputation and stakeholder reactions. CSR fit interacts with reputation, and influences the partial mediation process through SA; under a bad reputation condition, low-fit CSR engenders less SA and results in better stakeholder reactions. A similar tendency was found with supportive communication intent and purchase intent. High-fit CSR initiatives by a negative reputation company engendered the weakest supportive intent and purchase intent. For a reputable company, across both CSR fits, respondents displayed generally very positive attitudes toward, greater intent to support, and intent to purchase from the company. Originality/value The study findings provide useful and empirically supported logical explanations of why high-fit CSR programs sometimes cause backlash effects, despite the general consensus that such initiatives generate positive outcomes. This study offers an alternative and more relevant perspective to conceptualize the complexity of anticipating CSR outcomes.

AB  - Background: Breast milk is the optimal source of nutrition for infants in the first six months of life. Promoting and protecting breastfeeding is reflected in public health policy across the globe, but breastfeeding rates in both developing and industrialised countries continue to demonstrate that few mothers meet these recommendations. In addition to sociodemographic factors such as age, education and income, modifiable factors such as maternal infant feeding attitudes have been shown to influence breastfeeding duration. The objective of this paper was to describe the influence of infant feeding attitudes on breastfeeding duration in rural Western Australia.
   Methods: A cohort of 427 women and their infants were recruited from hospitals in rural Western Australia and followed for a period of 12 months. Information about feeding methods was gathered in hospital and at a further seven follow-up contacts. Infant feeding attitude was measured using the Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS), and a score of > 65 was considered positive towards breastfeeding.
   Results: Mothers with an IIFAS score of > 65 were approximately twice as likely to be exclusively breastfeeding at six months, and breastfeeding at any intensity to 12 months. The median duration of exclusive breastfeeding for mothers with an IIFAS score of > 65 was 16 weeks (95 % CI 13.5, 18.5) compared with 5 weeks for those with a score < 65 (95 % CI 3.2, 6.8) (p < 0.0001). The median duration of any breastfeeding to 12 months was more than twice as long for mothers with an IIFAS score > 65 (48 vs. 22 weeks, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Women in this rural cohort who had a more positive attitude towards breastfeeding had a longer duration of both exclusive breastfeeding to six months and any breastfeeding to 12 months. Further research examining the breastfeeding attitudes of specific subgroups such as men, grandparents and adolescents in rural areas will contribute to the evidence base and help to ensure that breastfeeding is seen as the normal method of infant feeding.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Single-port laparoscopy is prospected as the future of minimal invasive surgery. It is hypothesised to cause less post operative pain, with a shorter hospitalisation period and improved cosmetic results. Population-and patient-based opinion is important for the adaptation of new techniques. This study aimed to assess the opinion and perception of a healthy population and a patient population on single-port laparoscopy compared with conventional laparoscopy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An anonymous 33-item questionnaire, describing conventional and single-port laparoscopy, was given to 101 patients and 104 healthy volunteers. The survey participants (median age 44 years; range 17-82 years) were asked questions about their personal situation and their expectations and perceptions of the two different surgical techniques; conventional multi-port laparoscopy and single-port laparoscopy. RESULTS: A total of 72% of the participants had never heard of single-port laparoscopy before. The most important concern in both groups was the risk of surgical complications. When complication risks remain similar, 80% prefers single-port laparoscopy to conventional laparoscopy. When the risk of complications increases from 1% to 10%, 43% of all participants prefer single-port laparoscopy. A total of 70% of the participants are prepared to receive treatment in another hospital if single-port surgery is not performed in their hometown hospital. The preference for single-port approach was higher in the female population. CONCLUSION: Although cure and safety remain the main concerns, the population and patients group have a favourable perception of single-port surgery. The impact of public opinion and patient perception towards innovative techniques is undeniable. If the safety of the two different procedures is similar, this study shows a positive attitude of both participant groups in favour of single-port laparoscopy. However, solid scientific proof for the safety and feasibility of this new surgical technique needs to be obtained before this procedure can be implemented into everyday practice.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the impact of blogs on teaching English as a foreign language (EFL) to primary students. The study also explores educators' perceptions of social media tools and digital literacy in school environments.
   Design/methodology/approach - A three-step approach was used to collect both qualitative and quantitative data. First, the blogs of 23 fifth-grade students in an EFL class in Kuwait was analysed for one semester along with student perceptions and teacher observations. Second, a survey was distributed to the students at the end of the semester, and finally, four focus groups were conducted regarding educators' perceptions on the use of social media, their skills and needs and problems encountered.
   Findings - The findings showed that by the end of the semester, students were writing lengthy sentences, had fewer spelling and grammatical mistakes, were more motivated and independent and displayed a more positive attitude towards learning EFL. In addition, educators are enthusiastic about using Web technologies in their teaching practices but have several concerns such as digital literacy competencies, technology-use behaviour and lack of accessibility to digital content.
   Research limitations/implications - The number of questions on the student survey could be reduced. Also, it would be preferable in future studies to require all students to blog at least twice a week which could provide a broader representation of their writing abilities.
   Originality/value - Little research has been reported in the literature on the use of blogs in teaching EFL to primary school students. Most literature focuses on teaching EFL to university students. By using a mixed-methodology approach, this study also highlights the needs of educators and students in technology learning environments and makes a good contribution towards offering pragmatic solutions.

AB  - Background: There is an increasing push in Western healthcare for people to 'manage' their health, a key aspect of what has been called the 'new public health'. It has been argued that this 'personal health management' - informal work done to monitor, inform, or influence one's health - may be a burden, with potential to contribute to poor health outcomes. However, there is little research actually examining perceptions of personal health management and the 'burden' of these activities, particularly for generally healthy individuals.
   Methods: We conducted exploratory qualitative interviews with 30 generally healthy men and women about their perceptions and experiences of personal health management. Questions focused on health behaviours (e. g., information seeking), as well as feelings about these behaviours and perceptions of the time dedicated to health. Audio-recorded interviews were transcribed and analyzed qualitatively using NVivo 10. Where appropriate, quantitative codes were applied and descriptive statistics are reported alongside qualitative findings.
   Results: Participants were generally satisfied with the amount of time spent on their health and few perceived personal health management as a burden. Many participants took issue with the concept of 'work' being associated with health and stressed the importance of taking personal responsibility for health.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that generally healthy people have internalised the notion of the 'new public health' and accepted the imperative of personal health responsibility. On the one hand, this bodes well for healthy individuals; their positive attitude may lead to better health outcomes, and the manageable amount of time spent suggests personal health management is unlikely to cause negative health consequences associated with stress. On the other hand, our findings may indicate that other factors, such as social determinants of health, are ignored in health promotion efforts and that those who cannot manage their own health may fall further behind. Future research should continue to explore the time people spend 'working' for their health, and how they perceive and respond to 'new public health' imperatives.

The sample consisted of 179 participants with a mean age of 40.85 years (SD = 13.7). The analyzes indicate that resilience is highly predictive of psychological well-being and mood and is a protective factor against post-traumatic stress. Also for the ease of carrying the pandemic, which may be mediated by other factors. The effects of the pandemic and confinement appear to have significantly increased post-traumatic stress symptoms. Women have more post-traumatic stress and less psychological well-being. The age group most affected is that of young people (18-25 years).

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this article was to explore the influence of individual perception and social climate on consumer-initiated group-buying purchase decisions. An extended cross-level research model was used to explain how a new mechanism for purchasing through personal interactions could work. Design/methodology/approach This study utilised a questionnaire survey for data gathering. The subjects of the investigation were group-buying initiators. Hierarchical linear modelling (HLM) was used to experimentally examine the research hypotheses. Findings The empirical results of the study indicate that the social influence of critical mass can effectively promote positive attitudes and intentions towards consumer-initiated online group buying. An individuals' perception of an initiator's fairness influences their trust in the initiator. In addition, trust in the initiator can positively and significantly influence buyers' attitudes and intentions to online group buying. Originality/value Most previous studies on online group-buying focus on how social media influences group-buying behaviours. This study extends social media research by introducing an extended cross-level model to provide a comprehensive investigation into online-shopping. It is a preliminary attempt to systematically verify relationships at the individual and aggregate levels. The decision to group buying requires a relationship of trust to be formed before any transaction takes place, thereby increasing the intention to make a purchase. As a result, group buying is perceived as positive when interpersonal communication is very efficient, or when social influence is high.

AB  - Contrary to much boundary spanning research, we examined the negative consequences of boundary spanning contact in multi-organizational contexts. Results from a sample of 833 Dutch peacekeepers show that employees' boundary spanning contact with members of other organizations was associated with reports of negative relationships with external parties (e.g., work-specific problems, culture-specific problems). These negative relationships also had a spillover effect such that they mediated the effect of boundary spanning contact on boundary spanners' negative attitudes toward their own jobs and organization (e.g., job attractiveness and confidence in the organization).

AB  - Sub-optimal vaccination coverage and recent outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases serve as a reminder that vaccine hesitancy remains a concern. ImmunizeCA, a new smartphone app to help track immunizations, may address several reasons for not vaccinating. We conducted a study to describe demographic variables, attitudes, beliefs and information sources regarding pediatric vaccination in a sample of childbearing women who were willing to download an immunization app. We also sought to measure their current mobile usage behaviors and determine if there is an association between participant demographics, attitudes, beliefs and information sources regarding pediatric vaccination and mobile usage. We recruited participants using a combination of passive and active methods at a tertiary care hospital in Ottawa, Canada. We used surveys to collect demographic information, examine attitudes, behavior, and information sources regarding immunization and self-reported mobile phone usage. A total of 54 women participated. The majority had positive attitudes toward vaccination (96%) and intended to vaccinate their children (98%). Participants were interested in information on pediatric vaccination (94%), and found information from public health the most reliable and accessible (78%). Participants also trusted immunization information from their doctor or nurse and public health (83%) more than other sources. There was variability in participant use of mobile apps for other purposes. The median participant mobile readiness score was 3.2. We found no significant associations between participant age, behavior and attitudes regarding vaccination and mobile readiness scores. This is the first evaluation of mobile readiness for a smartphone app to track immunizations. Our findings suggest that there exists an opportunity to provide reliable information on vaccination through mobile devices to better inform the public, however predictors of individual engagement with these technologies merits further study.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the Mathematics Infusion into Science Project (MiSP), which integrated science and mathematics in an engaging middle school science curriculum that fostered improvements in science content knowledge, higher-level problem solving, and affective domains related to mathematics. The project design was based upon a framework that suggests cross-curricular designs promote scientific thinking and positive attitudes towards the role of mathematics in learning and communicating science. The curriculum incorporated graphing skills that complemented eighth grade science concepts such as thermal energy transfer, density, and photosynthesis. Using a quasi-experimental wait-list control design, this research explored the impacts of MiSP in terms of students' content knowledge, application ability, reasoning skills, and affective domains over the course of one academic year. Over two academic years, 28 teachers participated in 87 h of professional development and 1135 students experienced mathematics-infused lessons and completed pre- and post-science assessments and attitude surveys. Data analyses utilizing analysis of covariance indicated significant improvements in science disciplinary knowledge, higher-order science process skills, and select affective domains, with small to medium effects. Further analyses indicated that treatment-related improvement in science process skills was not mediated by the significant affective domains including linear equation confidence, graph construction confidence, and mathematics applicability recognition. Quantitative findings support the use of graphing-infused curricula in middle schools to improve student science learning and mathematics-related attitudes. Implications for implementing science-mathematics integrated curricula and assessing reform-based science initiatives are discussed.

AB  - Background: Prostate cancer is a global health problem; its incidence is on the rise in Chinese and usually fraught with both physical and psychological symptomatology.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the relationships among demographic and disease characteristics, resourcefulness, depressive symptoms, and health related quality of life (HRQOL).
   Methods: A descriptive, correlational design was used. A total of 200 individuals with prostate cancer were recruited. The participants completed a self-report regarding their depressive symptoms and HRQOL. Using a structural equation modeling approach, all relationships among the factors, mediators, depressive symptoms, and HRQOL were analyzed.
   Results: The more resourcefulness that participants perceived, the more likely they were to report better HRQOL. The best-fitted structural equation model included individual demographics and disease characteristics and resourcefulness as significant predictors of HRQOL. Moreover, this structural model explained 72%, 76%, and 57% of the variance in physical quality of life, mental quality of life, and depressive symptoms, respectively. In addition, resourcefulness had a positive mediating effect on increasing the physical and mental quality of life and decreasing the depressive symptoms for patients with prostate cancer.
   Conclusions: Resourcefulness helps patients with prostate cancer build a positive attitude and that it is crucial for enhancing the HRQOL of patients. By using the proper resourcefulness strategy, that is, either personal (self-help) or social (help-seeking), nursing professionals can substantially contribute to enhancing the HRQOL for patients with PC.
   Implications for Practice: Knowledge of risk factors for HRQOL would be useful for nursing professional in detecting health problems and treatment options.

AB  - Behavioral integrity (BI) describes the extent to which an observer believes that an actor's words tend to align with their actions. It considers whether the actor is seen as keeping promises and enacting the same values they espouse. Although the construct of BI was introduced in 1999 and developed more fully in 2002, it builds on the work of earlier scholars that discussed related notions of hypocrisy, credibility, and gaps between espousal and enactment. Since the 2002 paper, a growing literature has established the BI construct, largely but not exclusively in the leadership realm, as a critical antecedent to positive attitudes such as trust and commitment, positive behaviors such as turnover and performance, and as a moderator of the effectiveness of leadership initiatives. BI is by definition subjectively assessed, and perceptions of BI are susceptible to various forms of perceptual biases. A variety of factors appear to affect whether observers interpret a particular word-action alignment or gap as an indication of the actor's high or low BI. In this article, we examine and synthesize this literature and suggest directions for future research. We discuss the early history of BI research and then examine contemporary research at the individual, group, and organizational levels of analysis. We assess what we have learned and what methodological challenges and theoretical questions remain to be addressed. We hope in this way to stimulate further research on this consequential construct.

AB  - Objective: This study examined the use of an active gaming program in a pre-vocational school over a 1-year period.
   Subjects and Methods: Three hundred students (mean age, 13.3 years; range, 12-18 years) were invited to participate and exposed to the active game program called E-sportszone, in which they could participate during the school day and after school. Attendance to E-sportszone was assessed by objectively monitoring over a 1-year period and self-report. Questionnaires about E-sportszone attendance, physical activity (PA), and sedentary behavior and underlying psychosocial determinants were administered at baseline and after 1 year.
   Results: Forty-two percent of the students attended the E-sportszone at least once. Attendance over the year varied from 1 day through 114 days (median, 3 days) with a peak during the E-sportszone marathon that was organized. Multivariate analysis showed boys used the E-sportszone more than girls (odds ratio [OR] 2.8) and older students were less likely to be users than younger students (OR 0.4). Furthermore, students who had a more positive attitude toward PA (OR 1.5) or who had higher scores on intention to use the E-sportszone (OR 1.5) were more likely to engage in active gaming than those who had lower scores.
   Conclusions: A substantial group of at-risk students (i.e., high body mass index, low PA, and high level of sedentary behavior) used the E-sportszone at least once. However, frequency of usage was low, resulting in limited contribution to PA behavior. Long-term use was challenging, and future studies should focus on strategies to encourage continued use of active games in this type of pre-vocational school setting.

AB  - Risky driving behavior (RDB) is one of the human factors contributing to the majority traffic injuries and crashes. This paper examines the influence of personality factors on RDB and the mediating role of intention and attitude in the relationship. The influence of different SES, personality, marital status, and gender characteristics on attitude, intention, and risky driving was also examined. A sample of 354 fully licensed Ghanaian drivers, including 278 males and 76 females, participated in the study at two times points separated by three months. The correlation results showed that unhealthy family relationship and negative emotions were positively associated with illegal speed-related behaviors, risky driving, and accident involvement. The results of a structural equation model suggested that personality variables significantly and positively influence intention and attitude toward speeding, with normlessness directly and positively influencing RBD. The mediation analysis shows that intention mediated the effects of personality variables on RBD. No significant mediating effect for attitude was found. The analysis of variance result shows that drivers with high socioeconomic status and personality had the high intention and attitude toward speeding and reported more RDB. Finally, drivers who had been divorced significantly reported more positive attitude toward speeding than the married and single group. Based on the results, the study concludes that, in accessing the effect of personality measures on RDB, it is important to include intention as a possible mediator for more accurate decision. Practical implications for managing different personalities and socioeconomic positions are also discussed.

AB  - The challenges and consequences of COVID-19 imposed massive changes in adolescents' daily routines (e.g., school closures, home confinement, and social distancing rules), which impacted their mental health. This longitudinal study aimed to better understand the changes in adolescents' internalizing symptoms and the underlying mechanisms of parental stress due to COVID-19. We asked 1053 parents of adolescents to complete an online survey during the second and fifth weeks and at the end of home confinement (i.e., four weeks later). Results showed that parents reported their adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms were more severe at Time 2 than at the first administration. Anxiety symptoms slightly decreased at Time 3, while there was no significant change in depression symptoms. Moreover, parents' expressive suppression mediated the association between parental stress and adolescents' anxiety and depression symptoms, respectively. The findings suggest that as restriction increased, adolescents' anxiety and depression became more severe. Moreover, due to the link between parental stress and adolescents' internalizing disorders helping families to cope with the distress due to the pandemic may have a positive impact on parents, the child, and the family as a whole (i.e., the family climate).

TI  - Reflective Photobooth - a way to visualise, and challenge perceptions and representations of distanced social groups
T2  - VISUAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Taken-for-granted knowledge about people from other social groups is a key challenge for overcoming stereotypes. This article describes a novel arts-based research method to visualise participants' frames of distanced social groups and aims to trigger reflections among them. The Reflective Photobooth invites participants to dress up as members of distanced social groups, stage a scene, produce pictures, answer prompting questions, and discuss their visualisations. We argue that the artistic re-enactment that underlies the visualisation process can attract diverse groups of participants to engage with research topics, create places for the articulation of critical statements against existing societal cliches and stereotypical media representations, and trigger reflections among participants about taken-for-granted knowledge. The method was tested within the Frame-a-Farmer project, in which the social distance between consumers and food producers in modern agrifood systems was addressed. Results indicate that despite the method bearing some risks and facing some challenges, three promising areas of future application could be identified: (i) raising awareness among large groups of people, (ii) collecting stories or topical vignettes, and (iii) deconstructing taken-for-granted knowledge and societal cliches.

AB  - Negative attitudes toward bisexuals have been documented among heterosexuals as well as lesbians/gay men, and a common theme is that bisexuals would not be suitable romantic or sexual partners. While gender, sexual orientation, and attitudes toward bisexuality influence people's willingness to engage in romantic or sexual activities with a bisexual partner, there are other individual differences that may contribute. The current study examined the associations between four types of conservative beliefs and willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner in a sample of heterosexuals and lesbians/gay men (N= 438). Attitudes toward bisexuality were examined as a mediator of these associations. In general, results indicated that higher social dominance orientation, political conservatism, and essentialist beliefs about the discreteness of homosexuality were associated with lower willingness to engage in romantic/sexual activities with a bisexual partner. Further, more negative attitudes toward bisexuality mediated these associations. There were several meaningful differences in these associations between heterosexual women, heterosexual men, lesbian women, and gay men, suggesting that influences on people's willingness to be romantically or sexually involved with abisexual partner may differ for different gender and sexual orientation groups. Implications for reducing stigma and discrimination against bisexual individuals are addressed.

AB  - Purpose
   Due to economic growth and increasing the population of Islamic societies in the world, marketing studies have become more essential in these societies. This paper aims to study the relationship between Islamic religiosity and conspicuous consumption in Mashhad, the second-most populous city in the Islamic Republic of Iran, as a case of Islamic societies in the Middle East.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The data were collected by a survey of 534 respondents in Mashhad and stratified random sampling was applied.
   Findings
   Unlike the majority of former investigations, the results showed that there is a positive relationship between Islamic religious commitment and conspicuous consumption. Furthermore, gender, social media and income are important factors in explaining the extent of conspicuous consumption.
   Practical implications
   Luxury companies can use the results of this research to invest in Islamic countries where there is a great demand for luxury items. Additionally, it is recommended for these companies to use the potential opportunity of social media which is extremely popular in Muslim countries to advertise their products to a large population at a low price.
   Originality/value
   The results of this study can challenge the conventional understanding of the relationship between Islamic religiosity and conspicuous consumption. According to the results of this paper, in the Middle East Islamic rich countries, it seems that Muslims have a positive attitude toward conspicuous consumption, although Islam disapproves consuming excessively by the notion of Israf.

AB  - Recent studies have suggested that health constructs embraced by the Terror Management Theory (TMT) and the Basic Psychological Needs Theory (BPNT) may drive individuals' COVID-19 health-related decisions. This study examines the relationships between existential concerns (ECs; within the TMT), basic psychological needs (BPNs; within the BPNT) and COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (VH), as well as the mediating role of negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. A cross-sectional survey was carried out from April to May 2021 on a sample of two hundred and eighty-seven adults (M-age = 36.04 +/- 12.07; 59.9% females). Participants provided information regarding existential concerns, basic psychological needs, attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and vaccine hesitancy for Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccines separately. Higher vaccine hesitancy (32.1%) and vaccine resistance (32.8%) rates were found for AstraZeneca than for Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine (22.3% and 10.1%, respectively). Structural equation modeling showed that existential concerns were related to Pfizer-BioNTech and AstraZeneca vaccine hesitancy both directly and indirectly through negative attitudes toward potential side effects of COVID-19 vaccines. The findings of the study confirm that the TMT is efficient in explaining COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Targeted efforts are needed to increase the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Loneliness is a painful condition associated with increased risk for premature mortality. The formation of new, positive social relationships can alleviate feelings of loneliness, but requires rapid trustworthiness decisions during initial encounters and it is still unclear how loneliness hinders interpersonal trust. Here, a multimodal approach including behavioral, psychophysiological, hormonal, and neuroimaging measurements is used to probe a trust-based mechanism underlying impaired social interactions in loneliness. Pre-stratified healthy individuals with high loneliness scores (n = 42 out of a screened sample of 3678 adults) show reduced oxytocinergic and affective responsiveness to a positive conversation, report less interpersonal trust, and prefer larger social distances compared to controls (n = 40). Moreover, lonely individuals are rated as less trustworthy compared to controls and identified by the blinded confederate better than chance. During initial trust decisions, lonely individuals exhibit attenuated limbic and striatal activation and blunted functional connectivity between the anterior insula and occipitoparietal regions, which correlates with the diminished affective responsiveness to the positive social interaction. This neural response pattern is not mediated by loneliness-associated psychological symptoms. Thus, the results indicate compromised integration of trust-related information as a shared neurobiological component in loneliness, yielding a reciprocally reinforced trust bias in social dyads.

AB  - The objective of the present study is to highlight the importance of online newspapers in the formation of public opinion, by discovering whether they promote positive or negative attitudes towards immigration or contribute to increasing awareness about the impact of the digital press in educational and developmental terms. With this in mind, we carried out a comparative study of the digital versions of the two widest selling, broad-based daily newspapers in Spain: el mundo.es and el pais.com. We used the same methodology as that used in Comparative Education, analyzing the content of articles published between January 2009 and June 2010. Although there are many similarities between the two newspapers and both coincide in supporting the process of integrating immigrants into Spanish society, they differ in the strategies to be followed for achieving the sought-after goal of peaceful coexistence between migrants and the host community. "El Mundo" tends to favour adopting strategies that encourage immigrants to adapt to the established norms and guidelines of the host society; in the articles of "El Pais', on the other hand, the requirement for them to adapt is not regarded as necessary. However, the various ideological lines expressed in the articles that we analyzed enable us to draw the conclusion that they do not coincide to a significant degree with the editorial line of the newspaper publishing them.

AB  - Background: Advance care planning for end-of-life care emerged in the mid-1970's to address the need for tools, such as the advance directive (AD) legal document, to guide medical decision-making among seriously ill patients, their families, and healthcare providers. Objective: Study aims examine providers' perspectives on AD education that involve examining (1) a range of attitudes about educating patients, (2) whether prior knowledge was associated with practice behaviors in educating patients, and (3) specific factors among healthcare providers such as characteristics of work setting, knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors that may influence AD education and documentation. Design: To examine providers' views, we conducted a cross-sectional, online survey questionnaire of healthcare providers using social media outreach methods for recruitment. Methods: This study used a cross-sectional survey design to examine the proposed aims. Healthcare providers, recruited through a broad approach using snowball methods, were invited to participate in an online survey. Logistic regression analyses were used to examine providers' views toward AD education. Results: Of 520 participants, findings indicate that most healthcare providers said that they were knowledgeable about AD education. They also viewed providing education as beneficial to their practice. These findings suggest that having a positive attitude toward AD education and experiencing less organizational barriers indicate a higher likelihood that providers will educate patients regarding ADs. Conclusion: Various disciplines are represented in this study, which indicates that attitudes and knowledge influence AD discussions. The importance of AD discussions initiated by healthcare providers is critical to providing optimal patient-centered care.

AB  - Three studies examined the role of causal beliefs in weight stigma in order to better understand people's evaluations of individuals with obesity. Participants viewed weight-related information about a target individual and evaluated that target on various dimensions. Study 1 showed that offset effort information (i.e., information about effort to lose weight) had a greater impact on participants' evaluations of individuals with obesity than did other causal information, such as onset control and offset ability. Study 2 extended this finding by demonstrating that the duration of effort invested to lose weight is also important in determining participants' evaluations of individuals with obesity. Study 3 replicated the effect of effort (albeit in terms of effort to maintain a healthy lifestyle) on evaluations of individuals without obesity. Furthermore, in all 3 studies, disgust mediated the association between perceived effort and desire for social distance from the target. These findings highlight a key role for effort and disgust in weight stigma, and suggest that the negative evaluations of individuals with obesity might in part reflect a pro-effort bias. The present research has important implications for strategies to reduce weight stigma, and may even inform strategies to reduce social stigma beyond obesity, such as drug addiction.

AB  - Communicating during a pandemic is as difficult as fighting it. Social media influencers have become role models in the pandemic due to the guiding nature of social media. The aim of this study is to analyze how micro-celebrities on Instagram, one of the most preferred social networks in Turkey, carry out their COVID-19-related content and how they communicate through Instagram during the pandemic. The conceptual framework of based on "Celebrity Influence Model'; the top 10 micro-celebrities posts were examined. Results show that 68.4% of the posts are related to COVID-19; their sponsored posts were decreased; they mostly preferred a "humorous" tone in their messages, they preferred their posts as "indoors", and the most shared topic is 'lifestyle "Fun" is the most used value by micro-influencers. The primary role they assumed was 'entertainer It has been observed that micro-celebrities aim to inform, warn, direct and even develop positive behavioral changes by raising awareness on issues, such as staying at home, complying with social distance rules and wearing masks.

AB  - Technological innovations have resulted in the production of new, super-high-tech assistive robotic devices that improve the development of children with atypical development. The theoretical basis for this study was the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model, which consists of four main constructs that directly determine user acceptance and user behavior: performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions. The purpose of the study was to understand the rationale behind the acceptance of robot-mediated teaching and therapy for children with atypical development by Polish professionals. Participants included 245 professionals recruited from the staff of special centers and schools for children with disabilities in the south of Poland. They were first presented with a video demonstration of the humanoid Nao robot and then given a 31-item questionnaire that estimates UTAUT. Participants' attitudes towards using the Nao robot in teaching and therapy for children with atypical development were positive. However, these attitudes were found to be a weak albeit significant predictor of behavioral intention to use the Nao device. They were significantly predicted by social influence, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. The results are discussed in the context of the general theoretical background and the latest findings related to professionals working with disabled children. Correlation and structural modeling analyses confirmed the applicability of the UTAUT model in education and care for children with disabilities. However, behavioral intention was weakly related to positive attitudes towards Nao robot in this Polish sample. Forthcoming questions follow the conclusions of the current study.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, children's physical health and access to mental health resources have been two critical concerns. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy-Health (PCIT-Health) is a treatment model aimed at helping parents manage children's general behavior and their behavior in obesogenic contexts (screen time and mealtime). Due to social distancing guidelines, PCIT-Health was adapted for remote delivery through video conferencing. In this article, we describe the experience of implementing virtual PCIT-Health with a family. The family's progress through treatment is described, along with the challenges associated with remote service delivery and how those challenges were addressed. Progress through treatment was measured with questionnaires administered to caregivers and with observational measures of parent-child interactions. The results from these measures indicate that caregivers experienced a reduction in stress and improvements in their child's behavior after PCIT-Health completion. They also reported engaging in healthier management of their child's screen time and mealtime behaviors. As coded from observational assessments, parents increased their use of positive parenting practices. Telehealth-delivered PCIT-Health is a promising treatment modality for increasing parenting skills and improving child behavior.

AB  - RESUME Nous avons examine les relations entre la sante percue (p. ex., l'etat de sante auto-evaluation) et des pratiques d'autoregulation de la conduite (p. ex., la frequence de la conduite, l'evitement des situations de conduite difficiles) comme mediee par les attitudes et les perceptions de conduite (a savoir, le confort de conduite, les attitudes positif et negatif envers la conduite) dans les donnees recueillies pour 928 conducteurs ages de 70 ans et plus inscrits a l'etude Candrive II. Nous avons observe que les attitudes specifiques a la conduite (p. ex., le confort de conduite, les attitudes negatives envers la conduite) assurent la mediation des relations entre les symptomes de sante et les comportements de conduite auto-reglementes au debut et au fil du temps. Seuls les attitudes negatives a l'egard de conduite ont medies entierement les relations entre les changements dans les symptomes percus de la sante et les changements dans le comportement de conduite. Les symptomes percus pour la sante influencent apparemment la probabilite d'eviter des situations difficiles de conduite par le biais de deux attitudes negatives initiales pour la conduite, ainsi que des changements dans les attitudes negatives au fil du temps. Comprendre les influences sur le comportement de conduite d'auto-reglementation seront benefiques lors de la conception des interventions visant a ameliorer la securite des conducteurs ages.
   ABSTRACT We examined the relations between perceived health (e.g., self-perceived health status) and driving self-regulatory practices (e.g., frequency of driving, avoiding challenging driving situations) as mediated by driving attitudes and perceptions (i.e., driving comfort, positive and negative attitudes towards driving) in data collected for 928 drivers aged 70 and older enrolled in the Candrive II study. We observed that specific attitudes towards driving (e.g., driving comfort, negative attitudes towards driving) mediate the relations between health symptoms and self-regulatory driving behaviours at baseline and over time. Only negative attitudes towards driving fully mediated the relationships between changes in perceived health symptoms and changes in driving behavior. Perceived health symptoms apparently influence the likelihood of avoiding challenging driving situations through both initial negative attitudes towards driving as well as changes in negative attitudes over time. Understanding influences on self-regulatory driving behaviours will be of benefit when designing interventions to enhance the safety of older drivers.

AB  - In 2005, 60 health care workers were recruited through services that attract injecting drug users (IDUs) and asked to complete attitude measures regarding IDU clients. Mediation analyses indicated that conservative health care workers displayed more negative attitudes toward their IDU clients because they believe that injecting drug use is within the control of the IDU. Negative attitudes toward IDU clients, in turn, were associated with worry about IDU clients' behavior in the clinic and with beliefs that IDU clients should disclose their hepatitis C status to their health care worker. Perceptions of controllability of drug use were also associated with the belief that IDU clients' ailments were caused by their IDU status. The study's limitations are noted.</.

AB  - Introduction: Breakthroughs in stem cell research (SCR) and regenerative medicine (RM) have attracted significant public attention worldwide. Simultaneously, scientific communities and science policies have tried to establish appropriate governance of SCR and RM. In this context, effective communication between scientific communities and the public is regarded as a key factor. However, the diversity of public attitudes and interests has not been sufficiently examined, especially the differences across countries. Methods: We conducted an international comparison of public attitudes toward SCR and RM. We circulated an internet questionnaire among people in six countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, the UK, Germany, and France. We collected 100 valid responses from each country, and a total of 600 responses were obtained. Results: Our key findings are the diversity of interests in RM, which can be expressed as user pragmatism, governance and handling of RM, risk, and benefit, and scientific interests. The priority of interests varied across the six countries, and the variations may be influenced by the political, social, cultural, and media contexts of SCR and RM in each country. Conclusion: The implications can contribute to a deeper understanding of the diversity of public attitudes, and bring about an appropriate examination of a wide range of ethical and social concerns of SCR and RM in global contexts. ?? 2022, The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.

AB  - Within the context of a pandemic flu, this experiment investigated whether source (government officials or physicians), severity condition (high or low), and mention of self-efficacy method (mention present or absent) in H1N1 health news affected participants' (a) perception of media influence on self and others and (b) intentions to get vaccinated. Results found support for third-person effects, and the magnitude of the effects grew with social distance. Main effect of source, as well as interaction effects among the independent variables on third-person effect and vaccination intentions, were also found.

AB  - This study explored the relationship between exposure to television programs featuring gay male characters and homonegativity in a diverse adult sample. Specifically, this relationship was examined at both the program and character level. Participants (N = 120) responded to an online survey that asked about exposure to television shows known to feature gay male characters that aired between 2000 and 2015. Next, participants recalled specific characters from these programs before reporting their homonegative attitudes and beliefs. Results revealed that both viewing programs featuring gay male characters and recall of specific gay male characters decreased their negative attitudes toward gay men in society, irrespective of individual difference factors (e.g., religiosity, gender, close interpersonal contact with gay men). Results are discussed in terms of mediated intergroup contact theory.

AB  - As COVID-19 has become a global pandemic, health researchers and practitioners have focused attention on identifying the factors that may help to shape health-protective behaviors, protecting individual health and well-being, and helping to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. This study explores the potential role of self-leadership and psychological capital (PsyCap) as key cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors. Using multiple theoretical frameworks (social cognitive theory, psychological resources theory, and the health belief model), this paper develops and tests a hypothesized serial mediation model in which PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors including hand washing, wearing face masks, and social distancing. Results suggest that PsyCap and coping self-efficacy mediate the positive relationship between self-leadership and health-protective behaviors. These results yield valuable insights regarding the usefulness of self-leadership and PsyCap as cognitive resources for shaping health-protective behaviors and for possible self-leadership and PsyCap interventions, potentially tailored to at-risk populations, which should have practical benefits for both the current and future pandemics and health crises.

AB  - Governments of numerous countries implemented school closures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Several investigations have shown the negative impact of social-distancing policies and school closures on children worldwide. Recently, research also demonstrated adverse effects on adults' well-being. The development of children is strongly affected by their parent's emotional state. The present study aimed to examine parental stress levels caused by a short period of homeschooling in December 2020 in Germany. A structured survey was set up and distributed randomly via social media and parent associations. We observed a significant increase in stress and concerns. Family conflicts significantly increased, social isolation was feared, and powerlessness and helplessness ascended. Risk factors were parental education levels, parental working time, and teaching features like the frequency of feedback, correction, and accessibility.

AB  - Building on the social distance theory of power, this study proposed the positive and negative mechanisms of power and their impacts on abusive supervision from the competitive perspectives of psychological distance and self-control. The boundary effects of independent self-construal were also analyzed. The hypotheses of this study were tested through questionnaires and an experimental study design. The Study 1 data were collected from 422 supervisors and subordinates from five private enterprises and one state-owned enterprise in Eastern China. Study 2, on the other hand, was conducted through a scenario-based experiment in which 180 part-time master of business administration (MBA) students from a university in Eastern China participated. All data were tested using polynomial regression analysis and a bootstrapping appraisal. The results revealed that (1) the relationship between power and abusive supervision is not significant; (2) psychological distance mediates the relationship between power and abusive supervision, with high power leading to higher psychological distance, which, in turn, strengthens abusive supervision; (3) self-control mediates the relationship between power and abusive supervision, with high power leading to higher self-control, which, in turn, weakens abusive supervision; (4) the mediating effect of psychological distance is stronger, and the mediating effect of self-control is weaker when independent self-construal is high rather than low. At the end of this study, the theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: The public must routinely practice precautionary behaviors to control the spread of COVID-19, as no vaccines and antiviral treatments are currently available. This paper examines the public's knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) related to COVID-19 and their relationships and identified the pandemic's vulnerable populations to provide recommendations for behavioral interventions and policies.
   Methods: Data collection took place over 3 days (June 26-29) via an online survey 5 months after the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) confirmed the first COVID case in South Korea; 970 subjects were included in the statistical data analysis.
   Results: Knowledge directly affected both attitudes (e.g., perceived risk and efficacy belief) and practices (e.g., personal hygiene practices and social distancing). Among the influencing factors of COVID-19 preventive behaviors, efficacy belief was the most influential and significant practice factor. It mediated the relationship between knowledge and all three preventive behaviors (wearing facial masks, practicing hand hygiene, and avoiding crowded places). The level of knowledge varied by sociodemographic characteristics. Females (beta=0.06, p< 0.05) and individuals with higher levels of education (beta=0.06, p< 0.05) demonstrated higher levels of knowledge.
   Conclusion: To increase precautionary behaviors among the public, health officials and policymakers must promote knowledge and efficacy belief. Future interventions and policies should also be developed in a 'person-centered' approach, targeting vulnerable subgroups, embracing them, and closing the gap of KAP toward COVID-19.

AB  - Atheists are among the most disliked "religious" groups in the United States, but the origins of this aversion remain poorly understood. Because the media are an important source of public attitudes, we analyze coverage of atheism and atheists in American and British newspapers. Using computational text analysis techniques, including sentiment analysis and topic modeling, we show that atheism is portrayed negatively by the print media. Significantly, we show that greater negativity is associated with atheism as a concept than with atheists as individuals. Building on this insight, and challenging arguments that prominent atheist intellectuals attract negative coverage, we also find that coverage of famous atheists is actually more positive than that of atheists or atheism in general. Overall, our findings add a new dimension to scholarship on differences between individual-targeted and group-targeted tolerance in public attitudes, establishing for the first time that media coverage mirrors such differences.

AB  - Social media play an important role in emergency management. The location of citizens and distance from a disaster influence the social media usage patterns. Using the Tianjin Port Explosion, we apply the correlation analysis and regression analysis to explore the relationship between online engagement and location. Citizens' online engagement is estimated by social media. Three dimensions of the psychological distance - spatial, temporal, and social distances - are applied to measure the effects of location and distance. Online engagement is negatively correlated to such 3 kinds of the distance, which indicates that citizens may pay less attention to a disaster that happens at a far away location and at an area of less interaction or at a relatively long period of time. Furthermore, a linear model is proposed to measure the psychological distance. The quantification relationship between online engagement and psychological distance is discussed. The result enhances our understanding of social media usage patterns related to location and distance. The study gives a new insight on situation awareness, decision-making during disasters.

TI  - Physical distancing and risk of COVID-19 in small-scale fisheries: a remote sensing assessment in coastal Ghana
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The novel coronavirus is predicted to have dire implications on global food systems including fisheries value chains due to restrictions imposed on human movements in many countries. In Ghana, food production, both agriculture and fisheries, is exempted from restrictions as an essential service. The enforcement of COVID-19 prevention protocols, particularly social distancing, has been widely reported in Ghana's agricultural markets whereas casual observations and media reports on fish landing sites suggest no such enforcements are in place. This study aimed to provide sound scientific evidence as a basis for informed policy direction and intervention for the artisanal fishing sector in these challenging times. We employed an unmanned aerial vehicle in assessing the risk of artisanal fishers to the pandemic using physical distancing as a proxy. From analysis of cumulative distribution function (G-function) of the nearest-neighbour distances, this study underscored crowding at all surveyed fish landing beaches, and identified potential "hotspots" for disease transmission. Aerial measurements taken at times of peak landing beach activity indicated that the highest proportion of people, representing 56%, 48%, 39% and 78% in Elmina, Winneba, Apam and Mumford respectively, were located at distances of less than one metre from their nearest neighbour. Risk of crowding was independent of the population at the landing beaches, suggesting that all categories of fish landing sites along the coast would require equal urgency and measured attention towards preventing and mitigating the spread of the disease.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is expected to affect operations and lifestyles of interventional cardiologists around the world in unprecedented ways. Timely gathering of information on this topic can provide valuable insight and improve the handling of the ongoing and future pandemic outbreaks.
   Methods and Results: A survey instrument developed by the authors was disseminated via e-mail, text messaging, WhatsApp, and social media to interventional cardiologists between April 6, 2020, and April 11, 2020. A total of 509 responses were collected from 18 countries, mainly from the United States (51%) and Italy (36%). Operators reported significant decline in coronary, structural heart, and endovascular procedure volumes. Personal protective equipment was available to 95% of respondents; however FIT-tested N95 or equivalent masks were available to only 70%, and 74% indicated absence of coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting. Most (83%) operators expressed concern when asked to perform cardiac catheterization on a suspected or confirmed coronavirus disease 2019 patient, primarily because of fear of viral transmission (88%). Although the survey demonstrated significant compliance with social distancing, high use of telemedicine (69%), and online education platforms (80%), there was concern over impending financial loss.
   Conclusions: Our survey indicates significant reduction in invasive procedure volumes and concern for viral transmission. There is near universal adoption of personal protective equipment; however, coronavirus disease 2019 pretesting and access to FIT-tested N95 masks is suboptimal. Although there is concern over impending financial loss, substantial engagement in telemedicine and online education is reported.

AB  - The COVID-19 health and economic crisis has affected all areas of social life globally, including the economy. The world economy has declined due to purchasing power for individuals who have been forced to stay at home and cannot perform work. These restrictions to prevent the spread of SARS-Cov-2 have led to an increase in electronic commerce and mobile commerce as tools for procuring goods and services. In this paper, we conducted a longitudinal analysis of mobile commerce as an essential electronic commerce component, establishing the main drivers of mobile commerce and the intensity of their influences. The research focuses on mobile commerce in the United States (U.S.). It covers the period 2010-2020, the last year of this period capturing the context of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on electronic commerce (e-commerce) and mobile commerce (m-commerce). In the macroeconomic analysis of competitiveness, we established the main drivers of m-commerce, using artificial neural networks and the mediation effects found between the variables that describe m-commerce, e-commerce, and total sales, using structural equation modeling. The research results indicate an increase in the share of e-commerce in total sales and a predominance of the m-commerce share in e-commerce on the background of traffic restrictions and social distance rules imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Stakeholders in the m-commerce area should consider the following enhancing drivers: increasing internet speed, expanding 5G and Wi-Fi networks, and increasing accessibility and trust in mobile devices and applications.

AB  - Objective Media recommendations for the reporting of events where one person or a small group kills multiple others in public settings have been developed recently by suicide prevention experts. Evidence on the effects of reports that are compliant or noncompliant with these recommendations is lacking. Methods We conducted a randomized controlled trial withn = 148 participants who were randomly assigned to read newspaper articles (A) on acts of terrorism assumed to be conducted by Islamist terrorists and not consistent with media recommendations, (B) the same articles differing only in their compliance with recommendations, or (C) articles of similar style that were about homicide. Islamophobia as well as suicidal ideation, stress, and mood were measured before reading the article (T1), immediately afterwards (T2), and one week later (T3). The primary hypothesis was that there is an increase in islamophobia after exposure to media portrayals not consistent with media recommendations. Results Compared to the control group, only participants reading media reports that were not consistent with media recommendations showed a short-term increase in islamophobia. Conclusion These findings suggest that reporting on terrorism that is not consistent with media recommendations appears to increase islamophobia. In the context of reporting on Islamist terrorism, consistency with recommendations might help reduce negative attitudes toward Muslim minorities.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: With social distancing measures in place both nationally and globally, the current COVID-19 pandemic has forced the cancellation of in-person classes at universities and medical schools across the country. This has presented unique challenges for educators in all fields as they have embarked, many for the first time, on the journey into remote education in order to provide distance learning opportunities for students.
   Materials and Methods: In this article we will review our approach to rapidly converting an in-person diagnostic radiology elective to an entirely remote learning experience for medical students at our institution, including modification of course structure, software tools and materials utilized, and strategies for learner engagement and collaboration.
   Results: Development of an online elective led to a 10-fold increase in student enrollment compared to the traditional course offering, providing a unique opportunity to reach a broad number of students, many of whom were in the early clinical stages of their medical school career. Lastly, we will review faculty feedback after participating in the remote course as well as lessons learned from the transition to distance learning and its implications for future work
   Conclusion: The current state of technology makes radiology particularly well-suited for distance learning, and with the proper tools and approaches, effective remote radiology instruction can be achieved.

AB  - Innovation in journalism became an important element to determine the current and future direction of the profession. Through incremental and cumulative transformations over time, because of many obstacles faced inside the newsrooms, journalism has suffered from significant and fundamental changes, including the deployment of data journalism. In Latin America, the practice has seen an increasing expansion in the last years. Nevertheless, there are important technological gaps that limit its development. The present study draws upon literature on data journalism, media management, and sociology, aiming to contribute theoretically to data journalism research. Our findings show that beyond the technological approach, practitioners are relying on data evangelists, collaboration, and audience-centered innovation to produce data storytelling in their newsrooms. On the other hand, these alliances form "homophily" and "endogamy" features that limit the dissemination of the practice, which must consider the potential implications for the social distance of the audiences. It argues that Latin American professionals are distancing themselves from technological determinism to embrace a more audience-centric innovation in newsrooms. Finally, it also states that it is important to take into account those limitations, as they pose obstacles for data journalism innovation research knowledge. The article concludes with an agenda for future research.

AB  - The music industry presents a strong gender disparity in all genres and roles (composers, musicians, conductors). The reasons for the disparity discussed in the socio-economic literature regard genetic diversity, socio-cultural differences, and gender discrimination. Discrimination can be aggravated by the negative attitude of the mass media towards the women involved in the music industry. This paper explores the potential media bias in 2022 reviews of pop-rock and jazz albums released internationally between 2003 and 2015, published in two major Italian music magazines. The empirical analysis shows that the reviews of "female" albums consist of fewer words than the "male" albums, but the difference is significant only for a magazine. Within each magazine, the data also reveal two weak qualitative biases (though not significant): the reviews are more positive if no woman appears among the artists and, if the reviewer is a woman, the attitude towards the albums by female artists is, on average, worse.

AB  - The news media is a major contributor to stigmatizing beliefs that people with mental illness are dangerous and should be avoided. To reduce stigma, it is critical to understand how to reduce the negative impact from stories about violence and mental illness. This study experimentally manipulated elements of a TV news report to explore the effect on stigma. Participants were 838 community adults, mainly from the U.K. and USA, who were randomized to one of two versions of a TV news report describing a violent crime in which the perpetrator has a severe mental illness, one containing additional stigmatizing elements and the other elements thought to mitigate against stigma. Participants completed a variety of stigma outcome measures designed to assess beliefs about dangerousness, fear, and desire for social distance. The effect of the news condition upon stigma was mixed. While several effects were in the expected direction favoring the mitigating condition, these effects were very small and not statistically significant. In contrast, participants in the mitigating condition showed significantly lower prosocial beliefs and greater perceived difference from people with mental illness than the stigmatizing condition. Exploratory analyses suggested that country may have moderated effects. In conclusion, we could not reliably detect a difference between the two versions of the TV news report on stigmatizing outcomes. Further novel research is needed to build the evidence base of how to improve TV reporting of stories involving people with severe mental illness in the context of violent crime.

AB  - Objectives: To evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of the Nursing School Students on Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM).
   Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among students of Gulhane Military Medical Academy Nursing School during March/April 2010. The sociodemographic characteristics of participants and their knowledge and attitudes towards CAM were collected by using a structured questionnaire developed by researchers.
   Results: Out of a total of 354 students, only 91.2% of those students (n=323) participated in the study. The sources of information were stated as television and radio 80.3% (n=265), Internet 69.0% (n=223), newspapers and magazines 68.1% (n=220), friends 48.6% (n=157), and books 32.5% (n=105) by participants. While the mostly known first three CAM practices were hypnosis (59.4%), prayer (58.5%), and herbal therapies (52.6%), those which were stated as most effective were massage (81.4%), herbal therapies (69.3%), and prayer (56.0%). Almost five out of six students (82.7%, n=267) stated that CAM therapies should be included into their curriculum. The distribution of the responses for the item, "Complementary therapies are a threat to public health" had statistically significant difference between the classes (p<0.001). The first year, second year and third year class students had more positive attitude for CAM than the fourth year class students.
   Conclusions: It is suggested that the lectures on CAM practices should be included into the curriculum of the nursing students who are enthusiastic about learning them which will have a positive impact on their education and training.

AB  - This study contributes to the limited literature on race and crime in a multicultural Asian context. Based on a survey in Singapore, where multiracialism is a fundamental political pillar and yet discourse about race is mostly shunned, the findings suggest a relationship between media consumption and racial perceptions. Respondents who consume more race-specific media have less negative racial perceptions of their own race, and more negative racial perceptions about other races. Respondents who consume more crime-related media content on TV, newspapers, and social networking sites tend to be more racially prejudiced against other races. Those who pay more attention to crime-related media content hold more negative racial perceptions of other races, and have harsher criminal culpability judgments of other races while holding a diminished culpability judgment of one's own race.

AB  - Pneumonia is one of the very common life-threatening diseases and needs proper diagnosis at an early stage to be cured expeditiously. Medical practitioners use chest X-ray as the best imaging modality to identify pneumonia. Due to the limited facilities available at the remote places and the need of maintaining the social distancing imposed by the recent outbreak of coronavirus disease, one may not have ease of access to a professional radiologist. This article proposes a deep learning (DL) framework that detects pneumonia from X-ray images to assist the medical practitioners located at distant places. The X-ray images are captured as compressed sensing (CS) measurements i.e. very few numbers of samples are observed in order to obtain an energy efficient and bandwidth preserving system to be utilized for far-end pneumonia detection purpose. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed approach enables the detection of pneumonia with 96.48% accuracy when only 30% samples are transmitted.

AB  - The acute consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted wellness strategies aimed at mitigating the pre-existing epidemic of burnout in radiology. Specifically, safety measures including social distancing requirements, effective communications, supporting remote and distributed work teams, and newly exposed employment and treatment inequities have challenged many major efforts at fostering professional fulfillment. To get our wellness efforts back on track and to achieve a new and perhaps even a better "normal" will require refocusing and reconsidering ways to foster and build a culture of wellness, implementing practices that improve work efficiencies, and supporting personal health, wellness behaviors, and resilience. Optimizing meaning in work is also critical for well-being and professional fulfillment. In addition to these earlier approaches, organizations and leaders will need to reprioritize efforts to build high-functioning cohesive and connected teams; to train, implement, and manage peer-support practices; and to support posttraumatic growth. This growth represents the positive psychological changes that can occur after highly challenging life circumstances and, when successful, allows individuals to achieve a higher level of functioning by addressing and learning from the precipitating event. Our practices can support this growth through education, emotional regulation, and disclosure, by developing a narrative that reimagines a hoped-for better future and by finding meaning through services that benefit others.

AB  - Purpose Long-term antipsychotic treatment is key to a positive clinical outcome in schizophrenia. Recent guidelines recommend the prescription of long-acting antipsychotic formulations (LAIs) as early as the first episode in patients with schizophrenia. The OPTIMUS study evaluated real-world use of a new three-monthly paliperidone palmitate formulation (PP3M) in France. Methods For this observational cross-sectional study, all French psychiatrists were invited to enrol patients who had initiated PP3M in the previous 4 months. Snapshot data were collected at a routine consultation, without any modification of clinical practice. Results This population of 350 patients with schizophrenia started on PP3M predominantly included single men, living independently with a diagnosis of schizophrenia for a median of 9.3 years. Demographic characteristics were broadly comparable to those reported in other studies on LAIs. Investigators cited treatment simplification (96.9%) and patient comfort (93.3%) as the most common reasons for switching to PP3M; enhancing adherence was mentioned less often (61.1%) with most patients previously considered as adherent, and a majority of them expressing a positive attitude to their treatment. One-third of patients accepted the psychiatrist's proposal to initiate PP3M treatment without any discussion, and relatives were involved in the therapeutic decision-making process in only 23.7% of cases. After initiation, few changes were seen in professional follow-up frequency or concomitant pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment modalities except for a decrease in antipsychotic polytherapy. Conclusions PP3M is mostly prescribed in adherent patients with fairly stable schizophrenia, and the longer dosing interval does not substantially affect patient care.

AB  - The 21st century marks a period where the pursuit of innovation, the advance of information media, and diverse values have gained great significance. In the face of information, economic impacts, and other challenges, developed countries in particular have come to emphasize online character education, as cultivating the people's character to have a positive attitude toward life. Teaching people desirable core values and moral thinking to cultivate pleasant character could enhance personal happiness and social harmony, boost national competitiveness, and be the key to a more harmonious society in the future. Education is the stable rock of ethics and morality, and like the foundation upon which to build a house, an unstable rock would result in the danger of collapse. People's sense of propriety, justice, integrity, and honor, as well as morality, is in decline. In such a social climate, online character education plays an extremely important role. Taking employees of defense suppliers for the Ministry of National Defense, Taiwan, as empirical subjects, 226 employees proceeded with our 20-week (4 h per week, for a total of 80 h) experimental teaching research. The research results reveal that: (1) online character education would affect learning motivation, (2) online character education would affect the perception of integrity, and (3) learning motivation presents significantly positive effects on the perception of integrity. Our results suggest that online character education and discussion is expected to help defense suppliers cultivate good social interaction skills and character to build harmonious interpersonal relationships.</p>

AB  - The period of early adolescence is characterized by dramatic changes, simultaneously affecting physiological, psychological, social, and cognitive development. The physical transition from elementary to middle school can exacerbate the stress and adversity experienced during this critical life stage. Middle school students often struggle to find social and emotional support, and many students experience a decreased sense of belonging in school, diverting students from promising academic and career trajectories. Drawing on psychological insights for promoting belonging, we fielded a brief intervention designed to help students reappraise concerns about fitting in at the start of middle school as both temporary and normal. We conducted a district-wide double-blind experimental study of this approach with middle school students (n = 1,304). Compared with the control condition activities, the intervention reduced sixth-grade disciplinary incidents across the district by 34%, increased attendance by 12%, and reduced the number of failing grades by 18%. Differences in benefits across demographic groups were not statistically significant, but some impacts were descriptively larger for historically underserved minority students and boys. A mediational analysis suggested 80% of long-term intervention effects on students' grade point averages were accounted for by changes in students' attitudes and behaviors. These results demonstrate the long-term benefits of psychologically reappraising stressful experiences during critical transitions and the psychological and behavioral mechanisms that support them. Furthermore, this brief intervention is a highly cost-effective and scalable approach that schools may use to help address the troubling decline in positive attitudes and academic outcomes typically accompanying adolescence and the middle school transition.

AB  - International media has paid attention to the use of substances by healthy subjects to enhance cognitive performance. Medical students are liable to use cognitive enhancers (CE) with the aim of improving academic performance. The study explored use and attitudes toward the use of CE in Italian medical students. The authors anonymously surveyed 433 medical students of the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia with an ad hoc 36-items questionnaire. CE were broadly defined as any substance taken with the purpose of improving cognitive functions, from readily available beverages and substances, such as coffee, tea, energy drinks, and supplements to prescription only medication, such as psychostimulants and modafinil. Response rate was 83.8% (n = 363). While the majority of the students (74.7%; n = 271) said that they had used substances to improve cognitive functions, only 2 students (0.6%) reported the use of prescription-only medications in the last 30 days. Main reasons for not taking prescription-only drugs were concerns about safety and side effects, reported by 83.3% of students (n = 295). A positive attitude toward use was held by 60.3% (n = 219) subjects. The surveyed Italian medical students used many substances as CE, but this did not seem to apply significantly to psychostimulants. A multivariable analysis showed that the following variables were related to the propensity to use substances as CE: male gender, self-reported memory impairment, concerns about worsening of cognitive performance, lifetime use of at least one illegal substance, use of any substance (both legal or illegal) in the last 30 days.

AB  - The Wildlife Society's (TWS) strategic plan for 2014-2019 intends to improve member services, organizational integration, and sustainability of the Society. To inform these efforts, we invited 12,681 TWS members to participate in an online survey covering demographics and perceptions of member services and benefits in 2014. Compared with a previous TWS member survey completed in 1991, member demographics have shifted: females comprise a greater proportion of the membership (32% in 2014; 19% in 1991), a smaller proportion of members are actively involved at any level of TWS (41%; 52%), and the median age of members has increased slightly from 39 to 44. A smaller proportion of current members supported expansion of the certification program (28%) as compared with member responses in 1991 (51%). Support for TWS becoming an accrediting agency for university wildlife programs declined from 79% to 50%. A greater proportion of current members (54%) opposed using TWS certification requirements as hiring guidelines for wildlife biologists, compared with 38% of members in 1991. In 2014, most TWS members viewed access to TWS publications and networking opportunities with other professionals as valuable membership benefits; however, lack of time or resources for involvement and lack of encouragement from employers were perceived as the main barriers to TWS participation. Although often an integral part of a member's professional career, our results suggest that members are less active in the Society and hold weaker positive attitudes toward the role of TWS in their career as it relates to certification, formal education, and employment compared with 1991.

AB  - Problem & aim: Cultural beliefs that equate birth technology with progress, safety and convenience contribute to widespread acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions. Little is known about attitudes towards childbirth technology and interventions among the next generation of maternity care users and whether attitudes vary by country, age, gender, childbirth fear, and other factors.
   Methods: Data were collected via online survey in eight countries. Students who had never had children, and who planned to have at least one child were eligible to participate.
   Findings: The majority of participants (n = 4569) were women (79.3%), and the median age was 22 years. More than half of students agreed that birth technology makes birth easier (55.8%), protects babies from harm (49.1%) and that women have a right to choose a medically non-indicated cesarean (50.8%). Respondents who had greater acceptance of childbirth technology and interventions were from countries with higher national caesarean birth rates, reported higher levels of childbirth fear, and were more likely to report that visual media or school-based education shaped their attitudes toward birth. Positive attitudes toward childbirth technology and interventions were also associated with less confidence in knowledge of birth, and more common among younger and male respondents.
   Discussion/conclusion: Educational strategies to teach university students about pregnancy and birth in ways that does not frighten them and promotes critical reflection about childbirth technology are needed. This is especially true in countries with high rates of interventions that reciprocally shape culture norms, attitudes, and expectations. (C) 2018 Australian College of Midwives.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to explore the characteristics of a brand spokesperson's voice that are the most valuable for consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) and evaluates various explanations in previous research regarding the influences of a speaker's voice.
   Design/methodology/approach - Brand identities can transfer their associations and affect as well as influence brand recall, thus contributing to CBBE. In addition, the pitch and gender of a speaker's voice are considered as key characteristics of voice perception. This experimental study exposed 521 respondents to 12 different voices and measured the effects of a spokesperson's voice pitch and gender on associations, attitude toward the voice and brand recall.
   Findings - This study presents a model that explains the influence of a brand spokesperson's voice on CBBE. The findings show that low-pitched voices induced distinctive, positive associations and led to a more positive attitude toward the voice and greater brand recall, regardless of the gender of the spokesperson and that of the respondent. Moreover, voice associations partially mediated the effects on attitude toward the voice and completely mediated the effects on brand recall.
   Originality/value - While numerous brands have resorted to specific voices to represent themselves, brand spokesperson's voice and its associations have not been studied. This study highlights the importance of a spokesperson's voice pitch and its associations in building CBBE and nuances the roles of spokespersons' and respondents' gender.

AB  - Objective: Evidence suggests that the actual experience of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has a positive impact on perceptions regarding the treatment among patients and their relatives. This assumption was tested by comparing relatives of patients treated with ECT with those of patients treated by other means.
   Design: Knowledge about and attitudes toward ECT were assessed using specifically designed questionnaires among 206 relatives of patients who were undergoing psychiatric treatment but had never received ECT (non-ECT group). The results were compared with those obtained among 77 relatives of patients who had undergone the treatment (ECT-treated group).
   Results: The relatives of the ECT-treated group were more likely to have acquired their information about ECT from physicians, whereas relatives of the non-ECT group usually relied on the media for this purpose. The relatives who obtained their information from physicians were more aware and more positive about ECT than those who obtained their information from the media. Knowledge about ECT was greater among relatives of the ECT-treated group than those of the non-ECT group. The relatives of the ECT recipients had significantly more positive attitudes toward the treatment, whereas the relatives of the non-ECT group were more often either ambivalent about ECT or critical of the treatment.
   Conclusions: Although the groups differed on certain clinical and demographic variables, these differences were unlikely to have influenced the results significantly. Thus, it was possible to conclude that sharing the experience of ECT with the patient had a significant and positive impact on the relative's knowledge and attitudes concerning the treatment.

AB  - When the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in 2020, countries around the world began enacting lockdown measures and enforcing social distancing rules. Almost at the same time, the use of drones also began to see a spike, especially in the hands of civilian users. This article examines the phenomenon of the drone video as a genre of the pandemic. While drone imagery is not endemic to the COVID-19 crisis, in the face of mass deaths and lockdowns, drone users globally began to turn to the drone as a mobile archive machine. Drawing on recent scholarship on drones, I examine how the drone's vertical vision afforded a form of pandemic witnessed by proxy. Despite the increasing use of drones for policing, surveillance and warfare, in the case of India, drone imagery also played an important role in countering government narratives about the pandemic and its body counts. Examining the drone images captured by the late photographer Danish Siddiqui, I demonstrate how the drone's 'vertical play' facilitated the emergence of a counter-archive of the pandemic.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has had a major impact on the education of trainees in the radiology environment. The precipitous drop in patient volumes and sequestering of faculty and trainees to maintain social distancing affects experiential learning. The shift of nearly all teaching settings to a virtual environment has been challenging but may also allow more interaction during teaching sessions than traditional readout sessions or didactic lectures. Faculty development is key in ensuring competence and confidence in this new environment. Recruitment of trainees using a virtual platform will require communication of opportunities as well as the culture of the department and institution as well as the community. Delay of the board examinations has caused angst as well as disruption of the timing of clinical rotations but may ultimately result in a shift of how the examinations are administered. The exceptional disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic allows us to reconsider how the educational aspects of imaging can emerge as improved in the years to come.

AB  - In the near future, the year 2050, agricultural production should expand to fulfill the needs of approximately 9.7 billion inhabitants. Such an objective should be harmonized with social, economic, and environmental sustainability aspects to maintain safe food production and food security worldwide. For more than a year, the COVID-19 pandemic has raised and is still strongly disrupting the agro-livestock production sector, similar to several other economic sectors. In this sector, the relationships between suppliers, producers, and consumers should always continue to maintain the activity of the production chain, which are impaired by social distancing decisions taken following the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, a global cross-sectional survey (translated into four languages: Arabic, English, French, and Spanish) was shared with people belonging to the agricultural sector to identify: (1) the role of the agricultural information and communication technologies (ICTs) in agro-livestock farming systems sustainability during the period of COVID-19 pandemic, (2) the need for such technologies in the agricultural sector, and (3) the factors that affect the use of such technologies. The results showed that the most frequently used agricultural ICTs were social media (Facebook and/or WhatsApp; 27.3%) and online platforms and Internet services (26.3%), whereas robotic vehicles and/or drones (6.6%) were less frequently used. During the emergence of the pandemic, the major reasons impacting agro-livestock farming systems' sustainability were social distancing (30.0%), shortage of labor (17.7%), maintaining precision farm management (14.8%), product marketing (14.2%), access production inputs (7.2%), and others (16.1%). Applying agricultural ICTs solved many obstacles related to the production process, such as maintaining precision farm management (25.6%), product marketing (23.6%), and access production inputs (16.1%). The subgroup analyses of the results considering the degree of country advancement, size of agribusinesses, and role/position of respondents in the farm highlighted the importance of supporting the use, availability, and awareness of agricultural ICTs at least for some groups of people such as those belong to developing countries, laborers, and small-scale agri-business holders. This cross-sectional study highlights the urgent need to turn to and to expand the use of new agricultural ICTs to meet the growing demand for food production in the world and to ensure the resilience and sustainability of farming systems, specifically under unexpected and extreme conditions.

AB  - Purpose This study examines perceived transparency of direct-to-consumer (DTC) genetic testing communication and measures its impact on consumers' trust, attitudes, and the intention to recommend the test to others. Design/methodology/approach An online survey of US-based adults (over 18 years of age) (N = 271) was administered by the online panel company Qualtrics Panels. The sample consisted of participants who have taken a DTC genetic test previously because only existing consumers could provide insight into companies' transparency about the entire genetic testing process (including the communication before, during, and after) as they experienced it. Participants were asked questions that measured intention to recommend DTC genetic tests to others, trust, attitude toward the DTC testing, and perceptions of transparency of the DTC companies' communication. Findings Results indicated that consumers who perceive DTC genetic testing companies to be transparent in their communication tend to trust the genetic testing process more, have more positive attitudes toward DTC genetic tests, and are more likely to recommend the tests to others. Research limitations/implications This study integrates corporate communication and science communication through the theoretical framework of transparency. It empirically demonstrates that message transparency is key to increasing the publics' trust, attitude and behavioral intentions toward companies that involve sensitive health information or online privacy. Originality/value This paper answers previous calls to explore the organizational approach of science communication in the context of the under-examined companies in the science and health sectors, specifically the DTC genetic testing industry.

AB  - Over the past decade, there has been a strong national push to increase minority students' positive attitudes towards STEM-related careers. However, despite this focus, minority students have remained underrepresented in these fields. Some researchers have directed their attention towards improving the STEM pipeline which carries students through our educational system and into STEM careers. Previous research has shown that expectancy-value theory (EVT) is useful for examining the short-term as well as long-term academic motivations and intentions of elementary age minority students. These findings provide insights into ways we may be able to potentially "patch" particular STEM pipeline leaks. In the current study, we advance this research by using EVT as a framework to examine the STEM attitudes of young students directly. We hypothesize that students' academic-related expectancies for success and subjective task values will be associated with an increase in STEM attitudes. Data for this study was gathered over the course of a large-scale computing intervention which sought to increase students' STEM interest. This computing intervention took place in an urban elementary school district located within the southeastern USA. Results from this study indicate that both intrinsic values and utility values predict students' STEM attitudes but they influence attitudes related to the various dimensions of STEM differently. These findings demonstrate that EVT provides a useful framework, which can be integrated into future computing interventions, to help encourage positive STEM attitudes in young children, thus increasing the internal pressure (or flow) within the STEM pipeline.

AB  - Rationale and methods: Despite the prevalence of media-based anti-stigma campaigns, there is little empirical evidence of their effectiveness and little guidance regarding which communicative strategies can bolster their message. Using a Belgian sample (N = 737) recruited in March-April 2019, the current experimental study manipulated a campaign message using counterframing strategies. Hierarchical linear regression analyses were used to investigate the effectiveness of the resulting nine variants.
   Results: Campaign effectiveness was most increased by stating that people with a mental illness are "not free-riders or poseurs", or by redefining them as "go-getters" who are "certainly not abnormal or crazy". These variants decreased desired social distance, and significantly reduced stereotype endorsement for people with a high need for cognitive closure. Whereas several campaigns decreased attitudinal stigma for people with a high need for cognitive closure, they inadvertently increased it for people with a low need for cognitive closure.
   Conclusion: This study indicates that small changes in the body copy can impact a campaign's destigmatizing potential. As such, empirical testing is essential to avoid ineffective or counter-productive anti-stigma interventions. Moreover, this study demonstrates that refuting stigmatizing statements can be a valid strategy in anti-stigma interventions, even though previous literature has argued against it.

AB  - Objective Methods This study tests U.S. citizens' attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Immigrants and immigration educe strong, divergent sentiments in the U.S. population. While these sentiments, which are tied to public policy, have been examined in prior studies, it is important to test them regularly in empirical studies to observe any changes in attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. I rely on the 2014 General Social Survey and employ hierarchical multivariate regression models to test the effects of patriotism, nationalism, xenophobia, and "world citizenship" on pro-immigration attitudes. Results Conclusion Appendix Females, respondents with higher education, and respondents who were more patriotic were more likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. Conversely, older respondents and respondents who held greater xenophobic attitudes were less likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. Finally, respondents who viewed themselves more as citizens of the world than citizens of a particular country were more likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. The study's results are generally consistent with findings from prior research, and point to a general invariability in Americans' views about immigrants and immigration. The policy implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - People 's actions toward a competitive outgroup can be motivated not only by their perceptions of the outgroup, but also by how they think the outgroup perceives the ingroup (i.e., meta-perceptions). Here, we examine the prevalence, accuracy, and consequences of meta-perceptions among American political partisans. Using a representative sample (n = 1,056) and a longitudinal convenience sample (n = 2,707), we find that Democrats and Republicans equally dislike and dehumanize each other but think that the levels of prejudice and dehumanization held by the outgroup party are approximately twice as strong as actually reported by a representative sample of Democrats and Republicans. Overestimations of negative meta-perceptions were consistent across samples over time and between demographic subgroups but were modulated by political ideology: More strongly liberal Democrats and more strongly conservative Republicans were particularly prone to exaggerate meta-perceptions. Finally, we show that meta-prejudice and meta-dehumanization are independently associated with the desire for social distance from members of the outgroup party and support for policies that harm the country and flout democratic norms to favor the ingroup political party. This research demonstrates that partisan meta-perceptions are subject to a strong negativity bias with Democrats and Republicans agreeing that the shadow of partisanship is much larger than it actually is, which fosters mutual intergroup hostility.

AB  - Information is now commonly consumed online, often displayed in conjunction with self-expression affordances (i.e., likes, votes) that create a sense of "self as source." Sundar et al.'s (2015) theory of interactive media effects (TIME) conceptualizes such affordances as source interactivity (SI). An experiment examined medium effects of SI as well as message effects on attitudes. It tracked selective exposure to attitude-consistent vs. -discrepant political messages, to capture confirmation bias, and manipulated SI presence (affordance to up-vote or downvote articles present or absent) as within-subjects factors. SI use and attitude change were captured. SI reduced selective exposure to attitude-consistent content. However, use of SI affected attitude reinforcement independently as well. Hence, users shaped their own attitudes both by selectively reading articles and expressing their views through SI. Directions for theory development are offered.

AB  - Childhood obesity and its associated risks in Malaysia remains a major health concern where at least one in five of children are affected. Media engagement with the public on the outbreak of Covid-19 had since overshadowed these health issues. Measures for social distancing and containment through the Movement Control Order (MCO) presented challenges for parents in making healthy food choices and dealing with unforeseen sedentary lifestyles. The study examined perceptions of parents towards health communication, how parents ensure their children abide by healthy eating habits, and how they seek information on childhood obesity intervention during this period. The positive deviance (PD) approach argues that champions of innovative ideas on maintaining good health are found within the communities rather than a change agency's prescription. The study obtained input from parents in the Klang Valley through semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis findings show that parents from M40 and B40 communities have insufficient information on nutrition for childhood development and prioritize convenience over long-term effects due to their hectic routines and household income. Positive deviant (PD) T20 groups are found to be more efficient in managing and applying knowledge due to their higher health literacy and communication within their social groups. This outlines the gap on effective communication strategies to improve health literacy of the public.

AB  - Despite their colossal size and importance in policing, China's auxiliary police forces have garnered very little research attention. This study attempts to fill our knowledge gap by first describing key features that distinguish the auxiliary police from the regular police in China and their counterparts in Western societies, followed by an empirical investigation of public attitudes toward the auxiliary police in China. Based on survey data collected from a coastal city in China, we reported the general patterns of people's evaluations of auxiliary officers and assessed whether variables representing institutional trust, media exposure, and neighborhood context are predictive of Chinese attitudes toward the auxiliary police. We found that Chinese citizens rated their local auxiliary officers very positively. Trust in the government and police and known negative reports about the auxiliary police are linked to Chinese' global satisfaction with the auxiliary police. Trust in the police, exposure to and belief in negative media reports about the auxiliary police, and perception of neighborhood collective efficacy are associated with people's specific attitudes toward auxiliary officers. Implications for future research and policy are discussed.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) ineluctably caused social distancing and unemployment, which may bring additional health risks for patients with cancer. To investigate the association of the pandemic-related impacts with the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among patients with melanoma during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a cross-sectional study among Chinese patients with melanoma. A self-administered online questionnaire was distributed to melanoma patients through social media. Demographic and clinical data, and pandemic-related impacts (unemployment and income loss) were collected. HRQoL was determined by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) and its disease-specific module (the melanoma subscale, MS). A total of 135 patients with melanoma completed the study. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 +/- 14.2 years, 48.1% (65/135) were male, and 17.04% (34/135) were unemployed since the epidemic. Unemployment of the patients and their family members and income loss were significantly associated with a lower FACT-G score, while the MS score was associated with the unemployment of the patients' family members. Our findings suggested that unemployment is associated with impaired HRQoL in melanoma patients during the COVID-19 epidemic.

T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English

KW  - CORONAVIRUS
KW  - AEROSOLS
AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has focused attention on airborne transmission of viruses. Using realistic air flow simulation, we model droplet dispersion from coughing and study the transmission risk related to SARS-CoV-2. Although this model defines most airborne droplets as 8-16 mu m in diameter, we infer that larger droplets of 32-40 mu m in diameter may potentially be more infectious due to higher viral content. Use of face masks is therefore recommended for both personal and social protection. We found social distancing effective at reducing transmission potential across all droplet sizes. However, the presence of a human body 1 m away modifies the aerodynamics so that downstream droplet dispersion is enhanced, which has implications on safe distancing in queues. At 1 m distance, we found that an average of 0.55 viral copies is inhaled for a cough at median loading, scalable up to 340 copies at peak loading. Droplet evaporation results in significant reduction in droplet counts, but airborne transmission remains possible even under low humidity conditions.

AB  - The school environment is extremely salient in young adolescents' lives. Adolescents who have unfavorable attitudes toward school and teachers are at elevated risk for dropping out of school and engaging in behavioral health risks. Peer network health-a summation of the positive and negative behaviors in which one's close friend group engages-may be one way by which attitudes toward school exert influence on youth substance use. Utilizing a sample of 248 primarily African-American young urban adolescents, we tested a moderated mediation model to determine if the indirect effect of attitude to school on cannabis involvement through peer network health was conditioned on gender. Attitude toward school measured at baseline was the predictor (X), peer network health measured at 6 months was the mediator (M), cannabis involvement (including use, offers to use, and refusals to use) measured at 24 months was the outcome (Y), and gender was the moderator (W). Results indicated that negative attitudes toward school were indirectly associated with increased cannabis involvement through peer network health. This relationship was not moderated by gender. Adolescents in our sample with negative attitudes toward school were more likely to receive more offers to use cannabis and to use cannabis more frequently through the perceived health behaviors of their close friends. Implications from these results point to opportunities to leverage the dynamic associations among school experiences, friends, and cannabis involvement, such as offers and use.

AB  - Around the world, people are now facing an unprecedented situation with the COVID-19 virus pandemic. With numerous countries announcing various modes of self-quarantine and social distancing, the Malaysian government has initially called for a 3-week Movement Control Order (MCO) beginning mid-March 2020. In this paper, we explore how citizens in Malaysia respond to such crises by examining letters that were submitted during the MCO period to The Star Online the nation's leading English online news portal. Using corpus linguistics techniques, 227 letters were firstly investigated for recurrent words/phrases used on how people talk about issues during this time. A critical discourse analysis on these recurring patterns of language was then employed to further examine their occurrences in this corpus, following Carvalho's (2008) analysis of media discourse. This, we contend as being the synergy between corpus methods and classic CDA that contribute to the corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADS) approach. Results yield Malaysians' view on the matter that could describe in so far as how the country is coping with the pandemic at the time. More specifically, letters that have mostly referred to COVID-19 pandemic as being a challenge and associating it with negative expressions are in fact emotionally charged, revealing how public letters written by citizen journalists provide a much more comprehensive view of public stance on COVID-19 in Malaysia.

AB  - In recent years, China has witnessed fierce competition for talents among cities. There is evidence that China's first-tier cities are losing their appeal for young talents due to the soaring housing prices and high living costs in first-tier cities, as well as the catch-up of next-tier cities. Therefore, uncovering what factors drive young talents to develop in first-tier cities is important for policymakers to maintain and enhance the attractiveness of first-tier cities. Most previous research on talent migration has focused on demographic and socioeconomic factors, while little research has examined the influence of psychological factors. By adopting the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), this paper aims to explore what beliefs and background factors influence university students' intention to develop in first-tier cities after graduation. Using the data we collected from 1242 university students across China, we found that two-thirds of university students have the intention to develop in a first-tier city after graduation. The Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results show that students' migration intentions were most influenced by their attitudes, followed by subjective norms and perceived behavioral control (PBC). Specifically, beliefs such as realizing future dreams, better job opportunities, and higher wages shape students' positive attitudes towards developing in first-tier cities. The supports from family, friends, teachers, and classmates contribute to positive subjective norms of developing in first-tier cities. In contrast, perceptions of high housing prices, high living costs, and family ties discourage students from developing in first-tier cities. Furthermore, being male, being a non-only child, studying in first-tier cities, and attending higher-ranking universities have positive influences on migration intention through the mediating effects of the TPB constructs. Policy implications were discussed to help first-tier cities attract graduates.

AB  - Objectives This study aims to describe the perception of dental professionals in Pakistan and Saudi Arabia (SA) towards the practice of teledentistry, its usefulness and challenges. Methods A cross-sectional study was carried out among 190 dentists from January 2021 to April 2021. The participants were included in the study using snowball sampling method. A 26-item adopted questionnaire was distributed using different social media channels. Chi-square test was used for analysis. Results Out of 190 participants, 46.3% were from Pakistan and 53.7% were from SA. The majority of participants in both countries agreed that teledentistry would enhance guidelines and advice (74.2%), improve peer-to-peer interaction (79.5%) and make patient's referrals more efficient (75.8%). For the usefulness, most participants agree that it is economical for the patients (61.1%), improves communication (74.7%), helps in educating the patients (86.3%), avoid unnecessary travel (76.8%), helps monitoring (71.6%), and benefits patients in remote areas (74.7%); however, more Pakistani participants perceived that time spent with the patient would increase compared to SA participants (p < 0.001) and a higher proportion of SA participants believe that it helps in communication and monitoring of patients (p < 0.001) than Pakistani participants. Regarding the challenges in the use of teledentistry, few participants think that it violates the patient's privacy (22.6%) or is difficult to use (14.7%) or have distrust towards the teledentistry equipment (24.2%). Conclusion The results indicated a high awareness and a positive attitude towards teledentistry, and its adaptation in their dental practice in both countries. However, limited infrastructure, set-up cost, and information technology (IT) literacy are the main challenges in integrating teledentistry which can be overcome by strategic government initiatives, policies, and programs.

AB  - The SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) pandemic has had a tremendous impact on the functionality of health systems and world affairs. We assessed knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) of healthcare workers (HCWs) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This was a cross-sectional study conducted in 23 referral hospitals located in three towns of the DRC (Lubumbashi, Kamina, Mbuji-Mayi). In total, 613 HCWs were surveyed using the World Health Organization's (WHO's) "Exposure Risk Assessment in the Context of COVID-19" questionnaire. Participants included medical doctors (27.2%) and other categories of HCWs (72.8%). The mean age was 40.3 +/- 11.7 years. Over 80% (range: 83-96%) of respondents had sufficient knowledge on each of the three domains: COVID-19 symptoms, disease transmission, and patient care approach. However, attitudes and practices scores were relatively low. Only 27.7% of HCWs were willing to receive a COVID-19 vaccine when it is available, whereas 55% of HCWs complied with good practices; 49.4% wore masks consistently and, surprisingly, only 54.9% used personal protective equipment (PPE) consistently at work and during contact with patients. Knowledge level was positively associated with the use of social media as a primary source of COVID-19-related information and the category of residence, with HCWs from towns already affected by the COVID-19 epidemic being more likely to have positive attitudes (adjusted OR, 1.64; 95%CI, 1.32-2.20) and comply with good practices (aOR, 2.79; 95%CI, 1.93-4.06). This study showed that most Congolese HCWs had sufficient knowledge on COVID-19, whereas the majority did not comply with consistent PPE use. The government of the DRC should urgently take major steps in capacity building for HCWs in outbreak preparedness and supplying hospitals with PPE.

AB  - Introduction: The objective of this study was to investigate the discrepancy between individuals with positive attitudes towards organ donation and the actual number of registered organ donors in Hong Kong, and to investigate the best modalities for promoting more organ donor registrations.
   Methods: This cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted in Hong Kong. Telephone numbers were selected randomly. Upon successful contact with a household, the eligible household member who had the most recent birthday was selected to participate in the telephone interview.
   Results: A total of 1000 Hong Kong Chinese residents were interviewed successfully. The response rate was 53.8%. The majority of the respondents were female (68.3%) and were aged 51 to 60 years (24%) or >= 61 years (43.6%). Among the respondents, 31.3% were willing to donate their organs after death; 43.3% were indecisive, and 25.4% refused. Among those who were willing to donate organs after death, only 34.2% had registered with the Centralised Organ Donation Register (CODR). Among those who were willing to donate organs after death but had not yet registered on CODR, 52.2% said they were not determined enough to take action, 47.8% said they were too busy, 37.8% said they were too lazy, and 20.4% said they were always forgetful about registering. In all, 32.8% of the interviewees were not aware of the ways to register as a prospective organ donor. Among non-messenger social media platforms, Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram were the most commonly used. Most participants believed that Facebook and YouTube were effective for engaging audiences.
   Conclusions: More effort should be made to facilitate organ donor registration in face-to-face settings via promotional booths and in online settings via appropriate social media platforms.

AB  - A key aspect for a successful management of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) is the cooperation with local stakeholders. In this study we assessed stakeholders' baseline knowledge and perceptions on marine NIS foreseeing support for their management in the Azores and Madeira archipelagos (Portugal). Survey questionnaires were designed to assess: i) current knowledge and stakeholder perception of NIS and associated problems; ii) influence of communication media on NIS dissemination; iii) stakeholder willingness to be involved in NIS management actions and; iv) which factors predict stakeholder participation in NIS management actions. Face-to face survey questionnaires were administered in recreational marinas of Sao Miguel (Azores) and Madeira islands. Four groups of stakeholders classified based on their putative relation with NIS were selected as target. In total 214 survey questionnaires were collected and analysed. Our results showed no significant differences between stakeholders based in Sao Miguel and the ones from Madeira. Overall a strong baseline knowledge on NIS and associated consequences was found but a weak accuracy to identify NIS examples was demonstrated. Types of communication media revealed to be stakeholder-specific and information-specific. Decision tree predictive models showed three powerful factors to forecast the respondent's participation in NIS management actions: 1- to belong to one of the four stakeholder groups; 2- to have a good level of NIS knowledge; and 3- to have the perception that NIS introduction is an important issue. Despite the positive attitude exhibited by stakeholders in engaging NIS management, our results highlighted a consensus to attribute governmental responsibility to such activities. The results of this work constitute a baseline to develop further management actions aiming to reduce the local spread of marine NIS and so contributing to a better environmental status of Portuguese marine waters.

AB  - Objective: To assess awareness, attitudes and opinions regarding bioethical issues among graduate students and faculty/researchers of universities in Lahore, Pakistan.
   Methodology: A questionnaire consisting of 20 questions was designed and sent to 700 students and faculty members/researchers of 14 academic departments/research institutions of seven universities in Lahore, Pakistan. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics using SPSS 16.0.
   Results: We obtained responses from 87% (614/700) participants. The sample populations appeared receptive to latest developments in science and technology; and were optimistic that such developments will have positive effect on their lives. On average almost 90% of the respondents were familiar with the term "bioethics"; 75.4% of the respondents desired that bioethics should be taught regularly in the classes. However, students of two important disciplines of knowledge i.e law and Islamic studies had awareness levels of only 43% and '0'% respectively regarding the term bioethics. A vast majority of the respondents were not satisfied with the state laws, policies, rules, regulations and institutions concerned with bioethical issues. The survey indicated that cloning (27.2%), abortion (24.6%) and organ donation (13.2%) are regarded as the most important bioethical issues, probably for specific reasons of the glamour attached to the technology, moral connotations and the hype created by media respectively.
   Conclusion: Educated youth in general have positive attitude towards S&T and its effect on their lives. Awareness level among students and faculty of life sciences is very high; however it is dismally low among students of Law and Islamic studies. The results of this survey does not necessarily mirror the awareness level, attitudes and opinions in the society at large since literacy level among the masses is low (57%) and prevalence of higher levels of education is even lower.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 has impacted the health and social fabric of individuals and families living across the USA, and it has disproportionately affected people living in urban communities with co-morbidities, those working in high-risk settings, refusing or unable to adhere to CDC guidelines, and more. Social determinants of health (SDH), such as stigmatization, incarceration, and poverty, have been associated with increased exposure to COVID-19 and increased deaths. While vaccines and booster shots are available, it will take time to reach herd immunity, and it is unclear how long newly developed vaccines provide protection and how effective they are against emerging variants. Therefore, prevention methods recommended by the Centers for Disease and Control (CDC)-i.e., testing, hand-washing, social distancing, contact tracing, vaccination and booster shots, and quarantine-are essential to reduce the rates of COVID-19 in marginalized communities. This project will adapt and test evidence-based HIV interventions along the prevention and treatment cascade to help address COVID-19 prevention needs.
   Methods: The study aims to (1) optimize an adaptive intervention that will increase rates of testing and adherence to New Jersey State COVID-19 recommendations (testing, social distancing, quarantine, hospitalization, contact tracing, and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination and booster shots) among high-risk populations and (2) identify predictors of testing completion and adherence to New Jersey recommendations. This study follows Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) principles to conduct a Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) with 670 COVID-19 medically/socially vulnerable people. Participants will be recruited using a variety of strategies including advertisements on social media, posting fliers in public places, street outreach, facility-based, and snowball sampling. Participants complete a baseline survey and are randomized to receive navigation services or an electronic brochure. They then complete a follow-up 7 days after baseline and are randomized again to either continue with their original assignment or switch to the other intervention or critical dialog or brief counseling. Participants then complete a 5-week post-baseline follow-up. Guided by the COVID-19 Continuum of Prevention, Care, and Treatment, the analysis will explore the factors associated with COVID-19 testing within 7 days of the intervention.
   Discussion: This paper describes the protocol of the first study to use SMART following CBPR to adapt evidence-based HIV prevention interventions to COVID-19. The findings will inform the development of an effective and scalable adaptive intervention to increase COVID-19 testing and adherence to public health recommendations, including vaccination and booster shots, among a marginalized and difficult-to-engage population.

AB  - This article explores some dimensions of how the role of the English language in Norway has been discursively constructed in newspapers during recent years, based on the analysis of data from the five-year period 2008-2012. The analysis is conducted using a specialised corpus containing 3,743 newspaper articles which were subjected to corpus-based macro-analyses and techniques, as well as manual micro-level analyses and categorisation. The main focus of the analysis is on the manifestation of attitudes through various ways of expression, such as the occurrence of lexical sequences and conceptual metaphors related to language. The results show that even though positive perceptions of English were quite frequent in the data, the main part consisted of expressions where English is seen in a negative light. Hence, a fairly negative attitude towards the role of English is predominant, as illustrated by the most frequent conceptual metaphor, language is an invading force, where English is at war with and seen as representing a threat to the Norwegian language.

AB  - Study Objective: Nonadherence in sexual risk reduction interventions might be common among adolescents. We compared intervention completion rates among adolescent and young adult women with and without a previous pregnancy or sexually transmitted infection (STI) participating in a program to improve contraceptive continuation. Design: Secondary data analysis from a feasibility study of a health-coaching intervention to improve contraceptive continuation. Setting: Three urban pediatric clinics in Philadelphia. Participants: Women ages 14-22 years who were English-speaking, sexually active in the past year, not desiring pregnancy in the next year, and starting a new contraceptive method. Interventions: At baseline, participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire and semistructured interview, followed by 5 monthly coaching sessions. Interviews and coaching sessions were audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded for thematic content. Main Outcome Measures: Intervention completion was defined as the number of completed coaching sessions. Secondary outcomes were qualitatively explored group differences in reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception. Results: Participants with a previous adverse outcome (a previous STI and/or a previous pregnancy) completed fewer coaching sessions than those without such history (median: 2 vs 4; P = .03). Both groups had low HIV/STI knowledge, negative attitudes toward pregnancy, and low HIV/STI risk perception. Those with a previous adverse reproductive outcome held more negative attitudes toward condoms. Conclusion: Despite similar reproductive knowledge, attitudes, and risk perception, young women who have experienced an adverse reproductive outcome might be less likely to fully engage in sexual risk reduction interventions. Future studies should confirm these findings and consider strategies to optimize the intervention's reach for vulnerable youth.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated whether levels of receptive arts engagement (visiting museums/concerts/the theater/the cinema) during the year preceding the COVID-19 outbreak may have served as a psychological resource for older adults that mitigated the association between resilience levels and COVID-19 anxiety when the pandemic broke out. Data were collected after the enactment of the first emergency regulations (between March 15 and April 1, 2020) via the Qualtrics Survey Software link that was sent out through social media platforms. In total, 205 participants aged 65 to 92 (mean age, 72.32; SD, 5.63) reported general anxiety symptom levels (GAD-7) (Spitzer et al., 2006), resilience (Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale), frequency of receptive arts engagement in the previous year, health status, exposure to risk situations, and behavioral changes due to the pandemic. Our hypothesis that receptive arts would moderate the resilience-COVID-19 anxiety link was examined by a multiple hierarchical regression analysis and with the PROCESS computational tool. Findings show that resilience was associated with COVID-19 anxiety and that this association was moderated by levels of receptive arts engagement. The findings show that high levels of prior art engagement constituted a potent buffer against subsequent COVID-19 anxiety. Policy makers may benefit older adults by encouraging their engagement in arts activities, even during social distancing.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has interrupted everyday life virtually everywhere in the world, enabling real-life research on threat-and-defense processes. In a survey conducted within the first days of implementing social distancing measures in Austria and Germany, we aimed to explore the pathways from threat perception to preferences of defense strategies. We found that anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance were specifically elicited by motivational (vs. epistemic) discrepancies. In a second step, we tested the mediating effect of anxiety, approach-related affect, and reactance on preferences regarding personal-social and concrete-abstract defenses. Experiencing anxiety was related to interest in security-related actions, and approach-affect was related to both personal projects and social media use. Participants experiencing reactance were more inclined to pursue personal projects (personal-abstract) and less interested in security-related (personal-concrete) actions. They also showed marginally lower system justification (social-abstract). Additionally, we examined the relationship of loneliness with defense strategies, showing that loneliness was associated with lower system justification and security behaviors. The results suggest that individuals deal with threat in their own ways, mostly depending on affective state and motivational orientation: Anxiety was related to security, approach-state to action (both social and personal), reactance to derogation of the system and disregard for security, while loneliness was associated with inaction.

AB  - A beta coronavirus named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was identified recently. This virus caused pneumonia of unknown etiology and is named as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). The disease is novel and hence no medicine to cure the infected patients is available. The only way to control the pandemic is by breaking the chain of the virus. The chain can be broken by massive diagnosis and social distancing. Radiological examinations, included computed tomography is identified as an effective way for disease diagnosis. CT and Chest X-ray images are considered to be an effective way for making clinical decisions. The X-ray facility is available even in the remotest parts and thus X-ray images can be easily acquired for patients. These images can help in prevention of infection, diagnosis and control. In this paper, an initial investigation report on the various aspects of COVID-19 is presented. An automated method for diagnosis of COVID-19 from X-ray images is proposed. The proposed model is based on XceptionNet that uses depth wise separable convolutions. The results obtained from the proposed model have high accuracy. The proposed method is compared with four other state of the art methods. The comparative study reveals that the proposed method performs better than the existing methods. Thus the method can be effectively used for diagnosis of the novel coronavirus.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has severely impacted children's and adolescents' lives due to policies and regulations implemented to slow the virus from spreading, which led to a loss of routine, structure, academic support, and social contacts. Literature also reports a lack of outdoor activity, inappropriate diet, and disruption of sleeping habits as affecting children's and adolescents' lifestyles and well-being. Remarkably, these consequent psychological, behavioral, and emotional changes can compromise their self-esteem, sense of self-efficacy, and self-concept, affecting their immune systems. These maladaptive coping strategies and associated effects may emerge as a failure to access some of the sources of support that might help them cope. Facing this crisis, we aimed at promoting well-being, growth, and the positive development of Portuguese adolescents through an intervention focused on positive coping strategies. We developed "Adolescer in time of COVID-19-A good practices Guide for adolescents in social distancing" as a digital document to be quickly disseminated online, answering the emergent needs of Portuguese youth between 13 and 18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we present the rationale and process of construction of this intervention while living within a quarantine period, considering the restrictive measures adopted at the time.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has intensified the search for digital approaches in mental health treatment, particularly due to patients and clinicians practicing social distancing. This has resulted in the dramatic growth of videoconferencing-based telemental health (V-TMH) services. It is critical for behavioral health providers and those in the mental health field to understand the implications of V-TMH expansion on the stakeholders who use such services, such as patients and clinicians, to provide the service that addresses both patient and clinical needs. Several key questions arise as a result, such as the following: (1) in what ways does V-TMH affect the practice of psychotherapy (ie, clinical needs), (2) to what extent are ethical and patient-centered concerns warranted in terms of V-TMH services (ie, patient needs), and (3) how do factors related to user experience affect treatment dynamics for both the patient and therapist (ie, patient and clinical needs)? We discuss how behavioral health providers can consider the future delivery of mental health care services based on these questions, which pose strong implications for technological innovation, the adaptation of treatments to new technologies, and training professionals in the delivery of V-TMH services and other digital health interventions.

AB  - Purpose The first research objective is to understand the role of digital [artificial intelligence (AI)] technologies on user engagement and conversion that has resulted in high online activities and increased online sales in current times in India. In addition, combined with changes such as social distancing and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic, digital disruption has largely impacted the old ways of communication both at the individual and organizational levels, ultimately resulting in prominent social change. While interacting in the virtual world, this change is more noticeable. Therefore, the second research objective is to examine if a satisfying experience during online shopping leads to repurchase intention. Design/methodology/approach Using primary data collected from consumers in a developing economy (India), we tested the theoretical model to further extend the theoretical debate in consumer research. Findings This study empirically tests and further establishes that deploying AI technologies have a positive relationship with user engagement and conversion. Further, conversion leads to satisfying user experience. Finally, the relationship between satisfying user experience and repurchase intention is also found to be significant. Originality/value The uniqueness of this study is that it tests few key relationships related to user engagement during this uncertain period (COVID-19 pandemic) and examines the underlying mechanism which leads to increase in online sales.

AB  - With the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak, much of the world has been experiencing isolation and quarantine. Digital technology, especially the internet, has become the essential method of communication when social distancing measures constrain physical contact. The global health crisis leads to a dynamically increasing reliance on digital equipment contributing to a posthuman world. The article will take Shanghai-based multimedia artist Lu Yang (1984-) as a representative example to explore an alternative posthumanism subjectivity in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Built theoretically on Kathrine Hayles and Rosi Braidotti's posthumanism concepts of virtual bodies, this article will examine how Lu Yang's work articulates the interactive relationships between humans and the material world to go beyond the conservative corporeality and contribute to a renewal of posthuman subjectivity. In Lu Yang's recent projects created during the pandemic, such as Doku x The 1975 'Playing on My Mind' (2020) and the live-streamed piece Delusional World specialIntscript the artist experiments with different strategies to break down social-cultural constraints and transcend established dualisms of gender binaries, life and death, human and non-human. With a close investiga-tion of Lu Yang's multidisciplinary artistic practices, this article intends to argue how a new subjectivity emerges in contemporary Chinese art and its roles in the current COVID-19 pandemic world.

T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION

KW  - EPIDEMIC
AB  - Drug overdose is a leading cause of injury and death in the United States, and opioids are among the most significant of causes. For people with opioid use disorders (OUDs), opioid stigma can lead to devastating consequences, including anxiety and depression. Still, mass media may stigmatize people with OUDs by ascribing stigmatizing labels (e.g., "opioid addict") and other stigma features to those individuals. However, it is unclear how these stigmatizing messages influence public perceptions of people with OUDs and public support for rehabilitation and Naloxone administration policies. The model of stigma communication (MSC) provides a framework for understanding these relationships. This study used the MSC in two online factorial experiments, the first among college undergraduates (N = 231) and the second among Amazon Mechanical Turk workers (N = 245), to examine how stigmatizing messages about people with OUDs influence stigma-related outcomes. Results reveal that opioid stigma messages influence different outcomes depending on the content of those messages. Classification messages with a stigmatizing mark (e.g., "Alex appears unkempt") and label (e.g., "opioid addict") led to greater perceptions of dangerousness and threat in both studies. High stigma classification messages also led to an increased desire for behavioral regulation and social distance in Study 2. Structural equation modeling in Study 1 also supported the applicability of the MSC in the opioid context. Implications for health communication theory development and practice are discussed.

AB  - In the present paper, we tested an objectification theory model including compliance with COVID-19 safety measures as an outcome. Safety measures recommended by governments and health organizations include monitoring one's body and interpersonal and social distance from others. We contend that the diffuse safety anxiety stemming from sexual and self-objectification encourages targets to broadly adopt behaviors that protect against body-based dangers, including COVID-19. Accordingly, safety anxiety should predict greater compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. U.S. residents (N = 501) were recruited online and completed measures of sexual objectification, self-objectification, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety compliance. Two-step mediation analyses revealed a positive indirect effect of sexual objectification on safety anxiety through internalization of observers' perspectives (self-objectification Factor 1); in turn, there was a positive indirect effect of internalized others on COVID-19 body-based safety compliance through safety anxiety. Moreover, women (vs. men) reported higher levels of sexual objectification, internalization of observers' perspectives, safety anxiety, appearance anxiety, and COVID-19 safety measure compliance. Not only is safety anxiety relevant to cautionary behaviors protective against sexual objectification threat, but it also predicts compliance with measures that reduce the risk of contracting COVID-19. Implications for objectification theory are discussed.

AB  - Digital health and technologies are essential to curbing the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic especially with shelter-in-place and social distancing orders. Epidemiologists and public health officials are tapping into frequently used technologies like wearables, digital devices, digital and social media data to detect and validate COVID-19 symptoms throughout the pandemic, especially during early stages when symptoms were evolving. In this article, we review how digital technologies and social media platforms can identify and inform our understanding of COVID-19 pandemic surveillance and recovery efforts. We analyze Reddit narrative posts and comments on r/covidlonghaulers to demonstrate how social media can be used to better understand COVID-19 pandemic. Using Reddit data, we highlight long haulers' patient journeys and shed light on potential consequences of their condition. We identified 21 themes, of which the following were significantly associated with valence: COVID-19 Symptoms (r = -0.037), medical advice (r = -0.030), medical system (r = -0.029), bodily processes (r = -0.020), questions (r = 0.024), physical activity (r = 0.033), self-differentials and negations (r = 0.040) and supplements (r = 0.025). Our brief literature review and analysis of r/covidlonghaulers narrative posts demonstrate the value of digital technologies and social media platforms as they act as modern avenues for public health, safety, and well-being.

AB  - COVID-19 created a substantial set of challenges for health communication practitioners in the process of planning, implementing, and evaluating entertainment-education (EE) campaigns. EE is a theory and evidence-based communication strategy that employs entertainment media for educational messaging. Here, we briefly review EE campaigns in response to previous health emergencies and present three cases of EE responses to the COVID-19 pandemic from leading global organizations (PCI Media, BBC Media Action, and Sesame Workshop). Responses ranged from adaptation and re-distribution of existing content to creating new content under social-distancing restrictions and utilizing transmedia. These cases demonstrate that EE initiatives responding to future pandemics may be well served by starting with existing infrastructure to quickly build capacity, support, and trust; working with partners to tailor programs to the local context; and continuing to focus on good storytelling while simultaneously considering evolving media formats and theory.

AB  - Purpose Emerging as a black swan event that stifled the global economy, COVID-19 is the first social media (SM) pandemic. In an unsocial age due to social distancing, SM relevance is intuitively magnified during a pandemic. This study aims to investigate the direct and moderating impact of Twitter on the Australian stock market during the COVID-19 info-pandemic. Design/methodology/approach As a natural experiment, a time-series regression measures the effect of the COVID-19 virus, proxied by the active cases and the marginal impact of SM user attention and sentiment on the Australian stock market. Findings Results show that SM user attention and sentiment to COVID-19 related fear topics are significant in explaining market returns and in predicting their volatility. It demonstrates that SM plays a role between COVID-19 and Australian stock market performance by amplifying the pandemic impact. Originality The study goes beyond a purely empirical investigation of the catalyst (i.e. the pandemic), thus contributing to current theoretical debates on the impact of SM on investor behaviour. Practical implications Policymakers and market participants could benefit from the empirical findings of this research in the case of analogous epidemics.

AB  - Despite the recognised importance of public acceptance for the success of industrial technologies, little is known about public attitudes towards chemical recycling. We address this gap by investigating the nature of public attitudes towards gasification. Gasification, a form of chemical recycling, can be used to convert carbonaceous wastes into feedstocks that can be used to produce a variety of products (e.g., plastics and transportation fuels) and is seen as a means of supporting the transition towards a circular carbon economy. Using an online questionnaire distributed to diverse samples of the public in Germany (n=318) and the UK(n=327), we assessed participants' attitudes towards gasification after exposure to a short informative video about either coal- or wastebased gasification. These countries were selected as both have advanced chemical recycling industries, but also evidence historic differences in public perceptions of carbon-related technologies. Results show that initial self-reported awareness and knowledge of gasification were very low, although improved by the video. Participants in both countries were generally positive about gasification, particularly waste-based gasification. Mediation analysis indicated that this preference was explained by a stronger positive and weaker negative affective response to the technology, as well as a stronger belief that waste-based gasification is a `green' technology option that was worthy of investment. Trust in developers was identified as a direct predictor of attitudes towards gasification. The study complements the ongoing techno-economic-ecological evaluations of gasification technologies and has implications for the development of public engagement and communication efforts.

AB  - The third-person effect (TPE) hypothesis states that people typically perceive the media messages to have greater influence on others than on themselves. Though this self-other perceptual bias has been shown to be robust across a variety of message contexts, past research has typically utilized Caucasian college student samples. The current study addresses this shortcoming in the literature by examining whether the TPE hypothesis holds for low-income, low-education, Spanish-speaking female adults with regard to the perceived effects of health news coverage. Our findings showed that most participants chose "equal to others" when estimating health news effects on themselves instead of "less than others" or "more than others." Results from ordinal logistic regression showed that the propensity toward TPE was related to optimistic bias and certain indicators of acculturation. Our findings suggest the need for future TPE research in Hispanic populations and further efforts to investigate TPE from an intercultural perspective.

AB  - Aim: Sexual health needs are one of the holistic care needs. Nurses need to help individuals identify and meet these needs. However, sometimes their perception of sexuality can affect their attitudes towards care. The aim of this study determine the effect of sexual self-schema and sexual embarrassment on attitudes and beliefs related to sexual health in nursing students. Background: The sexual self-schema, which emphasizes the cognitive aspect of sexuality, is defined as cognitive generalizations that a person does for her/his own sexuality. Sexual self-schemas are known to affect individuals' feelings, beliefs and attitudes towards sexuality. Those with a positive sexual self-schema experience less embarrassment and more positive attitudes towards sexuality. Those with a negative sexual self-schema experience more sexual embarrassment. Those who experience sexual embarrassment have an avoidance of sexual interaction and talking about sexual issues. Nurses and student nurses have embarrassed to talk about sexuality with their patients. It is thought that sexual attitudes and beliefs are effective on this situation. Design: This study was conducted in a cross-sectional descriptive type. Structural equality model was established to test the hypotheses of the research. In the model, the direct effects of the sexual self-schema and the sexual embarrassment on sexual attitudes and beliefs were examined. In addition, the mediating effect of sexual embarrassment between sexual schemas and sexual attitudes and beliefs is also included in the model. Methods: The study population was the students who attended to and conducted clinical practice at the second, third and fourth study year at a Faculty of Health Sciences. For data collection, the Introductory Information Form which questioned socio-demographic characteristics of individuals, Sexual Self-Schema Scale (SSS), Sexual Embarrassment Scale (SES), and Sexual Attitudes and Beliefs Survey for Sexual Health (SABS) were used. The data were collected online with voluntary participation. Results: Students' average scale scores were: SSS: 121.57 +/- 21.23, SES: 12.16 +/- 5.74 and SABS: 35.62 +/- 7.53. It was also found that sexual self-schemas and sexual embarrassment effected sexual attitudes and beliefs. Conclusion: It could be recommended that these results be tested with different studies, that the course content on sexual issues be reviewed be addressed in a broader context.

AB  - Sun protection among children is of utmost importance since sunburn in early life is a major risk factor for skin cancer development. Because parents play a vital role in enhancing sun safety among children, this study explored parental perceptions concerning sun exposure, sun protection behaviors, and sunburn in children. Additionally, the context in which children experience sunburn in order to assist the development, optimization, and targeting of sun safety interventions for parents is revealed. A qualitative study design, using a semi-structured interview guide addressing several themes (e.g., sun exposure, sun protection, and sunburn experiences), was used. Data were collected in the Netherlands in the fall of 2019. Parents were recruited via purposive sampling at schools, youth services centers, and social media. Execution, transcription, and coding of the interviews was done by two researchers, using the qualitative analyzing program Nvivo (interrater reliability of d = 0.84). In total, 26 interviews were performed (n = 17 mothers, n = 17 daughters, aged between 4 and 11 years). Parental perceptions and recall of their child's lifetime sunburn were frequent, even though all parents reported using at least one sun protection measure during sun exposure situations and parents seemed often unaware of their child's sunburn. Moreover, parents reported an overreliance on sunscreen, often failing to adequately protect their children's skin. Water-related activities, a lack of shade, and misconceptions regarding UV-index were often related to sunburn. In addition, unexpected sun exposure or longer exposure duration than initially planned were reported as challenging situations. The majority of parents had positive perceptions regarding tanned skin for both themselves as for children. This study provides directions for skin cancer prevention efforts targeted at both parents and their children. Since a lack of knowledge regarding sufficient sun protection measures and sunburn occurrence in various situations was reported, educational efforts are warranted. Additionally, focusing on clothing, shade-seeking, and adequate sunscreen use is recommended to increase children's sun safety. By intervening in the physical environment as well (e.g., providing shady areas), sun protection barriers can be reduced. Lastly, the general positive attitude toward tanned skin evident in this study is certainly worthy of attention in future interventions.

AB  - Background: Emergency contraception (EC) is a type of modern contraception which is indicated after unprotected sexual intercourse when regular contraception is not in use. The importance of EC is evident in preventing unintended pregnancies and its ill consequences like unintended child delivery or unsafe abortion, which are the most common causes of maternal mortality. Therefore, EC need to be available and used appropriately as a backup in case regular contraception is not used, misused or failed. Knowing that Ethiopia is one of the countries with highest maternal mortality rate, this study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of EC, and to further elucidate the relationship between these factors and some socioeconomic and demographic characteristics among female undergraduate students of Addis Ababa University (AAU). This information will contribute substantially to interventions intended to combat maternal mortality.
   Methods: A Cross-sectional quantitative study among 368 AAU undergraduate students was conducted using self-administered questionnaire. Study participants were selected by stratified random sampling. Data was entered and analyzed using SPSS Version 17. Results were presented using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation and logistic regression.
   Results: Among the total participants (n = 368), only 23.4% were sexually active. Majority (84.2%) had heard of EC; 32.3% had a positive attitude towards it. The main source of information reported by the respondents was Media (69.3%). Among those who were sexually active, about 42% had unprotected sexual intercourse. Among those who had unprotected sexual intercourse, 75% had ever used EC. Sexually active participants had significantly better attitude towards EC than sexually inactive participants (crude OR 0.33(0.15-0.71)); even after adjusting for possible confounders such as age, region, religion, ethnicity, marital status, department and family education and income (adj. OR 0.36(0.15-0.86)).
   Conclusions: The study showed high EC awareness and usage in contrast to other studies in the city, which could be due to the fact that university students are relatively in a better educational level. Therefore, it is highly recommended that interventions intended to combat maternal mortality through contraceptive usage need to be aware of such information specific to the target groups.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has placed stress on all National Health Systems (NHSs) worldwide. Recent studies on the disease have evaluated different variables, namely, quarantine models, mitigation efforts, damage to mental health, mortality of the population with chronic diseases, diagnosis, use of masks and social distancing, and mortality based on age. This study focused on the four NHSs recognized by the WHO. These systems are as follows: (1) The Beveridge model, (2) the Bismarck model, (3) the National Health Insurance (NHI) model, and (4) the "Out-of-Pocket " model. The study analyzes the response of the health systems to the pandemic by comparing the time in days required to double the number of disease-related deaths. The statistical analysis was limited to 56 countries representing 70% of the global population. Each country was grouped into the health system defined by the WHO. The study compared the median death toll DT, between health systems using Mood's median test method. The results show high variability of the temporal trends in each group; none of the health systems for the three analyzed periods maintain stable interquartile ranges (IQRs). Nevertheless, the results obtained show similar medians between the study groups. The COVID-19 pandemic saturates health systems regardless of their management structures, and the result measured with the time for doubling death rate variable is similar among the four NHSs.

AB  - Social discounting is when resource allocation decreases as social distance increases. Studies fitting different quantitative models to social discounting data have shown that a q-exponential function based on Tsallis' statistics best fits loss data, whereas a hyperbolic power function best fits gain data. However, a social discounting sign effect, where losses are discounted less than equivalent gains, has not been consistently found. This study fit four different quantitative social discounting models to gain and loss data for 40 United States (US) participants. We compared quantitative model fits to previous studies collected with Japanese and German participants to determine if (1) different quantitative social discounting models best fit loss and gain data, (2) US participants discounted less gains than Japanese participants, but not losses, and (3) US participants showed the sign effect. Results showed that the q-exponential function and the hyperbolic power function best fit median loss and gain data, respectively. There were no significant absolute differences between cultures for gains or losses, and US participants showed a robust sign effect. While most results for US participants were consistent with previous data, future cross-cultural social discounting studies are needed that manipulate sign as well as reward magnitude to determine best quantitative model fits. Social discounting results are also discussed in relation to their application to important health behaviors such as smoking and obesity.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic has affected everyday life to a significant degree. The transport sector is no exception, with mobility restrictions and social distancing affecting the operation of transport systems. This research attempts to examine the effect of the pandemic on the users of the public transport system of London through analyzing tweets before (2019) and during (2020) the outbreak. For the needs of the research, we initially assess the sentiment expressed by users using the SentiStrength tool. In total, almost 250,000 tweets were collected and analyzed, equally distributed between the two years. Afterward, by examining the word clouds of the tweets expressing negative sentiment and by applying the latent Dirichlet allocation method, we investigate the most prevalent topics in both analysis periods. Results indicate an increase in negative sentiment on dates when stricter restrictions against the pandemic were imposed. Furthermore, topic analysis results highlight that although users focused on the operational conditions of the public transport network during the pre-pandemic period, they tend to refer more to the effect of the pandemic on public transport during the outbreak. Additionally, according to correlations between ridership data and the frequency of pandemic-related terms, we found that during 2020, public transport demand was decreased while tweets with negative sentiment were being increased at the same time.

AB  - Negative public attitudes towards cancer may contribute to delays in presentation and present barriers to providing quality care. This study explored the views of cancer experts regarding the content of public health messages to improve public attitudes to cancer.
   Twenty-one healthcare professionals (HCPs) from a range of backgrounds took part took part in interviews. Interview transcripts were evaluated using thematic analysis focusing on the HCPs views of the prevailing negative stereotype of cancer patients and their recommendations for cancer awareness campaigns that could redress this view.
   HCPs contrasted the progress that had been made in the effective management of cancer with popular stereotypes and media representations. Information quality and supply were identified as barriers to changing the cancer stereotype held by the public.
   HCPs believe there is a need for more information about cancer in the public domain and it should focus on providing more balanced messages that include information about the improvements that have been achieved in preventing and treating cancer.

AB  - Increasingly, criminal justice policies have become bifurcated, categorizing and separating those who commit violent offenses from those who commit non-violent offenses. Such bifurcation is evident in recent reform efforts targeting the civic marginalization of those with a felony conviction and is also characteristic of public opinion toward those convicted of a felony criminal offense. Along those lines, this study examines how felon-jurors' conviction type shapes public sentiment. Utilizing originally collected survey data from 815 Californians, we examine support for felon-jurors generally and by crime type (violent and non-violent). Results reveal far less support for felon-jurors convicted of violent offenses than for felon-jurors generally and felon-jurors convicted of non-violent offenses. In addition, we find that crime-type concerns vary considerably across ideological groups, with conservatives (and to a lesser extent moderates) being significantly less likely than liberals to support jury service for those convicted of violent crimes. Findings align with prior literature suggesting that the public tends to harbor more punitive views toward those who commit violent offenses, and that these views are especially pronounced among conservatives. As the first survey investigating the intersecting dynamics of crime-type and felon-juror exclusion, this study expands our understanding of public attitudes toward those convicted of a felony criminal offense and their involvement in democratic processes.

AB  - Educating society concerning stigmatized conditions, such as the eating disorder Anorexia Nervosa (AN), aims to change attitudes that will encourage individuals with AN to recognize their condition and decide to seek help. Embodied Conversational Agents (ECAs) may play an important role in bringing about changes in attitude and behavior because they potentially allow tailored but anonymous, free and convenient access and can deliver the information in a conversational way that overcomes health literacy barriers. In this first study we compare the use of an ECA with a video to deliver two strategies (education and contact) to address stigma around the mental health condition of Anorexia Nervosa (AN). Our results with 245 participants show that both media (ECA and video) aided recognition of AN and produced significant changes in positive volitional stigma and negative volitional stigma but not in traditional stigma (desire for social distance), with some notable differences based on gender. Baseline data was used in place of a control group and the sample population was undergraduate Psychology students due to higher incidences of AN in this population. Further validation is needed involving a control group and testing on populations other than Psychology students. Nevertheless, these initial results encourage our future work to build tailored ECAs to challenge particular beliefs to support a wide range of educational interventions to change behaviors and improve decision-making relating to health and wellbeing.

AB  - Background Limitations in current Australian regulatory provisions may be identified by demonstrating the effect of different marketing methods on children's recognition and attitudes toward unhealthy food brands.
   Objective To investigate how exposure to different marketing techniques from television (TV) and online food advertising affects children's brand recall, recognition, and attitudinal responses toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the advertised products.
   Design Secondary analysis of data from a crossover experimental-control study.
   Participants/setting In all, 154 children (7 to 12 years) completed the study, conducted at four 6-day holiday camps from April 2016 to January 2017 in New South Wales, Australia. Children were assigned to a single-media (n=76) or multiple-media (n=78) condition.
   Intervention All children viewed 10 TV food advertisements in a cartoon on three occasions. For one of the brands, one set of children additionally played online "advergames" featuring the brand.
   Main outcome measures Children's recognition and attitudes toward brands and brand consumers and children's desire to eat the product were reported via a brand recognition and attitude survey pre- and postintervention. Marketing techniques were categorized.
   Statistical analysis Pre- and postintervention brand recognition and relationships between brand recognition and attitudes by media condition and desire to eat the product were examined using generalized linear mixed models and linear mixed models.
   Results There was a significant increase in the number of brands recognized post-exposure by children in both media groups (mean difference=3.8, P<0.0001). The majority of brands appealed to children. Children who reported wanting to eat the advertised products rated brands more positively than children who did not express a desire to eat the products. A larger proportion of children who played the advergames (36%) rated brand consumers as "cool" than children who viewed the TV advertisements only (19%) (P<0.001). Anti-adult themes, fun and humor, and parent pleasing were techniques unique to some of the most recognized and favored advertisements.
   Conclusions The marketing communications increased children's brand recognition and elicited positive attitudinal responses. These findings indicate a need for policy makers to consider additional regulations to protect children from the persuasive influence of unhealthy food advertising.

KW  - Remote learning
KW  - Student engagement
KW  - COVID-19

KW  - Virtual read-out
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: The need for social distancing has resulted in rapid restructuring of medical student education in radiology. While students traditionally spend time learning in the reading room, remote clinical learning requires material shared without direct teaching at the radiology workstation. Can remote clinical learning meet or exceed the educational value of the traditional in-person learning experience? Can student engagement be matched or exceeded in a remote learning environment?
   Materials and Methods: To replace the in-person reading room experience, a small-group learning session for medical students named Virtual Read-Out (VRO) was developed using teleconferencing software. After Institutional Review Board approval, two student groups were anonymously surveyed to assess differences in student engagement and perceived value between learning environments: "Conventional" students participating in the reading room (before the pandemic) and "Remote" students participating in VRO sessions. Students reported perceived frequency of a series of five-point Likert statements. Based on number of respondents, an independent t-test was performed to determine the significance of results between two groups.
   Results: Twenty-seven conventional and 41 remote students responded. Remote students reported modest but significantly higher frequency of active participation in reviewing radiology exams (p < 0.05). There was significantly lower frequency of reported boredom among Remote students (p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in perceived educational value between the two groups.
   Conclusion: Students report a high degree of teaching quality, clinical relevance, and educational value regardless of remote or in-person learning format. Remote clinical radiology education can be achieved with equal or greater student interaction and perceived value in fewer contact hours than conventional learning in the reading room.

AB  - As the effects of climate change begin to materialise across Pacific Island nations, many exposed communities are considering migrating away from their homelands. Migrants' resettlement experiences can depend upon their reception in the host nation. However, it is unclear whether justice-based obligations will influence host attitudes toward climate migrants. Using an online survey of 238 Aotearoa New Zealanders, we explore how beliefs about anthropogenic climate change, climate justice and global responsibility contribute to public attitudes towards climate migrants. Overall, people thought more positively of immigrants in general than of climate migrants. Through moderated mediation analyses, we observed that people with stronger belief in anthropogenic climate change were more positive towards climate migrants. This pattern was related to people's beliefs about climate justice and justice-based migration approaches. Findings suggest that host perceptions of climate migrants are connected to being aware of the ties between greenhouse gas emissions and migration. We outline anticipated challenges and potential opportunities for both migrant communities and the nations in which they seek refuge.

AB  - Background: Smoking is a plausible risk factor for COVID-19 progression and complications. Smoking cessation digital platforms transcend pandemic-driven social distancing and lockdown measures in terms of assisting smokers in their quit attempts.
   Objective: This study aims to examine trends in the number of visitors, followers, and subscribers on smoking cessation digital platforms from January to April 2020 and to compare these traffic data to those observed during the same 4-month period in 2019. The examination of prepandemic and postpandemic trends in smoking cessation digital platform traffic can reveal whether interest in smoking cessation among smokers is attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We obtained cross-sectional data from daily visitors on the SmokeFree website; the followers of six SmokeFree social media accounts; and subscribers to the SmokeFree SMS text messaging and mobile app interventions of the National Cancer Institute's SmokeFree.gov initiative platforms, which are publicly available to US smokers. Average daily percentage changes (ADPCs) were used to measure trends for the entire 2020 and 2019 study periods, whereas daily percentage changes (DPCs) were used to measure trends for each time segment of change within each 4-month period. Data analysis was conducted in May and June 2020.
   Results: The number of new daily visitors on the SmokeFree website (between days 39 and 44: DPC=18.79%; 95% CI 5.16% to 34.19%) and subscribers to the adult-focused interventions QuitGuide (between days 11 and 62: DPC=1.11%; 95% CI 0.80% to 1.43%) and SmokeFreeTXT (between days 11 and 89: DPC=0.23%; 95% CI 0.004% to 0.47%) increased, but this was followed by declines in traffic. No comparable peaks were observed in 2019. The number of new daily subscribers to quitSTART (ie, the teen-focused intervention) trended downward in 2020 (ADPC=-1.02%; 95% CI -1.88% to -0.15%), whereas the overall trend in the number of subscribers in 2019 was insignificant (P=.07). The number of SmokeFree social media account followers steadily increased by <0.1% over the 4-month study periods in 2019 and 2020.
   Conclusions: Peaks in traffic on the SmokeFree website and adult-focused intervention platforms in 2020 could be attributed to an increased interest in smoking cessation among smokers during the COVID-19 pandemic. Coordinated campaigns, especially those for adolescents, should emphasize the importance of smoking cessation as a preventive measure against SARS-CoV-2 infection and raise awareness of digital smoking cessation platforms to capitalize on smokers' heightened interest during the pandemic.

AB  - Introduction: Health professional education curricula in Nepal do not include interprofessional education (IPE). Though a previous study conducted in Nepal identified positive attitudes among medical and nursing students, so far there are no studies assessing the health professional students' readiness toward IPE. The aim of the study was to assess the readiness for IPE among medical and dental students.
   Methods: The present cross-sectional study explored the readiness of conveniently selected first-year medical and dental students towards IPE and compared readiness among subgroups of respondents. The readiness was assessed through an online survey using the standard Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) during June 2021. The nineteen questions in RIPLS were categorized under four domains: teamwork and collaboration (items 1-9), negative professional identity (items 10-12), positive professional identity (items 13-16), and roles and responsibilities (items 17-19). The individual statements were scored and assessed as per the study objectives. The scores were not normally distributed, so non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney U-test and Kruskal Wallis test) were used.
   Results: A total of 83 students (69 medical and 14 dental) students responded. The median total score was 75, IQR 6 with the maximum score being 95. The median (IQR) scores for the domains teamwork and collaboration were 38 (IQR 3), negative professional identity 11 (IQR 2), positive professional identity 16 (IQR 3), roles and responsibilities 10 (3). The scores were different between students aged 20 years and below = 37, and above 20 years = 38; (p =< 0.001) in the negative professional identity domain and the total score (p = 0.001). The scores were also different among those with and without previous learning exposure with other discipline students in the same class (p = 0.046). A high median score of 5 was achieved for 8 out of 19 statements in the questionnaire.
   Conclusion: The findings showed a high level of readiness for IPE among student respondents. Study findings can be considered as a positive factor for implementing IPE sessions.

AB  - Introduction A review of international and Australian school-based resources suggests that teaching of the ovulatory-menstrual (OM) cycle is predominantly couched in biology. A whole-person framework that integrates spiritual, intellectual, social and emotional dimensions with the physical changes of the OM cycle is needed to facilitate adolescent OM health literacy. This paper describes the protocol for a study that aims to develop and trial an intervention for adolescent girls aged 13-16 years that enhances positive attitudes towards OM health coupled with developing skills to monitor and self-report OM health. These skills aim to foster acceptance of the OM cycle as a 'vital sign' and facilitate confident communication of common OM disturbances (namely, dysmenorrhoea, abnormal uterine bleeding and premenstrual syndrome), which are known to impact school and social activities.
   Methods and analysis Phase I will comprise a Delphi panel of women's health specialists, public health professionals and curriculum consultants and focus groups with adolescent girls, teachers and school healthcare professionals. This will inform the development of an intervention to facilitate OM health literacy. The Delphi panel will also inform the development of a valid and reliable questionnaire to evaluate OM health literacy. Phase II will trial the intervention with a convenience sample of at least 175 adolescent girls from one single-sex school. The mixed-method evaluation of the intervention will include a pre-intervention and post-intervention questionnaire. One-on-one interviews with teachers and school healthcare professionals will expand the understanding of the barriers, enablers and suitability of implementation of the intervention in a school-based setting. Finally, focus groups with purposively selected trial participants will further refine the intervention.
   Ethics and dissemination The study findings will be disseminated through local community seminars, conferences, peer-review articles and media channels where appropriate. The Curtin University of Human Research Ethics Committee has approved this study (approval HRE2018-0101). This project is registered with the 'Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry'.

AB  - There is a growing awareness amongst Muslims to avoid all items containing non-Halal ingredients. This sentiment has now progressed into the field of various medications. It therefore, required a study to assess the knowledge, attitude and perception (KAP) relating to pharmaceuticals containing non-Halal ingredients among doctors working in various hospitals of Malaysia. This was a cross sectional study, carried out in January 2013 - February 2013 period, using a structured, self-administered questionnaires. Study settings included various government hospitals in Malaysia. Data were collected by distributing questionnaires through respective heads of the departments. Study was conducted on a sample of 243 participants. Inclusion criterion was a registered medical doctor working in a govemment hospital. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, percentage, median, inter quartile range) was applied to summarize the data, non-parametric tests were applied. chi(2) Test and Fisher's Exact Test were applied to assess the association between demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude and perception scores. Results revealed that the hospital doctors had a good and positive attitude and perception about Halal pharmaceuticals. Mean knowledge score out of maximum possible 9 score was 7.67 +/- 1.68. Mean attitude score out of maximum possible 45 score was 34.10 +/- 5.35 while mean perception score out of maximum possible 55 score was 45.73 +/- 5.44. Mean overall KAP score out of maximum possible 109 was 87.60 +/- 10.37. There was a significant, positive and weak correlation (0.20 - 0.29) between knowledge and attitude (r = 0.231, p < 0.001) as well as between knowledge and perception (r = 0.209, p = 0.001) while there was good correlation (0.5 -0.75) between attitude and perception (r = 0.588, p < 0.001). It is concluded from the results that the better knowledge the respondents have on Halal pharmaceuticals the better is their perception and attitude towards Halal pharmaceuticals.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a common cause for genital warts and cervical cancer. Developing countries in the Middle East such as Lebanon are traditionally considered to be conservative societies with low incidence of sexually transmitted infections. However, nowadays, there is an unexpected increase in the incidence of HPV infections among Middle Eastern females. Thus, the objective of this study is to assess the behavioral perceptions of HPV vaccination among female students attending an academic institution in Lebanon. This cross-sectional study invited 512 students to complete a self-administered questionnaire that assessed the knowledge, attitudes, and intentions towards HPV vaccination. Data analysis included the calculation of knowledge scores ranging from 0 to 100, attitude scores ranging from most positive (1) to most negative (5), and intention scores ranging from lowest intention (0) to highest intention (10). With a response rate of n = 215 (42%),36.5% never heard of the vaccine before, and only 16.5% were already HPV vaccinated. The median knowledge score of 52.7%+/- 11.71 reflects poor to moderate knowledge. Still, the median attitude score of 2.47 +/- 0.05 shows a general positive attitude towards HPV vaccination where most of the participants agreed that female college students in Lebanon have a good chance of contracting HPV (62.1%) and that all gynecologists should recommend the vaccine (76.0%). Students in graduate programs, health related majors, and those who are vaccinated had significantly higher knowledge scores compared with students in undergraduate programs, non-health related majors, and HPV non-vaccinated students, respectively. Finally, the survey helped in increasing the intention to obtain HPV vaccine as the intention score increased significantly from 5.24 +/- 0.27 before the students went through the survey to 6.98 +/- 0.22 after the students completed the survey. Our study highlights the importance of offering guidance to female college students about HPV and its vaccination in developing countries where the incidence of sexually transmitted infections is on the rise.

AB  - Why do some heterosexual people react in a negative manner when pondering or experiencing romantic or sexual overtures from persons of their same-sex, whereas other heterosexual people react more positively? To answer this question, this cross-sectional, correlational study examined individual difference predictors of heterosexual people's responses to romantic or sexual overtures from same-sex persons. Our sample comprised 306 men and 307 women, ages 18-35 years, who were recruited from Mechanical Turk and identified as cisgender and heterosexual. Our hypotheses were premised on the theoretical construct of reactive group distinctiveness. Specifically, we explored predictors of heterosexual individuals' negative perceptions of same-sex overtures. We found that more negative reactions to same-sex overtures were uniquely predicted by old-fashioned sexual prejudice, modern sexual prejudice, and desire to be perceived as gender conforming, via the mediators of social distance from same-sex sexual minority individuals and desire to be perceived as heterosexual. Gender moderated these relationships inconsistently. These findings indicate that two classes of individual differences-sexual prejudice and gender conforming reputation desire-are uniquely associated with heterosexual persons' reactions to overtures from same-sex persons. We explain how these findings evidence the process of reactive group distinctiveness.

AB  - We examined the interrelation between religiosity, anti-intellectualism, and political mistrust in predicting belief in conspiracy theories. Improving on previous psychological research on the link between religiosity and societal and political attitudes, we assessed the predictive power of religious self-categorization and the importance attached to one's own (non)religious worldview predicting belief in conspiracy theories separately. Applying quota sampling in a study in Australia (N = 515), the sample consisted of 48.9% believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as religious persons) and 51.1% non-believers (i.e., those who self-categorized as non-religious persons). The results showed that believers and non-believers did not differ in the belief in conspiracy theories. Unpacking this further though, we did find that the extent to which religious worldviews were endorsed predicted belief in conspiracy theories. Among believers, the importance attached to their religious worldview was directly associated with higher belief in conspiracy theories and this link was partly mediated by higher anti-intellectualism. Political trust, in turn, served as an inhibitor of the link between religiosity and conspiracy beliefs. Among non-believers, there was no direct association between the importance of non-religious worldview and belief in conspiracy theories. However, we found that higher trust in political institutions accounted for the negative association between non-religious worldview and lower belief in conspiracy theories. The results underline the importance of distinguishing religiosity as a self-categorization and religiosity as a worldview. We find that it is not the self-categorization as religious, but the extent to which religious worldviews are endorsed that could predict people's beliefs in conspiracy theories.

AB  - ObjectiveIn this article, we investigate the third-person effect within the context of the decision by the New Orleans Times-Picayune in September 2012 to end daily print circulation in favor of a three-day-per-week publication schedule and online news offerings.
   MethodsWe utilize original survey data based on 1,043 telephone interviews with respondents living in the greater New Orleans area, including 530 landline respondents selected via random digit dialing and 513 respondents randomly selected from available cellular telephone blocks.
   ResultsWe find evidence of a third-person effect on judgments about changes at The Times-Picayune. New Orleans area residents worry that the decline of information will negatively affect the ability of others to keep up with the news. We also show that the effects are contingent upon physical location. The greater the distance from New Orleans, the more pronounced concerns are about the effect of the loss of this daily information source on others in the community.
   ConclusionsTo date, third-person effects have generally been studied within the context of enduring and established forms of communication, especially those viewed as having potential negative effectspolitically biased messages, other forms of propaganda, and communication that could harm reputations. In this article, we extend this work to show third-person effects persist within the context of declining news coverage.

AB  - Background: Although electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a safe and effective treatment modality with a long history of use in psychiatry, it remains controversial owing to misconceptions and negative attitudes among the public and medical profession. The aim of this study was to explore the state of knowledge and attitudes towards ECT among a sample of South African medical students.
   Method: Prior to their theoretical psychiatry module, 131 second-year medical students responded to an anonymous online survey designed to assess the source and extent of their ECT knowledge as well as their attitude towards ECT and psychiatry in general.
   Results: The Internet (46.6%) and TV and/or movies (30.5%) were the principal sources of knowledge of ECT while 'professional publication' was the least common (0%). The students' attitudes towards psychiatry were generally positive and nearly one-third (29.8%) would consider specialising in the field. Overall, perception towards ECT was mixed, with many respondents approving of its use albeit only as a last resort. Notably, low ECT knowledge scores were associated with more negative attitudes towards this treatment modality and a lower perception of psychiatry as a medical speciality.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that for these students, media is the main source of ECT knowledge. While they are generally knowledgeable about ECT, they still harbour some misconceptions and negative attitudes about the treatment. Knowledge appears able to amend these attitudes, thus underlining the importance of integrating accurate information about ECT into the preclinical medical curriculum rather than leaving it to mass media to forge warped perceptions and attitudes for these future clinicians.

AB  - The current recommendation for reducing person-to-person Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) transmission is social distancing, including remote work and school, and home confinement. However, confinement may cause negative feelings, such as frustration, anger, boredom, and stress, in quarantined people. Furthermore, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity behaviors are commonly linked to home confinement, leading to weight gain, metabolic disorders, smoking, and exacerbated alcohol consumption. As a result, these unhealthy behaviors are typically linked to vascular endothelium damage (endothelial dysfunction), which is a first step for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Given that CVD is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, attenuating the progression of endothelial dysfunction is very important for the control of CVD. Consuming vegetable rich in nitrate, such as beetroots, may be an effective way to prevent endothelial dysfunction. Several emerging studies have recommended beetroot juice in order to improve endothelial function in hypertensive, hypercholesterolemic individuals, as well as in those with CVD risk factors. Therefore, nitrate-rich vegetable consumption, such as beetroot, should be encouraged to be included in the diet during confinement from COVID-19 outbreaks in order to alleviate the potential negative effect of home confinement on cardiovascular health.

AB  - Introduction The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) systems into medical imaging is advancing the practice and patient care. It is thought to further revolutionise the entire field in the near future. This study explored Ghanaian radiographers' perspectives on the integration of AI into medical imaging.
   Methods A cross-sectional online survey of registered Ghanaian radiographers was conducted within a 3-month period (February-April, 2020). The survey sought information relating to demography, general perspectives on AI and implementation issues. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analyses.
   Results A response rate of 64.5% (151/234) was achieved. Majority of the respondents (n = 122, 80.8%) agreed that AI technology is the future of medical imaging. A good number of them (n = 131, 87.4%) indicated that AI would have an overall positive impact on medical imaging practice. However, some expressed fears about AI-related errors (n = 126, 83.4%), while others expressed concerns relating to job security (n = 35, 23.2%). High equipment cost, lack of knowledge and fear of cyber threats were identified as some factors hindering AI implementation in Ghana.
   Conclusions The radiographers who responded to this survey demonstrated a positive attitude towards the integration of AI into medical imaging. However, there were concerns about AI-related errors, job displacement and salary reduction which need to be addressed. Lack of knowledge, high equipment cost and cyber threats could impede the implementation of AI in medical imaging in Ghana. These findings are likely comparable to most low resource countries and we suggest more education to promote credibility of AI in practice.

AB  - Background: The attachment theory suggests that adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) can have an effect on how individuals perceive other people's attitude towards them. ACEs have also been associated with adult depression. We hypothesised that ACEs associate with perceived negative attitude of others (AoO) and depressive symptoms (DEPS), and that these associations differ between the genders.
   Methods: Altogether, 692 participants drawn from the general population completed the Trauma and Distress Scale, as a measurement of ACE and its domains: emotional abuse (EmoAb), physical abuse (PhyAb), sexual abuse (SexAb), emotional neglect (EmoNeg) and physical neglect (PhyNeg); a visual analog scale with the question: "What kind of attitude do other people take towards you?", and the self-report scale DEPS on depressive symptoms. Results: ACEs, AoO and DEPS correlated strongly with each other. In path analyses, ACE total and all its domains associated directly and indirectly, via DEPS, to negative AoO in the whole sample, and in females separately. ACE total, EmoAb, PhyAb, EmoNeg and PhyNeg associated directly and indirectly, via AoO, to DEPS in the whole sample and in both genders separately. EmoNeg, in all, and EmoAB, in males, had specific associations both with negative AoO and DEPS. Mediation effect via AoO was greater than via DEPS.
   Conclusions: ACEs have a direct and indirect, via depression, negative effect on how adult individuals perceive other people's attitude towards themselves. Additionally, negative AoO mediates the effects of ACEs on depression. Childhood EmoNeg associates specifically with negative AoO and DEPS in adulthood. (c) 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to conceptualise and empirically examine how blog users engage with the sponsored posts on consumer-generated content, specifically blogs.
   Design/methodology/approach This paper empirically tested the proposed hypotheses using the structural equation modelling using a sample of 399 blog users.
   Findings The need for cognition, perceived interactivity and perceived credibility of blogs has been found to directly influence consumers' attitude towards blogs. Innovativeness has been found to have a weak negative link with the attitude towards blogs. Blog users were more favourable towards the sponsored posts if the blogs were more interactive. Attitude towards blogs has been found to mediate the relationship between users' perceived interactivity and their avoidance of the sponsored posts and also between perceived credibility and avoidance of the sponsored posts on blogs. The most significant finding of this study is that the positive attitude towards a blog results in a higher avoidance of the sponsored posts.
   Research limitations/implications This study focuses on the sponsored posts on blogs. It does not look at other forms of advertising on blogs such as banner ads, or other forms of consumer-generated content.
   Practical implications Marketers and bloggers should carefully consider the suitability of the sponsored posts on blogs as they risk alienating the regular users of the blogs. Sponsored posts which are perceived as honest reviews (as opposed to paid advertorials) might be more acceptable to blog users.
   Social implications This study highlights the importance of credibility of bloggers to blog users. There are some serious ethical issues related to the sponsored posts which have not been discussed here but need to be examined further.
   Originality/value This study represents one of the first attempts to conceptualise and empirically examine how blog users engage with customer-generated advertising - sponsored posts. It contributes to marketing literature by enhancing the understanding of how consumers perceive consumer-generated content and more specifically, with regard to consumer attitudes towards online consumer-generated advertising. This study enhances the theoretical and empirical knowledge on how consumers react to advertisements on social media, with important suggestions for future research and implications for practitioners.

AB  - How we listen to music and respond to its media and contexts has changed significantly since the invention of sound recording. Today's musicians have countless opportunities to listen to others' interpretations given the vast availability of past and contemporary repertories through the global reach of recordings. This study investigated the extent to which the growing archive of recordings provides a valuable resource for performers' creativity. Although musical performance is a particularly porous domain for influence through either deliberate or spontaneous assimilation of expressive variation from other aural sources, little empirical research exists on influence in performance and specifically on the influence of recordings. Qualitative data were obtained via an online questionnaire to identify how and in what ways the use and influence of recordings have changed over the course of classical performers' training or professional careers. Respondents' (N = 130) comments were analysed using a thematic inductive approach. The emerging themes reveal an overall increased level of use of recordings now relative to the past, a largely positive contribution of recordings in shaping musical development, including the role of recordings in self-regulated learning, a largely positive attitude to the influence of others' interpretations, a means of developing expressions of self-identity in relation to others and a route to acquiring a more critical and discerning mode of listening to recordings. Implications for music education are discussed in terms of how listening to recordings, in both formal and informal learning contexts, could support advanced musicians' learning through trial and error, enhance creative insight, strengthen self-efficacy, foster metacognitive skills and nurture individuality.

AB  - Human-carnivore interactions are on the rise globally, and often take the form of damage to property and livelihoods, human injuries or fatalities, and retaliatory killing of carnivores. Potential conflict situations are rarely recognized early, and circumstances are often complicated by mismatches between people's perceptions and reality. Following media reports of sloth bear Melursus ursinus attacks on people, we evaluated the situation in a tourism-dominated town in southern Rajasthan, India. Using a spatially explicit survey design, we interviewed 241 residents of Mount Abu to record recent bear sightings and attacks, prevailing attitudes towards bears, and respondents' understanding of bear ecology. We obtained independent secondary information on tourism levels and bear attacks to verify information received during interviews. We used recursive partitioning to identify factors that explained residents' attitudes towards sloth bears, and multi-model inference to identify land cover and other features that influenced bear presence. Respondents perceived increasing bear presence and attacks, and secondary data supported these perceptions. Respondents' insights regarding bear ecology, particularly bears being attracted by rubbish bins, were supported by multi-model inferences. Mount Abu's residents, especially women and younger men, had negative attitudes towards bears, independent of their education level or occupation. Our findings suggest a novel situation in Mount Abu, with sloth bears habitually accessing rubbish bins, which leads to increased bear-human interactions and negative attitudes among residents. We recommend immediate action focusing on waste management, which could help prevent an escalation of the situation and reduce attacks by bears that could otherwise lead to retaliatory killings.

AB  - Management of a pandemic engages multiple sites where previously settled or uncontroversial understandings may be transformed by global and domestic forces. This article examines the iconography of social distancing implicated in the discourses of 'quarantine' and 'risk control' in public health, and the tension between scientific and popular media readings of the contours of acceptable public health models for managing particular pandemics. The role of culture in shaping and reshaping borders at an operational level is explored as a basis for explaining the apparent paradoxes in the way historic and contemporary pandemics are actually managed, and the different ways particular pandemics are framed. The article argues that a rational-scientific approach to pandemic management is insufficient and that a more nuanced socio-political blend of science, culture and public perceptions offers a more substantial basis for public health policy.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Recently, human impacts on marine ecosystems have intensified as the population and pressures increase. Human-originated pollutants of all kinds have impacted the oceans and the marine ecosystems. Oil spills, sewage, plastics, chemicals, garbage, carbon dioxide, and overfishing are the most challenging issues. It is known that school students are the future generation; they receive their information at school. Therefore, it is essential to assess students' knowledge and awareness regarding ocean related issues.
   Methodology: This study investigated ocean literacy (OL) of primary school students at international schools in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, based on the seven principles of ocean literacy. Resources from which children get information about the oceans was also investigated. Finally, the study investigated the attitudes of primary school students towards learning oceanography, protecting the oceans, and the relationship between humans and the environment. A questionnaire had been adapted from the Survey of Ocean Literacy and Experience (SOLE) and the Survey of Ocean Stewardship (SOS). The SOLE and SOS surveys had been developed originally by Greely (2008). However, due to the grade level of students and time issues, the number of questionnaire items were reduced and simplified. The questionnaire was distributed in two separate sessions. Students from three international schools, boys' sections, received the survey. 120 students answered the SOLE, and 102 students answered the SOS.
   Findings: Results indicated a rather moderate level of ocean literacy of participants with a mean score of 12.56 (SD=5.18) concerning the SOLE, and a mean score of 3.30 (SD=1.12) concerning the SOS. As for the resource of information, results indicated the education program to be the students' main source of education, television channels came second.
   Contributions: Students of Riyadh international primary schools showed a positive attitude toward ocean stewardship. The study can help policy makers, curriculum developers and textbook authors to better understand the level of ocean literacy among students and take decisions to develop school curricula especially in the efforts to align with UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development (2021-2030). It also corresponds to the 2020-2030 vision in Saudi Arabia.

TI  - Woman-centered research on access to safe abortion services and implications for behavioral change communication interventions: a cross-sectional study of women in Bihar and Jharkhand, India
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - MEDICAL-CARE
AB  - Background: Unsafe abortion in India leads to significant morbidity and mortality. Abortion has been legal in India since 1971, and the availability of safe abortion services has increased. However, service availability has not led to a significant reduction in unsafe abortion. This study aimed to understand the gap between safe abortion availability and use of services in Bihar and Jharkhand, India by examining accessibility from the perspective of rural, Indian women.
   Methods: Two-stage stratified random sampling was used to identify and enroll 1411 married women of reproductive age in four rural districts in Bihar and Jharkhand, India. Data were collected on women's socio-demographic characteristics; exposure to mass media and other information sources; and abortion-related knowledge, perceptions and practices. Multiple linear regression models were used to explore the association between knowledge and perceptions about abortion.
   Results: Most women were poor, had never attended school, and had limited exposure to mass media. Instead, they relied on community health workers, family and friends for health information. Women who had knowledge about abortion, such as knowing an abortion method, were more likely to perceive that services are available (beta = 0.079; p < 0.05) and have positive attitudes toward abortion (beta = 0.070; p < 0.05). In addition, women who reported exposure to abortion messages were more likely to have favorable attitudes toward abortion (beta = 0.182; p < 0.05).
   Conclusions: Behavior change communication (BCC) interventions, which address negative perceptions by improving community knowledge about abortion and support local availability of safe abortion services, are needed to increase enabling resources for women and improve potential access to services. Implementing BCC interventions is challenging in settings such as Bihar and Jharkhand where women may be difficult to reach directly, but interventions can target individuals in the community to transfer information to the women who need this information most. Interpersonal approaches that engage community leaders and influencers may also counteract negative social norms regarding abortion and associated stigma. Collaborative actions of government, NGOs and private partners should capitalize on this potential power of communities to reduce the impact of unsafe abortion on rural women.

AB  - Background: Wrong beliefs about risky actions such as sunbathing and tanning are common due to media advertisements or general lack of knowledge. This work has focused on the knowledge and attitude of a group of citizens in Tehran, Iran and the protective actions they take regarding undesirable effects of the sun.
   Methods: A descriptive-analytic cross-sectional study has been conducted on 400 randomly selected individuals from the citizens of Shahrak-E-Gharb, an area in northwest Tehran. A questionnaire comprising 24 questions including demographic information, individuals' knowledge about sun exposure, and their opinions and behaviors on protective actions towards solar radiation were used to assess study objectives. Crude and adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for socio-demographic factors were calculated through univariate and multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: The majority of participants had good knowledge about sun protective behaviors. Knowledge about sun exposure duration and tanning was higher among women and those with higher education. As for attitude, only 15% were concerned about skin cancer and 61.8% thought skin cancer can be prevented by sun protection. Higher education was associated with a more positive attitude towards tanning. Among respondents, 41% had suitable clothing to protect themselves against sun burn and only 32% used sunscreen most of the time. University graduates had significantly better practice towards using sunscreen cream compared to high school graduates.
   Conclusion: Although our study sample possessed good knowledge towards sun protection, their attitude and practices were unsatisfactory. Thereby, they need to be informed and educated as how to be safely protected against excessive sun exposure.

AB  - Objectives. To investigate dental beliefs and attitudes of a diverse group of parents from their children when they were aged 3 and 5 years old and to identify possible mediators for a group composed of the parents with the most negative dental attitudes. Material and methods. Data were collected by parental questionnaire when the children were aged 3 years in 2002 and again 2 years later. The inclusion criteria were children with mothers from Norway (N group) or non-Western countries (IM, group). Questionnaires were extensive and had previously been used in a multicenter study. Three composite attitudinal variables relating to oral hygiene, diet and parental indulgence were calculated and an "attitudinal risk group" identified. The association between those variables and the assignment to the group,vas measured by odds ratio (bivariate and multiple logistic regression). Results. The N parents' dental attitudes were significantly more positive in 2004 when their children were 5 years old than when they were 3 years old (p < 0.0001), but this was not the case among immigrant parents. "Education" and "Immigrant status" [odds ratio (OR) 3.3, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.6-7.0; and OR 2.8, Cl 1.1-7.3, respectively] were significantly associated with the defined "attitudinal risk group". Conclusions. Only dental attitudes among N parents were significantly more positive in 2004 than in 2002. Not having higher education and being of non-Western background were associated with belonging to the "attitudinal risk group". Culturally tailored programs of dental health education are needed to promote more positive attitudes to oral health.

AB  - A range of studies suggest that singing activities with young children can have a beneficial impact on other aspects of their development. However, there is little research examining the relationship between young children's singing and their developing social identity. In the current study, data were captured of young children's singing and social identity as part of a larger-scale, longitudinal evaluation of the nationwide Sing Up programme in England. Participants were 720 children aged 5-8 years old. The assessment of young children's singing ability employed an established measure and was undertaken individually. With adult support, the children were also asked to complete a simple questionnaire that focused on selected aspects of their social identity, both in general terms and also related to singing. Key themes embraced their attitudes to singing (at home, in school and in informal settings), singer identity (emotional engagement with singing and self-concept), and perceptions of self (self-efficacy, self-esteem, social integration). Comparative data were collected from young children of a similar age outside the programme. Findings suggested that the programme had a positive impact on children's singing ability, both overall and including the youngest children. The data analyses suggest that children could be identified as either "pupils with positive singing identity" or "pupils with less positive, or still developing singing identity." Overall, pupils with a more positive singer identity-irrespective of Sing Up-related experience-tended to report more positive attitudes toward singing at school and other settings, had higher perceived levels of self-esteem and social integration, as well as more positive evaluations of their singing ability. Furthermore, the research suggests that successful participation in high-quality singing activities is likely to have a positive impact on young children's singing ability and, by implication, such positive singing development will also be associated with aspects of self that are related to contexualised singer identity and their sense of social inclusion.

AB  - The article deals with the issue of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in the awareness of economics students as future managers responsible for the implementation of this idea in enterprises. Due to the fact that CSR is a source of many innovations today, the aim of the research was to learn about the awareness and opinions of students about CSR on such issues as: reasons for implementation, main activities, impact on profitability, and the need to explore and assess the usefulness of this knowledge. The research was conducted in 2019 among students from Poland and Georgia (as countries at various stages of advancement in the market economy). The results of the research were statistically analyzed in terms of obtaining answers to the hypotheses and research questions, checking the significance of differences in the answers due to nationality, and additionally, gender (chi-square test and test for two proportions). The primary contribution of this study is an exploration of the views of students on various issues of CSR and sustainability. The results showed that-according to students-ethical values, increased consumer awareness, and the desire to gain a competitive advantage are the most common reasons for the implementation of the CSR concept by companies. The vast majority of respondents indicated the need to enrich the knowledge of business ethics as an important aspect shaping the attitudes of employers and employees. The positive attitude of students regarding the impact of CSR on the company's profitability was confirmed, although the authors expected more unambiguous results. Differences were also distinguished between the responses of students from both countries on some issues, such as: opinions on the developing ethical sensitivity, the need for the credibility of the EU economic policy, ecology and relations with the local community, as well as relations with the closest stakeholders of companies. The results of the conducted research suggest the need for intense activity in the field of public awareness and the requirement of personnel training for the skilful implementation of CSR principles in enterprises.

AB  - BackgroundSocial media platform is one way to share online information regarding pandemic prevention. However, there is no study regarding the attitude of health professionals toward social media use for the COVID-19-related information. This study aimed to assess health professionals' attitudes toward using social media for COVID-19-related information. MethodsAn institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 355 health professionals in Bahir Dar city public health centers, Northwest Ethiopia. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. The data were entered by EPI-data version 4.6 and analyzed using SPSS version 23 software. Descriptive statistics, bivariable, and multivariable logistic regression analysis were used to describe respondents' attitudes toward using social media for COVID-19 information and identify associated factors. An adjusted odds ratio (OR) and a p-value with a 95% CI were calculated to measure the strength of the association and assess statistical significance. ResultOut of 341 participants, about 73% of the participants had a good attitude toward the use of social media for COVID-19 information. Age < 24 [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 3.74, 95% CI: (1.53-9.13)] and age group 25-34 years [AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: (1.04-4.86)], computer training [AOR = 2.03, 95% CI: (1.03-4.00)], usefulness of social media [AOR = 3.25, 95% CI: (1.58-6.67)], and trustworthiness [AOR = 3.57, 95% CI: (1.93-6.60)] were enabling factors for attitude toward the use of social media for COVID-19 related information. ConclusionHealth professionals had a moderate attitude toward using social media for accessing COVID-19-related information. This implies that after considering positive attitude predictors, such as providing basic computer training, emphasizing the usefulness of social media, and building trusted social media pages, social media platforms can be used as a source of COVID-19-related information for health professionals.

AB  - Background: Historically, acute otitis media (AOM) had been the most common complaint of parents bringing preschool age children to physicians for urgent assessment and treatment. In 2013 and 2016 the clinical guidelines related to the treatment of acute otitis media (AOM) without complications, and guidelines related to otitis media with effusion, were updated. Adoption of these guidelines by pediatricians is critical. As the issue is not only increased costs of care, but also contributing to antibiotic resistance strains of bacteria as well as negative outcomes that can include permanent or temporary hearing loss, impacts on the development, and risks of infection.
   Aims: The aim of the study was to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of Saudi pediatricians about the clinical guidelines regarding the diagnosis and management of acute otitis media and otitis media with effusion in pediatric medicine. The objective was to develop an understanding of potential areas of strength and weakness in relation continuous improvement of health care through better patient safety and quality of care.
   Methods: This quantitative, cross-sectional design tested and captured attitudes and knowledge using two separately administered questionnaires. The questionnaires included demographic questions, and statements that participants responded to on a five-point Likert scale to indicate their level of agreement. The sample was composed of 358 Saudi pediatricians from 32 hospitals in 13 cities in Saudi Arabia.
   Results: The results of this study included a wide variation of attitudes with fairly even distribution between negative and positive attitudes towards clinical guidelines, along with a knowledge score of the clinical guidelines that was below 50% in every category of role, gender and facility.
   Conclusion: our study revealed low knowledge of Saudi pediatricians about the guidelines for diagnosis and management of acute otitis media and detected that their opinions vary widely regarding the importance of guidelines. The general attitude reflects a lack of interest and belief in the use of evidence-based guidelines.

AB  - Over one billion people worldwide were under social isolation restrictions between April and May 2020. While humans felt the weight of being isolated under lockdown, nonhuman animals accustomed to continuous human connection had minimized exposure at different animal tourism sites and institutions - such as zoos and aquariums. One interesting case comes from garden eels, which according to their caretakers, were particularly susceptible to isolation from humans and required immediate action: Facetime calls with humans. In this research insight, I explore the new technologically mediated humanimal communication practice between humans and garden eels at the Sumida Aquarium in Tokyo, Japan. "Remembering humans" is explored as a humanature cultural discourse that emerged from humanity's social distancing phenomena, seemingly bridging humanature connection amidst the multitude of discourses that removed humanity from nature. This discourse also functions within a form of tourist gaze in tourism institutions. Even though small in scope, this cultural discourse analysis brings to surface one way we have discursively engaged with our solitude during quarantine: mirroring it on more-than-human animals' experiences. Further investigations about this, and other humanature emerging communication practices, are needed to better understand how the social isolation phenomena impacted communication meanings about humanature relations.

AB  - Objectives: To clarify the implementation status of personal protective measures by ordinary citizens in Japan during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on internet-based survey. A total of 2400 people (50% male: 20-79 years) were selected between February 25 and 27, 2020, from registrants of an Internet research company, to complete a questionnaire. Participants were asked to indicate how often they implemented the following five personal protective measures recommended by the World Health Organization (hand hygiene, social distancing measures, avoiding touching the eyes, nose and mouth, respiratory etiquette, and self-isolation). In addition, the participants responded to questions regarding the daily frequency of hand hygiene events.
   Results: The prevalence of the five personal protective measures ranged from 59.8% to 83.8%, with the lowest being avoiding touching the eyes, nose, and mouth. In total, 34.7% implemented all personal protective measures. The median daily hand hygiene events were 5 per day (25th percentile, 75th percentile: 3,8).
   Conclusions: The protective measures implemented by ordinary citizens are insufficient and further public awareness activities are required. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of International Society for Infectious Diseases.

AB  - CSI: Crime Scene Investigation ((2002-2015) CBS, Alliance Atlantis Communications, CBS Paramount Network Television, Jerry Bruckheimer Television.) marks a paradigm shift in the post-9/11 forensic visual culture, ostensibly presenting physical evidence as a system of surveillance and control; the team of criminalists as ideologically complicit with state power; and high-tech forensic gadgetry as infallible and conducive to the culprit. In the melodramatic narrative strands, sophisticated plotlines, and spectacular performances of forensic science, CSI heavily rests on a novel and meticulously elaborated aesthetics that redefines the conception of gaze and camera shot in the weaving of episodes across the different seasons. A more nuanced comprehension of CSI's visual forensic discourse is, therefore, necessitated to fully understand the cultural significance of these offerings. To this end, extending the work of Kress and Van Leuween on the systems of gaze and social distance in light of the Foucauldian and post-panoptic views on power and control, the article introduces fine-grained taxonomies of the forensic gaze and camera shot as fundamental aesthetics closely tied to post-9/11 extensive surveillance discourse. Resituating CSI in the broader context of the post-panopticon, the study argues that the drama series operates in a hybrid surveillance mode that surpasses conventional readings of panopticism, straddling the line between the physical and the digital in the contemporary age.

AB  - Developing positive attitudes by upgrading the environmental literacy level is very important to protect nature from anthropogenic pressures. This study evaluates existing knowledge, awareness, attitude and behavior, perceived issues, and solutions of undergraduates on major environmental issues of two national universities with different teaching methods of the Open University of Sri Lanka (OUSL: open distance learning) and the University of Peradeniya (UP: conventional). A questionnaire survey (29 structured and 04 open-ended items) was adapted with 800 undergraduates of engineering, science, management, law, and arts/ social sciences disciplines. We computerized descriptive statistics, such as frequency and cross-tabulation, and mean comparison using the SPSS software. The results showed that there was no significant difference (p > 0.05) of existing environmental knowledge in undergraduates of two universities. However, there was a significant difference in undergraduates' family income (F = 5.387, p < 0.001) and family educational background (p < 0.05) with environmental knowledge. School education played a main role in building environmental concepts for undergraduates. The environmental attitude and behavior of both student groups showed a fairly favorable status. The majority of respondents suggested that TV and radio were the most effective media for environmental awareness. Undergraduates of the OUSL and UP were more interested in "tree planting"/ "gardening" (22.7%) and "hiking (mountain climbing)" (25.7%), respectively. Both OUSL and UP groups recognized "global warming" as the major global environmental issue and air pollution as the local issue. This study highlights the importance of building environmental knowledge among undergraduates, mainly on global and local environmental issues, to improve sustainable environment management.

AB  - Southern right whale-kelp gull biological interaction has been the focus of debates in Peninsula Valdes, Argentina, not only within the academia but also in the public domain. This interaction is perceived as an important and imminent threat to whale conservation and thus to the whale watching activity. When stakeholders complain, sometimes the management actions are not necessarily based on reality itself, but how reality is perceived. The contrasting perceptions of the biological interaction reflect differences in the frames that shape how individuals and institutions conceptualize the relevant aspects of this issue. This study compares the relative impact of attribute frames on tourists' attitudes and perceptions concerning interaction effects on whales, examining how frames could be used to shape decision strategies for management. Results from 100 interviews revealed that gender and attribute frames affected tourists' perception of interaction effect and damage. Greater perception of damage and more negative effects perception were found among women who had received the negative frame. Television, radio and whale watching at Puerto Piramide are the main sources from which the "kelp gulls produce damage to whales" information is gathered (57.15%). Tourists are less interested in gulls than in whales and present a positive attitude towards gulls. These results offer new insights for resource managers and policymakers and highlight the need of the use of the frame theory in delivering information as a part of any policy. The use of positive frame adjusting exaggerated perceptions of the interaction, is recommended to promote environmental education and awareness.

TI  - #Caremongering: A community-led social movement to address health and social needs during COVID-19
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   To combat social distancing and stay-at-home restrictions due to COVID-19, Canadian communities began a Facebook social media movement, #Caremongering, to support vulnerable individuals in their communities. Little research has examined the spread and use of #Caremongering to address community health and social needs.
   Objectives
   We examined the rate at which #Caremongering grew across Canada, the main ways the groups were used, and differences in use by membership size and activity.
   Methods
   We searched Facebook Groups using the term "Caremongering" combined with the names of the largest population centres in every province and territory in Canada. We extracted available Facebook analytics on all the groups found, restricted to public groups that operated in English. We further conducted a content analysis of themes from postings in 30 groups using purposive sampling. Posted content was qualitatively analyzed to determine consistent themes across the groups and between those with smaller and larger member numbers.
   Results
   The search of Facebook groups across 185 cities yielded 130 unique groups, including groups from all 13 provinces and territories in Canada. Total membership across all groups as of May 4, 2020 was 194,879. The vast majority were formed within days of the global pandemic announcement, two months prior. There were four major themes identified: personal protective equipment, offer, need, and information. Few differences were found between how large and small groups were being used.
   Conclusions
   The #Caremongering Facebook groups spread across the entire nation in a matter of days, engaging hundreds of thousands of Canadians. Social media appears to be a useful tool for spreading community-led solutions to address health and social needs.

AB  - In the era of COVID-19, travel decisions are influenced by social norms, which is a deciding factor between one's perception of risk and their travel intention. Moreover, serious safety measures, such as increased aircraft cleaning, social distancing during the boarding process, and the use of face masks are critical factors that influence passengers' trust in air travel. This study examines the direct effects of safety and preventive measures and social norms on passengers' trust in travelling with airlines. A total of 210 responses were obtained online. Multiple regression analysis was used to test the study hypotheses. Based on the result, social norms are the most influential predictors of passengers' trust, followed by safety and preventive measures. Furthermore, the study suggests that media coverage and social circle influence can be critical elements in transferring information to passengers, influencing their decision, and instill trust to travel during the pandemic. Notably, apart from exercising social norms, the airline industry also needs to focus on safety and preventive measures consisting of staff safety practices towards the passenger and new standard operating procedures (SOPs) during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study findings assist the airline industry in understanding passengers' post-pandemic travelling behaviour. Notably, the implementation of health security protocols at airports, supported by the provision of continuous safety information, is indeed an important feature for passengers.

AB  - Background The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic warranted a myriad of government-ordered business closures across the USA in efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus. This study aims to discover the implications of government-enforced health policies of reopening public businesses amidst the pandemic and its effect on county-level infection rates. Methods Eighty-three US counties (n = 83) that reported at least 20 000 cases as of 4 November 2020 were selected for this study. The dates when businesses (restaurants, bars, retail, gyms, salons/barbers and public schools) partially and fully reopened, as well as infection rates on the 1st and 14th days following each businesses' reopening, were recorded. Regression analysis was conducted to deduce potential associations between the 14-day change in infection rate and mask usage frequency, median household income, population density and social distancing. Results On average, infection rates rose significantly as businesses reopened. The average 14-day change in infection rate was higher for fully reopened businesses (infection rate = +0.100) compared to partially reopened businesses (infection rate = +0.0454). The P-value of the two distributions was 0.001692, indicating statistical significance (P < 0.01). Conclusion This research provides insight into the transmission of COVID-19 and promotes evidence-driven policymaking for disease prevention and community health.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - In March of 2020, the United States was confronted with a major public health crisis caused by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This study aimed to identify what factors influence adherence to recently implemented public health measures such as mask-wearing and social distancing, trust of scientific organizations like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) on information pertaining to the pandemic, and level of perceived risk. Data were collected from June 30, 2020 to July 22, 2020 on 951 adult residents of the United States using an online survey through Microsoft Forms. Multiple linear regression was used to identify the strongest predictors for compliance to pandemic-related health measures, trust in the scientific community, and perceived risk. Results showed that the strongest predictor of all variables of interest was degree of policy liberalism. Additionally, participants who consumed more conservative news media conformed less to the pandemic health guidelines and had less trust in the scientific community. Degree of policy liberalism was found to have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between gender and conformity to pandemic-related health behaviors. These findings have concerning implications that factors like degree of policy liberalism and source of news are more influential in predicting adherence to life-saving health measures than established risk factors like pre-existing health conditions.

AB  - The containment measures imposed during the first COVID-19 outbreak required economic, social, and behavioral changes to minimize the spread of the coronavirus. Some studies have focused on how personality predicts distinct patterns of adherence to protective measures with psychopathic and antisocial traits predicting reduced engagement in such measures. In this study we extended previous findings by analyzing how boldness, meanness, and disinhibition psychopathic traits relate with both risk perceptions and protective behaviors during the first COVID-19 outbreak. A sample of 194 individuals (24% male) engaged in the survey, were assessed for psychopathic traits with the Triarchic Psychopathy Measure, and completed a COVID-19 survey targeting risk perceptions (spread, risk of becoming infected, state anxiety toward the COVID-19, and perceived risk of specific behaviors) and frequency of protective behaviors (e.g., not engaging in social distancing). Overall results show that boldness predicts reduced estimate of COVID-19 spread, reduced perceived risk of becoming infected, reduced state anxiety toward COVID-19, and reduced frequency of protective behaviors. Exploratory mediation models suggest that risk perceptions are not significant mediators of the association between psychopathic traits and reduced engagement in protective behaviors. Our results unveil that psychopathic traits affect risk perceptions and the propensity to engage in protective measures, emphasizing the need to accommodate these personality features in the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 spread.

AB  - Purpose: The COVID-19 outbreak has caused governments to put pandemic-related guidelines requiring compliance and understanding by healthcare professionals to mitigate its spread uncontrollably. We studied pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards the COVD-19 outbreak compared with other healthcare workers during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Methods: We surveyed pharmacists' socio-demographics (n=50) compared with other healthcare professionals (n=378) during lockdown starting in June 2020. We measured respondents' level of knowledge (n=10 questions, maximum score of 10), attitude (n=17 questions, maximum score of 80), and their practices (n=16 questions, maximum score of 80) towards COVID-19 infection. Results: Median knowledge score was 8 (25th-75th percentiles: 7-9), attitude score 76 (70- 80) and practice score 74 (68-78). Good knowledge predictors were >20 years working experience [OR: 2.05 (95% CI: 1.03-4.06); P=0.04] and >50% working in clinical practice [OR: 1.72 (95% CI: 1.12-2.66); P=0.01], in inverse relationship with paramedical profes-sions [OR: 0.45 (95% CI: 0.45 (0.28-0.72)); P=0.001] and working in a university hospital [OR: 0.51 (95% CI: 0.33. 0.81); P=0.004]. Availability of pharmaceutical information and treatment options was associated with good attitude [OR: 2.19 (95% CI: 1.04-4.59); P=0.039] and acquaintance as primary information sources negatively associated with good attitude [OR: 0.34 (95% CI: 0.15-0.8); P=0.013]. Good practice predictors were female gender [OR: 3.84 (95% CI: 2.37-6.24); P<0.001], military hospital employment [OR: 2.32 (95% CI: 1.25-4.31); P=0.008], USA [OR: 3.41 (95% CI: 1.03-11.22); P=0.044] or UK [OR: 8.86 (95% CI: 1.91-41.07); P=0.005] qualifications, and information on supportive measures [OR: 2.2 (95% CI: 1.36-3.56); P=0.001]. Conclusion: Health workers displayed good knowledge about COVID-19, while profession and working experience predicted adequate knowledge, positive attitude, or practice towards disease management.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude and practices on cholera in an arid county, Kenya, 2018: A mixed-methods approach
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Cholera remains a public health problem in Kenya despite increased efforts to create awareness. Assessment of knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) in the community is essential for the planning and implementation of preventive measures. We assessed cholera KAP in a community in Isiolo County, Kenya.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study involved a mixed-methods approach utilizing a questionnaire survey and focus group discussions (FGDs). Using multistage sampling with household as the secondary sampling unit, interviewers administered structured questionnaires to one respondent aged.18 years old per household. We created knowledge score by allotting one point for each correct response, considered any total score. median score as high knowledge score, calculated descriptive statistics and used multivariate logistic regression to examine factors associated with high knowledge score. In FGDs, we randomly selected the participants aged.18 years and had lived in Isiolo for > 1 year, conducted the FGDs using an interview guide and used content analysis to identify salient emerging themes.
   Results
   We interviewed 428 participants (median age = 30 years; Q1 = 25, Q3 = 38) comprising 372 (86.9%) females. Of the 425/428 (99.3%) who had heard about cholera, 311/425 (73.2%) knew that it is communicable. Although 273/428 (63.8%) respondents knew the importance of treating drinking water, only 216/421 (51.3%) treated drinking water. Those with good defecation practice were 209/428 (48.8%). Respondents with high knowledge score were 227/ 428 (53.0%). Positive attitude (aOR = 2.88, 95% C.I = 1.34-6.20), treating drinking water (aOR = 2.21, 95% C.I = 1.47-3.33), age < 36 years (aOR = 1.75, 95% C.I = 1.11-2.74) and formal education (aOR = 1.71, 95% C.I = 1.08-2.68) were independently associated with high knowledge score. FGDs showed poor latrine coverage, inadequate water treatment and socio-cultural beliefs as barriers to cholera prevention and control.
   Conclusions
   There was a high knowledge score on cholera with gaps in preventive practices. We recommend targeted health education to the old and uneducated persons and general strengthening of health education in the community.

AB  - Introduction Although social distancing may help contain the spread of COVID-19, the social isolation and loneliness it causes can heighten stress, contribute to unhealthy lifestyle behaviours and have deleterious effects on social relationships. This ongoing longitudinal cohort study aims to (1) characterise the psychological, social and health behavioural impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic over a 12-month period in the USA; (2) determine whether these impacts differ for certain subgroups based on sociodemographics and other individual-level factors; and (3) explore whether there are modifiable factors (eg, coping, social support) that moderate the effects of the pandemic over time. Methods and analysis Adults (aged >= 18 years) who were fluent in either English or Spanish were recruited via social media and invited to complete an online survey during the 8-week period from 13 April to 8 June 2020 (baseline). Follow-up surveys will be conducted 6 and 12 months after baseline. Data transformations, non-parametric tests or other alternative methods will be used when appropriate. Descriptive statistics and cross-sectional analyses will be performed. Longitudinal associations will be analysed using multilevel modelling with time-variant and time-invariant predictors of change in trajectory over the study period. Ethics and dissemination Research ethics approval was received from the Baylor College of Medicine Institutional Review Board (H-47505). Overall, this study will provide timely information that can be used to inform public health messaging strategies and guide development of assessment tools and interventions to support vulnerable individuals dealing with the long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: In our Islamic societies in contrast to most regions of the world the epidemiology of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is low. Data from the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region suggests increasing incidence among key populations (people who inject drugs, men who have sex with men, transgender persons, sex workers and prisoners) in the region. Accurate data collection has long been limited by social, cultural, and religious taboos. Understanding knowledge levels and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS is an important component to design adequate and culturally appropriate awareness and prevention programs.
   Objectives: This study set out to determine the knowledge, attitude and risk perception of Saudi surgery trainees to HIV infection and AIDS.
   Methods: cross-sectional survey was conducted among 500 surgery trainees in Riyadh hospitals. Data was collected using a pretested, Online-administrated 30-item questionnaire and was statistically analyzed using SPSS software version 20.
   Design: cross sectional design
   Setting: online survey
   Main Outcome Measures: Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the surgeon trainees toward people living with HIV/AIDS
   Results: Most of participants (60%) were males with mean age of 35 years. Also 60% were married. Almost all of our participants (90%) aren't concerned with estimation the HIV prevalence in their area. More than three quarters (82%) of them said that needle stick injuries (NSI) could occur from 5 to 6 times per year. The majority of participants (84%) occasionally exposed to HIV positive blood. 80% of them occasionally operated on AIDS patients unknowingly. The majority (81%) had an idea of the CDC guidelines for universal precautions against blood borne pathogens.
   Conclusion: Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes of the surgeon trainees toward people living with HIV/AIDS have been identified and can be improved by medical training and social media awareness campaigns.

AB  - Background. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited disorder of amino acid metabolism, the treatment of which often requires a special diet to prevent adverse neuropsychiatric outcomes. In the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a substantial effect on the whole world since the beginning of 2020, PKU patients represent a vulnerable population because they may be dependent on special nutritional products, have limited access to routine care and display increased levels of anxiety. Methods. For this reason, an online questionnaire assessing the anxiety levels and various personal opinions and practices regarding the pandemic was sent to the PKU patients managed at our clinic, who were 12 years of age or older. Ninety-eight patients responded to the questionnaire. Median age of the participants was 19 years. Results. Most patients were compliant with the hygiene and social distancing recommendations regarding the spread of COVID-19. Of the patients, 61.2% felt more anxious since the pandemic. The most common concern was the possibility of not being able to obtain special nutritional products (58.2%). Anxiety level was significantly higher in females. Conclusions. These data suggest that food security is an important issue of concern in PKU patients. In line with the changing world after the pandemic, different strategies should be considered in the management of patients with inborn errors of metabolism, including PKU.

AB  - This study aims to investigate public response attitude, anxiety, practices and trust in the authorities' mitigation plan during the first wave of COVID-19 pandemic. A national cross sectional phone survey was conducted among Saudi residents aged 16 years and above. A total of 90,421 (45.2%) individuals participated in the study. Of those, the overall rate of COVID-19 correct knowledge was 82% (mean: 9.84); social media was the most reported source of knowledge. Younger age, low levels of education and foreign residents were associated with poor knowledge. Overall, 49.5% scored 5 or more on the GAD-7 test, indicating anxiety symptoms, 19.2% of them scored 10 and above, suggesting moderate to severe anxiety. Majority of participants (>78%) trusted and supported the interventions implemented by the government to control COVID-19. Social distancing practices among participants was as following, 72.5% stayed at home and avoid going out for nonessential business and 49.5% avoided attending social events and family gatherings. Trust in authorities, being anxious, worry and levels of knowledge about the disease, were the most common factors affecting adoption of the recommended practices. Continuous evaluation of public response about COVID-19, and the effectiveness of protective measures is essential to better inform policy-makers and identify ways of encouraging behaviour change among public during pandemic.

AB  - Public health interventions, such as mandated vaccinating or quarantining during an epidemic, are necessary to limit the spread of communicable diseases, but in many cases, certain groups resist these initiatives. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, antiquarantine groups protested the mandate to socially distance and remain at home, claiming these directives violated their right to assemble, travel, and work. The current analysis examined media descriptions of these antiquarantine groups to determine if these groups' divergent responses to a legally and medically warranted health initiative resulted from groupthink: the deterioration of judgment and rationality that sometimes occurs in groups. In support of this possibility, accounts of these groups indicated that (a) the conditions that cause groupthink, including high levels of cohesion and isolation, were present and potent within these groups and that (b) the groups exhibited many of the symptoms of groupthink, including group illusions and pressures to conform. Given the ubiquity of these groups-for centuries, public health interventions have generated opposing antiregulation reactions-no amount of planning may be sufficient to prevent such groups. However, a theory-driven approach based on groupthink suggests that group-level interventions that directly address the processes that cause groupthink, such as isolation, conformity pressure, and cohesion, could reduce the influence of such groups on their members and on society.

AB  - Introduction:The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted everyone, including students. Accurate information about the disease, its spread, preventive measures and government-issued advisories is critical for containing an outbreak. We evaluated the knowledge, attitudes and practices, and the key behavioural determinants of clinical outcomes, among university students.Materials and methods:We conducted a cross-sectional study among IIHMR University students (31 March to 10 April 2020), soon after the nationwide lockdown in India. Through purposive sampling, we enrolled 529 students, who completed a semi-structured questionnaire (44% completion rate). Knowledge level of the participants was assessed using a scoring system, and chi-squared test andt-test were performed to detect significant (p< 0.05) differences among various groups.Results:More than 70 per cent of students had good knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, mode of transmission and preventive measures, and 66 per cent knew about treatment approaches. Social media (83%) and TV (77%) were their primary sources of information. Most students showed a willingness to follow social distancing and lockdown guidelines; however, only 27 per cent perceived the risk of infection. Nearly all students reported compliance with government health advisories.Conclusions:We evaluated COVID-19 awareness and impacts of various information sources on effective outbreak containment. Improved community engagement activities and effective communication are needed during widespread disease outbreaks.

AB  - This study examines how Otherness is constructed visually in newspaper photographs of the refugee crisis. This visual rhetoric analysis examines the form, content, and function of images and explores the rhetorical strategies deployed in visualizations of the refugee crisis in a mainstream Finnish national newspaper from 2015 to 2016. The data consisted of 1,473 images. The study identified six rhetorical strategies used for dehumanizing refugees: massifying, separating, passivating, demonizing, individualizing, and recontextualizing the Other. The rhetorical strategies in turn constructed four discourses related to refugees, namely those of threat and victimhood aimed at dehumanizing as well as personhood and distance aimed at humanizing the Other. The paper contributes to the current knowledge on dehumanization and humanization of refugees in public discourse by unpacking the subtle visual mechanisms through which these processes occur.

AB  - Background: Adherence by diabetic patients to dietary recommendations is important for effective therapy. Considering patients' expectations in case of diet is significant in this regard. The aim of this paper was to analyze the relationship between selected independent variables (eg, regular blood glucose testing) and patients' adherence to dietary recommendations, bearing in mind that the degree of disease acceptance might play a mediation role.
   Subjects and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 91 patients treated for type 2 diabetes mellitus in a public medical facility. Paper-and-pencil interviewing was administered ahead of the planned visit with a diabetes specialist. Two measures were applied in the study: the Acceptance and Action Diabetes Questionnaire and the Patient Diet Adherence in Diabetes Scale. Additionally, data related to sociodemographic characteristics, lifestyle-related factors, and the course of the disease (management, incidence of complications, and dietician's supervision) were also collected. The regression method was used in the analysis, and Cohen's methodology was used to estimate partial mediation. Significance of the mediation effect was assessed by the Goodman test. P-values of < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.
   Results: Patients' non-adherence to dietary recommendations was related to a low level of disease acceptance (standardized regression coefficient =-0.266; P=0.010). Moreover, failure to perform regular blood glucose testing was associated with a lack of disease acceptance (standardized regression coefficient =-0.455; P=0.000). However, the lack of regular blood glucose testing and low level of acceptance had only partially negative impacts on adherence to dietary recommendations (Goodman mediation test, Z=1.939; P=0.054). This dependence was not seen in patients treated with diet and concomitant oral medicines and/or insulin therapy.
   Conclusion: Effective dietary education should include activities promoting a more positive attitude toward the disease. This may be obtained by individual counseling, respecting the patient's needs, and focus on regular blood glucose testing.

AB  - Background: The classification of Alzheimer's disease is undergoing a significant transformation. Researchers have created the category of "preclinical Alzheimer's," characterized by biomarker pathology rather than observable symptoms. Diagnosis and treatment at this stage could allow preventing Alzheimer's cognitive decline. While many commentators have worried that persons given a preclinical Alzheimer's label will be subject to stigma, little research exists to inform whether the stigma attached to the label of clinical Alzheimer's will extend to a preclinical disorder that has the label of "Alzheimer's" but lacks the symptoms or expected prognosis of the clinical form.
   Research questions: The present study sought to correct this gap by examining the foundations of stigma directed at Alzheimer's. It asked: do people form stigmatizing reactions to the label "Alzheimer's disease" itself or to the condition's observable impairments? How does the condition's prognosis modify these reactions?
   Methods: Data were collected through a web-based experiment with N = 789 adult members of the U.S. general population (median age = 49, interquartile range, 32-60, range = 18-90). Participants were randomized through a 3 x 3 design to read one of 9 vignettes depicting signs and symptoms of mild stage dementia that varied the disease label ("Alzheimer's" vs. "traumatic brain injury" vs. no label) and prognosis (improve vs. static vs. worsen symptoms). Four stigma outcomes were assessed: discrimination, negative cognitive attributions, negative emotions, and social distance.
   Results: The study found that the Alzheimer's disease label was generally not associated with more stigmatizing reactions. In contrast, expecting the symptoms to get worse, regardless of which disease label those symptoms received, resulted in higher levels of perceived structural discrimination, higher pity, and greater social distance.
   Conclusion: These findings suggest that stigma surrounding pre-clinical Alzheimer's categories will depend highly on the expected prognosis attached to the label. They also highlight the need for models of Alzheimer's-directed stigma that incorporate attributions about the condition's mutability. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic had a global impact. The study explores the various COVID-19 experiences in Malta over the past year and provides a snapshot of acute and post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, as well as national vaccination roll-out and hesitancy. Methods: Data on medical access, lifestyle habits, acute and post-acute COVID-19 symptoms, and vaccination hesitancy was gathered through a social media survey targeting adults of Malta. COVID-19 data were gathered from the Malta Ministry of Health COVID-19 dashboard. Results: Malta controlled COVID-19 spread exceptionally well initially. Since August 2020, the positivity rate, mortality, and hospital admission rates saw a fluctuating incline. From COVID-19 onset, a decrease in physical activity and an increase in body weight was reported. Most participants acquiring COVID-19 were asymptomatic but nontrivial proportion experienced post-acute symptoms. The majority opted to take the COVID-19 vaccine with only a minority expressing safety concerns. Conclusions: Malta has experienced roller coaster events over a year. The population faced elevated levels of morbidity, mortality, and economic hardship along with negative and positive risk-associated behaviors. Vaccination in combination with population adherence to social distancing, mask wearing, and personal hygiene are expected to be the beacons of hope in the coming months.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic posed challenges for healthcare systems and political leaders across the globe. In this case study of Brazil, we argue that leadership failings at the highest level contributed to Brazil's relatively high and escalating death rates during 2020. Drawing on an analysis of a large amount of textual documentation drawn from media reports, we emphasise the role and consequences of President Jair Bolsonaro's political discourse and prioritisation of the economy. We focus on the first wave that swept across the globe between January and late June of 2020, arguing that Bolsonaro underplayed the seriousness of the epidemic, leveraged misinformation as a political strategy, promoted pseudoscience, and undermined the Ministry of Health. He also confronted subnational governments for adopting lockdown measures - a move that enabled him to blame regional governors for the short-term economic costs of COVID-19 related restrictions. We suggest that his denialist approach to climate change paved the way for his subsequent denialism of the seriousness of COVID-19 and for his undermining of social distancing, mask-wearing and other preventative responses supported by science. These sobering findings highlight the role that national leaders can play in undermining scientific approaches to both public health and the environment.

AB  - Being one of the most lucrative industries worldwide, the automobile industry majorly impacts the economy of any country because it acts as a foundation of the greater transportation and logistics scenario, and that is directly connected to the magnitude of goods and services imported and exported within and outside the country. Purchasing a car has leveled up to include personality types and value systems. Thus, studying consumer behavior in the automotive industry could give us a holistic view of society and its evolution. But looking at the scenario in 2020, things might look grim due to the onset of COVID-19 and a complete travel halt. Looking at the bright side of it, this pandemic scenario would boost sales of automobiles as people would prefer private or personal transport to the public or shared mobility to maintain better social distance. This research focuses on the impact of epidemic outbreaks on the consumer behavior of the automobile industry, with a special focus on COVID-19. A mixed-methods or a multimethod approach is followed to holistically dig out information to collect and analyze the data. The findings suggest that around 87% of the consumers aged 25-60 years prefer private transport over public transport to be safe from attracting COVID-19. Thus, using this information to communicate value and delight to the consumers would help marketers steer through the situation with ease.

AB  - Introduction: HIV/AIDS is one of the major health problems worldwide. Despite the low prevalence of HIV in Bahrain, educational and awareness programs remain highly important in controlling and preventing the spread of the disease. This study aimed to assess the public's knowledge, risk perceptions, and attitudes towards HIV/AIDS in Bahrain.
   Methodology: A self-administered questionnaire-based survey was administered to and completed by 1,038 Bahraini adults.
   Results: Although the average general awareness among participants was good (63%), some misconceptions and erroneous beliefs were common, including knowledge of mode of transmission and high risk groups. Participants' attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients varied but were mostly negative; 60% of respondents agreed to isolating HIV/AIDS patients in workplaces and schools, and 52.4% of them thought that HIV is a divine punishment. The vast majority of the participants (84.4%) believed in the role of religion in limiting the spread of the disease. Though the local media was the least utilized source of information, the general opinion of the participants about the role of Bahraini government agencies and organizations in combating HIV/AIDS was positive.
   Conclusions: Though the Bahraini public had good knowledge about HIV/AIDS, there were misconceptions that need to be addressed. A major finding of this study was the negative attitudes towards HIV/AIDS patients. To have successful HIV control programs, negative attitudes towards HIV patients and the disease should be minimized. Existing and newly proposed health education and awareness program in Bahrain should address the issue of negative attitudes towards HIV/AIDS observed in this study.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide managers and researchers a comprehensive view of the root causes of customer departure and empirically test the attitudinal and behavioural consequences of failed service quality in a retail banking context.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative study was conducted among retail banking customers who had defected from a large retail bank provider. Data from 989 usable responses to a questionnaire filled through a telephone survey were applied to model estimation through structural equation modelling.
   Findings - Findings demonstrate the effect of failed service quality on customers' negative attitudes towards the retail bank provider (dissatisfaction and lack of commitment), the direct negative impact of failed service quality on loyalty (the opposite of defection), as well as its indirect negative impact on loyalty through negative attitudes. The moderating role of customers' switching costs and subjective knowledge of the bank's products is revealed and the relative impact of each failed service quality factor on negative attitudes and behavioural intentions is assessed.
   Practical implications - Key areas causing customer dissatisfaction and eventually defection are shown to bank managers, providing direction for implementing strategies and mechanisms in order to effectively reduce the defection rate.
   Originality/value - The theoretical model, which was in large confirmed through the empirical data, offers for the first time empirical evidence regarding the extent to which the general categories of reasons to defect in a service context identified in the literature are indeed causing customer exit.

AB  - Question What is the transmissibility of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to close contacts? Findings In this case-ascertained study of 100 cases of confirmed COVID-19 and 2761 close contacts, the overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7%. The attack rate was higher among contacts whose exposure to the index case started within 5 days of symptom onset than those who were exposed later. Meaning High transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to interrupt transmission, and that more generalized measures might be required, such as social distancing.
   Importance The dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) transmissibility are yet to be fully understood. Better understanding of the transmission dynamics is important for the development and evaluation of effective control policies. Objective To delineate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 and evaluate the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset. Design, Setting, and Participants This prospective case-ascertained study in Taiwan included laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 and their contacts. The study period was from January 15 to March 18, 2020. All close contacts were quarantined at home for 14 days after their last exposure to the index case. During the quarantine period, any relevant symptoms (fever, cough, or other respiratory symptoms) of contacts triggered a COVID-19 test. The final follow-up date was April 2, 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures Secondary clinical attack rate (considering symptomatic cases only) for different exposure time windows of the index cases and for different exposure settings (such as household, family, and health care). Results We enrolled 100 confirmed patients, with a median age of 44 years (range, 11-88 years), including 44 men and 56 women. Among their 2761 close contacts, there were 22 paired index-secondary cases. The overall secondary clinical attack rate was 0.7% (95% CI, 0.4%-1.0%). The attack rate was higher among the 1818 contacts whose exposure to index cases started within 5 days of symptom onset (1.0% [95% CI, 0.6%-1.6%]) compared with those who were exposed later (0 cases from 852 contacts; 95% CI, 0%-0.4%). The 299 contacts with exclusive presymptomatic exposures were also at risk (attack rate, 0.7% [95% CI, 0.2%-2.4%]). The attack rate was higher among household (4.6% [95% CI, 2.3%-9.3%]) and nonhousehold (5.3% [95% CI, 2.1%-12.8%]) family contacts than that in health care or other settings. The attack rates were higher among those aged 40 to 59 years (1.1% [95% CI, 0.6%-2.1%]) and those aged 60 years and older (0.9% [95% CI, 0.3%-2.6%]). Conclusions and Relevance In this study, high transmissibility of COVID-19 before and immediately after symptom onset suggests that finding and isolating symptomatic patients alone may not suffice to contain the epidemic, and more generalized measures may be required, such as social distancing.
   This study delineates the transmission dynamics of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and evaluates the transmission risk at different exposure window periods before and after symptom onset.

AB  - Background: Alleviating suffering and improving quality of life are universally shared goals. In this context, we implemented a pilot study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a mindfulness intervention in the form of meditation involving together cancer patients, health professionals, and third persons.
   Methods: Two groups of 15 participants equally composed of patients, health professionals and third persons were constituted. A dedicated programme on mindfulness and compassion was constructed, including 12 weekly sessions of 1.5 h and a half-day retreat. Adherence and satisfaction with the programme were evaluated. All participants completed questionnaires on perceived stress, quality of life, mindfulness, empathy, and self-efficacy. Burnout was assessed in health professionals.
   Results: Shared meditation was feasible as 70% of participants attended >= 80% of the 13 meditation sessions. Satisfaction with the programme was high (median satisfaction score: 9.1 out of 10) and all participants expressed positive attitudes towards shared meditation and a benefit on their global quality of life. Participants reported significant improvement in stress (p < 0.001), global quality of life (p = 0.004), self-efficacy (p <0.001), and mindfulness skills (p<0.001) from baseline to post-programme.
   Conclusions: This study demonstrated the feasibility of a shared dedicated meditation programme in terms of participation and acceptability of participants. The measured benefits observed among participants furthermore justify the interest of a subsequent randomized study aiming to demonstrate the potential added value of shared meditation by promoting bridge-building between cancer patients, health professionals and others.

AB  - COVID-19 (Corona-Virus Disease 2019) in Italy and the measures that were adopted to contain its diffusion had a strong impact on people's quality of life and mental health. The objective of the study was to quantify the psychological impact of the lockdown period on the general Italian population during the two weeks when the COVID-19 emergency in Italy was at its peak. The study (1556 adults) was conducted from April 6th to April 12th, 2020. A survey was developed through Google Forms in order to assess different psychological measures (Self Efficacy, Locus of Control, Social Connectedness, Sense of Virtual Community, Flourishing, Positive and Negative Affect, Life Satisfaction, and Risk Propensity). The results were then compared to reference data. Thelockdown period increased arousal mainly for negative emotions, but also for positive emotions, and quality of life seemed to be reduced. From a psychosocial point of view, while social connectedness has decreased during lockdown, probably because of isolation and social distancing, the virtual social community seemed to increase in the same period. Interestingly, we revealed how self efficacy increased during the lockdown period, and, at the same time, the Locus of control appeared as externalized, and the risk propensity as reduced. The results are discussed considering previous literature, and a coherent theoretical framework is proposed in order to refine the forecasting model for the psychological impact of the lockdown.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, does more internet and social media use lead to taking more- or less-effective preventive measures against the disease? A two-wave longitudinal survey with the general population in mainland China in mid-2020 found that during the COVID-19 pandemic, internet and social media use intensity promoted the adoption of nonpharmaceutical and pharmaceutical antipandemic measures. The first wave of data (n = 1014) showed that the more intensively people used the internet/social media, the more they perceived the threat of the pandemic, and took more nonpharmaceutical preventive measures (e.g., wearing masks, maintaining social distance, and washing hands) as a result. The second wave (n = 220) showed firstly the predicted relationship between internet/social media use intensity and the perceived threat of the pandemic and the adoption of nonpharmaceutical preventive measures by cross-lagged analysis; secondly, the predictive effect of internet/social media use on the adoption of pharmacological measures (i.e., willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19) and the mediating role of perceived pandemic threat were verified. The article concludes with a discussion of the role of the internet and social media use in the fight against COVID-19 in specific macrosocial contexts.

AB  - Merkley and Loewen find that anti-intellectualism (distrust in experts and intellectuals) is linked to COVID-19 (mis)perceptions, compliance with public health directives and information search using survey and experimental data from Canada.
   Anti-intellectualism (the generalized distrust of experts and intellectuals) is an important concept in explaining the public's engagement with advice from scientists and experts. We ask whether it has shaped the mass public's response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We provide evidence of a consistent connection between anti-intellectualism and COVID-19 risk perceptions, social distancing, mask usage, misperceptions and information acquisition using a representative survey of 27,615 Canadians conducted from March to July 2020. We exploit a panel component of our design (N = 4,910) to strongly link anti-intellectualism and within-respondent change in mask usage. Finally, we provide experimental evidence of anti-intellectualism's importance in information search behaviour with two conjoint studies (N similar to 2,500) that show that preferences for COVID-19 news and COVID-19 information from experts dissipate among respondents with higher levels of anti-intellectual sentiment. Anti-intellectualism poses a fundamental challenge in maintaining and increasing public compliance with expert-guided COVID-19 health directives.

AB  - This study explores responses to the death of actor/comedian Robin Williams, focusing on the role of celebrity attachment and exposure to media coverage following his suicide. A total of 350 respondents recruited on Mechanical Turk completed an online survey. Participants who had a stronger parasocial relationship with Williams reported lower social distance from people with depression, greater willingness to seek treatment for depression, and more frequent outreach to other people with depression or suicidal thoughts following his death. Exposure to media coverage of suicide/depression - both informational and stigmatizing - was associated with more frequent outreach to others, but only informational coverage was related to greater willingness to seek treatment. Stigmatizing media exposure was related to greater depression stereotypes. Seeing more media stories celebrating Williams' life and career was associated with reduced depression stigma but also with less willingness to seek treatment for depression and less outreach to others. Implications of the findings for media and mental health are discussed.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is assesment of awareness and knowledge of oral cancer in a group of tobacco users.
   Methods: The study group consisted of 100 adult patients aged 18 years and over who applied to Marmara University Faculty of Dentistry Oral and Maxillofacial Radiology Clinic for routine examination. The patients were asked to complete a 16-point questionnaire evaluating the effects of smoking on oral cancer.
   Results: The participants in our study identified oral cancer symptoms as swelling / mass formation (60%), wound in mouth (58%), loss of sensation (39%) and pain (38%). There was statistically significant difference between the responses given to "What are the causes of oral cancer?", "what are the symptoms of oral cancer?" and "What are the diagnostic methods for oral cancer?" between women and men (p < 0.05). The rate of responding to the question "What do you think are the causes of oral cancer?" as "alcohol use" in women (63.3%) was significantly higher than men (39.2%) (p=0.027; p < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between genders regarding "smoking" and "chewing tobacco" as oral cancer factor (p > 0.05).
   Conclusion: It is concluded that women smoker individiuals have more awareness, knowledge level and positive attitudes about oral cancer compared to men. Increasing level of knowledge of individuals about oral cancer, routine examination of individuals at high risk group and development of national policies with this purpose can make a contribution to improve the level of consciousness.

AB  - Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on well-being and mental health are a concern worldwide. This article is based on two longitudinal studies that investigated the role of social media use in loneliness and psychological distress before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study 1 utilized nationally representative 3-point longitudinal data (n = 735) collected in 2017-2020 on the Finnish population. Study 2 utilized 5-point longitudinal data (n = 840) collected in 2019-2021 representing the Finnish working population. We analyzed the data using multilevel mixed-effects regression analysis. A longitudinal analysis of Study 1 showed that perceived loneliness did not increase among the Finnish population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Stronger involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted lower loneliness during the pandemic. Study 2 results showed that since the outbreak of the pandemic, psychological distress has increased among lonely individuals but not among the general working population. Involvement in social media identity bubbles predicted generally lower psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it did not buffer against higher psychological distress among lonely individuals. The findings suggest that perceived loneliness is a risk factor for prolonged negative mental health effects of the pandemic. Social media identity bubbles can offer meaningful social resources during times of social distancing but cannot protect against higher psychological distress among those who perceive themselves as often lonely.

AB  - This paper examines the interaction of education for both Blacks and Whites in all major religious groups on four key political issues: Abortion, gay marriage, feelings toward redistribution, and political party identification. We find that for most Blacks, race is the most salient factor across all four political dimensions; whereas there is significant variation by religion and education for Whites, there is very little difference for Blacks. As previous research has noted, Blacks are generally more conservative on gay marriage and Blacks are generally positive about redistribution, much more so than most Whites regardless of education and religion. We find education is more liberating to Whites than Blacks. The only issue for which education has significant effects for Blacks is abortion, but even in this case, unlike for Whites, there are not large religious differences among Blacks. This study corroborates previous research that abortion and gay marriage are less politically central to Blacks, who at all education levels are more likely to be Democrat than the most Democrat identified Whites.

AB  - A B S T R A C T Virtual forms of communication have been integrated into academic surgery now more than ever. The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated its implementation in an effort to support social-distancing. Academic surgery is now learning valuable lessons from early experiences to optimally integrate this communication mode. The Society of Asian Academic Surgeons convened an expert panel during the society's fifth annual meeting that explores these lessons. Realms of virtual communication including meetings, networking, surgery department administration, social media, application processes, and advice for early or mid-career academic surgeons are explored. Virtual conferences pose a new challenge by removing the in-person component that is evident to be integral to networking, collaboration, and all aspects of academic socialization. Strategies such as creating virtual chat rooms, mentor-mentee virtual introductions, and deliberate interactions can enhance the experience. Virtual administrative meetings require special attention to preparation and strategies to insure engagement. Social media can be a valuable tool to integrate into academic careers but special attention needs to be made to utilize it deliberately and not to shy away from our individuality. The interview process can be enhanced when made virtual to give opportunities to those typically disadvantaged in the usual, in-person process. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to assess the level of knowledge regarding the basic life support (BLS) and attitudes related to BLS training and to identify the factors affecting these among medical students in Oman.
   Materials and methods: This prospective cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was carried out during the period July 2017 to February 2018 at Medical College of Sultan Qaboos University, Muscat, Oman. Validated questionnaires in English were distributed among undergraduate medical students from 1st to 7th years.
   Results: A total of 304 medical students completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 82.7%. The mean knowledge score of the participants was slightly high (5.5 +/- 2.1) and median score of 5. About 53.6% of the participants had insufficient knowledge level. The scores increased with increase in the year of training. More than half (64.5%) of the participants had no previous BLS training. Students who attended previous BLS training showed higher knowledge scores (p < 0.001). Majority of the participants (97.4%) supported including of BLS in the undergraduate medical curriculum. Majority of the students (74%) were not reluctant to perform BLS on a stranger, although there was some reluctance among the female students.
   Conclusion: Our findings show that medical students in Oman had insufficient knowledge about BLS. However, they showed positive attitudes toward BLS training and were not reluctant to provide BLS to a stranger if required. These highlights the importance to provide sufficient BLS training for medical students early in their course.

AB  - This exploratory study investigates the opinions of mothers who have at least one child between the ages of 7 and 12 in terms of the impact of TV food advertising on their children. This research also examines whether there is any third person effect active in mothers' opinions of TV food advertising aimed at children by asking them about both the impact on their own children, and the children of strangers. The results reveal that most mothers in the study have generally negative attitudes toward TV food advertising aimed at children, but they believe that the children of strangers are more negatively impacted by exposure to the ads than their own children.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic might have affected older adults' personal and general views on aging (VoA) because they were frequently, particularly during the early phase of the pandemic, portrayed as a homogeneous, vulnerable group in the media and in public debates. Also, their higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease progression as well as other pandemic-related stressors and restrictions might have impacted how older adults perceive their own aging. In this study, it was examined to which extent middle-aged and older adults' personal and general VoA changed due to the pandemic by distinguishing between normative age-graded change across multiple measurement occasions and potentially pandemic-specific history-graded change. Multiple VoA indicators (personal VoA: attitude toward own aging, subjective age, awareness of age-related change [gains and losses]; general VoA: domain-specific age stereotypes) of 423 German adults aged 40 years and older were assessed across three prepandemic measurement occasions (2012, 2015, and 2017) and one occasion after the pandemic's outbreak (summer 2020). Normative age-graded changes and pandemic-specific changes were estimated and compared using longitudinal multilevel regression analyses. Both perceived age-related gains and age-related losses decreased between 2012 and 2017, but increased thereafter between 2017 and 2020. Further, the overall change trend toward less positive attitude toward own aging slowed down from 2017 to 2020. There was also a slight trend toward younger subjective ages from 2017 to 2020. For most age stereotypes, pandemic-specific trends indicated a shift toward more negative stereotypes. These findings suggest that pandemic-specific changes in VoA are multidirectional, comprising perceptions of both losses and gains.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has exacted an appreciable burden on health systems globally including adverse psychological impacts on health workers. This study sought to assess COVID-19-related fear, depression, anxiety and stress among hospital staff, potential factors that may help reduce its psychological effects and their personal coping strategies. The study will help to highlight the psychological impact of COVID-19 on Ghanaian health workers and indirectly serve as a needs assessment survey for input to support affected staff and the broader health system.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among health workers in three hospitals in the Ashanti Region of Ghana from 11 July 2020 to 12 August 2020. Demographic data and scores from the validated DASS-21 and Fear of COVID-19 scales and two other scales developed de novo were entered from 272 self-administered questionnaires and analyzed for means, frequencies and proportions. Fisher's exact test analysis was done to ascertain associations between selected independent variables and depression, anxiety, stress and fear. Parametric and non-parametric tests were used to compare the mean and median scores of the outcome variables across the three study hospitals.
   Results and conclusion: Over 40% of respondents had fear while 21.1%, 27.8% and 8.2% had depression, anxiety and stress, respectively. Positive attitudes from colleagues and the government's tax-free salary relief were some factors said to reduce the psychological effects while over half of participants indicated praying more often as a coping strategy. There is a need for the health system to recognize the presence of these adverse psychological effects in health workers and take pragmatic steps to address them.

AB  - Background:Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in numerous experimental studies, particularly in skin cancer diagnostics. Translation of these findings into the clinic is the logical next step. This translation can only be successful if patients' concerns and questions are addressed suitably. We therefore conducted a survey to evaluate the patients' view of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics in Germany, with a particular focus on patients with a history of melanoma. Participants and Methods:A web-based questionnaire was designed using LimeSurvey, sent by e-mail to university hospitals and melanoma support groups and advertised on social media. The anonymous questionnaire evaluated patients' expectations and concerns toward artificial intelligence in general as well as their attitudes toward different application scenarios. Descriptive analysis was performed with expression of categorical variables as percentages and 95% confidence intervals. Statistical tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire. Results:298 individuals (154 with a melanoma diagnosis, 143 without) responded to the questionnaire. About 94% [95% CI = 0.91-0.97] of respondents supported the use of artificial intelligence in medical approaches. 88% [95% CI = 0.85-0.92] would even make their own health data anonymously available for the further development of AI-based applications in medicine. Only 41% [95% CI = 0.35-0.46] of respondents were amenable to the use of artificial intelligence as stand-alone system, 94% [95% CI = 0.92-0.97] to its use as assistance system for physicians. In sub-group analyses, only minor differences were detectable. Respondents with a previous history of melanoma were more amenable to the use of AI applications for early detection even at home. They would prefer an application scenario where physician and AI classify the lesions independently. With respect to AI-based applications in medicine, patients were concerned about insufficient data protection, impersonality and susceptibility to errors, but expected faster, more precise and unbiased diagnostics, less diagnostic errors and support for physicians. Conclusions:The vast majority of participants exhibited a positive attitude toward the use of artificial intelligence in melanoma diagnostics, especially as an assistance system.

AB  - Controlling the spread of influenza to reduce the effects of infection on a population is an important mandate of public health. Mass media reports on an epidemic or pandemic can provide important information to the public, and in turn, can induce positive healthy behaviour practices (i.e., handwashing, social distancing) in the individuals, that will reduce the probability of contracting the disease. Mass media fatigue, however, can dampen these effects. Mathematical models can be used to study the effects of mass media reports on epidemic/pandemic outcomes. In this study we employ a stochastic agent based model to provide a quantification of mass media reports on the variability in important public health measurements. We also include mass media report data compiled by the Global Public Health Intelligence Network, to study the effects of mass media reports in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. We find that the report rate and the rate at which individuals relax their healthy behaviours (media fatigue) greatly affect the variability in important public health measurements. When the mass media reporting data is included in the model, two peaks of infection result.

We applied a model previously published to quantitatively and qualitatively assess media coverage on vaccines and immunization-related topics on the most read Italian newspaper, Corriere della Sera, over an 11-year study period (2007-2017). We retrieved relevant key words and articles, reported on included articles' topic, position, approach to immunization and on other selected indicators' summary statistics, temporal trends and correspondence with key epidemiological and policy events. Over the study period the quote vaccin* was mentioned on average 325times per year; with an increase of 150% after the approval of the new law on mandatory immunization in 2017. In the same year, on average, two first-page articles per week were published on the topic. We report a clear association between key events (i.e the H1N1 influenza pandemic, the Fluad case, the approval of the new law on mandatory immunization) and their media coverage. Overall, 84% of articles had a positive attitude towards immunization, this share decreasing to 79% when only considering articles published after the approval of the law on mandatory vaccination. Media play a crucial role in channelling health-related information and significantly influence health behaviours. We urge public institutions, health authorities and the scientific community not to underestimate the opportunity to monitor media coverage on key healthcare topics and to convey evidence-based health education messages through the media.

AB  - Background: With a disparate HIV prevalence among young men and women, high rates of teenage pregnancies and a lack of responsible fatherhood, issues of reproductive health among young people need to be urgently addressed. The aim of this research was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding sexual and reproductive health among young men in the Bethesda Hospital catchment area of northern KwaZulu-Natal province. Methods: This observational, descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted at six randomly selected high schools within the uMkhanyakude district. All grade 12 male learners ? 18 years completed a questionnaire regarding their reproductive health knowledge, attitudes and practices. Results: A total of 279 learners participated in the study with a median age of 20.2 years and a mean knowledge score of 63.8%. Only 28.3% of the learners showed good or excellent knowledge on basic sexual and reproductive health questions; 50.9% believed that girls say ?no? to sex when they mean ?yes?, and 46.2% believed that girls were sexually aroused when dominated by a man. Some 156 (55.9%) of those who were sexually active did not know their current sexual partner's HIV status. There were significant associations between being brought up in a female-headed family and early sexual debut but not between early sexual debut and paternalistic attitudes to women. Discussion and conclusions: Basic sexual and reproductive health knowledge among the majority of participants was adequate. Patriarchal attitudes of sexual domination were prominent, and these are probably influenced by sociocultural belief systems of traditional masculinity, which are defined and dominated by men. This perpetuates gender inequality and contributes to poor sexual and reproductive health outcomes. Poor health-seeking behaviour and attitude relating to sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and having concurrent multiple sexual partners, puts them and their sexual partners at risk of HIV/AIDS acquisition. Strategies need to be developed to enhance socially acceptable and comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education and services among young men in this area, foster positive attitudes towards women and encourage gender-equal relationships.

AB  - Stigma can have a debilitating effect on mental health. Both LGBTQ+ individuals and substance users experience stigma, and concurrent membership of both groups can result in double stigma. This study aimed to investigate differences in stigmatized attitudes based on substance use behaviors and sexual identity using data from 102 participants (83% female). Findings suggest the presence of a hierarchy of stigma where heterosexual individuals were typically viewed more positively than LGBTQ+ individuals, regardless of the substance using status of the LGBTQ+ individual. However illicit drug use by heterosexual individuals resulted in the most negative attitudes. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Objective:
   We aimed to investigate the relationships between use of media to obtain information on radiation and radiation anxiety among community residents in Fukushima, 5.5 years after the nuclear power plant accident.
   Methods:
   A questionnaire survey was administered between August and October 2016 to 2000 randomly sampled residents in Fukushima prefecture. Radiation anxiety toward health and regarding discrimination and prejudice were assessed with 4- and 3-item scales, respectively. Participants nominated their most-used media for acquiring information on radiation by choosing up to 3 sources from 12 information sources listed (eg, local newspaper, TV news, websites, social networking sites [SNS], local government newsletter, word of mouth). We investigated associations of most-used media types and radiation anxiety, controlling for sociodemographic characteristics and anxiety regarding radiation's health effects immediately after the accident, using multivariate linear regression analyses.
   Results:
   Valid responses were obtained from 790 (39.5%) residents. Acquiring information about radiation by word of mouth was related to higher radiation anxiety toward health. Regarding radiation anxiety concerning discrimination and prejudice, SNS use was related to higher anxiety, whereas acquiring information through Nippon Hoso Kyokai (NHK) TV news was related to lower anxiety.
   Conclusions:
   Interpersonal interactions rather than gaining information from media - characterized by unidirectional information exchange - may increase radiation anxiety.

AB  - ObjectiveBehavioral intentions to care for patients with infectious diseases are crucial for improving quality of care. However, there have been few studies of the behavioral intentions and factors influencing patient care by clinical nurses during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aims to explore cognition, attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions of clinical nurses while caring for COVID-19 patients and to explore any influencing factors. MethodA cross-sectional survey was conducted of nurses through convenience sampling in southeast China from February 2020 to March 2020. The questionnaire was developed based on the theory of planned behavior and self-efficacy. ResultsA total of 774 nurses completed the survey. Of these, 69.12% (535/774) reported positive behavioral intentions, 75.58% (585/774) reported a positive attitude, and 63.82% (494/774) reported having the confidence to care for patients. However, the lack of support from family and friends and special allowance affected their self-confidence. Attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norms, and ethical cognition were significantly positively correlated with behavioral intentions (r = 0.719, 0.690, 0.603, and 0.546, respectively, all P < 0.001). Structural equation model showed that self-efficacy, attitude, ethical cognition, and subjective norms had positive effects on behavioral intentions (beta = 0.402, 0.382, 0.091, and 0.066, respectively, P < 0.01). The total effect of behavioral intentions was influenced by attitude, ethical cognition, self-efficacy, and subjective norms (beta = 0.656, 0.630, 0.402, and 0.157, respectively, P < 0.01). In addition, ethical cognition had a positive mediating effect on behavioral intentions (beta = 0.539, P < 0.001). ConclusionThe study results indicated that attitude, ethical cognition, and self-efficacy were the main factors influencing nurses' behavioral intention. Efforts should be made to improve nurses' attitude and self-efficacy through ethical education and training to increase behavioral intentions to care for patients with infectious diseases, which will improve the quality of nursing care.

AB  - Background Vaccination against Covid 19 disease was based on rational practice theory. One of the most effective methods to control the COVID-19 pandemic is extensive vaccination coverage in the shortest time. The relevant beliefs and predictors of COVID-19 vaccine and the barriers to and facilitators of receiving COVID-19 vaccine should be identified. Individuals' intention to receive COVID-19 and the effective factors are of an utmost importance. This study aimed to predict intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine in the South of Iran. Methods This cross-sectional study was performed over a period of 2 months (May 2021 to July 2021) in 4 southern provinces in Iran. The study population of this study included people over 18 years of age who did not receive the COVID-19 vaccine. The online questionnaire was used to collect data. We recruited participants through a self-selection sampling method and posted the online survey link. The questionnaire had two parts: demographic information and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) questions. All statistical calculations and hypotheses tests were performed using SPSS21 and Amos21 software and the significance level was considered 0.05. Results A total number of 2556 people participated in this study with a mean age of 37.76 (10.7) of years (Age Range = 18-75). The findings showed that attitudes and subjective norms and the use of social media predict the intention to receive COVID-19 vaccine. SEM showed that attitude (beta = 0.596, P < 0.001), subjective norms (beta = 0.265, P < 0.001) were significant predictors of vaccination intention. In this study, 78% of people were willing to receive the vaccine when they were officially allowed to. Conclusion According to the results of the study, it is suggested to strengthen positive attitudes and subjective norms about the importance of COVID-19 vaccination as well as using social media to inform the community in order increase the intention to vaccinate COVID-19 and increase vaccine coverage.

AB  - Purpose Despite the importance of pharmaceutical products in everyday life, particularly after the coronavirus outbreak in early 2020, only a few studies have attempted to analyse consumer behaviour with regard to halal pharmaceutical products. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the factors influencing purchase intention for halal pharmaceutical products among Indonesian Muslims. Design/methodology/approach This study uses a theory of planned behaviour approach, in which religiosity and knowledge of halal product variables are added to attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control variables. Primary data were collected from 225 Indonesian Muslims in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia and analysed using structural equation modelling. Findings The study found that the intention to purchase halal pharmaceutical products is positively affected by attitude, religiosity, knowledge of halal products and perceived behavioural control. However, the influence of the subjective norm variable was found to be insignificant in this study. Research limitations/implications It is possible to improve the empirical model by including more explanatory variables and investigating the mediating effect of the variables. The study could also be scaled up to reach more respondents in different regions and countries. These additional aspects would provide better insights into the behaviour of consumers when considering halal pharmaceutical products. Practical implications The findings suggest the importance of designing and implementing appropriate strategies and campaigns to enhance knowledge of halal products, of positive attitudes and of better resources/opportunities to consume halal pharmaceutical products. The industry needs to highlight its products' halal and tayyib aspects through proper branding and promotion strategies. The government and other stakeholders could also implement education campaigns to increase halal products and halal literacy knowledge. These are ultimately expected to enhance the effectiveness of halal regulations and meet Muslim consumer expectations in the country. Originality/value Despite the importance of halal pharmaceutical products, this area has received limited attention in the academic literature. Thus, this study attempts to elaborate on consumer behaviour in this niche area.

AB  - Introduction: Special Care Dentistry (SCD) is a dentistry branch that advocates equal dental Patient with Special Care Needs (PSCN). In several countries, it is a separate specialty. In India, it is still in its infancy. Few studies have explored the dentists' perception regarding SCD.
   Aim: To determine the knowledge and attitude about SCD, also the practice measures followed by the dentists in Chennai colleges.
   Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional observational study was conducted in three dental colleges in Chennai from September 2019 to October 2019. A total of 230 dentists were enrolled using random sampling. A set of 20 close ended multiple choice questions were formulated and administered to dentists {Undergraduates (UGs) and Postgraduates (PGs)}. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square test was performed using MATLAB software (Mathworks, 2015), with p<0.05.
   Results: A 78.8% of respondents got good scores of >= 7 in knowledge based questions, 25.6% of the participants showed overall positive attitude. Educational qualification did not affect respondents' knowledge and attitude about SCD (p>0.05). Only 21.95% of UGs and 22.31% of the PGs have good self-confidence in treating patients with special needs. More than 80% have not administered Domiciliary Care (DC). A total of 65% of participants denied getting any training in their UGs/PGs curriculum.
   Conclusion: Dentists in the present study are aware about SCD. Clinical measures adopted by dentists and their confidence in treating these patients are suboptimal. Training in SCD should become integral part of future dental education.

AB  - Simple Summary Although images are more effective than words at communicating important conservation ideas, different aspects of these images have been demonstrated to have positive and negative effects on viewers' views towards wildlife and towards the organisation that posted the image. The most prevalent and engaging characteristics of wildlife photographs posted to Instagram in 2020 and 2021 were assessed using a quantitative content analysis, with Australian organisations as a case study. The findings show that conservation organisations can confidently share and post photographs that promote positive attitudes towards wildlife and the conservation organisation, and that Instagram posts can feature and promote a wide range of currently underrepresented species. Wildlife populations are vanishing at alarmingly high rates. This issue is being addressed by organisations around the world and when utilizing social media sites like Instagram, images are potentially more powerful than words at conveying crucial conservation messages and garnering public support. However, different elements of these images have been shown to potentially have either positive or negative effects on viewers' attitudes and behaviours towards wildlife and towards the organisation posting the image. This study used a quantitative content analysis to assess the most common and engaging elements of wildlife images posted to Instagram in 2020 and 2021, using Australian conservation organisations as a case study. A total of 670 wildlife images from the Instagram accounts of 160 conservation organisation Instagram accounts were coded and analysed. Results highlight that the most common image elements used included natural backgrounds, mammals and birds, and no human presence. In addition, it was found that the taxon of the animal featured in a post and the presence of humans did not impact engagement levels. Our findings highlight the potential for Instagram posts to feature and promote a wide range of currently underrepresented species, and for conservation organisations to be able to confidently share and post images that promote positive perceptions of both the animal and the conservation organisation.

AB  - Background:There is increasing evidence on the exponential use of technology-based social media in medical field that has led to a proliferation of unprofessional behaviors in digital realm. Educating, training, and changing the behaviors of healthcare professionals are essential elements to restrain the rising unprofessional incidents. Therefore, this research was designed to determine the impact of an interventional workshop on the medical and dental students in improving their professional behaviors in the digital world using the newly developed medical Education e-Professionalism (MEeP) framework. MethodsWe adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a benchmark reference which explores constructs intertwined with the mission-based MEeP framework; values (whistleblowing-raising concerns), behaviors (being responsible in the digital world) and identity (reflective practice in the digital world). A multicentre 3-phased mixed-method study was conducted using a pre-workshop survey, an online interventional workshop, and a post-workshop survey. SPSS and NVivo were the tools used for the data analysis. ResultsA total of 130 students registered for workshop out of which 120 completed the pre-workshop survey, 62 joined the workshop and 59 completed the workshop and post-workshop survey. From the whistleblowing - raising concern perspective, we found that attitudes and perceived behavioral control had a significant relationship. While for responsible in digital world category, attitude and perceived behavioral control had a significant bearing on the intentions. Third, for reflective practice, attitude and subjective norms significantly enhanced the intention of participants. A multi layered thematic analysis yielded four overarching themes of attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and intentions. Most students showed positive attitudes of being reflective, self-directed, and humane. Students realized the subjective norms had made them conscientious, self-aware and conformative. While perceived behavioural control manifested as identity and Intentions were heavily reliant on self-actualization. ConclusionOur mixed method study found that the interventional workshop using MEeP framework significantly improved attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and intentions. This study provides valuable evidence of MEeP framework evaluation using the theoretical underpinning of TPB by reporting positive changes in professional values, behaviors, and identities of undergraduate medical and dental students.

AB  - Although research demonstrates significant stigma toward individuals with mental illness, the relative importance of observed behavior and a psychiatric diagnosis in eliciting stigma remains poorly understood. Using video vignettes, two experiments (ns = 195 and 749) examined the effect of irritable (vs. calm) behavior and the presence (vs. absence) of a schizophrenia diagnosis on attitudinal, emotional, and behavioral dimensions of stigma toward a fictitious emergency room patient seeking migraine treatment. In line with labeling theory, irritable behavior resulted in greater blameworthy attributions for behavior, greater fear and anger, and less caring emotions. A psychiatric diagnosis increased endorsement of other stigmatizing attributions (e.g., substance use) as a reason for behavior. Behavior and diagnosis both resulted in patients being rated as less warm, competent, and predictable, and more dangerous. These independent variables also interacted to predict desire for social distance. A calm, nondiagnosed patient elicited the lowest desire for distance, an irritable patient with or without a diagnosis elicited equally high desire for distance, and a calm, diagnosed patient elicited moderate desire for distance. Mediational analyses show that dangerousness and fear may mediate the effect of a diagnosis on desire for distance. In all, results suggest both diagnostic labels and behavior result in stigma via different attitudinal and emotional mechanisms, and that individuals with a schizophrenia diagnosis face stigma even if behaving calmly. By enriching understanding of the relative importance of aberrant behavior and a psychiatric diagnosis on multiple dimensions of mental illness stigma, this work has implications for antistigma interventions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is highly contagious, and thus has become an emerging health crisis worldwide. The optimal strategies to prevent the spread of this disease are inconclusive, and therefore, the adopted measurements to combat COVID-19 varies in different countries. In mid-March and late-August 2020, we performed internet searches to collect relevant information, from sources such as the website of the World Health Organization. The epidemiological data of COVID-19 from several countries were collected and we found that Taiwan had a comparably successful story for combating the pandemic. As of mid-March, Taiwan had high rates of diagnostic testing (688.5 tests per million citizens) with a lower infection rate (49 cases, 2.1 cases per million people). As of late-August, there were 488 cases (20 cases per million people). Furthermore, Taiwanese government-guided strategies and hospital data were also reviewed. We summarized some important strategies to combat COVID-19, which include: (1) border control; (2) official media channel and press conferences; (3) name-based rationing system for medical masks; (4) TOCC-based rapid triage, outdoor clinics, and protective sampling devices; and (5) social distancing, delaying the start of new semesters, and religious assembly restriction. In conclusion, Taiwan had lower rates of COVID-19 compared with other countries, and Taiwan government-guided strategies contributed to the control of the disease's spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the effects of pandemic in the exercising practice and impact of the disease in patients with Fibromyalgia. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey answered by 1156 individuals with Fibromyalgia diagnosis. Questions were on epidemiology, social distancing habits, and exercise practice before and after COVID-19 pandemic, including subtypes of exercises (for resistance, flexibility, balance, and strength). The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire was applied. RESULTS: In the whole sample, 57.7% of individuals practiced exercises before pandemic; during pandemic, only 34.8% practiced and 39.6% left this practice. Among those taking quarantine (n=440), 52.9% used to do exercises prior to pandemic; in the pandemic, 28.1% (reduction of 53.2%). The median Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire among those who practiced exercises in the pandemic was 73.6 (61.1-83.2) and that among those who did not was 80.4 (71.9-86.9), with p<0.0001. The Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire did not change according to the type of physical exercise (p=0.27). CONCLUSION: A high proportion of patients with Fibromyalgia stopped exercising during COVID-19 pandemic; as a result, the impact of the disease during this period was worse among those not practicing exercises.

AB  - Purpose: To describe the epidemiology and outcome of the first 100 COVID-19 cases in Taiwan.
   Methods: We included the first 100 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in Taiwan. Demographic, clinical, epidemiological and laboratory data were extracted from outbreak investigation reports and medical records.
   Results: Illness onset of the 100 patients was during January 11 to March 16, 2020. Twenty-nine (29%) had at least one underlying condition and ten (10%) were asymptomatic. Seventy-one were imported, including four clusters. Twenty-nine were locally-acquired, including four clusters. The median days from onset to report was longer in locally-acquired cases (10 vs 3 days). Three patients died (case fatality rate 3%) and all of them had underlying conditions. As of May 13, 2020, 93 had been discharged in stable condition; the median hospital stay was 30 days (range, 10-79 days).
   Conclusion: The first 100 cases of COVID-19 in Taiwan showed the persistent threat of imported cases from different countries. Even though sporadic locally-acquired disease has been identified, through contact investigation, isolation, quarantine and implementation of social distancing measures, the epidemic is contained to a manageable level with minimal local transmission.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to identify current barriers to CPD and generate ideas for strategies to overcome these issues. Further aims were to gather an overview of respondents' understanding and opinions of CPD.
   Methods: An online survey was used to acquire information from departmental band 5 and band 6 radiographers. Descriptive statistical analysis and thematic analysis were performed to understand demographics and individuals' behaviours and experiences.
   Findings: Radiographers (n = 33) were sent an invitation via email providing a response rate of 75.8% (n = 25), with 20 females (80%) and 5 males (20%). 52% (n = 13) dedicate less than three hours a month. Participants highlighted time restraint as their biggest barrier to CPD. They also indicated a reluctance to use their own time to undertake work-related learning, despite exhibiting positive attitudes towards CPD. Radiographers see CPD as a vital and necessary, career-long learning process and they recognise the impacts on service provision. The notion of dedicated study time was unanimously suggested as the best approach to increase commitment to CPD.
   Conclusion: Radiographers demonstrated positive opinions of CPD, yet it was evident that many are not undertaking activities during their own time and it was acknowledged that opportunities during work time are limited. The provision of study time in work was suggested as an approach to improve radiographer's opportunities to complete CPD. Training sessions underlining the necessity of CPD in maintaining registration, what constitutes CPD and reinforcement of the benefits of systematic recording of CPD should be provided.

AB  - In order to study the influence of entrepreneurial passion on entrepreneurs' psychology and behavior, based on the theory of self-efficacy, a model of relationship between entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneurs' psychology and behavior was constructed, relevant hypotheses were proposed, and the promotion mechanism of entrepreneurial passion on entrepreneurial behavior and enterprise performance was analyzed. A survey of 300 entrepreneurs from Hangzhou, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Shaoxing, and Huzhou was conducted to verify the reliability of the questionnaire through statistical description and analysis. Then exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to test the correlation between variables. Finally, the structural equation was simulated to verify the correctness of the proposed hypothesis and model. The results show that the designed questionnaire has good reliability [the correction item total correlation coefficients (CITC) of all scales are greater than 0.3, values of Cronbach's alpha are higher than 0.6], the validity (all inventory accumulation explanation degree are higher than 50%) and the fitting (chi(2)/df values of all scales are less than 3, comparative fitness index (CFI), goodness of fitness index (GFI), and incremental fitness index (IFI) are greater than 0.9, root-mean-square error of approximation (RMSEA) value is less than 0.08). The direct effect of harmonious passion on entrepreneurial persistence and enterprise performance is not significant, while the direct effect of compulsive passion on entrepreneurial persistence and enterprise performance is significant. Harmonious passion (P< 0.001) and compulsive passion (P< 0.01) are significantly correlated with entrepreneurial self-efficacy, and self-efficacy plays a mediating role between entrepreneurial passion and entrepreneur psychology and behavior (P< 0.05), and the hypothesis proposed is basically valid. Therefore, entrepreneurial passion can positively guide the entrepreneurial persistence of entrepreneurs, and at the same time promote the performance of enterprises by stimulating the positive emotions of entrepreneurs. In addition, entrepreneurs can enhance their entrepreneurial role identity, maintain a positive attitude, stimulate creativity, and innovation, to enhance their sense of energy efficiency. The government can also promote successful business cases to build an inclusive and innovative social environment and stimulate the entrepreneurial passion of entrepreneurs. This study reveals the relationship between entrepreneurial passion, self-efficacy, and entrepreneur psychology and behavior, and extends the application of entrepreneurial passion in the field of entrepreneurship.

AB  - This paper has been written to assist researchers and practitioners to have an alternative view of investigating the effectiveness of personalized ads on social media. The current literature shows that consumers mostly have negative attitudes and perceptions towards social media advertising but on the other hand, few studies indicate that these ads are quite effective. The literature review, in this article, illustrates that relevance as a construct has not been given enough attention which possibly is the cause of the unclear conclusion about the role and usefulness of personalized ads, therefore, analysis is done on the relevance of personalized ads on social media. Henceforth, instead of relying on predetermined effectiveness measures, it is important to understand the role of relevance in the effectiveness of personalized social media ads (Proposition 1). Also, the literature indicates that there is an emotional experience that consumers go through that affects the way consumers respond to the personalized ads (Proposition 2). Furthermore, the analysis shows that the relevance of a personalized ad on social media is an antecedent of advertising value (Proposition 3).

AB  - Risky decision-making lies at the center of the COVID-19 pandemic and will determine future viral outbreaks. Therefore, a critical evaluation of major explanations of such decision-making is of acute practical importance. We review the underlying mechanisms and predictions offered by expectancy-value and dual-process theories. We then highlight how fuzzy-trace theory builds on these approaches and provides further insight into how knowledge, emotions, values, and metacognitive inhibition influence risky decision-making through its unique mental representational architecture (i.e., parallel verbatim and gist representations of information). We discuss how social values relate to decision-making according to fuzzy-trace theory, including how categorical gist representations cue core values. Although gist often supports health-promoting behaviors such as vaccination, social distancing, and mask-wearing, why this is not always the case as with status-quo gist is explained, and suggestions are offered for how to overcome the "battle for the gist" as it plays out in social media.

AB  - Seventy-five percent of children aged 12-23 months in Malawi have received all eight basic vaccinations-still leaving many children at risk. The Malawi Expanded Program on Immunization comprehensive Multi-Year Plan 2016-2020 reveals several challenges impeding immunization and disease surveillance efforts, such as the fact that non-governmental health organizations (NGHOs) and communities are minimally included in the planning, implementation, and monitoring of these activities. This article examines the extent to which NGHOs are promoting the use of social mobilization (SM) and community mobilizers (CMs) for sharing health information related to the eradication of polio, the importance of routine immunization, and the control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Data collection involved document analysis and interviews with 11 organizations in Malawi whose work contributes to the eradication of polio and control of measles and neonatal tetanus. Content analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data, whereas descriptive statistics were used to analyze the quantitative data. Non-governmental health organizations use a variety of approaches for SM, including mass media campaigns (radio and printed booklets), local skits and dramas, and home visits. Most NGHOs use training workshops and opinion leaders to impart knowledge and skills to CMs on immunization to eradicate polio and to control measles and neonatal tetanus. Major challenges faced by the NGHOs include negative attitudes toward campaigns and demotivation of CMs due to lack of financial incentives. The article concludes with a discussion of approaches to strengthen SM and the role of CMs by NGHOs.

AB  - This research examines how the media report on sentences given to those who commit serious crimes against children and how this impacts on public knowledge and attitudes. Three months of press and television coverage were analysed in order to establish the editorial lines that are taken in different sections of the media and how they are promoted by selective reporting of sentencing. Results indicate that a small number of very high profile crimes account for a significant proportion of reporting in this area and often, particularly in the tabloid press, important information regarding sentencing rationale is sidelined in favour of moral condemnation and criticism of the judiciary. Polling data indicate that public attitudes are highly critical of sentencing but also confused about the meaning of tariffs. The article concludes by discussing what can be done to promote a more informed public debate over penal policy in this area.

AB  - Background: Back pain, the most common type of pain reported by older adults, is often undertreated for reasons that are poorly understood, especially in minority populations. The objective of this study was to understand older adults' beliefs and perspectives regarding care-seeking for restricting back pain (back pain that restricts activity).
   Methods: We used data from a diverse sample of 93 older adults (median age 83) who reported restricting back pain during the past 3 months. A semi-structured discussion guide was used in 23 individual interviews and 16 focus groups to prompt participants to share experiences, beliefs, and attitudes about managing restricting back pain. Transcripts were analyzed in an iterative process to develop thematic categories.
   Results: Three themes for why older adults may not seek care for restricting back pain were identified: (1) beliefs about the age-related inevitability of restricting back pain, (2) negative attitudes toward medication and/or surgery, and (3) perceived importance of restricting back pain relative to other comorbidities. No new themes emerged in the more diverse focus groups.
   Conclusions: Illness perceptions (including pain-related beliefs), and interactions with providers may influence older adults' willingness to seek care for restricting back pain. These results highlight opportunities to improve the care for older adults with restricting back pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered before and during the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil.
   METHODS: This is an ecological, time series study based on data from the National Immunization Program. Differences between the median number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered in Brazil and in its regions before (from April/2019 to March/2020) and after (from April/2020 to March/2021) the implementation of social distancing measures in the country were assessed via the Mann-Whitney test. Prais-Winsten regression models were used for time series analyses.
   RESULTS: We found a reduction in the median number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered in Brazil and in its regions: North (-34.71%), Midwest (-21.72%), South (-63.50%), and Southeast (-34.42%) (p < 0.05). Series showed stationary behavior in Brazil and in its five regions during the covid-19 pandemic (p > 0.05). Brazilian states also showed stationary trends, except for two states which recorded an increasing trend in the number of administered yellow fever vaccine doses, namely: Alagoas State (before: beta = 64, p = 0.081; after: beta = 897, p = 0.039), which became a yellow fever vaccine recommendation zone, and Roraima State (before: beta = 68, p = 0.724; after: beta = 150, p = 0.000), which intensified yellow fever vaccinations due to a yellow fever case confirmation in a Venezuelan State in 2020.
   CONCLUSION: The reduced number of yellow fever vaccine doses administered during the covid-19 pandemic in Brazil may favor the reemergence of urban yellow fever cases in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SARS-CoV-2 and its related COVID-19 are now affecting people worldwide. The pandemic, started at the end of 2019 and spread in Europe and all over the world at the beginning of the 2020, is the biggest threat to the health and to the economy of all countries, since the time of Spanish Flu. A global effort is being made to counter the virus with social distancing and restrictions, but our habits and behavior have dramatically been modified. Hospital activity has changed, and Plastic Surgery is affected as well as other disciplines.
   MATERIALS, METHODS AND RESULTS: Our work describes the impact of the pandemic on a Plastic Surgery Unit in a tertiary care hospital and estimates the possible consequences in the near future. Elective procedures and consultations have been postposed and rescheduled, but we ensured treatment for life-threatening conditions and offered the best therapy, complying with the new safety standard to protect the patients and the healthcare providers. Media helped in keeping in touch the people, ensuring continuity in education and circulation of the data about SARS-CoV-2 research.
   CONCLUSION: We don't know yet what the overall cost of the crisis will be on the global economy and on the National Health Systems. Definitely, it will be a big challenge to face, both for the Governments, for the people, as for healthcare providers. However, to date, we should remind our responsibilities as doctors, as we can contribute with our efforts and our knowledge to ensure continuity of care and research.

AB  - Since severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spread from the early epicenter, Wuhan, to the rest of China, the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 might have evolved at different phases of the pandemic. We therefore compared the unique features among 62 coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) inpatients who contracted SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan (15 cases), exposed to the patients from Wuhan (26 cases), or acquired the disease without exposure to Wuhan patients (21 cases). Median incubation periods are 4.5 days (3-5) for Wuhan patients, 8 days (3-11) for those infected by Wuhan patients, and 12 days (7-13) for those without aforementioned experience. The disease onset dates are earliest for Wuhan patients and latest for those without exposure to Wuhan patients. Blood lymphocytes were lowest in Wuhan patients, lower in those affected by Wuhan patients, and modest reduced in remaining ones. Disease severity is worst for Wuhan patients, and modest for those without contact with Wuhan patients. Wuhan patients had longest (27 days, 18-28), those transmitted by Wuhan patients had intermediate (16 days, 8-23), and the rest of the patients had shortest (13 days, 8.5-22.5) hospital stay. Early viral exposure, older age, lymphocytopenia, and underlying conditions are risk factors which warrant aggressive intervention. Even though the virulence of SARS-CoV-2 appears decline over the course of serial transmissions, viral testing, contact tracing, social distancing, and face masking should be imposed on general public to contain viral dissemination from both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with this highly contagious disease.

AB  - Objective: To explore the promotion of discretionary foods/beverages and marketing strategies employed by the top three online food delivery services' (OFDS) Instagram accounts in three countries before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Design: Publicly available data were extracted for the top three OFDS Instagram accounts for Australia, United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) from March to May 2019 and 2020. Food/beverage items from posts were classified as 'discretionary' or from the five food groups (FFG) according to the Australian Dietary Guidelines. Marketing strategies were coded using an existing framework. Posts referring to COVID-19 were coded under four marketing strategies: (i) appropriating frontline workers; (ii) combatting the pandemic; (iii) selling social distancing; and (iv) accelerating digitalisation. Results: From 581 posts, 618 food/beverage items were shown, of which 69 % (427/618) were classified as discretionary. In 2019, the most used marketing strategies were product imagery (unbranded) (137/195, 70 %), links (111/195, 57 %) and sponsorships/partnerships (58/195, 30 %). In 2020, the most used were links (252/386, 68 %), product imagery (unbranded) (179/386, 49 %) and branding elements (175/386, 45 %). The most common COVID-19 marketing strategy was combatting the pandemic (76/123, 62 %) followed by selling social distancing (53/123, 43 %), appropriating frontline workers (34/123, 28 %) and accelerating digitalisation (32/123, 26 %). Conclusions: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, OFDS adapted their marketing, creating content with the theme of 'combatting the pandemic'. Due to the growing number of discretionary foods/beverages promoted on Instagram, this highlights the need for policy action to counter the potential influence social media platforms have on dietary behaviours.

AB  - Emergence of novel SARS-CoV-2 lineages are under the spotlight of the media, scientific community and governments. Recent reports of novel variants in the United Kingdom, South Africa and Brazil (B.1.1.28-E484K) have raised intense interest because of a possible higher transmission rate or resistance to the novel vaccines. Nevertheless, the spread of B.1.1.28 (E484K) and other variants in Brazil is still unknown. In this work, we investigated the population structure and genomic complexity of SARS-CoV-2 in Rio Grande do Sul, the southernmost state in Brazil. Most samples sequenced belonged to the B.1.1.28 (E484K) lineage, demonstrating its widespread dispersion. We were the first to identify two independent events of co-infection caused by the occurrence of B.1.1.28 (E484K) with either B.1.1.248 or B.1.91 lineages. Also, clustering analysis revealed the occurrence of a novel cluster of samples circulating in the state (named VUI-NP13L) characterized by 12 lineage defining mutations. In light of the evidence for E484K dispersion, co-infection and emergence of VUI-NP13 L in Rio Grande do Sul, we reaffirm the importance of establishing strict and effective social distancing measures to counter the spread of potentially more hazardous SARS-CoV-2 strains.

AB  - The study presents a longitudinal, qualitative and ethnographic investigation of language use and change within an informal Japanese alumni network. It utilises the author's corpus of past email correspondence among a social network of Japanese men between 2006 and 2009, and a subsequent interview in 2012. The study illuminates a struggle over the interpretation of the use of honorifics as a semiotic tool which could affect interpersonal relationships. More specifically, it illustrates the increasing use of honorifics by a member in enacting a social event organiser (**Kanji) role in this community and its multiple interpretations by other members reflecting various vantage points. Theoretically, it aims to demonstrate the multiple indexical meanings of Japanese honorifics by exploring the use of honorifics indexing neither deference nor social distance (the traditional interpretations of honorific use) but rather the functional enactment of a recognized social role and its associated register. This use of honorific language as 'functional rather than relational' has not been previously emphasised in the literature on Japanese honorific use. It also demonstrates the fundamental indeterminacy of indexical meanings in relation to various interpretive vantage points and evaluative moments. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: to investigate the factors associated with the practice of sex under the influence of drugs (chemsex) among Portuguese men who have sex with men during the period of social distancing to prevent the COVID-19. Method: online survey applied in May 2020 to a sample of 1,301 participants living in Portugal, recruited according to Respondent Driven Sampling and via social media Facebook (R). Descriptive and bivariate analyses were performed along with logistic regression to calculate adjusted Odds Ratio (ORa). Results: the prevalence of chemsex was 20.2%. The likelihood of practicing chemsex increased with group sex (ORa: 28.4, 95%CI 16.93-47.49); unprotected sex (ORa: 7.1 95%CI 4.57- 10.99); the use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent COVID-19 (ORa: 4.2, 95%CI 2.71- 6.39) and COVID-19 testing (ORa: 1.9, 95%CI 1.15-3.10). Conclusion: the practice of chemsex among men who have sex with men during the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal was very frequent and may support greater understanding of the role and impact of sexual behavior on the COVID-19 transmission rates and the current pandemic situation in Portugal.

AB  - The role of human factors in employee information security awareness (ISA) has garnered increased attention, with many researchers highlighting a potential link between problematic technology use and poorer online safety and security. This study aimed to present additional evidence for this by exploring the relationship between of Fear of Missing Out (FoMO) and ISA in employees. A total of 718 participants completed an online questionnaire that included a measure of FoMO, ISA, as well as the Big Five personality inventory. Participants who reported higher levels of FoMO had lower overall ISA, as well as having poorer knowledge, a more negative attitude, and engaged in riskier behaviors in relation to ISA. FoMO was also demonstrated to be the largest single negative predictor for ISA, above that of age, gender, and the key personality traits tested. The potential reasons for the influence of FoMO over ISA are discussed, as well as the implications for organizational information security.

TI  - Language revitalization, video, and mobile social media: A case study from the Khroskyabs language amongst Tibetans in China
T2  - LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Technology is by no means the most important channel to maintain a language, but it is an effective mode to communicate and interact using the language. As the lives of Khroskyabs speakers continue to be modernized, fewer and fewer aspects of those lives will take place in Khroskyabs. Furthermore, Khroskyabs speakers tend to express negative attitudes towards their language, especially in comparison to the dominant national language - Mandarin - and the local prestige language - Tibetan. The Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media project aims to expand the Khroskyabs language into a new domain amongst its speakers by creating a series of videos in the language and sharing them on social media-WeChat. The emerging use of social media such as WeChat provides a platform for language use in the contemporary context for unrecognized and under-resourced languages like Khroskyabs. This project aimed to address these issues, of domain exclusion and negative attitudes, through the production of mobile digital media that can be freely and conveniently shared via the social media platform WeChat for consumption of people in the Khroskyabs-speaking community.

FX  - I am a native speaker of Khroskyabs, from Siyuewu Village in Rngaba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. I was born and raised in the village and recently graduated from the University of Oregon with a linguistics degree. I began making videos about my community whilst in high school. I would like to thank and acknowledge my community for their ongoing support. I would also like to acknowledge the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (SCFCH) and the Northwest Indian Language Institute (NILI) at the University of Oregon for their financial and institutional support for the Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media Project. The writing of this article was supported by a seed-funding grant from the China Studies Research Centre at La Trobe University (Australia). In the near future, I hope to come up with many other ways to preserve Khroskyabs people's customs, culture, and language.

AB  - Explanations regarding the etiology of mental health difficulties have been found to affect public attitudes towards those who experience such difficulties. Utilizing a large, randomized parallel-groups design (N=1004), we examined how standardized differential explanations of voice-hearing influence public attitudes, attributions, and behavioral intentions towards voice-hearers. Additionally, we incorporated a behavioral outcome measure to examine whether reported behavioral intentions towards voice-hearers were related to responses towards an individual with a history of voice-hearing. Consistent with attribution theory, mediated pathways between attributions and intentions were identified: broadly, viewing the voice-hearer's behavior as dangerous, within their personal responsibility, and global was associated with more coercive intentions - and these were mediated by feelings of fear, anger, and pity. Reported behavioral intentions demonstrated small-to-moderate associations with our behavioral outcome measure. The findings suggest that explanations regarding the etiology of mental health difficulties that seek to reduce public attributions of dangerousness, personal responsibility, and globality may facilitate more helpful responses towards voice-hearers.

AB  - Purpose While research shows that organic labels are perceived positively for most food products, the findings are more ambiguous for wine. This may be due to the complexity of the product. Accordingly, the labelling effect might be influenced by people's prior knowledge of wines and their attitudes towards organic wines and thus be more pronounced for certain consumer groups. Providing insights into those moderators could help to steer people towards sustainable wine consumption. Therefore, this paper aims to investigate the effect of organic labelling on consumers' liking of, and their willingness to pay (WTP) for white wine, and the role of potential moderators. Design/methodology/approach A wine tasting experiment was conducted using a within-subjects design (n = 214). The mediating role of expected liking and the moderating roles of subjective knowledge and attitude towards organic wine were analysed using the MEMORE macro in SPSS. Findings The results do not confirm an overall positive halo effect of labelling on liking of organic wine. Nevertheless, a positive halo effect on actual liking was observed for those respondents who have a positive attitude towards organic wine. Furthermore, an overall positive effect of organic labelling on WTP was found. Mediation effects could not be confirmed. Originality/value This study used an experimental design that considers not only expected liking but also actual liking and WTP for organic wines. Using a moderation-mediation framework helps to better understand consumers' quality evaluation and WTP for organic wine. Finally, it could be shown that the organic halo is more complex for the product category of wine than others have previously stated.

AB  - Flipped classroom teaching has been used by many educators to promote active learning in higher education. This andragogy is thought to increase student engagement by making them more accountable for their learning and increase time on task in the classroom. While there are several systematic reviews that point to improved student results, it remains unclear if flipped classrooms have positive learning effects in physiology education. Flipped classroom teaching was introduced in two advanced physiology subjects (advanced neuroscience, semester 1, and cardiorespiratory and renal physiology, semester 2). Changing the mode of content delivery reduced the time students needed to spend listening to lectures by one-third, without sacrificing either learning content or academic standards. Higher pass rates were observed with larger number of students earning distinction and high-distinction grades. Statistically significant improvements in final grades were observed from both subjects (semester 1: 2017. 49.28 +/- 20.16; 2018, 53.29 +/- 19.77, t(268) = 2.058, P = 0.0405; semester 2: 2017, 58.87 +/- 21.19; 2018, 67.91 +/- 20.40, t(111) = 2.306, P = 0.023). Finally, students' perception of their learning experience remained at or above the university benchmarks (median score of >80% for all iterations of the subjects). While the most frequent and persistent area that students suggested could be improved was reduction of content, equal numbers of students commented that no improvement in the subjects was required. Despite the generally positive attitude to recorded didactic teaching content, classroom attendance remained very low, and students did not engage with the active learning content. This suggest that more emphasis needs to be placed on promoting class attendance by developing better active learning content.

AB  - Background Research illustrates that girls indicate more positive attitudes towards reading than boys. Gender differences are often presented in simplistic terms with 'all boys' represented as one homogenous group. Methods This study developed a survey to identify similarities and differences in boys' and girls' attitudes towards a range of school-related activities, including reading, and among boys themselves. The survey of 296 (f = 137, m = 159) 8- to 10-year-olds attending elementary schools in Australia was designed to identify the way attitudes towards school-related activities, including reading, may be interrelated. Cluster analysis identified nuances associated with socio-economic background, reading frequency and reading outcomes. Results Results indicated that girls and boys were represented similarly in the cluster groups that indicated positive enjoyment for books. However, there were significantly more girls than boys who enjoyed the social aspects of reading. A main finding was that many boys indicated they personally enjoyed reading, in contrast to previous studies, however, they did not necessarily enjoy the social aspects of reading with this finding particularly evident for boys from lower socio-economic backgrounds. Attitude towards reading was interrelated with the social aspects of reading and other school-related activities such as competition sports. Conclusions Outcomes from the survey cluster groupings made visible the multiplicity of differences among boys' attitudes towards reading that are often left out of simplistic representations in educational policies, teaching literature and the popular media. Findings suggest the need to open up educational discussions about the ways that reading attitudes may be embedded within, and related to, socio-economic location and other school-based experiences.

AB  - Background
   The knowledge of mothers with respect to health can affect their children's health either directly by promoting health practices or indirectly by influencing the health-related attitudes and behaviours of children.
   Aims
   The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of a group of mothers living in Saudi Arabia with regard to their children's oral health.
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study involved 614 mothers living across Saudi Arabia. An electronic web-based questionnaire was developed and distributed among the participants using different social media outlets.
   Results
   Almost 80 per cent of study participants were knowledgeable regarding their child's primary and permanent teeth's eruption time and agreed that their child's primary teeth were as important as the permanent teeth. The results also indicated that 79 per cent of the participants were aware that bottle feeding during sleep causes tooth decay and 73.7 per cent knew that the frequency of sugar consumption has a greater impact on oral health than the quantity of sugar consumed. Almost all participants (97 per cent) reported that they watch and help their children to brush their teeth. More than half (55.8 per cent) of them reported that they take their children for their first dental check-up when the children are one-year old, and almost three-quarters (73 per cent) reported they take their children to regular dental check-ups.
   Conclusion
   Most mothers had a positive attitude toward their children's oral health and were reasonably knowledgeable about it; however, further health education is required among some groups and in some aspects particularly those concerning oral and systemic health.

AB  - Background Determine attitude of young people to reproductive health issues can somewhat predict their behavior in this area. This helps us in planning future on reproductive health. The aim of this study was to determine the attitude of reproductive health and related factors among Iranian students in public universities in Iran.
   Method A cross-sectional study was carried out. The tool was developed based on a literature review to find out about reproductive health attitudes and sociodemographic factors associated. The face and content validity of the questionnaire was performed using expert judgment. Cronbach's coefficient and test-retest were used to determine the reliability. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software by independent t test, ANOVA, and multiple linear regression.
   Results Out of 461 respondents, the majority of students were nonmedical sciences (81.1%). The main sources of information for reproductive health awareness were the media (40%); 54.9% disagreed with having premarital sex in both sexes, while only 36% agreed to postpone sexual activity until marriage in order to prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Moreover, 64% believed that contraception would cause infertility in the future. The majority found the need for reproductive health services and education essential for single youth. Multiple regression showed a poor reproductive health attitude in nonmedical students, families who did not talk about boy-girl relationships, as well as in satellite users and hookah consumers.
   Conclusion The students' level of attitude on reproductive health was not satisfactory. Intervention programs related to reproductive health taking into account the cultural aspects of Iranian society can protect young people from risky behaviors and unwanted pregnancies by creating a positive attitude.

AB  - Background: Limited documentation exists on the effectiveness of psychoeducational group (PEG) versus support group (SG) interventions among breast cancer patients during primary care. Support group is a component of the hospitals' routine breast cancer care. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate which of these approaches provides the greatest benefits to participants, particularly to women with low optimism (pessimists). The primary outcomes investigated here were anxiety, depression, and mental adjustment to cancer. Methods: A total of 367 women with early-stage breast cancer were randomized to the PEG or SG intervention starting 1 to 8 weeks after surgery. The PEG intervention included health education, enhancement of problem-solving skills, stress management, and psychological support. Results: Participants in both groups showed improvement over time; however, no significant differences in emotional distress were found. The PEG participants exhibited more positive attitude at 2 and 6 months (P < .001) and less helplessness/hopelessness (P = .01) at 2 months compared with the SG participants. However, no significant differences were found between the groups at 12 months. Pessimists did not benefit more from attending the PEG than they did from attending the SG. Conclusion: Both groups showed improvement in emotional distress and coping over time. Although the results were limited, the PEG intervention seems to enhance short-term, but not long-term, adaptive coping. Implications for practice: Psychoeducational group intervention yields benefits during the difficult period when patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Thus, the hospital's standard group interventions have been changed to include more health education and stress management, but within the same time frame as the original SG.

AB  - Human rationality-the ability to behave in order to maximize the achievement of their presumed goals (i.e., their optimal choices)-is the foundation for democracy. Research evidence has suggested that voters may not make decisions after exhaustively processing relevant information; instead, our decision-making capacity may be restricted by our own biases and the environment. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which humans in a democratic society can be rational when making decisions in a serious, complex situation-voting in a local political election. We believe examining human rationality in a political election is important, because a well-functioning democracy rests largely upon the rational choices of individual voters. Previous research has shown that explicit political attitudes predict voting intention and choices (i.e., actual votes) in democratic societies, indicating that people are able to reason comprehensively when making voting decisions. Other work, though, has demonstrated that the attitudes of which we may not be aware, such as our implicit (e.g., subconscious) preferences, can predict voting choices, which may question the well-functioning democracy. In this study, we systematically examined predictors on voting intention and choices in the 2014 mayoral election in Taipei, Taiwan. Results indicate that explicit political party preferences had the largest impact on voting intention and choices. Moreover, implicit political party preferences interacted with explicit political party preferences in accounting for voting intention, and in turn predicted voting choices. Ethnic identity and perceived voting intention of significant others were found to predict voting choices, but not voting intention. In sum, to the comfort of democracy, voters appeared to engage mainly explicit, controlled processes in making their decisions; but findings on ethnic identity and perceived voting intention of significant others may suggest otherwise.

AB  - In this article, the authors describe the development and dissemination of a film-based educational intervention to reduce negative attitudes toward gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and people living with HIV/AIDS in Latino communities, with a focus on youth. The intervention, Tal Como Somos/Just as We Are, is based on stigma and attribution theories, extensive formative research, and community input. Evaluation findings among educators and school youth suggest the film has the potential to effectively influence attitudes toward gay and bisexual men, transgender women, and people living with HIV/AIDS. The film and intervention are being disseminated using diffusion of innovations theory through community-based organizations, schools, television broadcasting, and film festivals.

AB  - Introduction Despite carrying a disproportionately high burden of depression, patients in low-income countries lack access to effective care. The collaborative care model (CoCM) has robust evidence for clinical effectiveness in improving mental health outcomes. However, evidence from real-world implementation of CoCM is necessary to inform its expansion in low-resource settings. Methods We conducted a 2-year mixed-methods study to assess the implementation and clinical impact of CoCM using the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme protocols in a primary care clinic in rural Nepal. We used the Capability Opportunity Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) implementation research framework to adapt and study the intervention. To assess implementation factors, we qualitatively studied the impact on providers' behaviour to screen, diagnose and treat mental illness. To assess clinical impact, we followed a cohort of 201 patients with moderate to severe depression and determined the proportion of patients who had a substantial clinical response (defined as >= 50% decrease from baseline scores of Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) to measure depression) by the end of the study period. Results Providers experienced improved capability (enhanced self-efficacy and knowledge), greater opportunity (via access to counsellors, psychiatrist, medications and diagnostic tests) and increased motivation (developing positive attitudes towards people with mental illness and seeing patients improve) to provide mental healthcare. We observed substantial clinical response in 99 (49%; 95% CI: 42% to 56%) of the 201 cohort patients, with a median seven point (Q1:-9, Q3:-2) decrease in PHQ-9 scores (p<0.0001). Conclusion Using the COM-B framework, we successfully adapted and implemented CoCM in rural Nepal, and found that it enhanced providers' positive perceptions of and engagement in delivering mental healthcare. We observed clinical improvement of depression comparable to controlled trials in high-resource settings. We recommend using implementation research to adapt and evaluate CoCM in other resource-constrained settings to help expand access to high-quality mental healthcare.

AB  - Communication plans are fundamental for the success of conservation programs, especially when dealing with alien species. In a media-saturated society the effectiveness of communication could be evaluated through the information reported by the media, as an indicator of public attitudes towards a particular issue. We evaluated the effectiveness of a communication campaign by analysing the perception of the media towards management activities to control grey squirrel populations. A media content analysis was performed to classify the news in categories regarding their attitude towards the project. A total of 166 articles were analysed, which corresponds to a mean of one article every 9 days along the 4-years project. News followed peaks of interest in specific periods, generally related with milestones of the project. Half of the negative news regarded management activities in an urban area, despite the softer management approach adopted, with surgical sterilization of animals instead of their euthanasia after live-trapping. A reinforcement of the communication focused in Liguria inverted the trend of negative news which decreased over time, indicating the effectiveness of communication activities. Public support is fundamental for the successful implementation of eradication and control plans. Considering the role of media in informing and driving public opinion, media monitoring is routinely included in the development of management projects. We suggest that a media content analysis can be used as a performance indicator to evaluate the communication effectiveness of conservation projects, helping to identify negative trends so to proactively react.

TI  - Exploring the Complex Pathways between the Fear of COVID-19 and Preventive Health Behavior among Nigerians: Mediation and Moderation Analyses
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF TROPICAL MEDICINE AND HYGIENE
LA  - English
AB  - Since COVID-19 currently has no proven cure but high morbidity and mortality, many people are living in fear of the virus along with other mental health challenges induced by the lockdowns and social distancing. Hence, this study aims to provide evidence on the co-occurrence and inter-relations between the fear of COVID-19, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and psychological distress in adherence to preventive health behavior among Nigerians. It also seeks to determine whether this process differs for men and women. The sample comprised 1,172 consenting young adults (mean age 5 22.9 6 6.6 years, 54.5% females) selected using a snowball sampling technique. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the mediation model of post-traumatic stress symptoms and psychological distress as parallel and serial mediators of the relationship between the fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior. The indirect effect of the fear of COVID-19 on preventive health behavior across gender was tested using moderation analysis. Results showed that post-traumatic stress symptoms and psychological distress serially and fully, in causal order, mediated the association between the fear of COVID-19 and preventive health behavior, and gender moderated the mediation effects. The research provides evidence that the fear of COVID-19 could trigger preventive health behavior through post-traumatic stress symptoms but reduces it through psychological distress, whereas the fear of COVID-19 has a slightly more positive impact on preventive health behavior among men.

AB  - Undergraduate women (N = 143) completed self-reports on exercise behavior, body orientation, body appreciation, and body-related talk. Results showed that conversations about weight loss/dieting and conversations about exercise differentially predicted body appreciation. Importantly, multiple regression analyses showed that the relationship between talk type and body appreciation was explained by the object-process dichotomy: Conversations about exercise oriented women to consider what their bodies can do which, in turn, predicted appreciation of one's body. In contrast, the relationship between conversations about weight loss/dieting and body appreciation was mediated by negative attitudes about one's body but not by an object orientation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Today, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has evolved into a modern procedure with a benign side effect profile, which is performed under anesthesia and the administration of muscle relaxants, but the negative view of this treatment is held not only by the general lay public but also by the medical professionals including nurses. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge about and attitude toward ECT in nursing students.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study in which knowledge about ECT and attitude toward this treatment were assessed in nursing students using ECT knowledge and attitude questionnaires. Statistical analysis was carried out using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences.
   RESULTS: A total of 54 3rd year nursing students were included in the study. More than half (59.3%) reported the primary source of information as media. None of our students had full knowledge about ECT, i.e., a score of 31. The mean knowledge score was 16.22 +/- 3.36 with a range of 10-21. They were more knowledgeable about the consent, side effects, and procedure part of the questionnaire compared to indications and effectiveness parts of it. A negative attitude toward ECT was highly prevalent. The mean score on attitude questionnaire was -7.5 +/- 3.61 with a range of 0--12. More than three-quarters of our subjects had a negative attitude in 12 out of 16 items. The total score on the knowledge questionnaire and total score on the attitude questionnaire were correlated positively (r = 0.387, P < 0.004).
   CONCLUSION: There is a deficiency in knowledge and highly prevalent negative attitude toward ECT among nursing students, which needs to be rectified so that ECT becomes a more acceptable treatment procedure.

AB  - What happens when affective displays deviate from normative expectations? In this study, participants evaluated target individuals displaying flat, incongruent, or congruent expressions seemingly in response to pictures eliciting positive, neutral, or negative affect. Relative to targets who displayed normative reactions, those who violated affective norms (affective deviants) were rated more negatively on various dimensions of social judgment. Participants also preferred greater social distance from affective deviants, reported more moral outrage in response to them, and inferred that these targets did not share their moral values. Incongruent affect resulted in more negative social judgment than did flat affect, and this relationship was moderated by stimulus valence. Finally, the relationship between targets' affective expressions and participants' avoidant intentions was mediated by the extent to which participants thought the targets shared their moral values. These findings demonstrate the interpersonal costs of affective deviance, revealing the pervasiveness and force of affective norms.

AB  - Previous research on media framing of wildfire has chiefly been concerned with the nature of wildfire in the context of climate change and with framing effects on policy and public opinion. Empirical studies on media content, hence what is mediated to crisis managers and the public concerning authorities' and the public's response, seem to be largely missing. This is remarkable, given that the media represent main sources of information that may influence crisis management and shape public opinion. Thus, the aim of this study was to identify key media frames relating to portrayals of public and authority responses during and after a wildfire crisis. The study is based on media articles from two time periods: immediately after the fire and 1 year later. We used a thematic method of analysis (TA), thus an inductive, "bottom-up" approach. A core frame, Responsibility/accountability is identified, underpinned by two sub-themes. One sub-theme relates to the causes of the fire and its escalation, revealing a number of different interrelated blame frames. The second sub-theme refers to management of the crisis, reflecting both authorities' and citizens' responses. The deficiencies of the former are implicitly suggested to have forced citizens to act to compensate for their inadequacy. The main theoretical contribution is the identification of an interrelationship between frames in relation to different groups of individuals responding to a crisis, pointing to a more complex view of framing effects. In addition, results show how media tend to assess crisis management based on idealistic criteria, inevitably making the evaluation negative. This contributes to an understanding of how media blame frames, thus "blame games," may unfold. Practical implications of these results are discussed.

AB  - Cataclysmic changes by the gradual spread of COVID-19 have triggered the interest of scientists, scholars, academicians, and linguists in analyzing the discourse related to the spread of the pandemic. The descriptions made by all of these scholars not only contribute to language with linguistic innovations but also cause the emergence of human attitudes and behaviours. At the same time, the issues raised through the language used during the challenging time of such crises shape and reveal several human schemas of language, discourse, society, and culture. Several studies on past situations of diseases and calamities have provided critical analyses of these schemas of difficult times in human history. Discourses through various linguistic practices in this regard play a crucial role in shaping and demonstrating the schemas of the crisis hit societies. Media discourse, specifically, has hidden powers to exercise, identify and report various socio-cultural issues. The current study focuses on finding the themes of socio-cultural attitudes and behaviours that emerged from newspaper editorials published in Pakistani newspapers in February, March and April, 2020. To achieve this goal, the corpus -driven analysis of 198 newspaper editorials having 215,842 words was conducted. The study revealed various themes that prevailed in this pre-vaccination period of COVID-19 in Pakistan. The themes included the metaphoric use of the language such as battle, corps and frontline; racism while naming the virus as China virus or Hazara virus; conspiracy theories assumed to be associated with COVID-19 spread i.e. suspected involvement of Bill Gates and the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), US and World Health Organization (WHO); negligence on the part of people; and criticism on government for health facilities and implications of globalization. It is concluded, based on these findings, that media representation of pre -vaccination phase of COVID-19 in Pakistan is loaded with unhealthy discourse which could have been avoided in order to shape positive attitudes and behaviours of the masses.

AB  - The global crisis caused by the outbreak of a novel coronavirus and the associated disease (COVID-19) has changed working conditions due to social-distancing policies. Many workers started to use new technologies at work, including social media applications. In this longitudinal study, we investigated the potential stress effects of social media communication (SMC) at work. Based on our integrative theoretical model, we expected that SMC at work would burden some workers, but those who were accustomed to SMC at work would be better off when the crisis started. We collected a nationally representative sample of Finnish workers before (N = 1308) and during (N = 1081) the COVID-19 crisis. Outcome measures included technostress and work exhaustion. Multilevel linear mixed-effects regression models investigated formal and informal SMC at work. Covariates included cyberbullying at work, social media usage, personality, occupational status, and sociodemographic factors. Results showed that formal SMC increased and predicted higher technostress. However, technostress and work exhaustion decreased among workers already accustomed to using SMC at work before the crisis. The results indicate a disparity in workers' resilience during remote work and highlight a need for organizational level support.

AB  - Timber out-grower schemes have proved to be one of the most profitable enterprises for rural households. No wonder, several analysts and researchers regard them as an alternative model to avoid problems of displacement and create 'win-win' outcomes for both rural communities and private investors in forestry. However, understanding farmers' knowledge, attitudes and perceptions towards tree out-grower schemes plays a key role in farmers' adoption of the interventions. This study examined these farmers' attributes towards out-grower schemes in selected districts of Malawi. Data were collected from 300 farmers who were randomly selected between September and October 2017 through semi-structured interviews and focus group discussions. The results revealed that 82% of the respondents participated in timber out-grower schemes, piloted by WVI and ICRAF. Based on a median score of 4.75 (IQR 4-5), respondents were strongly agreed on their knowledge on timber out-grower schemes as a basis for adopting the intervention. Using the cumulative Cube-root frequency method of stratification, the results revealed that more than half (51%) of the respondents belonged to the high category, and thus had high knowledge of timber out-grower schemes, whereas 32% and 17% had very high and medium levels of knowledge, respectively. The study also revealed that 79.3% of the respondents had a positive attitude towards out-grower schemes. Pearson correlation analysis revealed a positive, significant relationship between marital status (r = 0.081), household size (r = 0.062), education (r = 0.051) and knowledge of the respondents on timber out-grower schemes. A significant positive relationship was also observed between marital status (r = 0.156), household size (0.178), education (0.002), ethnic group (0.151) and attitudes of the respondents towards timber out-grower schemes. However, a negative relationship between knowledge and attitude was revealed (r = -0.534). The study therefore concludes that socio-economic factors, such as gender, education, ethnic group and household size, should be considered in upscaling timber out-grower schemes in Malawi.

AB  - Given the omnipresence and profoundness of the ongoing pandemic from the Coronavirus disease 2019, its potential spread can be minimized through social distancing. However, this practice causes increasing difficulties and undesirability of traditional transactions or interactions. Accordingly, various manufacturing firms around the world have become more committed not only to accelerating the development of digital technologies, but also to integrating them with existing processes. In this study, we address an important issue of how manufacturing firms can adapt to the ever-changing volatility and unpredictable global business environment, and achieve sustainable growth by developing a strong supply chain management capability. Two specific interrelated research questions are considered: (1) How do supply chain management capabilities contribute to firm environmental performance; and (2) What are the sources of such capabilities? In so doing, we integrate various forms of digital innovation into a supply chain management capability logic to explore their antecedents and consequences. By using survey data from 272 manufacturing firms in China, we examine the relationship between three key forms of digital innovation (i.e., product, platform, and service) and firm environmental performance. Results show that digital product, platform, and service innovations all have positive contributions to supply chain management capability. In turn, supply chain management capabilities have a partial mediating effect between digital product innovation and firm environmental performance, but a full mediating effect between digital platform and service innovations and firm environmental performance.

AB  - There is prejudice against Muslims in many nations, including Japan. This prejudice would be related to biased mental representations of Muslim faces. Moreover, in 2015, the increased news coverage linking Muslims to terrorism in Japan would have enhanced such negative mental representations. In the present study, Japanese participants were asked to imagine Muslim men, and from two faces with a random noise pattern added, participants were instructed to choose the face they imagined to be more Muslim. Typical Muslim facial representations were visualized in 2015, 2016, and 2017 by averaging all selected noise patterns using reverse correlation. The visualized representations were evaluated using the dimensions of warmth, competence, and basic emotions. The results showed that the warmth scores for the visualized facial representation were lower in 2015 than in 2017, whereas competence scores did not differ between the representations in 2015, 2016, and 2017. "Angry" and "disgusted" scores for the facial representation in 2015 were higher than those in 2017, whereas "happy" scores in 2015 were lower than those in 2017. The decreased "angry" score and increased "happy" score predicted an increase in the impression of warmth from 2015 to 2017.

AB  - Background. Media reports on armed fights or terror attacks introduce reminders of death into people's daily lives. When people feel non-specific threats (mortality salience) or specific threats (intergroup threats), they may demonstrate unfavorable attitudes toward national outgroups. The issue is mostly analyzed today in line with Terror Management Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory.
   Objective. To examine such threats in the Russian context, and the impact of mortality salience (MS) on attitudes toward national outgroups that induced different levels of perceived intergroup threat.
   Design. In two studies, participants watched films and completed questionnaires about social distance, social thermometer, and trust toward "more or less threatening" countries. In Study 1, 120 Russian students were assigned to six groups via experimental design: 3 (MS: terrorist attacks in Europe, terrorist attacks in Russia, or a control group watching a video about dental treatment) x 2 (country: Ukraine and Belarus). In Study 2, 122 participants were similarly divided into six groups, evaluating attitudes toward the USA and China.
   Results. Study 1 showed that MS mostly increased unfavorable attitudes toward a country perceived as more threatening (Ukraine) than toward one perceived as less threatening (Belarus). Study 2 indicated the same effect on attitudes toward both more (the USA) and less (China) threatening outgroups.
   Conclusion. The results identified contradictory tendencies in MS effect, in line with Terror Management Theory and Intergroup Threat Theory. The findings could be used in improving relationships from an international perspective.

KW  - STUDENTS
AB  - Background
   The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic led to far-reaching restrictions of social and professional life, affecting societies all over the world. To contain the virus, medical schools had to restructure their curriculum by switching to online learning. However, only few medical schools had implemented such novel learning concepts. We aimed to evaluate students' attitudes to online learning to provide a broad scientific basis to guide future development of medical education.
   Methods
   Overall, 3286 medical students from 12 different countries participated in this cross-sectional, web-based study investigating various aspects of online learning in medical education. On a 7-point Likert scale, participants rated the online learning situation during the pandemic at their medical schools, technical and social aspects, and the current and future role of online learning in medical education.
   Results
   The majority of medical schools managed the rapid switch to online learning (78%) and most students were satisfied with the quantity (67%) and quality (62%) of the courses. Online learning provided greater flexibility (84%) and led to unchanged or even higher attendance of courses (70%). Possible downsides included motivational problems (42%), insufficient possibilities for interaction with fellow students (67%) and thus the risk of social isolation (64%). The vast majority felt comfortable using the software solutions (80%). Most were convinced that medical education lags behind current capabilities regarding online learning (78%) and estimated the proportion of online learning before the pandemic at only 14%. In order to improve the current curriculum, they wish for a more balanced ratio with at least 40% of online teaching compared to on-site teaching.
   Conclusion
   This study demonstrates the positive attitude of medical students towards online learning. Furthermore, it reveals a considerable discrepancy between what students demand and what the curriculum offers. Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic might be the long-awaited catalyst for a new "online era" in medical education.

AB  - Education is undergoing profound changes due to permanent technological innovations. This paper reports the results of a pilot study aimed at developing, implementing and evaluating the course, "Applicative Use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) in Medicine," upon medical school entry. The Faculty of Medicine, University of Belgrade, introduced a curriculum reform in 2014 that included the implementation of the course, "Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine" for first year medical students. The course was designed using a blended learning format to introduce the concepts of Web-based learning environments. Data regarding student knowledge, use and attitudes towards ICT were prospectively collected for the classes of 2015/16 and 2016/17. The teaching approach was supported by multimedia didactic materials using Moodle LMS. The overall quality of the course was also assessed. The five level Likert scale was used to measure attitudes related to ICT. In total, 1110 students were assessed upon medical school entry. A small number of students (19%) had previous experience with e-learning. Students were largely in agreement that informatics is needed in medical education, and that it is also useful for doctors (4.1 +/- 1.0 and 4.1 +/- 0.9, respectively). Ability in informatics and use of the Internet in education in the adjusted multivariate regression model were significantly associated with positive student attitudes toward ICT. More than 80% of students stated that they had learned to evaluate medical information and would use the Internet to search medical literature as an additional source for education. The majority of students (77%) agreed that a blended learning approach facilitates access to learning materials and enables time independent learning (72%). Implementing the blended learning course, "Applicative Use of ICT in Medicine," may bridge the gap between medicine and informatics upon medical school entry. Students displayed positive attitudes towards using ICT and gained skills necessary to function effectively in an information-rich environment.

AB  - During the time of the coronavirus, strict prevention policies, social distancing, and limited contact with others were enforced in Greece. As a result, Twitter and other social media became an important place of interaction, and conversation became online. The aim of this study is to examine Twitter discussions around COVID-19 in Greece. Twitter was chosen because of the critical role it played during the global health crisis. Tweets were recorded over four time periods. NodeXL Pro was used to identify word pairs, create semantic networks, and analyze them. A lexicon-based sentiment analysis was also performed. The main topics of conversation were extracted. "New cases" are heavily discussed throughout, showing fear of transmission of the virus in the community. Mood analysis showed fluctuations in mood over time. Positive emotions weakened and negative emotions increased. Fear is the dominant sentiment. Timely knowledge of people's sentiment can be valuable for government agencies to develop efficient strategies to better manage the situation and use efficient communication guidelines in Twitter to disseminate accurate, reliable information and control panic.

AB  - The recent COVID-19 pandemic and related social distancing measures have significantly changed worldwide employment conditions. In developed economies, institutions and organizations, both public and private, are called upon to reflect on new organizational models of work and human resource management, which - in fact - should offer workers sufficient flexibility in adapting their work schedules remotely to their personal (and family) needs. This study aims to explore, within a Job Demands-Resources framework, whether and to what extent job demands (workload and social isolation), organizational job resources (perceived organizational support), and personal resources (self-efficacy, vision about the future and commitment to organizational change) have affected workers' quality of life during the pandemic, taking into account the potential mediating role of job satisfaction and perceived stress. Using data from a sample of 293 workers, we estimate measurement and structural models, according to the Item Response Theory and the Path analysis frameworks, which allow us to operationalize the latent traits and study the complex structure of relationships between the latent dimensions. We inserted in the model as control variables, the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the respondents, with particular emphasis on gender differences and the presence and age of children. The study offers insights into the relationship between remote work and quality of life, and the need to rethink human resource management policies considering the opportunities and critical issues highlighted by working full-time remotely.

AB  - The popularity of televised political debates is growing, attracting millions of viewers. However, evidence that such debates can shift voters' attitudes is mixed and the impact on voters' preference is also mixed. In addition, the evidence comes mostly from presidential elections in the United States and almost exclusively from established democracies. A call for comparative research in new democracies has been made several times. Our research answers the call and contributes to this debate by comparing two experimental studies based on first-order national elections and second-order European Parliament elections in Slovakia. To our knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been performed in a post-communist EU country. We employed a pre-test/post-test experimental design in a controlled environment with participants randomly assigned to both groups. The results show that debate exposure has a stronger effect on opinions about candidates' leadership skills, credibility, and economic competence if the candidates were previously unknown. Familiarity with the candidates and pre-existing preferences also function as a block to preference change. Almost all of our findings are in line with previous research originating from Western contexts. Therefore, we conclude that the causal mechanism linking debate exposure to voters' preference and attitudes in the post-communist context is similar to that in Western countries with long-term democratic traditions.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of employees' words about their organization's corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on external publics' attitudes and behaviors toward the organization. Specifically, it examines how the valence (positive vs. negative) of employees' words regarding a CSR campaign interacts with the type of channel (face-to-face vs. social media) of employees' communication behaviors, and how these factors affect external publics' perceived authenticity of the organization's CSR, corporate attitudes, and purchasing intentions, respectively. An online experiment among 221 general consumers in the United States was conducted. The results demonstrated that negative messages regarding CSR distributed by employees in face-to-face communication decreased publics' favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions to a greater extent than that distributed via social media (i.e., Facebook). However, the effect of communication channel became insignificant when positive messages regarding CSR were shared by employees. The results further showed that perceived authenticity mediated the effects of channel and message valence on publics' attitudes and behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications for CSR practices and employee communication are discussed.

AB  - In Brazil, the Covid-19 pandemic is triggering tensions in health management that provoke, among others, a political crisis led by the federal government, characterized by negationist postures regarding the seriousness of the disease and lack of focus on public health policies. There is also an information crisis enabled by the political strategy of dissemination of disinformation that disqualifies scientific parameters and the role of the press. In this context, churches and Christian religious leaders who have risen to power in recent years play a fundamental role, which allows them to be analyzed from their performance as a public religion. By decreeing the closure of religious temples, as a preventive measure for the advance of the disease, evangelical-pentecostal churches insert into the public debate the defense of the essentiality of religious service as a fundamental dimension for society, conferring support and legitimacy to the action of the government. In this sense, this paper argues that the Brazilian scenario, when compared to other Latin American countries, is an outlier. Based on ethnographic research within online media and the religious media circuit, this paper maintains that, nationally, religion takes the lead in the political and information crisis. At the same time, this study affirms that, approaching other countries of the region, the churches reinvented mediatized religious practices, deriving from the social distancing and isolation, and offered new meanings and religious moralities around the health crisis.

AB  - Background As the novel coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) continues its pandemic surge globally along with its social distancing norms, the physical conduction of practical examinations for medical graduates and postgraduates has become difficult. Software-based systems and social media platforms could provide alternatives for ensuring regular medical education and exam-oriented assessments. In this context, we evaluated our own experience with virtual conduction of semester practical exams for medical graduates. Material and Methods This prospective study was conducted in Gynaecology and Obstetrics department. We employed live streaming educational video conferencing software for virtual consultation between medical students, patients (case presentations), internal and external examiners. The outcomes were evaluated in terms of conduction of various components of practical examination-Viva, case presentations, instruments, slides, specimen examination. Statistical analysis was performed by descriptive statistics through Microsoft Excel sheet. Results Virtual conduction examination/evaluation was performed on 150 medical students by examiners from a distant location. No problems occurred except few short duration (less than 5 min) interruptions due to internet connectivity issues. 125/150 (83.5%) of medical students and all examiners (2 internal and 2 external) expressed satisfaction with virtual medical evaluation. Conclusions 83.5% of medical students and all examiners expressed satisfaction with virtual medical evaluation during this COVID pandemic. Our findings suggest that virtual conduction of practical annual medical exams through virtual video conferencing platform appears to be an optimal alternative during COVID pandemic.

AB  - Purpose To support the wellbeing of both patients and their families, our aim was to investigate the satisfaction of non-COVID in- and out-patients regarding safety measures implemented at our radiology unit of a transplant institute against COVID infection. Materials and Methods Over a five-month period, adult patients' feedback was obtained by a questionnaire on the fear of contracting COVID-19 during a radiology examination, the perceived delay in treatment, and the following safety measures implemented: modified schedules to limit the number of patients in the waiting area and to maximize social distancing; assistance by staff when visitors were not admitted; cleaning and disinfection of machines; mask wearing and hand hygiene of staff; and staff advice on hand hygiene and infection control precautions. Results Over a five-month period, our preliminary results (387 patients) showed general patient satisfaction (99.1%) with safety measures applied at our radiology unit. Patients were satisfied with distancing and assistance by staff (100%), cleaning and disinfection (91%), mask wearing and hand hygiene of the staff (97%), and staff advice (94%). There was some criticism of the perceived delay in treatment (7.3%) and in the scheduling of the waiting list (5.4%), with 5.4% fearing contracting the virus. Patients' awareness of safety measures and confidence in the hospital preparedness policy was perceived by all interviewers, and 100% appreciated being questioned. Conclusion The feedback given by the non-COVID patient helps to measure the quality in health care, to improve the quality service, and to protect and satisfy more vulnerable patients, also during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand the ethnocentric tendencies of Indian consumers towards foreign multi-brand retailers (FMBRs), and the influence that such ethnocentrism has on their attitudes towards, and future purchasing behaviour from, these international retailers.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper used a mall intercept method with a randomised data collection process to secure data from 119 organised retail shoppers in a major metropolitan Indian city. The analysis was carried out using analysis of covariance, bootstrapping mediation, multiple regression analysis, and Johnson's relative weight analysis.
   Findings Two main results are as follows: concern for livelihoods of small retailers and a perception that earnings of foreign retailers are unjust are revealed as the most significant drivers of negative attitude towards FMBRs, and although high ethnocentric customers have a strong negative attitude towards FMBRs, they are open to the idea of making future purchases of goods that are not available with small retailers, from the foreign retail outlets.
   Research limitations/implications The study sample is from a single metropolitan city, albeit one which serves as a miniature version of the Indian society. As a limitation, the results might not be generalisable to small, non-metropolitan Indian towns.
   Practical implications These results provide valuable input regarding the marketing strategy and sustainability of foreign retailers planning to launch operations in India. For example, FMBRs should position themselves as not being in competition with existing small retail shops by offering a different array of products. Further, younger and more educated Indians are the least ethnocentric towards FMBRs, thus making them an attractive target segment.
   Originality/value Extant research has studied consumer ethnocentrism of Indian consumers towards foreign brands and products, but not towards FMBRs. This paper attempts to fill that research gap.

AB  - Proceeding globalization and the increase in global mobility entail that a growing proportion of people in economically developed countries have a migration background, so that cultural diversity has become an integral characteristic of many societies. Consequently, national identifications and attitudes towards immigrants are gaining importance in both international and intra-societal contexts. Previous studies revealed that in some countries, including Germany, national identification is associated with negative attitudes towards outgroups. In the present article, the interplay between national identification and intergroup contact is analyzed, with xenophobia as the criterion. The study is based on a cross-sectional survey amongst members of the majority population in Germany. It was predicted and found that the association between national identification and xenophobia is moderated by intergroup contact. There was only an association between national identification and xenophobia in participants with below-average or average levels of contact, whilst for those with above-average levels of contact, there was no significant association. Thus, the results point to the importance of contact experiences as a path to neutralize the effects of national identification on xenophobia, possibly by assisting in a redefinition of national belonging.

AB  - Purpose: Youth smoking is a global public health concern. Health educators are increasingly using Internet-based technologies, but the effectiveness of Internet viral marketing in promoting health remains uncertain. This prospective pilot study assessed the efficacy of an online game-based viral marketing campaign in promoting a smoke-free attitude among Chinese adolescents.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty-one Hong Kong Chinese adolescents aged 10 to 24 were invited to participate in an online multiple-choice quiz game competition designed to deliver tobacco-related health information. Participants were encouraged to refer others to join. A zero-inflated negative binomial model was used to explore the factors contributing to the referral process. Latent transition analysis utilising a pre-and post-game survey was used to detect attitudinal changes toward smoking.
   Results: The number of participants increased almost eightfold from 121 to 928 (34.6% current or ex-smokers) during the 22-day campaign. Participants exhibited significant attitudinal change, with 73% holding negative attitudes toward smoking after the campaign compared to 57% before it. The transition probabilities from positive to negative and neutral to negative attitudes were 0.52 and 0.48, respectively. It was also found that attempting every 20 quiz questions was associated with lower perceived smoking decision in future (OR = 0.95, p-value <0.01).
   Conclusions: Our online game-based viral marketing programme was effective in reaching a large number of smoking and non-smoking participants and changing their attitudes toward smoking. It constitutes a promising practical and cost-effective model for engaging young smokers and promulgating smoking-related health information among Chinese adolescents.

AB  - Background: Effective management of the spread of a novel infectious disease, such as the COVID-19 virus can be achieved through influencing people's behavior to adopt preventive measures. The public's perceptions and attitudes towards the virus, governmental guidance and preventive measures were unknown in Saudi Arabia.
   Objectives: 1) investigate the public perception of COVID-19, anxiety level, the COVID-19 information sources sought, adoption of preventive measures, and ability and willingness to self-isolate during and post-lockdown periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia; 2) investigate socio-demographic factors associated with adoption of preventive measures against COVID-19 and self-isolation practices. Method: Between April 22nd and June 21st 2020, Saudi adults aged >= 18 years voluntarily completed a selfadministered web-based cross-sectional survey, distributed through social media (WhatsApp) and emails to representatives in education, health, business, and social sectors across all Saudi Arabian regions. The survey included questions on anxiety level, COVID-19 risk perceptions and adoption of preventive measures. Weighted percentages, Pearson's chi-square tests, and multiple logistic regression were applied to evaluate associations between these factors and socio-demographic variables.
   Results: A total of 2393 respondents completed the survey. A majority (74%) were worried about the COVID-19 outbreak and of those, 27% reported that it was likely that they would be infected with COVID-19; 16% believed it would be life-threatening or severe. However, only 11% of respondents reported high anxiety level. Adoption of hygiene practices and social distancing were lower among older (> 65 years) compared to younger (18-24 years) respondents (OR: 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.28 and OR 0.06; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.27 respectively). High percentages of respondents reported being able to (88%) and were willing to (82%) self-isolate. Those with the lowest gross household income and those with at least one flu symptom were less able and willing to self-isolate. A significant increase in levels of anxiety, perceived effectiveness of social distancing and hygiene practices was reported in the post-lockdown compared to during the lockdown.
   Conclusions: The study reported high levels of adoption of preventive measures, willingness and perceived ability to self-isolate during the early phase of the pandemic. Vulnerable groups such as the elderly, and those with low socio-economic status reported lower adoption of preventive measures or ability and willingness to self-isolate. Tailored public health messages and interventions are needed to achieve high adherence to these preventive measures in these groups.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is a highly transmissible illness caused by SARS-CoV-2. The disease has affected more than 200 countries, and the measures that have been implemented to combat its spread, as there is still no vaccine or definitive medication, have been based on supportive interventions and drug repositioning. Brazil, the largest country in South America, has had more than 140,000 recorded deaths and is one of the most affected countries. Despite the extensive quantity of scientifically recognized information, there are still conflicting discussions on how best to face the disease and the virus, especially with regard to social distancing, preventive methods, and the use of medications.
   Objective: The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the Brazilian population's basic knowledge about COVID-19 to demonstrate how Brazilians are managing to identify scientifically proven information.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study design was used. An original online questionnaire survey was administered from June 16 to August 21, 2020, across all five different geopolitical regions of the country (ie, the North, Northeast, Center-West, Southeast, and South). The questionnaire was comprised of questions about basic aspects of COVID-19, such as the related symptoms, conduct that should be followed when suspected of infection, risk groups, prevention, transmission, and social distancing. The wrong questionnaire response alternatives were taken from the fake news combat website of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Participants (aged >= 18 years) were recruited through social networking platforms, including Facebook, WhatsApp, and Twitter. The mean distributions, frequencies, and similarities or dissimilarities between the responses for the different variables of the study were evaluated. The significance level for all statistical tests was less than.05.
   Results: A total of 4180 valid responses representative of all the states and regions of Brazil were recorded. Most respondents had good knowledge about COVID-19, getting an average of 86.59% of the total score with regard to the basic aspects of the disease. The region, education level, age, sex, and social condition had a significant association (P<.001) with knowledge about the disease, which meant that women, the young, those with higher education levels, nonrecipients of social assistance, and more economically and socially developed regions had more correct answers.
   Conclusions: Overall, Brazilians with social media access have a good level of basic knowledge about COVID-19 but with differences depending on the analyzed subgroup. Due to the limitation of the platform used in carrying out the study, care should be taken when generalizing the study findings to populations with less education or who are not used to accessing social networking platforms.

AB  - This study examines how the issue of game regulation has been discussed and influenced public perception by exploring ideologically differing media outlets' distinct uses of frames by analyzing news contents (N = 1,217) and public opinion survey of the notional sample of Korean garners (N = 1,362), who play games currently. The analyses include the influence of media on attitudes toward game regulation, perception of games, and frame adoption, based on the results of news content analysis. The study found that (a) mainstream media was ambivalent about game issues and tended to define gaming and garners in sensationalistic ways; (b) while the dynamics of media effects on public attitudes toward game regulation are complex, exposure to game-related news content significantly impacted public attitudes; mass media that highlight the negative aspects of games have strong impacts on public perception toward games, which may ultimately affect attitudes toward game regulation.

AB  - Drawing upon the sociofunctional approach to prejudice, three studies examined distrust as a predictor of attitudes toward transgender individuals relative to sexual minorities (primarily gay men), focusing on two possible mediators: perceived deception and identity-confusion. Participants expressed more negative attitudes and greater distrust toward transgender individuals than gay men, and these effects were driven by perceived deception but not identity-confusion. Importantly, prejudice, distrust, and perceived deception were more pronounced toward transgender women (i.e., assigned male at birth but identify as female) than transgender men (i.e., assigned female at birth but identify as male; Study 2). In Study 3, transgender individuals were viewed as more deceptive than lesbians and bisexual individuals (a group also stereotyped as untrustworthy).

AB  - Background Orders such as self-isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lockdown implemented as a protective measure against COVID-19 has allowed people to devote their excess leisure time to their appearance, cosmetics, and hygiene. Objective To assess the skin care routine regarding hygiene and cosmetic practices among female users of social media during the COVID-19 pandemic. Method A cross-sectional study was done among 300 female social media users using purposive sampling. A self-administered questionnaire that included questions related to hygiene practices such as hand washing, use of hand sanitizers, bathing, hair washing, and use of certain cosmetics before and during the pandemic was used to collect all relevant data. Result Handwashing after returning home and shaking hands with others increased during the pandemic as compared with prior practices. The frequency of using a hand sanitizer had also increased during the pandemic. There was a statistically significant decrease in the frequency of the hair removal and visits to beauty salons during the pandemic. Cosmetics were used less, although face creams and lip balm were used more. Even though most of our respondents thought pandemic practices were convenient to use, more than half of them said they wished to go back to their pre-pandemic routines once the pandemic was over. Conclusion The study revealed an increase in washing behavior, use of facial cream, and lip balms. Moreover, a decrease in using make-up cosmetics, hair removal, and beauty salon visits during the pandemic.

AB  - With the emergence of COVID-19, mobile health applications have increasingly become crucial in contact tracing, information dissemination, and pandemic control in general. Apps warn users if they have been close to an infected person for sufficient time, and therefore potentially at risk. The distance measurement accuracy heavily affects the probability estimation of being infected. Most of these applications make use of the electromagnetic field produced by Bluetooth Low Energy technology to estimate the distance. Nevertheless, radio interference derived from numerous factors, such as crowding, obstacles, and user activity can lead to wrong distance estimation, and, in turn, to wrong decisions. Besides, most of the social distance-keeping criteria recognized worldwide plan to keep a different distance based on the activity of the person and on the surrounding environment. In this study, in order to enhance the performance of the COVID-19 tracking apps, a human activity classifier based on Convolutional Deep Neural Network is provided. In particular, the raw data coming from the accelerometer sensor of a smartphone are arranged to form an image including several channels (HAR-Image), which is used as fingerprints of the in-progress activity that can be used as an additional input by tracking applications. Experimental results, obtained by analyzing real data, have shown that the HAR-Images are effective features for human activity recognition. Indeed, the results on the k-fold cross-validation and obtained by using a real dataset achieved an accuracy very close to 100%.

AB  - Background: Three out of ten children in Germany have immigrant backgrounds and this proportion is expected to further increase in subsequent years. While immigrant youth have been found more vulnerable to developing symptoms of depression and anxiety, the underlying mechanisms of how such disparities unfold during youth development are still understudied. Some previous research has found that immigrant youth are at risk of experiencing a less positive self-concept compared to non-immigrant youth. We investigated whether the self-concept mediates mental health disparities and explored variability in such associations from middle childhood to late adolescence.
   Methods: Overall 1839 children and adolescents aged 6-21 years (M = 14.05 years, SD = 3.03, 49.8% female, n = 782 with immigrant status) participated in a cross-sectional self-report survey in classroom settings using scales from the Beck Youth Inventories II (Beck et al. in Beck Youth Inventories - Second Edition, Psychological Corporation, San Antonio, 2005) to assess self-concept and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Links between immigrant status, age, self- concept and symptom levels of depression as well as anxiety were examined using hierarchical regression and moderated mediation models.
   Results: Immigrant youth reported higher symptom levels of depression and anxiety than their non-immigrant peers but did not differ in their self-concepts. Hypothesized moderated mediation models were not fully supported and self- concept neither mediated the link between immigrant status and depression nor immigrant status and anxiety. However, self-concept was a significant predictor for symptom levels of depression as well as anxiety, with stronger associations in adolescents.
   Conclusions: Our study substantiates previous findings that immigrant youth in Germany have overall increased symptom levels of depression and anxiety compared to non-immigrant youth. Our study however does not support that immigrant youth have a more negative self-concept and that the self-concept mediates such internalizing mental health disparities. Findings match previous evidence that developing a positive attitude towards the self is linked to better mental health. Beyond that, our findings suggest that mental health interventions addressing the self-concept could be especially relevant when targeting adolescents. Further research is needed to deepen the understanding of the mediating processes between migration status and mental health variables.

KW  - Nutrition
KW  - COVID-19 pandemic

KW  - lifestyle habits
AB  - BACKGROUND: Social isolation required by the pandemic has led to some changes in individuals' eating and lifestyle habits.
   OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the change in nutrition and lifestyle habits of Turkish people during the COVID-19 outbreak and investigate the effects of individuals' attitudes to healthy eating on this change.
   METHOD: At the beginning of the pandemic, individuals over the age of 18 participated in this cross-sectional study using an online questionnaire. Demographic information (age, gender, education level, place of residence and occupation), anthropometric data (reported weight and height); nutritional behavior information (number of meals per day, changes in consumption of various foods, use of nutritional supplements, etc.) and changes in lifestyle habits were requested from the participations. In addition, the Healthy Nutrition Attitude Scale (ASHN) was used to determine the healthy eating attitudes of the participants.
   RESULTS: A total of 432 volunteers participated in the study. It was revealed that body weight increased in 38.0% of the participants and activity level decreased in 73.1% of them during the initial stage of the pandemic. Nevertheless, 44.7% of participants reported increased sleep time, 77.8% reported increased social media use, and 66.7% reported increased stress and anxiety. It was found that the most commonly used nutritional supplements during this period were vitamin C, vitamin D and multivitamin complex. Women have significantly higher ASHN scores compared to men (p < 0.001). The total ASHN scores of those whose body weight did not change and those who increased their activity level were found to be significantly higher. It was determined that as the age and education level increased, the healthy eating attitude increased.
   CONCLUSION: In this study, findings regarding the negative effects of the COVID-19 quarantine on the nutrition and lifestyle of the Turkish people are presented. However, those with a positive attitude toward healthy eating were observed to have better weight control and eating habits and stress management during the pandemic. Therefore, it is thought that the dissemination of healthy eating attitudes in society may contribute to the maintenance of physical and mental health in the event of a pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Several research models have been proposed in the existing literature to understand the intention to use Islamic banking where conventional bank customers are not primarily addressed. Upon measuring the level of Islamic financial literacy (IFL) among the customers of conventional banks in the UAE, the purpose of this paper is to examine the direct and indirect effects of IFL, awareness, cost and benefit, reputation and attitude towards Islamic banking on the intention of potential customers to use Islamic banking.
   Design/methodology/approach Using judgmental sampling techniques, questionnaires were distributed to working individuals who did not have accounts with Islamic banks. A total of 350 completed and usable questionnaires were received and used for further analysis. The SmartPLS 3.0 software was used to analyse the data.
   Findings The results revealed that the level of IFL was high across the respondents and differed significantly as a function of gender, income level and years of work experience. The findings showed that IFL, awareness, reputation and attitude towards Islamic banking significantly influenced the intention to use Islamic banking, while cost and benefit appear not to. Interestingly, IFL was negatively correlated with the intention to use Islamic banking, but when the attitude towards Islamic banking mediated the relationship between IFL and the intention to use Islamic banking it then became positive.
   Research limitations/implications Future research should consider looking at non-Muslim economies, which might be more vulnerable to IFL. In addition, a comparison between the current customers of Islamic banks and potential customers might be relevant to see whether the IFL of the current customers differs from the new customers.
   Practical implications The implications of the research are twofold. First the study suggests that IFL is crucial for an Islamic bank's potential new customers. Islamic bank managers should design and focus their policies toward enriching the knowledge of the public about Islamic banks and their products. Second, IFL alone does not lead to a higher level of intention to use Islamic banks unless there is a positive attitude towards such banks.
   Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, this is one of the first studies to consider the IFL measure used in this paper. Therefore, this study will be the foundation for future research on IFL.

AB  - Background Virtual reality (VR) has several applications in the medical domain and also generates a secure environment to carry out activities. Evaluation of the effectiveness of VR among older populations revealed positive effects of VR as a tool to reduce risks of falls and also improve the social and emotional well-being of older adults. The decline in physical and mental health, the loss of functional capabilities, and a weakening of social ties represent obstacles towards active aging among older adults and indicate a need for support. Existing research focused on the effects of VR among older populations, and its uses and benefits. Our study investigated the acceptance and use of VR by the elderly. Methods This pilot study was conducted on 30 older adults who voluntarily participated during March to May 2018. Nine VR applications that promote physical activities, motivate users, and provide entertainment were chosen for this study. Participants were asked to use any one of the applications of their choice for 15 min twice a week for 6 weeks. At the end of 6 weeks, participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire based on the Technology Acceptance Model and a literature review, to evaluate their acceptance of VR technology. Cronbach's alpha reliability analysis was used to test the internal consistency of the questionnaire items. Pearson's product moment correlation was used to examine the validity of the questionnaire. A linear regression and mediation analysis were utilized to identify relationships among the variables of the questionnaire. Results In total, six male and 24 female participants aged 6095 years volunteered to participate in the study. Perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and perceived enjoyment were seen to have had significant effects on the intention to use VR. Participants agreed to a large extent regarding the perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, and their experience of using VR. Thus, VR was seen to have high acceptance among this elderly population. Conclusions Older people have positive perceptions towards accepting and using VR to support active aging. They perceived VR to be useful, easy to use, and an enjoyable experience, implying positive attitudes toward adopting this new technology.

AB  - Drawing on the constructionist framing approach, this quantitative content analysis compares online news coverage of schizophrenia in China and the United States in 2015. Incorporating the concept of individualism-collectivism, this study seeks to unveil the effects of culture on the framing of causes, solutions, responsibility attribution, and discourse types. The findings reveal that the link between cultural orientation and the media's framing of schizophrenia is not simple, as both cross-cultural consistency and differences were observed. In addition, compared to U.S. online media, Chinese online news outlets were more likely to cover schizophrenia episodically, while placing more problem-solving responsibility on society. Moreover, examining stigma and challenge cues, this study also found that schizophrenia was more severely stigmatized in Chinese than in U.S. online news platforms. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: nutritional status might vary according to different underlying illnesses such as cancer or infectious diseases, including COVID-19. In this context, data from developing countries remain scarce.
   Objectives: the objective of this study was to assess the nutritional status and outcomes of Mexican cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at a tertiary care center.
   Methods: this was a retrospective study including 121 consecutive cancer patients diagnosed with COVID-19 at the National Cancer Institute, Mexico City, during four months.
   Results: the most frequent oncological diagnoses were gynecological (19 %) and hematological (17 %). Most patients were overweight (35 %). In the univariate analysis, >= 65 years, intubation, hypoalbuminemia, high creatinine, lymphopenia, nutrition-impact symptoms, and ECOG 2-4 were statistically associated with lower survival. The median survival of the cohort was 41 days.
   Conclusions: to our best knowledge, this is the first study of its kind performed in Mexico, and as other studies from other regions, our results might aid in identifying cancer patients most at risk for severe COVID-19, and could be potentially useful to enhance public health messaging on self-isolation and social distancing among Mexican cancer patients.

AB  - In two studies, we tested a model in which the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim (identity incompatibility) was expected to mediate between group-based discrimination and the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims. In Study 1 (N = 76), anti-Muslim discrimination was associated with lower national identification and more negative attitudes toward non-Muslims, and these relationships were mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. In Study 2 (N = 70), we additionally found that anti-Muslim discrimination predicted stronger endorsement of Islamic group rights, and this relationship was also mediated by perceived identity incompatibility. The studies highlight the importance of group-based discrimination in shaping the perceived (in)compatibility of being British and Muslim, and, in turn, the identifications and attitudes of British Muslims.

AB  - Objective The COVID-19 pandemic has had various effects on the social life and daily activities of people in most countries in the world, including Iran. Hygienic precautions have been recommended, such as wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, to reduce the spread of the COVID-19. However, some people in society have not considered and ignored these health issues. This study aims to identify the sociological perceptions of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. A qualitative study was carried out from May to July 2020. The interviewees were purposefully selected from people in Isfahan who avoided paying attention to the COVID-19 warnings. The saturation point was reached in 20 semi-structured interviews. The thematic analysis approach was used to analyze the transcribed documents using MAXQDA software (version 12). Results The results show 2 themes and 4 sub-themes related to the sociological perception of people who ignore the COVID-19 warning. The themes and sub-themes include: feelings of social anomie (disruption and social unrest, social distrust), unmet social relationship needs (intention to maintain social participation, Feeling of reduced social support). In order to tackle social perceptions contrary to health observance during the coronavirus pandemic, educational resources such as mass media, cyberspace and social programs on the necessity and importance of health observance need to be used. Policies should also be implemented in the social, cultural and legislative contexts to enhance the degree of individuals' social responsibility.

AB  - Purpose Entrepreneurship, which traditionally has been a male occupation, still attracts fewer women than men. Challenging gender stereotypes within entrepreneurship is one avenue to increase women's entrepreneurial intention and promote women entrepreneurship. This study adapts the "think manager - think male" leadership perspective to the entrepreneurship context and explores gender stereotype's implications for both entrepreneurial intention and motivation to become an entrepreneur. Design/methodology/approach A total of 902 Spanish non-entrepreneurs, both male and female, were randomly asked about the representation of successful entrepreneurs (no-gender-mention), successful men entrepreneurs or successful women entrepreneurs (reduced stereotype threat condition vs no-gender-mention or men entrepreneurs' conditions). Then, female participants' entrepreneurial intention, its antecedents (i.e. attitudes toward entrepreneurship, subjective norms and entrepreneurial self-efficacy) and necessity vs opportunity motivation were measured and compared to their male counterparts' scores in those three conditions. Findings Female participants reported higher entrepreneurial intention, self-efficacy and opportunity motivation when assigned to the successful women entrepreneurs' condition. Younger participants - compared to older ones - also exhibited higher entrepreneurial intention and opportunity motivation, more positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship and higher scores in subjective norms. Furthermore, findings suggest a woman entrepreneur seems to be less accessible (or more counter-stereotypical) to male participants than to female participants and, thus, the "think entrepreneur - think male" bias is more noticeable in male participants. Therefore, reducing negative stereotype threat for women in entrepreneurship may increase women's entrepreneurial career aspirations. This is of utmost importance to optimize training courses and mentoring programs to strengthen women's self-efficacy in their entrepreneurial skills and capabilities. Originality/value This study contributes to the literature about gender, entrepreneurial intention and motivation by adapting a leadership paradigm ("think manager - think male") to entrepreneurship ("think entrepreneur - think male"). These findings shed new light on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention and motivation and have implications for policy measures. Acknowledging that exposure to successful women entrepreneurs as role models potentially facilitates entrepreneurship among women, governments should provide tailor-made incentives and support for women entrepreneurs in the form of awareness raising, networking and in the mass media.

AB  - Background: Malaria causes variety of adverse consequences in pregnant women due to invasion of the placenta by Plasmodium. It increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome for the mother, the foetus and the new-born. Therefore, knowledge, attitudes and practices of this vulnerable group about malaria and the effective use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) contribute to sustainable control of the disease and its effects.
   Methods: A community based cross-sectional study was carried out in May, 2014. A validated structured questionnaire was used for data collection. The data was analysed using logistic regression by means of STATA version 11 data analysis software.
   Results: A total of 398 pregnant women participated in the study and their overall knowledge and attitude towards malaria and ITNs was fairly good; 74.3 % of the mothers had good knowledge and 51.1 % of them possessed positive attitude. Nevertheless, only 15.6 % of the mothers associated mosquitoes with malaria and majority of them (65.6 %) responded that it is transmitted due to poor personal hygiene and environmental sanitation. Younger age, receiving information and information obtained from health extension workers and media were found to be important predictors of pregnant women's attitude (P < 0.05). The ITNs utilization was poor. Only 15.8 % of 398 mothers owned at least one ITN. This was due to its unavailability in markets and unsustainable distribution. More than half of the mothers who owned the ITNs did not have a number proportional to their family size, and 52 % of the mothers had not slept under bed net the previous night. This was due to its being dirty, old, had holes and in some cases lack of awareness on how to install it and its importance to prevent malaria. Higher education was identified as the determining factor for ITNs utilization (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Even though the pregnant mothers' knowledge and attitude about malaria and ITNs was fairly good, its ownership and utilization was noticeably very low. Therefore, consistent and timely distribution by the government and other funding agencies is promptly needed. In addition, appropriate health education should be given on the link between malaria and mosquito, regular and correct use of ITNs with special focus to uneducated and elderly mothers.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the structural relationships among transformational leadership, affective organizational commitment and job performance, as well as the mediating effect of employee engagement on their relationships. Design/methodology/approach To examine the structural relationships among the research variables, structural equation modeling analysis and bootstrap estimates were performed using the data of 600 full-time employees working in Korean private organizations. Findings The results of the data analysis suggest that transformational leadership had a significant impact on employee affective organizational commitment and job performance through employee engagement as a mediator. Specifically, employee engagement partially mediated the mechanism in which transformational leadership affects employee affective organizational commitment, whereas there existed a full mediation of the association between transformational leadership and job performance. Practical implications The study finding suggested that transformational leadership was the key catalyst in both encouraging affective organizational commitment and task performance of employees throughout the mediator, employee engagement. Thus, organizations need to create a safe and positive environment that promotes employee engagement and should offer interventions for leaders to build skill sets of transformational leadership. Originality/value Because previous studies had explored the impacts of transformational leadership on employee positive attitude and job performance separately, there is little known about how these three constructs correlate. By investigating the impacts of transformational leadership on attitude and performance simultaneously in this study, this study expanded to the extant literature by providing better understanding of transformational leadership. Moreover, given that articles on transformational leadership have been limited in the HRD literature, findings of this study can offer trustworthy information for HRD practice and encourage HRD scholars to explore transformational leadership-related research.

AB  - Extended contact has been shown to improve explicit and implicit attitudes toward a number of outgroups, but not yet toward people with mental health conditions. Using people with schizophrenia as the target group, this experiment is the first to demonstrate that extended contact can reduce explicit prejudice, buffer stress responses to future interactions, improve non-verbal behavior, and improve the quality of interactions in a manner detectable by the target group member. Participants watched a video of a brief, positive interaction between two strangers, one of whom they were led to believe had schizophrenia. Control participants watched the same video without being told that the person had schizophrenia. They then participated in a social interaction with a confederate whom they were led to believe had the disorder. Participants' cardiovascular and electrodermal activity were monitored immediately before the interaction. The interaction was also secretly recorded to allow independent judges to assess the participants' non-verbal behaviors. The confederate also rated the positivity of each interaction. Participants in the extended contact condition reported more positive attitudes toward people with schizophrenia, displayed more positive non-verbal behaviors, and had a more positive interaction with the confederate. Moreover, just prior to the interaction, participants in the extended contact condition displayed smaller anticipatory stress responses, as reflected in smaller changes in interbeat interval and non-specific skin conductance responses during this phase. Together, these findings support the use of the extended contact as an intervention that could lead to genuine changes in attitudes toward and treatment of people with severe mental health disorders.

AB  - Orientation: To improve service delivery to its citizens, the South African public sector should aim to improve employees' performance by implementing effective performance management that would impact positively on work engagement and employment relationships.
   Research purpose: The primary objective of this study was to determine whether performance management could be a mediator for work engagement and employment relationships in the public sector in South Africa.
   Motivation for the study: The success of the public sector relies primarily on performance management that strengthens work engagement and employment relationships, which in turn positively influence employee performance. Managers need to understand the influence of performance management on work engagement and employment relationships.
   Research approach/design and method: A quantitative approach was employed. Nonprobability purposive sampling was used to select 400 permanent employees with more than 5 years of experience at job levels 1-12 in eight national departments based in Gauteng. A structured questionnaire was utilised as a data collection method in this study. The questionnaire for the study was divided into four sections and consisted of 74 Likert-scale questions.
   Main findings: This study showed a moderate correlation between performance management and work engagement and a strong correlation between performance management and employment relationships. This study indicated that performance management was indeed a mediator between work engagement and employment relationships.
   Practical/managerial implications: Management should ensure that employees understand the function of performance management as a whole, display a positive attitude towards the implementation of performance management, ensure that employees' Key Performance Indicator (KPIs) adequately reflect their areas of responsibility, motivate the use of performance management through the reward structure and finally, training and orientation on performance management should also be provided to newly appointed and existing staff members to ensure strong work engagement and good employment relationships.
   Contribution/value-add: Contribution of the study to knowledge and practice surrounding performance management, work engagement and employment relationships. The contribution of this study is to impress on managers and leaders the influence of performance management on work engagement and employment relationships.

AB  - The aim of this online cross-sectional study is to identify the sources of scientific information used by Brazilian dentists in clinical decision-making and the barriers that they perceive as important to the incorporation of scientific evidence into clinical practice. A pretested questionnaire created in Google Forms which was made available to participants through links sent by e-mail or shared on Facebook (R) and Instagram (R) was used to collect the data between October 2018 and May 2019. Only dentists who were involved in direct or indirect care of patients (i.e. clinicians who performed dental procedures or dental educators who participated in the clinical training of graduate or postgraduate dental students) were asked to complete the questionnaire. The sample was comprised of 528 dentists (the response rate from the alumni database was 6.9%); their mean age was 45.2 years (+/- 12.5) and 30.9% had an academic position. The majority were women (68.0%) and lived in Southern or Southeastern Brazil (96.0%). The sources of scientific information more frequently used by them in clinical decision-making were clinical guidelines (65.1%; 95% CI: 60.9, 69.2), scientific articles (56.8%; 95%CI: 52.5, 61.1) and bibliographic databases (48.3%; 95% CI: 43.9, 52.6). The information resource less frequently used was social media. The most important barriers to the clinical use of scientific evidence were: difficulty in determining whether scientific contents found on the Internet were reliable or not (41.8%; 95% CI: 37.6, 46.2), high cost of access to scientific papers (37.7%; 95% CI: 33.5, 41.9), and lack of time for reading scientific articles (32.4%; 95% CI: 28.4, 36.6). Although Brazilian dentists show a positive attitude towards obtaining scientific evidence from reliable sources, there still remain important barriers to the translation of evidence into practice. This can have significant implications for quality of care and should be further investigated.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has led to prolonged exposure to stress and anxiety, raising concerns about a large spectrum of psychological side effects. The primary objective of the study was to validate the COVID-19 Bullying Scale (CBS-11). The second objective was to explore factors associated with COVID-19-related bullying and evaluate the mediating effect of fear and anxiety between knowledge and COVID-19-related bullying. Methods A cross-sectional online survey conducted between December 20, 2020, and January 5, 2021, recruited 405 Lebanese adults using a snowball sampling technique. The CBS-11, an 11-item tool specifically created for this study, was used to measure bullying behaviors towards COVID-19 patients. Results All items of the CBS-11 converged over a 1-factor solution with an eigenvalue over 1, accounting for a variance of 75.16%. The scale has a high Cronbach's alpha (.974), indicating excellent reliability. A positive correlation was found between the COVID-19 bullying scale and fear, anxiety, and stigma discrimination. The logistic regression showed that higher fear of COVID-19 (ORa = 1.04), a positive attitude toward COVID-19 preventive measures and hygiene recommendations (ORa = 1.18), higher stigma discrimination scores (ORa = 1.09), and having a health professional family member (ORa = 2.42) were significantly associated with bullying. Conclusion Our main findings showed that the CBS-11 could be an efficient tool to measure bullying behaviors toward COVID-19 patients. Stigma discrimination and fear from COVID-19 were associated with higher bullying attitudes. Future prospective studies are needed to understand better the factors related to bullying among adults during a pandemic, such as COVID-19.

AB  - In China, learning weariness is the focus of attention, but few studies have explored the potential impact of bullying victimization on learning weariness. This study examines their relationship by exploring the mediating effect of two collectivism factors, attitude toward school and social alienation. One thousand one hundred and thirty-two students from 9 middle schools in rural China (11???15 years, 51.4% boys) participated in this study. Results show that bullying victimization has a significant impact on Chinese students??? learning weariness. Both negative attitudes toward school and social alienation have significant mediate effects, and the indirect result of negative school attitude is significantly higher than social alienation.

AB  - Scientists must share their work with the public in order to promote science-based public discourse and policies. These acts of science communication are often evaluated in terms of their ability to inform (i.e., introduce accurate and accessible information) and engage (i.e., capture interest and maintain attention). We focus on a third basis by which science communication might be judged, influence. Science communicators exert influence when they shape public opinions in ways that affect their judgments and decisions, alter social and political discourse and debate, and guide social policy. We describe how the influence of any given science communication should be evaluated independent of its ability to inform or engage. We give particular attention in our analysis to the often unintended influences that well-meaning science communicators can have. We begin by considering ways that communications from climate scientists might reduce support for climate regulation and communications from health scientists might undermine public health. We then develop two "case studies," drawn from social psychology. These show how popular media descriptions of the science of racial bias and disadvantage might in some cases exacerbate racial discrimination and reduce concern for the disadvantaged. We close with an agenda for a more vigorous science of science communication; one that engages in two complementary pursuits. Critical studies identify the dominant and consequential effects that popular science communicators are having on public perceptions. Strategic studies advance and empirically test communication strategies that scientists can pursue to reduce-rather than exacerbate-social problems.

AB  - Purpose Drawn from the concepts of processing fluency and mental imagery, the present study aims to fill the void by developing the mechanism underlying consumers' cognitive processing of visually appealing digital content in social media (i.e. Instagram) of retail brands. Design/methodology/approach Data were gathered using a web-based survey method with consumers residing in the USA (N = 328). Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to investigate the proposed hypotheses. In addition, measurement invariance and multigroup analyses were conducted to test the moderation effect of need for cognition (NFC). Findings The results supported the pivotal role of mental imagery when consumers process visual messages in the context of a retail brand's Instagram. Both comprehension fluency and imagery fluency positively influence mental imagery, which in turn cultivates positive attitude towards the brand. The mediating role of mental imagery is confirmed. Furthermore, individuals' NFC interacts with imagery fluency but not with comprehension fluency such that high NFC strengthens the effect of imagery fluency on mental imagery. That is, when high-NFC consumers process information on Instagram, their perceptions of ease of generating imagery likely evoke visual representation of the brand's messages on Instagram in their minds. Practical implications This research provides feasible ways for brands to increase the effectiveness of digital marketing communications in social media (e.g. optimising of the contextual features of visual information and employing interactive features such as filters of social media to enhance processing fluency). Originality/value Within the context of digital retailing, this study provides a new perspective of consumers' imagery processing to investigate the effectiveness of visual-focussed messages.

AB  - Attitudes toward same-gender parenting are of timely relevance, given increasing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights around the world. Two studies examined the influence of 2 predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The first was informational influence, which was manipulated via a newspaper-style article dispelling misconceptions about gender identity of children reared by same-gender parents. The second was social influence via parasocial contact measured as prior exposure to a same-gender adoptive parents TV show. Religious fundamentalism (RF) was assessed as an individual difference moderator of informational or social influence. Outcome variables were beliefs about same-gender parenting, perceived problems with same-gender parenting, and social distance from same-gender adoptive parents. We studied these relationships in Canada (Study 1, where same-gender couples' adoption is legal) and in Italy (Study 2, where same-gender couples' adoption is not legal). RF moderated the results of informational and social influence in the Canadian context, such that those high in RF tended to be favorably influenced. In Italy, results of informational influence were typically observed among those low in RF, and social influence directly predicted favorable attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Informational and social influence can improve attitudes toward same-gender parenting, but RF and legal/cultural context are also important to consider.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) spread across the globe through the human transmission. The World Health Organization suggested social distancing to curb the community spread. After national social lockdown started in India, air quality improved drastically. This further hypothesized to influence the environment and human health, and this study is positively the first to weigh it using multiple indices. The calculated environmental indices are photochemical ozone creation potential (POCP), acidification potential (AP), and eutrophication potential (EP). The cancer risk, chronic health index (CHI), and acute health index (AHI) were considered to calculate the health risk. The spatial trend change in the air pollution reflecting on these indices are calculated for four Indian megacities Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Temporal variation was accounted for monthly (2019 vs 2020), one-week and two-weeks period during the social lockdown. The results showed a significant decrease in environmental and health risk during the lockdown due to a corresponding decrement in air pollution. The decrease in the particulate matter was found to play a vital role in altering the air pollution mediated risks of interest. Delhi showed a maximum difference in POCP and Acute HI by recording a dip of 70.79% and 43.53% respectively in 2020 during lockdown. The maximum reduction in health risk indices was 41%, 31%, 17%, 19% for Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, and Kolkata. Bangalore recorded the maximum decline in EP, Cancer risk, Chronic HI by 66.66%, 58.62%, and 58.76% in 2020 compared to 2019. A maximum fall in AP was seen in Kolkata by 57.23% in 2020 among all cities. The connection between these drop-in indices and the cause of air pollutants were well discussed. This present paper gives more in-depth insights into air pollution?s effect on environmental and health parameters by connecting and converging various air pollution aspects into a single scale. This study also enlightens the importance of controlling air pollution to have a better environment and healthy life to attain sustainable development.

AB  - Descriptions of barriers and facilitators to adoption of evidence-based interventions in local health departments (LHDs) are limited. This study was conducted by the North Carolina Public Health Practice-Based Research Network to identify factors associated with adoption of an evidence-based human papillomavirus video intervention, "1-2-3 Pap NC," in North Carolina LHDs. A sequential mixed-method study design was used. Data from the 2013 National Profile of Local Health Departments were used to test associations between LHD characteristics and adoption of the intervention. Qualitative, key stakeholder interviews with LHD directors provided the context for quantitative data. Data collection and analysis continued from March 3, 2014, to September 15, 2014. Overall, 28% of North Carolina health jurisdictions (33 of 100 counties) implemented the intervention. Of the three channels used to deliver the intervention to clients, most LHDs opted to show the video in the exam room (42%), followed by website/other social media (36%) and video loop in the lobby/waiting room (22%). In logistic regression, gender of the director (female) was significantly and positively associated with adoption of the intervention (AOR = 4.44, p<0.05). Being a first-time director was marginally significant (AOR = 0.28, p = 0.074), suggesting first-time directors were less likely to adopt. Qualitative results suggested that aspects of communication (awareness and positive attitudes) and agency directors' evaluation of resources, balanced against intervention complexity and flexibility, competing priorities, and mandates, influenced adoption. Adoption of evidence-based interventions by LHDs is critical to improve population health. Practice-based research can contribute to understanding facilitators and modifying barriers to this process.

AB  - Background The year 2020 will be remembered as the "year of the COVID-19 pandemic". The world population had to familiarize themselves with words as swabs, personal protective equipment, pandemic. To curb the wave of the pandemic, almost all the countries imposed self-isolation and social distancing. We conducted a web-based survey to investigate the behavioural responses during the quarantine due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Participants were 1860 youth aged 12-18 years attending lower secondary schools and upper secondary schools. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, lifestyle changes during the quarantine period, and the psychological impact of the lock-down on adolescents' life. Results Most adolescents experienced feelings of fear, discouragement, and anxiety which strongly affected the approach to their daily lifestyles. Most of the surveyed subjects reported having used this period to acquire new skills and to practice physical activities at home. The use of technology was predominant both for recreational activities and educational purposes. Conclusions Despite the strong psychological impact of the quarantine, adolescents showed good levels of resilience. Technology played a crucial role during the quarantine for young subjects who have increased the daily use of technological devices to stay connected with the rest of the world.

AB  - Thanks largely to the affordances of social media, the Covid-19 pandemic has provoked a glut of neologisms, loan-words, abbreviations, calques and other linguistic variants. The crisis was accompanied in most nations by social measures curtailing what have long been seen as fundamental liberties; hence, it has foregrounded the re-emergence of old controversies about individualism vs collectivism, the nature of personal freedom, the role of the state, the right to healthcare, the distribution of wealth, and so on. On the UK side, our study explores some emergent neologisms in English and Russian, especially implicit meaning in terms like "social distancing" and "lockdown". We consider cross-cultural implications that relate to the way each national group conceptualized, and lived through, the experiences of lockdown. Linguistic practices may reflect deep-seated habits of being that characterize different countries, and thus our research may shed light on long-standing questions of national stereotypes. We look at some of the Covid-19 neologisms produced and/or used in British and Russian contexts, on the assumption that, by comparing these micro-linguistic practices, it is possible to learn something concerning the cultural realities of the countries in question, along the lines proposed in the works of Hofstede (2001) and Wierzbicka (2003).

TI  - Please Scream Inside Your Heart: Compounded Loss and Coping during the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - Individuals are experiencing unprecedented personal challenges as a result of the novel COVID-19 virus. Stay at home orders and social distancing guidelines were in place, which has had a direct effect on American lives: forcing the cancellation of events, ending in-person school or childcare, forcing remote work environments, and leading to drastic changes to recreational activities. All these life changes can be experienced as losses that lead to real grief. However, grieving in the time of COVID-19 is fraught with unique challenges. This study recruited 257 participants from across North America to participate in an online survey investigating the types of losses experienced due to COVID-19, feelings of guilt and delegitimization, communal coping, and general coping behaviors. Results indicate that people experienced various losses during the COVID-19 pandemic, many of which were compounded and varying in degrees of intensity (e.g., loss of a loved one, loss of a job, loss of physical activity routine). Because of these differences in intensity, people felt guilty for grieving over their losses, and subsequently were less likely to appraise the losses as communal and more likely to utilize avoidant coping mechanisms on their own. The theoretical and public health implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - Background: Despite many advantages of long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIA), this type of therapy is still underused in routine practice. Since psychiatrists' attitudes play an important role in prescription rate of LAIA, we found it valuable to examine their attitudes because, according to our knowledge, there hasn't been similar research in Croatia so far.
   Subjects and methods: In this research, we included the total of 48 psychiatrists. For research purposes, we created a questionnaire modeled on standardized questionnaire. Results are described with descriptive statistics and Likert scale was used to measure respondents' attitudes to statements.
   Results: The number of years of their experience in practice is expressed with median of 13.50 years with minimal value of 1.00 and maximum value of 36.00 years. Most of psychiatrists find that LAIA play an important role in treatment of schizophrenia (n=44, 93.62%) and that they tend to prescribe that type of therapy (n=39, 81.25%). Almost all of psychiatrists (n=45, 93.75%) agree or strongly agree that it is easier to control patients' disease if they are treated with LAIA rather than with oral therapy and 32 of them (68.08%) think that doctor-patient relationship is more successful when patients are treated with LAIA than with oral antipsychotics. According to their experience (n=32, 68.08%) patients prefer to be treated with oral antipsychotics instead of LAIA. We expressed approximate percentage of their patients treated with LAIA with median of 20%, with minimum value of 0.00% and maximum value of 70.00%.
   Conclusion: According to the results of our research, attitudes of psychiatrists towards LAIA are mostly positive, but considering the fact that there is a small number of their patients who are treated with them, we emphasize that psychiatrists still prescribe oral antipsychotics much more often than LAIA. Despite positive attitudes of patients towards LAIA, majority of psychiatrists think that patients would rather choose oral therapy.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 outbreak has led IBD clinics to adopt a remote monitoring approach in order to guarantee an adequate follow-up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and ensure the rules of social distancing. Aim: The aim of the study was to perform a survey on IBD patients who underwent remote monitoring in our tertiary referral center, to assess adherence, patients' perceptions and satisfaction, and finally their opinions for future monitoring. Furthermore, we evaluated changes in disease activity and Quality of Life (QoL) using validated questionnaires. Methods: Consecutive patients with IBD scheduled for follow-up visits were switched to remote monitoring through e-mail from March 2020 to February 2021. Patients were asked to complete a questionnaire focusing on the following elements of the intervention: (1) self-assessment questions, (2) action plans, and (3) educational messages. Results: Four hundred and twenty four Caucasian patients completed the survey. 233 (55.1%) were male, 220 (52.0%) had Crohn's Disease (CD). Median baseline Mayo Score and Harvey Bradshaw Index were 3 and 4, respectively. 9 (2.1%) patients were referred to the emergency department because of disease flares. 410 (96.9%) patients were satisfied with telemedicine, and 320 (76.5%) patients reported that they would maintain this approach also after COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, on univariate logistic regression analysis, none of the variables were related to patients' satisfaction or to an improved QoL. The presence of ulcerative colitis was associated with the need for treatment change. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a telemedicine approach is well accepted by patients with IBD and could represent an effective tool in monitoring disease activity. Further controlled studies are warranted to properly assess if telemedicine can replace face-to-face consultations in IBD.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic is a worldwide problem. Vaccination as primary prevention is necessary. Thailand is in the initial phase of the vaccination program. However, the demand for this vaccine among Thais and expatriates living in Thailand is still unknown. This study aims to assess acceptance, attitude, and determinants for COVID-19 vaccination among Thai people and expatriates living in Thailand. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted in Thailand during May 2021. An online survey (REDcap) was distributed through online social media platforms. Adult (>18 years old) Thai and expatriates living in Thailand were invited. Any person who already received any COVID-19 vaccine was excluded from this study. Result: One thousand sixty-six responses were collected in this survey. A total of 959 were available for analysis. Six hundred thirty-seven 637 responses were from Thais and 322 responses from expatriates living in Thailand. The acceptance rate was significantly higher among expatriates than local people (57.8% vs 41.8%, p-value < 0.001). The acceptance rate increased up to 89.0-91.3% if they could select the vaccine brand, and 80.7-83.2% when they were recommended by the health care professionals. Both groups had a similar mean attitude score toward COVID-19 vaccination. Being Thai, health care worker, good compliance to social distancing, accepting serious side effects at level 1 per 100,000, and having a good attitude toward COVID-19 vaccination were associated with vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Thailand's COVID-19 vaccination program could improve the acceptance rate by informing the public about vaccine efficacy, vaccine benefit, and vaccine safety. Moreover, supplying free of charge high efficacy alternative vaccines and letting all people living in Thailand make their own vaccine choices could increase the acceptance rate.

AB  - This article is a descriptive and reflective piece on the strategic adaptations that facilitated and enabled the teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences to medical students in an African medical school that never shut down during the COVID-19 induced lockdown of the year 2020. The article considers the roles of educational technology, innovations, media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. Specific technologies and innovations including the Anatomage Table, Complete 3D Anatomy software, and the use of High-Fidelity Mannequin were deployed to facilitate effective teaching of anatomy and related basic medical sciences. This was aided by the robust use of a learning management system Canvas, as well as internet facility for connection, videoconferencing, online sessions and online-based assessment in a strategically organised manner. This system was dynamic enough to respond to changes in COVID-19 related government policies including the lockdown and social distancing-related adjustments in the physical settings. The outcome was that the teaching of medical students did not stop, and optimal results were achieved. The article considers the roles of educational technology and innovations as well as the media and how these were used to achieve learning objectives with optimal outcomes during the lockdown. It is believed that this experiential piece would inspire and inform other medical schools on the benefit of building robustly dynamic medical school systems as well as the use of innovations in times of challenges. The article also considers both the limitations and benefits of technology in teaching anatomy. Very importantly, specific tools, innovations, and technologies were considered as used, and the information provided might be a guide for other potential users. Ultimately, the lesson learned would be of use to us and we believe we could also benefit many others.

AB  - With the global COVID-19 pandemic, governments from many countries in the world implemented various restrictions to prevent the SARS-Cov-2 virus's spread, including social distancing measures, quarantine, in-home lockdown, and the closure of services and public spaces. This led to an in-creased use of social media platforms to make people feel more connected, but also to maintain physical activity while self-isolating. Concerns about physical appearance and the desire to keep or reach a muscular and toned ideal body, might have further reinforced the engagement in fitness-related social media activities, like sharing progresses in training achievements or following more fitness contents on popular profiles. To better understand the underlying relation among these factors, the present study investigates 729 responses to the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI), the Appearance Anxiety Inventory (AAI), the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) and their association to social media usage and compares the results cross-culturally in five countries (Spain, Lithuania, United Kingdom, Japan, and Hungary). Findings highlight significant differences between males and females, espe-cially in regard to the time spent online (U = 477.5, p = 0.036). Greater levels of appearance anxiety were associated with the exposure to fitness-related contents on social media. These results strongly confirm the previously highlighted association between fitspiration media and body image anxiety predominantly in females. Clinical implications

AB  - Previous research notes that sense of place may intensify, and that levels of public risk perception may decrease with proximity to an established hazardous or stigmatised site. In addition, the literature suggests that sense of place may act either to mediate or moderate community perceptions of risk in such localities. This study comprised a major household survey (n = 1326) and an interview study (n = 39) and was conducted close to the nuclear power stations at Oldbury and Hinkley Point, both in the UK. It investigated the roles of perceptions of place and hazard proximity in considering (a) perceptions of risk and (b) public attitudes towards the building of a new nuclear power station in the nearby area. In addition, a novel scale was developed to measure the perceived contribution of the nearby nuclear power station to sense of place. The results suggest first, that sense of place mediates (but does not moderate) perceptions of risk in very proximate communities, and second, that public attitudes to new build in communities situated very close to established nuclear sites may be largely dependent on the extent to which the existing facility is perceived to contribute towards sense of place. The implications of these results for existing theory are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This commentary explores the distribution of human papilloma virus (HPV) and HPV-related diseases, and factors affecting attitudes towards HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination in the Latin American Andean region. Lack of knowledge of HPV, known negative attitudes or incorrect assumptions about HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination provide a basis upon which to develop targeted HPV awareness and preventive health media campaigns. For maximal effect, media campaigns should use the internet, radio, and television to address health care providers, parents, and students. Additional programming can be developed for clinics to use in-house with their clients. Ministries of Education, Finance, and Health all have roles to play to increase national HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination awareness.

AB  - Background: Social contact-based interventions effectively reduce stigma toward psychosis. We recently demonstrated the efficacy of a 90-second video intervention in reducing stigma. The current randomized controlled study presents four briefer videos differing in presenter's gender/race, with baseline, postintervention, and 30-day follow-up assessments. The study replicates previous findings and examine whether concordance of presenter's and viewer's race/gender enhanced the anti-stigma effect.
   Methods: Using a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 1993 participants ages 18-35 years to one of four brief video-based interventions (Black/White female, Black/White male presenters) or a nonintervention control condition. In the videos, a young presenter with psychosis humanized their illness through an evocative description of living a meaningful and productive life.
   Results: Group-by-time ANOVA showed a significant group-by-time interaction for the total score of all five stigma domains: social distance, stereotyping, separateness, social restriction, and perceived recovery. One-way ANOVA showed greater reductions in video intervention groups than control at post-intervention and 30-day follow-up, but no differences between video groups. Matching race/gender did not further reduce stigma.
   Conclusions: This randomized controlled study replicated and extended previous research findings, by showing stigma reduction across videos that differ in the presenter's gender and race, thus enhancing generalizability. The videos described the experience of psychosis and reduced stigma, suggesting their potential utility on social media platforms to increase the likelihood of seeking services and ultimately may improve access to care among young individuals with psychosis. Future research should address intersectional stigma experiences by focusing on race/gender and culturally tailoring the narrative.

AB  - Introduction: Disease transmission patterns of COVID-19 have shown that masking, social distancing, contact tracing and quarantine measures are important strategies for reducing transmission. The effective implementation of quarantine is determined by the commitment of the people and monitoring by the State. The aim of the study was to find out the effectiveness of home quarantine practises and its role in determining SARS CoV2 transmission. Methods: Record-based retrospective cohort study was conducted among expatriates of Kerala who were on quarantine at their homes and later tested positive for SARS -CoV-2. Quarantine practises were categorised as strict room quarantine, incomplete room quarantine, home quarantine and no quarantine. Risk of transmission was assessed using risk ratios. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to find out the determinants of SARS CoV2 transmission. Results: The median (IQR) age and duration of quarantine of 95 study participants were found to be 35 (29, 44) years and 7 (3,13) days, respectively. Majority of the participants practised strict room quarantine (57%), whereas 11.6%, 16.8% and 14.7% practiced incomplete room, home and no quarantine, respectively. Home quarantine without room quarantine had 24 times odds for transmitting disease [OR (95%CI)): 24.14 (4.87--119.75), P < 0.001] and not being in quarantine for any duration before being diagnosed was found to be 14 times riskier when compared with strict room quarantine [OR (95%CI)): 14.44 (2.42-86.17), P = 0.003]. Discussion: Low-resource settings successful in the initial phases of COVID-19 pandemic should make periodic revisions in the quarantine guidelines while continually promoting physical distancing strategies.

AB  - The relationship among the judiciary, public attitudes, public confidence and the institutional authority of courts in a democracy is complex. It is frequently asserted that courts depend on public confidence for the effectiveness and, indeed, legitimacy of judicial authority. Drawing on national interviews and surveys with Australian judicial officers, this article considers the judiciary's views about the nature and prevalence of public attitudes. It investigates individual judicial and institutional responses to perceived public criticism and commentary and considers activities aimed at affirmatively promoting improved public knowledge of courts and judicial work. Understanding the judiciary's own perceptions and attitudes generates important insights into the nature and limits of communication between courts and the public.

AB  - Aims.
   This study aimed to explore nursing staff's attitudes and use of music for older people with dementia in long-term care facilities.
   Background.
   Music has shown positive outcomes in managing behavioural symptoms of older people with dementia. Older people living in long-term care facilities often do not have access to trained music therapists. Nursing staff provide the majority of direct care for institutionalised older people with dementia, therefore, will be the most appropriate personnel to learn and implement music therapy for those with dementia. To date, no studies have explored nursing staff's attitudes and use of music for those with dementia.
   Design.
   A cross-sectional research design was used.
   Methods.
   A convenience sample of 285 nursing staff caring for those with dementia in long-term care facilities in Taiwan were recruited. Participants received a self-administered questionnaire consisted of items exploring nursing staff's attitude and use of music for those with dementia. A total of 214 participants completed the questionnaires, giving a response rate of 75 center dot 1%.
   Results.
   Most nursing staff held positive attitudes towards use of music for older people with dementia (mean = 84 center dot 89, range 23-115), but only 30 center dot 6% (n = 66) had used music for those with dementia in practice. The majority perceived that they had limited knowledge and skills about use of music (72 center dot 9%). Over half of the participants reported that they lacked resources and time to implement music therapy in practice.
   Conclusions.
   Nursing staff need more formal training to use music for those with dementia. Nursing staff can be the suitable personnel to learn easily and implement music therapy as a part of routine activity programmes for those with dementia.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   Appropriately trained nursing staff in long-term care facilities who use music therapy may help improve the mental health of older people with dementia.

AB  - Australia, along with nation-states internationally, has entered a new phase of environmentally focused activism, with globalised, coordinated and social media-enabled environmental social movements seeking to address human-induced climate change and related issues such as the mass extinction of species and land clearing. Some environmental protest groups such as Extinction Rebellion (XR) have attracted significant political, media and popular commentary for their sometimes theatrical and disruptive forms of nonviolent protest and civil disobedience. Drawing on green and cultural criminology, this article constitutes an autoethnographic account of environmental protest during the final stages of the initial COVID-19 lockdown in NSW, Australia. It takes as a case study a small protest by an XR subgroup called the Pedal Rebels. The article explores the policing of environmental protest from an activist standpoint, highlighting the extraordinary police resources and powers mobilised to regulate a small peaceful group of 'socially distanced' protesters operating within the existing public health orders. It places an autoethnographic description of this protest in the context of policing practice and green and cultural criminology. Additionally, it outlines the way in which such policing is emboldened by changes to laws affecting environmental protest, making activism an increasingly risky activity.

AB  - Social psychology has studied ethnic, gender, age, national, and other social groups but has neglected education based groups. This is surprising given the importance of education in predicting people's life outcomes and social attitudes. We study whether and why people evaluate education-based in-groups and out-groups differently. In contrast with popular views of the higher educated as tolerant and morally enlightened, we find that higher educated participants show education-based intergroup bias: They hold more negative attitudes towards less educated people than towards highly educated people. This is true both on direct measures (Studies 1-2) and on more indirect measures (Studies 3-4). The less educated do not show such education-based intergroup bias. In Studies 5-7 we investigate attributions regarding a range of disadvantaged groups. Less educated people are seen as more responsible and blameworthy for their situation, as compared to poor people or working class people. This shows that the psychological consequences of social inequality are worse when they are framed in terms of education rather than income or occupation. Finally, meritocracy beliefs are related to higher ratings of responsibility and blameworthiness, indicating that the processes we study are related to ideological beliefs. The findings are discussed in light of the role that education plays in the legitimization of social inequality.

AB  - This research discusses the potential of using big data for vocabulary learning from the perspective of learner-generated pictorial annotations. Pictorial annotations lead to effective vocabulary learning, the creation of which is however challenging and time-consuming. As user-generated annotations promote active learning, and in the big data era, data sources in social media platforms are not only huge but also user-generated, the proposal of using social media data to establish a natural and semantic connection between pictorial annotations and words seems feasible. This research investigated learners' perceptions of creating pictorial annotations using Google images and social media images, learners' evaluation of the learner-generated pictorial annotations, and the effectiveness of Google pictorial annotations and social media pictorial annotations in promoting vocabulary learning. A total of 153 undergraduates participated in the research, some of whom created pictorial annotations using Google and social media data, some evaluated the annotations, and some learned the target words with the annotations. The results indicated positive attitudes towards using Google and social media data sets as resources for language enhancement, as well as significant effectiveness of learner-generated Google pictorial annotations and social media pictorial annotations in promoting both initial learning and retention of target words. Specifically, we found that (i) Google images were more appropriate and reliable for pictorial annotations creation, and therefore they achieved better outcomes when learning with the annotations created with Google images than images from social media, and (ii) the participants who created word lists that integrate pictorial annotations were likely to engage in active learning when they selected and organized the verbal and visual information of target words by themselves and actively integrated such information with their prior knowledge.

KW  - public perceptions
KW  - COVERAGE
AB  - The imprisonment rate in New Zealand ranks seventh among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Yet the imprisonment of Indigenous people is on par with the United States, which has the world's highest incarceration rate. Almost 70% of the prison population in New Zealand is comprised of people racialized as non-White. In 2016, the National Government proposed to spend $2.5 billion over a 5-year period to build new prisons (1,500 prison beds) to accommodate a growing prison population. This study assessed public attitudes toward the need for more prisons and the equity of treatment of individuals within the criminal justice system. Findings from a 2016 and 2017 quantitative survey of 5,000 respondents each year revealed that roughly half of the respondents believed the proposed spending for new prisons to be extremely to somewhat necessary. A large proportion of respondents also believed Maori and Pakeha, if convicted of the same crime, are treated similarly within the criminal justice system. New Zealand scholars have critiqued news media coverage of contentious sociopolitical issues, such as crime and prisons, for employing tactics that have worked to construct a morally and culturally deficit "Other" while normalizing whiteness, rendering it invisible and raceless. This article concludes that this process masks racial disparities of individuals located within the criminal justice system and preserves the ideal that prisons are a normal function of the social landscape.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, adolescents faced hardships including being pulled from their schools and being unable to socialize with friends during mandated lockdowns. We had three aims in this study. First, we sought to test whether Chinese adolescents' resilience was strengthened, maintained, or weakened during the COVID-19 lockdown. Second, we sought to test whether adolescents' resilience predicted depressive symptoms and in turn, sleep problems. Third, we sought to examine the role social support may play. In a partially-longitudinal survey study, we demonstrated via a within-subject t-test and its Bayesian equivalent that Chinese adolescents' resilience weakened during the lockdown compared with before the pandemic. However, resilience remained an important predictor: A mediation model demonstrated that higher resilience was associated with fewer depressive symptoms, which in turn predicted fewer sleep problems. Moreover, we found that social support moderated this mediation: Strong social support reduced the negative effects of low resilience levels. These results help shed light on the fragility of resilience, its importance for adolescents' mental health when facing adversity, and how we might support adolescents experiencing social distancing mandates or who are otherwise isolated from their peers.

AB  - The British Thoracic Society have published SPACES (Sharing Patient Assessments Cuts Exposure for Staff) guidance recommending the use of telecommunications as a means of inpatient clinical assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. The aim of this audit was to reduce face-to-face exposure time during inpatient care of patients with suspected/confirmed COVID-19 using a telecommunications-based approach. 76 patients were included in the audit. 46 patients were included in cycle 1, which measured the average face-to-face time for clinical consultation per patient. 30 patients were included in cycle 2, whereby history-taking was conducted using telecommunications and, if required, face-to-face physical examination.
   Average face-to-face exposure time was reduced to a median of 0 seconds (IQR 0-146.3 seconds) in the telecommunications group, from a median of 312.5 seconds ( IQR 178.8-442.3 seconds) in the comparator group (p<0.0001). Patient satisfaction was high with individuals' responses revealing a perception of improved safety by maintaining social distancing. No adverse events were noted.
   The audit confirms telecommunications can be integrated successfully into the daily inpatient ward round structure, reducing face-to-face exposure time while maintaining patient satisfaction and safety.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the extent of overlap between autistic traits, body dissatisfaction and disordered eating and to explore the mediating effects of negative attitudes towards emotional expression and emotion dysregulation. The sample comprised 416 university students (82% females, 17-48 years [M=19.76, SD=3.85]), who completed an online questionnaire assessing eating attitudes and behaviours (including dieting, bulimia and oral control), body dissatisfaction, and autistic traits (including the Autism Quotient [AQ] and its related subscales as well as the Empathising Quotient). Attitudes towards emotional expression and emotion regulation were also assessed. Results revealed that eating pathology correlated highly with all AQ subscales, with the exception of the attention to detail subscale. However, there was no significant relationship between empathising and eating pathology. Path-analyses indicated that emotion dysregulation, but not negative attitudes towards emotional expression, was a significant mediator of the relationship between AQ body dissatisfaction and eating pathology. Direct relationships were also obtained for the AQ-bulimia and the AQ-oral control paths. Prevention and early intervention programs for eating pathology would likely benefit from addressing abnormalities in emotion processes in individuals who score highly on measures of autistic traits.

AB  - Aims and objectives. This study was conducted to determine the attitudes of undergraduate nursing students towards lesbian women and gay men.
   Background. Nursing education in Turkey is conducted holistically; in other words, it is an integration of the physical, spiritual, mental and social realms. Students are therefore expected to not express any discrimination due to factors such as religion, language, race and gender. However, some serious problems still exist in terms of the practical applications of that philosophy.
   Design. This study was descriptive.
   Methods. This study included 964 students. The Attitudes towards Lesbian Women and Gay Men scale and a questionnaire were used to learn about the attitudes of undergraduate nursing students regarding gay men and lesbian women.
   Results. Results of this study have indicated that the attitudes of religiously educated and/or conservative students towards lesbian women and gay men were negative. Female students from families with high incomes and highly educated families attended social activities and read more than other female students. The students with free life choice options expressed very positive attitudes towards gay men.
   Conclusion. The nursing education curriculum should cover information about patients with diverse sexual orientations and their absolute rights for equally optimal healthcare. Strategies to discourage traditional gender role stereotypes and educational and media experiences for better acceptance of sexual minorities need to be developed by educational policy makers. Antidiscrimination policies protecting lesbian women and gay men should be developed by the legislative authorities and then taught to students during their nursing education. Getting familiar with diverse sexual orientations might create awareness among nursing students and reduce their attitudinal and behavioural prejudices and biases.
   Relevance to clinical practice. To provide equal healthcare services for all patients, nurses must have accurate information about lesbian women, gay men and modify their attitude and behaviour accordingly.

AB  - Background: Young adults are at risk for HIV/STIs because they generally have an active sex life with multiple sexual partners; moreover, they use condoms to a lesser extent. Travelling increases sexually risky behaviour, and among both women and men, sexual contacts abroad are common. Better knowledge of how young adults experience prevention efforts prior to travelling, and what they prefer, is important when planning prevention efforts to this group. Experiences of and attitudes towards prevention efforts against HIV/STI among young adults in Sweden who have travelled abroad were investigated.
   Method: We conducted 12 focus-group interviews and four individual interviews with young adults (20-29 years) who had travelled abroad within the last 12 months. The interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed using thematic content analysis. Results were discussed from a salutogenic perspective.
   Results: Only a few had any experience of prevention efforts against HIV/STIs. The majority welcomed the idea of prevention efforts prior to travelling and would have welcomed more, preferably short reminders or links to reliable websites, or someone professional to discuss the issue with. Most of the young adults would use the Internet to search for information. They proposed the possibility of reaching young adults through social media, and the importance of better basic knowledge in school.
   Conclusion: It is difficult to reach young adults before their trips abroad. Prevention efforts on HIV/STI must therefore focus on the use of established forums. Setting the foundation for a positive attitude towards condom use is needed during school years. Even social media, where there is the possibility for dialogue, should be used as an information source.

AB  - This study addresses the effectiveness of political advertising in an extreme context, during war-time. A self-administered cross-sectional survey was used to collect data during the 2016 parliamentary elections in Syria. Structural equation modelling was utilized to test the hypothetical model and its invariance related to political involvement. The results indicated that beliefs are a four-dimensional structure consisting of information, veracity, sarcasm, and cynicism. Furthermore, war-time perceptions were found to negatively affect attitude towards political advertising via sarcasm among less politically involved voters. Negative attitude was found to be linked to lower levels of veracity among such voters and to higher levels of cynicism for those who are highly involved in politics. Negative attitudes regarding political advertising were found for lowering the chances for watching advertisements, for supporting a candidate, and for willingness to vote. The results also revealed that paying attention to political advertising does not relate to voters' intention to vote. This study is the first of its kind to empirically validate a conceptual model predicting voters' turnout behaviour based on voters' war-time perceptions, beliefs and attitudes regarding political advertising in an authoritarian setting. In addition, this study investigates whether the effects of the proposed model may be moderated by voters' political involvement.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic within the United States of America resulted in over 800,000 deaths as of February 2022 and has been addressed by social distancing or stay-at-home measures. Collective prolonged multimodal trauma on this scale is likely to elicit symptomatology in the general population consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), somatization, anxiety, and stress. The psychological component of this response contributes substantially to the burden of this disease worldwide. This cross-sectional study examines the relationship between COVID-19-related concern, anxiety, and perceived stress on PTSD-like symptomatology over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants were recruited via social media within the United States of America between 8th May 2020 and 11th August 2021 to complete an internet questionnaire including mood, personality, and COVID-19-specific scales. General anxiety and PTSD-like symptomatology were above the screening cutoffs for most respondents. These measures increased in severity over the pandemic, with the change point of our Concern scale preceding that of the other significant measures. Measures of COVID-19-related concern, generalized anxiety, and PTSD-like symptomatology were strongly correlated with each other. Anxiety, perceived stress, and PTSD-like symptomatology are strongly interrelated, increase with pandemic length, and are linked to reported levels of concern over COVID-19. These observations may aid future research and policy as the pandemic continues.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly spread, becoming a global pandemic with significant health, economic, and social impacts. COVID-19 has caused widespread anxiety, which at healthy levels leads to adaptive, protective behavioral changes. For some individuals, a pandemic outbreak can lead to excessive, maladaptive levels of anxiety, particularly among those with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and health anxiety. In the present paper, we review past research studies that examined anxiety in response to other disease outbreaks (including Swine Flu, Zika, and Ebola) to serve as a guide for expectable responses to COVID-19. Our review focused on the role of belief-based cognitive variables (obsessive beliefs, contamination cognitions), transdiagnostic processes (disgust sensitivity, anxiety sensitivity, an intolerance of uncertainty), social factors, and environmental/situational variables as contributing factors to excessive concerns about past pandemics. These factors in combination with unique characteristics of the virus (disease, behavioral, social and economic factors) and media consumption might enhance vulnerability to excessive anxiety about COVID-19, in line with a diathesis-stress model. COVID-19 is also unique from past pandemics due to its severity, easy transmissibility, and the nature of prescribed behavioral responses (i.e., hand washing and social distancing). We therefore discuss the ways in which COVID-19 may disproportionately affect individuals with OCD and health anxiety. We conclude with important topics for clinical and research attention to help mental health professionals respond in this time of crisis.

AB  - Events in 2005 such as the G8 Summit in Gleneagles and the Make Poverty History campaign have been successful in focusing the public's attention on the problem of world poverty. Despite these high-profile events and consistently high levels of public support for development assistance programmes, people's understanding of poverty and development issues remains shallow and levels of official development aid for many OECD countries fall well below the 0.7 per cent GDP goal. In this article we examine what factors drive individual-level attitudes of concern for poverty, how the media portray poverty in developing countries and how media portrayal affects individuals' concern for poverty. Drawing on extant literature on motivations for aid, we argue that individual concern for poverty can stem from self-interest or moral drivers. However, the implications of the different drivers do not appear to be well understood, yet they have important consequences for DFID and the OECD; strategies based on preference-accommodation rather than preference-shaping strategies may undermine rather than strengthen public concern for poverty. The data for the article come from DFID's 2005 Omnibus survey of public attitudes towards development and a content analysis of eight UK newspapers from January to December 2005. Using a binary logistic regression model we estimate individual concern for poverty in developing countries as a function of moral judgements, self-interest, awareness of poverty and assessments of achieving Millennium Development Goals, controlling for a host of demographic variables. Results from the content analysis show that economic and political frames dominate media coverage of poverty in developing countries. We find differential effects for moral and self-interested attitudes on concern for poverty; moral attitudes are positively related to concern, whereas self-interested attitudes are negatively related to concern.

AB  - Governments and public health institutions across the globe have set social distancing and stay-at-home guidelines to battle the COVID-19 pandemic. With reduced opportunities to spend time together in person come new challenges to remain socially connected. This essay addresses how the pandemic has changed people's use of digital communication methods, and how inequalities in the use of these methods may arise. We draw on data collected from 1,374 American adults between 4 and 8 April 2020, about two weeks after lockdown measures were introduced in various parts of the United States. We first address whether people changed their digital media use to reach out to friends and family, looking into voice calls, video calls, text messaging, social media, and online games. Then, we show how age, gender, living alone, concerns about Internet access, and Internet skills relate to changes in social contact during the pandemic. We discuss how the use of digital media for social connection during a global public health crisis may be unequally distributed among citizens and may continue to shape inequalities even after the pandemic is over. Such insights are important considering the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's social wellbeing. We also discuss how changes in digital media use might outlast the pandemic, and what this means for future communication and media research.

AB  - Colleges and universities around the world engaged diverse strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic. Baylor University, a community of similar to 22,700 individuals, was 1 of the institutions which resumed and sustained operations. The key strategy was establishment of multidisciplinary teams to develop mitigation strategies and priority areas for action. This population-based team approach along with implementation of a "Swiss Cheese" risk mitigation model allowed small clusters to be rapidly addressed through testing, surveillance, tracing, isolation, and quarantine. These efforts were supported by health protocols including face coverings, social distancing, and compliance monitoring. As a result, activities were sustained from August 1 to December 8, 2020. There were 62,970 COVID-19 tests conducted with 1435 people testing positive for a positivity rate of 2.28%. A total of 1670 COVID-19 cases were identified with 235 self-reports. The mean number of tests per week was 3500 with approximately 80 of these positive (11/d). More than 60 student tracers were trained with over 120 personnel available to contact trace, at a ratio of 1 per 400 university members. The successes and lessons learned provide a framework and pathway for similar institutions to mitigate the ongoing impacts of COVID-19 and sustain operations during a global pandemic.

AB  - Background: Regular physical activity (PA) has documented effects in prevention and treatment of many non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Physical inactivity is recognized as the fourth leading risk factor for premature death, worldwide. Despite these facts, physical inactivity is increasing, not only in high-income, but also in middle-and low-income countries. To address this negative trend, evidence-based methods to increase PA are needed. The purpose of this paper is to describe the implementation and assessment of 4 strategies designed to increase PA in Vietnam.
   Methods: Four strategies were used: i) introduction and evaluation of an education and training program on the Swedish method of Physical Activity on Prescription (PAP) among health care professionals, ii) translation of the PAP evidence-based handbook, Physical Activity in the Prevention and Treatment of Disease (called FYSS in Swedish) into Vietnamese, iii) launch of a mass-media campaign to promote PA, and iv) advocacy to support development of PA guidelines in Vietnam.
   Results: The evaluation indicated that the participating health care professionals had a positive attitude to PAP. However, they also reported uncertainty in prescribing PA. FYSS was translated and disseminated successfully to health care professionals. A mass-media campaign identified the beneficial effects of PA to health care professionals, journalists, policy makers, and the public. Last, the process of developing national guidelines on PA was initiated.
   Conclusion: This project led to enhanced awareness and appreciation of PA in the prevention and treatment of NCDs among health care professionals as well as initiation of national PA guidelines. Important lessons also were learned in the presentation of PAP, which will be considered when designing similar projects in the future.

AB  - Given the salience of socialization factors on adolescence and their role in vulnerability to disasters and trauma, this study examined whether COVID-19-associated fears and impacted quality of life mediated associations between pandemic-focused family conversations and media exposure and subsequent youth mental health. A primarily Latinx sample of adolescents (N = 167; Mage = 16.2 years, 44.9% female) participated in a longitudinal (summer 2020-winter 2020) COVID-19 study. COVID-19 media exposure predicted engagement in relevant safety behaviors, which negatively impacted quality of life, which in turn predicted increased internalizing problems. COVID-19 family conversations predicted social distancing fears, which negatively impacted quality of life, which then in turn also predicted increased internalizing problems. Targeting key socialization factors may minimize negative consequences following major community trauma among adolescents.

AB  - A nationally representative sample (N = 1050) responded to a survey testing possible connections between Americans' attention to media about President Donald J. Trump's preference for fast food, their perceptions of Trump, and public perceptions and behavioral intentions regarding fast food consumption. This survey utilized measures aimed at integrating theory about audience responses to celebrity health issues with the Theory of Planned Behavior and found a significant positive relationship between attention to media about Trump's diet and perceptions that fast food is socially acceptable, as well as intentions to consume it. Some, but not all, media-related variables in the analyses were positively associated with fast food perceptions and intentions, even after controlling for demographic and psychosocial factors. Attention to media specifically about Trump's dietary habits was more often associated with fast food-related perceptions and outcomes than were other types of media attention. Additionally, having a positive parasocial relationship with Trump was positively associated with increased perceived acceptability of fast food. There were also differences in the connections between attention to media about Trump's diet, parasocial relationships with Trump, and fast food perceptions and consumption intentions for audiences with different political affiliations. For instance, attention to media about Trump in general was positively associated with more positive attitudes toward fast food for Republicans, but not for Democrats are those unaffiliated with either political party. Attention to media specifically about Trump's diet was positively related to fast food attitudes for both Republicans and Democrats but not unaffiliated individuals. This study demonstrates the important role of social, political, and media influences in shaping fast food related perceptions and preferences and offers many potential avenues for future research in this area.

AB  - Introduction Thalassaemia is an inherited blood disorder, for which definitive treatments remain largely inaccessible. The recommended approach to reduce the disease burden is by prevention through screening. Currently, the implementation of thalassaemia preventive measures is poorly regulated in Indonesia. Thalassaemia prevention and education are best targeted to the youth, but information on their awareness towards thalassaemia is limited. This study aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) towards thalassaemia among Indonesian youth. Methods This observational study took place between January and May 2021. An online questionnaire was disseminated to Indonesian youth aged 15-24. Eligible respondents included carriers, unaffected individuals and individuals with unknown carrier status. The questionnaire comprised 28 questions to assess KAP. A cut-off of 75% was used to categorise participant's KAP into poor or negative and good or positive. Descriptive statistics, chi(2) test, logistic regression and Pearson correlation were performed for data analysis. Results A total of 906 responses were gathered, and 878 were analysed. Most respondents had poor knowledge (62.1%), positive attitude (83.3%) and poor practice (54.4%) towards thalassaemia. The results implied that respondents had limited understanding regarding the types of thalassaemia and the difference between asymptomatic carriers and individuals without the thalassaemia trait. Many (82.6%) believed they were not carrying thalassaemia trait despite the fact that most (95.7%) never got tested. Age, education, gender, residence and family income were key factors that correlated with or predicted the youth's KAP towards thalassaemia. Older respondents and women were more likely to have good KAP. Conclusion Thalassaemia screening targeted to the youth is urgently needed, and future interventions must consider sociodemographic factors that may affect how they perceive the disease. Social media appeals to the youth as an important source of information, but school, parents and health professionals should also be involved in delivering education about thalassaemia.

AB  - BackgroundThe fact that pharmacists are in the front line of patients' care gives a great responsibility to focus on education and training of pharmacy students to build a 'patient-centered' clinicians. Unfortunately, pharmacy education in the developing countries, have been lagging behind actual practice delivered by pharmacists. This highlighted the need to evaluate the perceptions of undergraduate pharmacy students regarding their current pharmacy training practices and experiences.MethodsThis is a cross-sectional study that was conducted in Jordan during the period from August 2018 to October 2018. During the study period, a questionnaire was distributed to pharmacy students to collect information regarding 1) pharmaceutical care services provided by them during their experiential training, 2) their perceptions towards training sites, 3) their perceptions of the outcomes of their training experience, 4) information about their training site and 5) their demographics characteristics.ResultsA total of 202 pharmacy students responded to the questionnaire. The majority of them reported having the opportunity to dispense refill or new prescriptions (73.8%, n=149), and conduct patient interviews (69.8%, n=141, but they were not provided good opportunities to create electronic patient profiles using the information obtained (53.0%, n=107), perform required dose calculations based on patient information (37.6%, n=76), and interact with other healthcare professionals (34.6%, n=70). In addition, students showed positive attitudes toward training sites, positive feedback about the outcomes of their training experience (median scores range between 4 and 5 for all statements (IQR=1 for all)).ConclusionStudents showed positive feedback about the outcomes of their training experience, but they felt that the selected training sites do not have adequate resources to meet their training competencies. Memorandums of understanding development is needed to specify the purpose of training and define the responsibility for both parties of the training process.

AB  - Mitigation of agricultural diffuse pollution poses a significant policy challenge across Europe and particularly in the UK. Existing combined regulatory and voluntary approaches applied in the UK continue to fail to deliver the necessary environmental outcomes for a variety of reasons including failure to achieve high adoption rates. It is therefore logical to identify specific on-farm mitigation measures towards which farmers express positive attitudes for higher future uptake rates. Accordingly, a farmer attitudinal survey was undertaken during phase one of the Demonstration Test Catchment programme in England to understand those measures towards which surveyed farmers are most receptive to increasing implementation in the future. A total of 29 on-farm measures were shortlisted by this baseline farm survey. This shortlist comprised many low cost or cost-neutral measures suggesting that costs continue to represent a principal selection criterion for many farmers. The 29 measures were mapped onto relevant major farm types and input, assuming 95% uptake, to a national scale multipollutant modelling framework to predict the technically feasible impact on annual agricultural emissions to water and air, relative to business as usual. Simulated median emission reductions, relative to current practise, for water management catchments across England and Wales, were estimated to be in the order sediment (20%) > ammonia (16%) > total phosphorus (15%) >> nitrate/methane (11%) > nitrous oxide (7%). The corresponding median annual total cost of the modelled scenario to farmers was 3 pound ha(-1) yr(-1), with a corresponding range of -84 pound ha(-1) yr(-1) (i.e. a net saving) to 33 pound ha(-1) yr(-1). The results suggest that those mitigation measures which surveyed farmers are most inclined to implement in the future would improve the environmental performance of agriculture in England and Wales at minimum to low cost per hectare.

AB  - Objective The publication of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) randomized, controlled trial in 2002 resulted in a critical discussion on the risks and benefits of hormone replacement therapy (HRT). The present study aims to evaluate the attitude of German gynecologists regarding changes in the prescription of HRT over recent years.
   Method A questionnaire was sent to all 9589 German gynecologists in private practice in November 2010.
   Results The response rate was 2548 (26.6%). Whereas 82.2% of the responders stated that their advice for primary hormone therapy and alternative agents depended on the severity of symptoms, 9.1% of the responders would recommend HRT in the first place (male: 14.3%; female: 6.1%; p < 0.001). An age limit for hormone prescription was stated by 26.2%, with a mean age limit of 63 +/- 5.3 years. An increasing number of patients and becoming more critical about HRT after the WHI was mentioned by 79.8%. Of the responding doctors, 43.9% found that their patients were badly informed by the media, 44.5% stated they were moderately or well (10.1%) informed, whereas only 1% considered their patients to be very well informed. HRT was prescribed for the relief of vasomotor symptoms by 97.4% of responders, making this the primary indication. This percentage decreased slightly to 92.6% between 2003 and 2008 (p < 0.001) and increased again to a similar level at the beginning of 2010 (96.7%, p < 0.05).
   Conclusion German gynecologists generally have a positive attitude towards HRT, but find it important to focus on the evaluation of the risk-benefit ratio. The major barriers to prescription are multiple concerns of the patients resulting from non-objective media.

AB  - Mobile technology opens the door for a new kind of learning called here and now learning that occurs when learners have access to information anytime and anywhere to perform authentic activities in the context of their learning. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of here and now mobile learning on student achievement and attitude. The research questions addressed were (1) Does "Here and Now" mobile learning significantly improve student achievement when compared with Computer based Instruction? (2) Does "Here and Now" mobile learning significantly improve student attitude when compared with Computer based Instruction? (3) Are there differences in student achievement and attitudes when "Here and Now" mobile learning is delivered using a tablet versus ipod? 109 undergraduate students enrolled in preservice instructional design and instructional technology courses at a regional southeastern university participated in the study. Participants took a pretest at the beginning of the study, and then were assigned to one of the versions of an art lesson (CBI version and iPad/iPod version) which were developed using Lectora Inspire incorporating information on five different paintings in the education building. After the lesson, they completed the posttest and an attitude survey. ANOVA was conducted on data obtained from the achievement posttest and on the attitude survey results for the Likert type items (Items 1-12). Analyses on achievement and attitude data revealed positive significant differences. The CBI treatment achieved positive posttest scores on the posttest while the iPad/iPod treatments had positive attitudes. This study has implications for those designing and implementing mobile learning. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With respect to both competitive and amateur/fitness sports, media may strongly influence young people's opinions and behaviors concerning the use of PAES (Performance and Appearance Enhancing Substances). The present investigation addressed this topic by focusing on sport sciences students' beliefs concerning the possible role of media related to the implementation and evaluation of a PAES-focus media literacy intervention conducted with sport science students. This study relied on a sample of 521 students (attrition rate 10.3%) (45.1% female, mean age = 22.6, SD = 2.20), which provided baseline data on students' levels of media literacy concerning the use of PAES (i.e. "descriptive sample"), and a sample of 248 students, who participated in and provided data on the media literacy intervention. This latter sample included a group of 128 students (44.5% female, mean age = 23.03, SD = 3.76) who actively participated in the intervention (i.e. "intervention group"), and a group of 120 students who did not (i.e. "control group", 53.3% female, mean age = 22.25, SD = 2.47). All students filled out media literacy questionnaires targeting students' awareness of media influence, their views about the realism of media content, their sense of confidence in dealing with media messages, and their positive attitudes toward PAES use. Analyses of questionnaire data showed that students are relatively aware of media influence on people's views and behaviors with respect to PAES use. At the same time, students also believed that young people do not consider media as "realistic sources" of information; nonetheless, they also did not consider themselves entirely capable of dealing effectively with media messages. With respect to the intervention, students overall appreciated and greatly welcomed the educational program on media literacy, and the analyses of intervention data across intervention and control groups showed that key media literacy variables changed over time, attesting to the overall effectiveness of the intervention.

AB  - This study models local and cross-city transmissions of the novel coronavirus in China between January 19 and February 29, 2020. We examine the role of various socioeconomic mediating factors, including public health measures that encourage social distancing in local communities. Weather characteristics 2 weeks prior are used as instrumental variables for causal inference. Stringent quarantines, city lockdowns, and local public health measures imposed in late January significantly decreased the virus transmission rate. The virus spread was contained by the middle of February. Population outflow from the outbreak source region posed a higher risk to the destination regions than other factors, including geographic proximity and similarity in economic conditions. We quantify the effects of different public health measures in reducing the number of infections through counterfactual analyses. Over 1.4 million infections and 56,000 deaths may have been avoided as a result of the national and provincial public health measures imposed in late January in China.

AB  - Background One central aspect of health literacy is knowledge of patients' rights. Being an important source of information about health and health care, the media may influence health literacy and act as a policy implementer.
   Objective To investigate whether regional news media coverage in Sweden is linked to (i) the public's awareness and knowledge of a patient's rights policy, the waiting-time guarantee and (ii) the public's attitudes to how the guarantee's time limits are met, that is, implementation success.
   Design and data Three types of data are used. First, a national telephone survey of the public's awareness, knowledge and attitudes; second, media coverage information from digital media monitoring; and third, official waiting-time statistics. Bivariate and multivariate regression analyses are performed with the 21 Swedish county councils/regions as a base.
   Results In the county councils/regions, non-awareness ranged from 1 to 15% and knowledge from 47 to 67%. There are relatively large differences between population groups. The amount of regional media coverage shows no significant correlation to the level of awareness and knowledge. There is, however, a significant correlation to both positive and negative attitudes; the latter remains after controlling for actual waiting times.
   Discussion and conclusions At the national level, the media function as a policy implementer, being the primary source of information. At the regional level, the media are part of the political communication, reporting more extensively in county councils/regions where the population holds negative views towards the achievement in implementing the guarantee. We conclude that Swedish authorities should develop its communication strategies to bridge health literacy inequalities.

AB  - Purpose: Asthma morbidity in children is associated with family psychosocial functioning. Although the family plays a pivotal role in maintaining optimal asthma care, the mechanism of how family support influences asthma outcomes is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of barriers to adherence in mediating the effect of family support on asthma outcomes in adolescents.
   Methods: The sample included 126 adolescents with asthma aged 13-20 years, living in the Northeast United States. The sample consisted of 49% Whites and 51% minorities, including primarily Blacks (38%) followed by Hispanic (11%). Adolescents provided self-reported data. Structural equation modeling was performed to examine the direct and indirect relationships between family support and asthma outcomes.
   Results: Family support was positively associated with asthma control and quality of life. These significant associations were mediated by barriers to adherence. Particularly, family support was found to reduce barriers concerning adolescents' negative attitudes toward medication and healthcare providers, which in turn improved asthma control and quality of life symptoms, emotional functioning, and activity domains. Adolescents' cognitive difficulty also tended to mediate the relationship between family support and emotional functioning.
   Conclusion: This study highlights the beneficial effects of family support in improving asthma outcomes in adolescents. Family support exerts the positive effect by ameliorating barriers to treatment adherence in adolescents, particularly the barriers associated with negative attitudes and cognitive challenges. The findings underscore the importance of incorporating family assessment and intervention in caring for adolescents with asthma. (C) 2010 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine.

AB  - In the absence of target treatments or vaccination, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic can be impeded by effectively implementing containment measures and behaviors. This relies on individuals' adoption of protective behaviors, their perceived risk, and the use and trust of information sources. During a health emergency, receiving timely and accurate information enables individuals to take appropriate actions to protect themselves, shaping their risk perception. Italy was the first western country plagued by COVID-19 and one of the most affected in the early phase. During this period, we surveyed 2,223 Italians before the national lockdown. A quarter of the sample perceived COVID-19 less threatening than flu and would not vaccinate, if a vaccine was available. Besides, most people perceived containment measures, based on social distancing or wearing masks, not useful. This perceived utility was related to COVID-19 threat perception and efficacy beliefs. All these measures were associated with the use of media and their truthfulness: participants declared to mainly use the Internet, while health organizations' websites were the most trusted. Although social networks were frequently used, they were rated lower for trustfulness. Our data differ from those obtained in other community samples, suggesting the relevance to explore changes across different countries and during the different phases of the pandemic. Understanding these phenomena, and how people access the media, may contribute to improve the efficacy of containment measures, tailoring specific policies and health communications.

AB  - Individuals with disabilities comprise the largest minority group in the world, yet they are the most underrepresented minority group in higher education, the job market and entertainment media such as literature. This population is often underrepresented because of the overlapping physical, attitudinal and policy barriers that prevent them from participating fully in society. Despite their large numbers, individuals with disabilities not only encounter personalised prejudice, but also experience institutionalised prejudice. In an effort to reduce negative attitudes toward individuals with disabilities, this study examined the effects of positive disability exemplars on people's attitudes. A comparison between implicit and explicit measures of prejudice found that implicit bias of able-bodied students was more entrenched than explicit biases.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown has disrupted the daily routine and required an adjustment to 'new normal'. The psychological impact of 'lockdown' as a social distancing strategy among children needs to be studied well.
   Aim: To assess the psychological impact of 'lockdown' on behaviour of children and adolescents.
   Methods: An online survey was conducted among parents of 3-15-year-old children by using Google Form. A 35-item self-designed questionnaire was used for the purpose of the study. Total 645 responses were received by the stipulated time.
   Results: The mean age of the children was 8.3 years (+/- 3.5). Majority of the children were male (51.6%), 1st born child (82.2%), and studying in primary school (44.8%). Near about one-third on the children became irritable (35.3%), hyperactive (33.3%), defiant/ disobedient (38%), anxious (29.9%), and crying often (32.7%) during the period of lockdown. Near about two-third of the children engaged more in mobile phones (63.4%) and watched television (58.1%) compared to their usual self during lockdown. Near about two-third (58.3%) and onethird (32.2%) of the children reported change in their sleeping and feeding habit respectively. Majority of the male (38.7%) and female (42.6%) children coped well with the lockdown.
   Conclusion: Index survey suggested that one-third of the children and adolescents were adversely affected due to lockdown.

AB  - For many social science scholars, the COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to re-think our approaches to research. As a result of new social distancing measures, those of us who conduct in-person qualitative and ethnographic research have faced significant challenges in accessing the populations and fields we study. Technology served as an incredibly useful tool for social interaction and research prior to the pandemic, and it has since become even more important as a way to engage with others. Although not all types of social research, or even all projects, lend themselves to online activities, digital communication platforms like Zoom, Skype, and Facebook have allowed many of us to continue our studies from a distance-in some cases, significant temporal and spatial distances away from our research sites. As such, it is important to consider how these different methodological approaches challenge our understandings of fieldwork. While the disadvantages of not physically accessing the places we study are clear, can mediated approaches offer (any) hope of the immersion we experienced with in-person fieldwork? If many of us are able to continue ethnographic research (in some form) without co-locating with our participants in our field sites, how are our studies fundamentally affected, as well as the ways we conceptualize the 'field' more largely? This paper explores these methodological and epistemological questions through reflections on conducting online research during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Recent years have witnessed an increased public outcry in certain quarters about a perceived lack of attention given to successful members of disadvantaged groups relative to equally meritorious members of advantaged groups, exemplified by social media campaigns centered around hashtags, such as #OscarsSoWhite and #WomenAlsoKnowStuff. Focusing on political ideology, we investigate here whether individuals differentially amplify successful targets depending on whether these targets belong to disadvantaged or advantaged groups, behavior that could help alleviate or entrench group-based disparities. Study 1 examines over 500,000 tweets from over 160,000 Twitter users about 46 unambiguously successful targets varying in race (white, black) and gender (male, female): American gold medalists from the 2016 Olympics. Leveraging advances in computational social science, we identify tweeters' political ideology, race, and gender. Tweets from political liberals were much more likely than those from conservatives to be about successful black (vs. white) and female (vs. male) gold medalists (and especially black females), controlling for tweeters' own race and gender, and even when tweeters themselves were white or male (i.e., advantaged group members). Studies 2 and 3 provided experimental evidence that liberals are more likely than conservatives to differentially amplify successful members of disadvantaged (vs. advantaged) groups and suggested that this is driven by liberals' heightened concern with social equality. Addressing theorizing about ideological asymmetries, we observed that political liberals are more responsible than conservatives for differential amplification. Our results highlight ideology's polarizing power to shape even whose accomplishments we promote, and extend theorizing about behavioral manifestations of egalitarian motives.

AB  - The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has adversely affected individuals' mental health. Social isolation as a result of social distancing during the pandemic potentially affects the associations among perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depression in university students. The present study examined the associations among university students' perceived available peer support, emotional well-being (as indicated negatively by loneliness and negative affects and positively by positive affects and hope), and depressive symptoms. During the third wave of the COVID-19 outbreak in July, 2020, 255 students at a public university in Hong Kong participated in an online-based survey that assessed their perceived available peer support, emotional well-being, and depressive symptoms. Results showed that perceived available peer support negatively contributed to depressive symptoms; both negative and positive indicators of emotional well-being mediated the association between perceived available peer support and depressive symptoms. Our results also suggested that university students showed signs of elevated depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Thus, our study advanced the theoretical understanding of university students' mental health in the time of a global pandemic. Our study also highlighted the practical needs for preventive efforts and accessible care to support the psychological and emotional needs of young people during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The objective of this study was to gain insights into how victims use their visual attention to determine the sincerity of an offender's apology during simulated victim-offender mediation. We hypothesized that the victims' visual attention (gaze fixation duration) would be focused more on the offender's upper (than lower) face area, especially the eyes and the eyebrows, to infer the degree to which the offender suffers, takes responsibility, and has empathy for the victim. In turn, we expected these inferences to positively predict the perceived sincerity of the apology. Additionally, we took into account the victims'a prioriexpectations regarding the sincerity of the apology and (positive) attitudes toward resocialization programs (ARPs). We expected both variables to enhance the above proposed process through which victims determine the sincerity of the apology. Fifty-eight students took the victim's role in a fictitious crime scenario and watched a video in which the offender offered a remorseful apology. We obtained eye tracking data to determine the participants' fixation and attention distribution. As expected, the participants' gaze fixated significantly longer on the upper face. The results also showed that their prior expectations, positive ARPs, and inferences of suffering and responsibility taking after the apology all positively predicted the perceived sincerity. However, unexpectedly, gaze duration was not directly associated with these inferences. The fixation duration on the upper face instead appeared to moderate how ARPs predicted inferences of responsibility taking. More concretely, the exploratory path model analyses revealed that when the participants had more positivea prioriARPs, the longer they focused on the offender's eyes and eyebrows and the more they concluded that he took responsibility for his actions (which in turn predictedmoresincerity). However, for those with relatively negative ARPs, it was the other way around: the more they focused on the eyes and the eyebrows, the stronger they inferred that the offender didnottake responsibility (which predictedlesssincerity). Our findings demonstrate the vital role of the victims'a prioriattitudes, expectations, and eye gaze behavior in understanding the reception and the evaluation of offenders' apologies. This study also suggests how novel technology can be used to investigate gaze behavior in the field of victim-offender mediation.

KW  - CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS
AB  - During the first four weeks of the COVID-19 lockdown, African countries recognized that the COVID-19 pandemic would be one of the biggest disasters the continent has faced in recent times. The effects of the virus were being felt at unprecedented levels and like all nations in the world, countries in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) were grappling with travel bans and social distancing measures. Through a critical discourse analysis lens, this article examines the tensions and contradictions evident in the excerpts of online news articles and newspaper reports published from March 2020 to September 2020 in the SACU region, focusing on the instructive decision-makers charged with the pandemic-driven technology's adoption and the impact of these decisions on tertiary students in the region. Central to our argument is that responsiveness should not come at the cost of accessibility as this will have a negative impact on remote teaching and online learning, and further entrench the vicious cycle of epistemic injustice and inequity. The discourse in the media reveals that most universities are heavily reliant on learning management systems in an attempt to save the academic year, while there is evidence of unevenness in the distribution of digital infrastructure which has an impact on economically marginalized students. Beyond digital equity issues, there was a need for differentiated professional development activities for lecturers on technology-enabled pedagogies and e-assessments. Furthermore, there is a need for an in-depth exploratory large-scale research to document user-stories on the emergence of remote teaching in the SACU region in order to develop a service-oriented architecture for digital education in higher education institutions (HEIs).

AB  - Background: Telemedicine is a resource to provide health care to patients social distancing and prevent their exposure to the risk of contamination by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in medical-hospital settings. This study evaluated a virtual model of care in acromegalic patients.
   Methods: We recruited 78 acromegalic patients, 65% female, median age 63 years. Outpatient management was remodeled to simplify access to care by (1) adoption of virtual meetings; (2) collection of blood samples at home; (3) abolishment of printed prescription and provision of electronic files directly to central pharmacy; and (4) drugs delivered to patients' home. Patients and physicians filled electronic surveys 48 h after each consultation.
   Results: The patients expressed satisfaction with convenience (91.1%), decreased wait time (85.1%), and saving money (79.2%) compared to face-to-face visits. Most patients felt supported by the medical team (89.1%) and kept the prescriptions updated (84.8%). The physicians reported resolutive appointments in 92.2% of cases, despite longer time to reach the patients and subsequent calls to complement missing information. Satisfaction and patient-provider relationship were maintained during the study, but the choice for virtual appointment for the next appointment fell from 78.7% to 34.8% after 6 months. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) was confirmed in 13% of patients, mostly mild and moderate manifestations.
   Conclusion: Telemedicine is a tool for medical care in underserved populations, feasible even in low-income countries. This study suggests that it is difficult to sustain exclusive remote care for more than 6 months. The method could be adopted interchangeably with in-person consultations in acromegalic patients with stable disease.

AB  - Emergency departments play a critical role in the public health system, particularly in times of pandemic. Infectious patients presenting to emergency departments bring a risk of cross-infection to other patients and staff through close proximity interactions or contacts. To understand factors associated with cross infection risk, we measured close proximity interactions of emergency department staff and patients by radiofrequency identification in a working emergency department. The number of contacts (degree) is not related to patient demographic characteristics. However, the amount of time in close proximity (weighted degree) of patients with ED personnel did differ, with black patients having approximately 15 min more contact with staff than non-white patients. Patients arriving by EMS had fewer contacts with other patients than patients arriving by other means. There are differences in the number of contacts based on staff role and arrival mode. When crowding is low, providers have the most contact time with patients, while administrative staff have the least. However, when crowding is high, this differential is reversed. The effect of arrival mode is modified by the extent of crowding. When crowding is low, patients arriving by EMS had longer contact with administrative staff, compared to patients arriving by other means. However, when crowding is high, patients arriving by EMS had less contact with administrative staff compared to patients arriving by other means. Our findings should help designers of emergency care focus on higher risk situations for transmission of dangerous pathogens in an emergency department. For instance, the effects of arrival and crowding should be considered as targets for engineering or architectural interventions that could artificially increase social distances.

AB  - Study objective: We describe the implementation of a mobile pediatric emergency response team for mildly ill children with influenza-like illnesses during the H1N1 swine influenza outbreak.
   Methods: This was a descriptive quality improvement study conducted in the Texas Children's Hospital (Houston, TX) pediatric emergency department (ED), covered, open-air parking lot from May 1, 2009, to May 7, 2009. Children aged 18 years or younger were screened for viral respiratory symptoms and sent to designated areas of the ED according to level of acuity, possibility of influenza-like illness, and the anticipated need for laboratory evaluation.
   Results: The mobile pediatric emergency response team experienced 18% of the total ED volume, or a median of 48 patients daily, peaking at 83 patients treated on May 3, 2009. Although few children had positive rapid influenza assay results and the morbidity of disease in the community appeared to be minimal for the majority of children, anxiety about pandemic influenza drove a large number of ED visits, necessitating an increase in surge capacity. Surge capacity was augmented both through utilization of existing institutional resources and by creating a novel area in which to treat patients with potential airborne pathogens. Infection control procedures and patient safety were also maximized through patient cohorting and adaptation of social distancing measures to the ED setting.
   Conclusion: The mobile pediatric emergency response team and screening and triage algorithms were able to safely and effectively identify a group of low-acuity patients who could be rapidly evaluated and discharged, alleviating ED volume and potentially preventing transmission of H1N1 influenza.

AB  - Purpose During COVID-19 pandemic, the use of social media enhances information exchange at a global level; therefore, customers are more aware and make backup plans to take optimal decisions. This study explores the customer psychology of impulse buying during COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The researcher, being a social constructionist, aims at understanding social patterns in impulsive buying strategies during COVID-19 pandemic. Forty UK consumers were participated using the telephonic interview method with the purpose to maintain social distancing practices. Findings Results revealed that vulnerable group of people, fear of illness, fear of empty shelves, fear of price increase and social inclination to buy extra for staying at home, increased panic impulsive buying behaviour among customers. Many people socially interpreted the evidence of death rate and empty shelves, which led to more disinformation, rumours and sensationalism, which increased customers' impulsive buying behaviour. Finally, risk of going outside, COVID-19 outbreak among employees of local retail stores, and health professionals' recommendations to stay at home, led to impulsive buying behaviour. Originality/value This study has constructed a research framework of customer psychology of impulse buying based on the results of this study and fear and perceived risk theories. The study also explains how the fear of fear, risk perception and conformist tendency enhanced impulsive buying during COVID-19 pandemic. This study has discussed specific implications for retailers.

AB  - Background: Young people are becoming increasingly exposed to the risk of HIV infection. According to the 2008 HIV/Syphilis sentinel survey in Nigeria, 3.3% of young people aged 15-19 years are infected. Primary prevention especially abstinence, remains one of the most realistic interventions for reducing further spread of the virus. However, the adoption of sexual abstinence as a prevention strategy among adolescents remains low and factors influencing its practice among urban young people in Nigeria are relatively unknown. The aim of the study was to document the sexual abstinence behaviour of in-school adolescents, the factors influencing or obstructing abstinence, and knowledge of HIV and AIDS in Ibadan, South-West Nigeria.
   Methods: The study was a descriptive cross-sectional survey of students in Ibadan South-West Local Government Area. A total of 420 respondents (52% males and 48% females), selected through a multistage sampling technique, completed a semi-structured questionnaire. This was supplemented with eight focus group discussions (FGDs) which had an average of 9 respondents within the 10 and 19 years age group. The data from the FGDs were transcribed and summarized manually while the quantitative data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences to generate frequencies, cross tabulations of variables and logistic regression analysis.
   Results: Twelve percent of the entire sample had ever had sex. Overall, knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention was high and most respondents favoured the promotion of abstinence as an HIV prevention strategy. A smaller proportion of male respondents (79%) abstained compared with the females (98%). Major predictors of sexual abstinence were being a female, not having a boyfriend or girl friend, not using alcohol and having a positive attitude towards abstinence (P < 0.05). Sexual abstinence was also significantly associated with perceived self efficacy to refuse sex and negative perception of peers who engage in sexual behaviours (P < 0.05). Majority of the FGD discussants suggested the involvement of parents, media, schools, faith-based institutions and non governmental organizations in promoting the adoption of abstinence.
   Conclusions: The sexual abstinence behaviour of young persons is influenced by multiple factors and should be considered in determining the effectiveness of interventions targeting this behaviour. Coherent sexuality education interventions to promote the adoption of abstinence among young people are urgently needed.

Past studies have evaluated the risk factors of opioid use disorder (OUD) and overdose, but few focused on the risk factors for inappropriate opioid use that can lead to an OUD. This study aims to perform a secondary analysis on the publicly available database of the 2013-2014 NYC Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NYC HANES) to identify the risk factors for inappropriate and appropriate opioid use among participants. We used multinomial logistic regression analysis to examine which factors are associated with opioid use. We also examined effect modification by gender and education. There were 1237 participants, 57% were female and the median age was 39 (IQR 29-54) years. Younger age, male, not physically active at all in the past 30 days, former smoker, cocaine and/or heroin use in past 12 months, and diagnosis of depression/anxiety were significantly associated with inappropriate opioid use, compared to no opioid use. Further, we observed an elevation in inappropriate opioid use among females who were Non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic, and that the association between no physical activity and inappropriate opioid use was stronger among those with lower education level. Overall, important risk factors associated with opioid use were found that can inform our approaches to mitigate the opioid epidemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has substantially induced worries and affected individual mental health and subjective well-being. Nonetheless, a high level of social capital could potentially protect individuals who suffer from mental health problems and thus promote their subjective well-being, especially under the social distancing policies during the pandemic. To this end, based on a random sample of 1053 Hong Kong adults, structural equation modeling was applied to study the path relationships between the worries of COVID-19, social capital, mental health problems, and subjective well-being. The study found that worries during the pandemic were associated with mental health and subjective well-being, through social capital as a mediator. Moreover, social capital exhibited a stronger influence on mental health and subjective well-being in the economically inactive group than in the economically active group. This study highlights the important role of social capital during the COVID-19 pandemic. While Hong Kong's COVID-19 response has primarily focused on disease prevention, it must be noted that social services and mutual-help activities are also crucial for people to withstand the crisis.

AB  - Background: Smartphone and social media use are an integral part of our daily life. Currently, the impact of excessive smartphone and social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic is poorly understood. The present study aimed to investigate problematic smartphone use (PSPU) and problematic social media use (PSMU) among Bangladeshi college and university students during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out involving 5,511 Bangladeshi college and university students (male: 58.9%; mean age: 21.2 years [SD = 1.7]; age range: 18-25) during the social-distancing in the COVID-19 pandemic (July 2020). A self-reported survey containing questions regarding socio-demographic, lifestyle, and home quarantine activities along with four psychometric scales was completed by participants.
   Results: The mean scores of PSPU and PSMU were 20.8 +/- 6.8 (out of 36) and 14.7 +/- 4.8 (out of 30). Based on a hierarchical regression analysis, PSPU and PSMU were positively associated with lower age, poor sleep, social media use, watching television, anxiety, and depression. Additionally, PSMU was linked to being female, living with nuclear family, having urban residence, irregular physical exercise, poor engagement with academic studies, and avoiding earning activities, whilst being male, being married, living with lower-income family, and alcohol consumption were linked to PSMU.
   Conclusions: The findings indicate that PSPU and PSMU were linked to poor psychological well-being (i.e., anxiety and depression) and other factors (especially lower age, poor sleep) during the pandemic, further suggesting the need for interventions including virtual awareness programs among college and university students.

KW  - DESIGN
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate an area of growing importance that is widely recognised in the literature relating to the issue of how to improve ways that assessments and feedback are provided to students within higher education. This paper reports on a study that aimed to explore the views of both educators (n = 70) and students (n = 540) on feedback and feed-forward at a UK university. The study also investigated their experience and attitudes to social media applications as a means of enhancing access to feedback within the context of mobile learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research approach adopted in this study predominately conforms to a quantitative research design though embeds elements of qualitative research via a "mixed methods" approach. The overall methodology of the paper adheres to an exploratory case study in a higher education environment to identify various issues and approaches that could be addressed or enhanced to aid ways that assessments and feedback are disseminated to students within higher education.
   Findings - Participants' views were sought in relation to students receiving learning materials, as well as feedback from tutors directly to their smartphones and mobile devices. In addition, the study explored possible reasons for students not wanting to use social media and mobile devices for their learning and feedback. Overall, the results indicated a positive attitude on the part of educators and students to using mobile devices and social media applications for teaching and learning purposes.
   Research limitations/implications - The case study presented in this paper draws on findings from one higher educational institution. Further research is required to determine the generalisability of the findings to allow comparison of the findings to be undertaken within other higher education institutions.
   Originality/value - The originality of the paper is that it provides detailed empirical evidence and findings that provide several important implications in relation to enhancing the student learning experience and providing considerable improvements to the way that feedback is provided that make it more likely that students will take more notice to feedback and act upon it. This in turn enables educators to better plan and manage their teaching and student experience online and through students' mobile devices. The value of this study is that it explores views of both educators and students, whereas many other previous studies tend to focus on the views of either educators or students.

AB  - Background The persistence of threatened and protected wildlife depends not only on habitat suitability but also remarkably on local communities' acceptance. The black-necked crane (Grus nigricollis) is a flagship species for conservation on the plateau in western China. However, the human dimension has been completely ignored in the decision-making process for conservation. Methods In this study, a questionnaire survey aiming to assess knowledge of and conservation attitude toward this bird was carried out among 1042 students of 7th and 9th grade from 12 schools in Weining county, Guizhou province, which has a large wintering population in an urban wetland. Logistic regression was used in the generalized linear model to identify the determinants that significantly affect students' knowledge of and conservation attitude toward this species. Results Most students have positive attitudes toward conservation, which is significantly affected by awareness, knowledge of this bird and grade. However, they have somewhat limited knowledge of this bird's biology and ecosystem services (nature's contributions to people). Knowledge was found to link with observation of the bird and grade, while observation related to the experience of visiting the wetland. Social media is the most cited resource to obtain knowledge on this bird. Conclusion It is suggested that local conservation experts could help introduce more information on the black-necked crane in the schools and help conduct outdoor education activities in and around the wetland. Traditional knowledge and culture could also be incorporated into the conservation awareness enhancing program. This study focuses on the human dimension for conserving the black-necked crane in China, showing significant implications in the design and application of effective measurements to improve students' perception and attitude toward its conservation. Future assessments should include other local populations, such as farmers, fishers, and urban citizens.

AB  - The design of university training programs affects academic outcomes therefore, exploring the various design components in the academic program is important. The study explored how participating in a co-teaching-based professional development program (PDP) affects novice teachers' self-efficacy, their attitudes toward the profession, and their application of pedagogical practices; and measured the correlation between self-efficacy and attitudes and how it is influenced by the application of pedagogical practices. We used a questionnaire answered by 300 novice teachers and interviews with 15 teachers who participated during their academic studies in the co-teaching-based PDP. The results indicated a higher sense of self-efficacy and attitudes toward the profession among teachers who participated in the co-teaching-based PDP. The relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and attitudes was partially mediated by six pedagogical applications. The findings provide insights on designing PDP that may contribute to ameliorating the entrance of novice teachers into the teaching profession with teaching skills that will sustain over time.
   Practitioner Notes
   1. Connecting experiential components from the educational field is important in the professional academic training of teachers. The findings of the study show that the integration of a component of co-teaching by university educators strengthens the academic course and contributes to teachers' self-efficacy and positive attitudes toward the teaching profession.
   2. The findings of the study confirm the positive and significant relationship that exists between teachers' self-efficacy and their attitudes toward the teaching profession. University educators need to take this into account in teaching and designing learning environments.
   3. The relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and attitudes was mediated by several pedagogical practices: applying constructivist pedagogical practices; matching to differences between learners; collaboration between fellow teachers; accountability; planning and teaching management; and academy-community relationships. University educators, therefore, should include these aspects in academic curricula.

AB  - Background: Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is a highly effective weight-loss intervention that often reduces preference and intake of high-energy foods. Research into the neural mechanisms behind this shift has mainly focused on reward processing of food cues. However, the ability to successfully control food intake and thereby weight-loss also depends on inhibitory control capacity. We investigated whether RYGB leads to alterations in neural inhibitory control in response to food cues.
   Methods: A food-specific go/no-go task with pictures of high-energy (desserts) and low-energy foods (vegetables), was used to assess neural inhibition responses before and after RYGB with functional magnetic resonance imaging. Data from 18 morbidly obese patients (15 females; age 41 +/- 11 years; BMI 42 +/- 4 kg/m(2) before; BMI 36 +/- 4 kg/m(2) after) were analysed. Pre- and post-RYGB BOLD fMRI responses were compared for response inhibition towards high- and low-energy foods. Participants were tested in a satiated state.
   Results: Response inhibition to high-energy foods was associated with increased activation of the right lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), right medial PFC, dorsolateral PFC, right middle cingulate cortex and the right inferior frontal operculum (involved in inhibitory control), after compared to before surgery. Response inhibition to low-energy foods elicited diminished post- compared to pre-surgery responses in the left superior temporal pole, right parahippocampal gyrus and right hypothalamus (involved in metabolic control).
   Conclusion: Neural changes indicate improved response inhibition towards high-energy food cues, altered influence of metabolic control during response inhibition towards low-energy food cues and a more positive attitude to both high-energy and low-energy food after RYGB. Alterations in neural circuits involved in inhibitory control, satiety signalling and reward processing may contribute to effective weight-loss after RYGB.

AB  - Objective: Attitudes and individual difference variables of car and racing enthusiasts regarding high-risk behaviors of street racing and stunt driving have recently been investigated. Positive attitudes toward high-risk driving, personality variables such as driver thrill seeking, and other self-reported risky driving acts were associated with these behaviors. However, probable relationships among high-risk driving tendencies, everyday driving behaviors, and negative road safety outcomes have remained largely unexamined. This study aimed to investigate the associations among car and racing enthusiasts' high-risk driving attitudes, self-reported everyday driving violations (i.e., ordinary and aggressive violations), and self-reported negative outcomes (i.e., collisions and driving offense citations).
   Method: A web-based survey was conducted with members and visitors of car club and racing websites in Ontario, Canada. Data were obtained from 366 participants. The questionnaire included 4 attitude measures-(1) attitudes toward new penalties for Ontario's Street Racers, Stunt and Aggressive Drivers Legislation; (2) attitudes toward new offenses of stunt driving under the same legislation; (3) general attitudes toward street racing and stunt driving; (4) comparison of street racing with other risky driving behaviors-self-reported driving violations (i.e., ordinary and aggressive violations); self-reported collisions and offense citations; and background and driving questions (e.g., age, driving frequency).
   Results: Results revealed that attitudes toward stunt driving offenses negatively and general attitudes toward street racing and stunt driving positively predicted ordinary violations, which, in turn, predicted offense citations. Moreover, general attitudes toward street racing and stunt driving positively predicted aggressive violations, which, in turn, predicted offense citations.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that positive high-risk driving attitudes may be transferring to driving violations in everyday traffic, which mediates driving offense citations.

AB  - Background This study aimed to explore the attitudes of registered physiotherapists (PTs) in Israel toward people identifying as lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) and to identify background characteristics associated with their attitudes toward LGB individuals. Methods This nationwide study in Israel employed an observational design. Participants completed an anonymous online questionnaire which included demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, gender, sexual orientation, religious affiliation, and religiousness) and questions regarding sources of knowledge about LGB individuals, and type of acquaintance with an LGB individual. In addition to two self-assessment questions regarding levels of homophobia (active engagement against LGB individuals) and heterosexism (holding negative opinions regarding LGB individuals) answered on a five point Likert scale (1 - not at all homophobic/ heterosexist, 5- very homophobic/ heterosexist) and the Hebrew version of the Attitudes Toward Homosexuality Scale (ATHS). Participants were recruited through professional organizations, social media, and word of mouth. Results The data of 383 registered PTs practicing in Israel were analyzed. The median score regarding level of homophobia and heterosexism was one ("not at all"). ATHS scores ranged between 32 and 110 (out of 110), with a median score of 106 and 41% scoring below the median. Multivariant logistic regression indicated that identifying as men, heterosexual orientation, and religiousness were significantly associated with less positive attitudes toward LGB individuals. Only 2% of the participants reported having been introduced to issues regarding the LGB community during their professional physiotherapy education. Conclusions Registered PTs in Israel demonstrated favorable attitudes toward LGB individuals, as reflected both by ATHS scores and levels of self-reported homophobia and heterosexism. Based on the current results regarding sources of knowledge, updating the physiotherapy curriculum to include information regarding sexual orientation and health of the LGB community is suggested.

AB  - Background: The overall global burden of stroke or cerebrovascular accident in Saudi Arabia is great and increasing. The community knowledge of stroke symptoms has an effect on early recognition and thereby the mortality and morbidity rates.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of the community about stroke risk factors and symptoms in Tabuk city, Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: In this cross sectional study, questionnaires were distributed on a random sample from the population of Tabuk city after obtaining an informed consent. A total of 350 study participants were enrolled into this study.
   Results: Two hundred and thirty six (67.4%) of participants were females with a median age (IQR) of 29 (21=40) years. More than half (52.3%) of the participants correctly identified stroke as a disorder of the brain. Two hundred and seventy two subjects (77.7 %) knew at least one risk factor for stroke, and 44.5% of them identified that a combination of hypertension, atherosclerosis, obesity and smoking are stroke risk factors. Most of participants (74.0%) knew warning signs of stroke. Analysis of factors associated with knowledge of one or more warning signs revealed only a significant relationship with the knowledge of stroke risk factors (p>0.05). Nearly half (55.1%) of the participants showed a positive attitude of rapid seeking of medical help by going to hospital either at once or after calling general practitioner or family physician.
   Conclusion: There was a lack of knowledge about the organ affected and warning signs of stroke. Also, the proper attitude in cases of stroke was not clear to all participants. This requires more awareness strategies including health education by specialists.

AB  - The aim of the current study was to examine the associations between a number of individual factors (demographic factors (age and gender), personality factors, risk-taking propensity, attitudes toward drink driving, and perceived legitimacy of drink driving enforcement) and how they influence the self-reported likelihood of drink driving. The second aim of this study was to examine the potential of attitudes mediating the relationship between risk-taking and self-reported likelihood of drink driving. In total, 293 Queensland drivers volunteered to participate in an online survey that assessed their self-reported likelihood to drink drive in the next month, demographics, traffic-related demographics, personality factors, risk-taking propensity, attitudes toward drink driving and perceived legitimacy of drink driving enforcement. An ordered logistic regression analysis was utilised to evaluate the first aim of the study; at the first step the demographic variables were entered; at step two the personality and risk-taking were entered; at the third step, the attitudes and perceptions of legitimacy variables were entered. Being a younger driver and having a high risk-taking propensity were related to self-reported likelihood of drink driving. However, when the attitudes variable was entered, these individual factors were no longer significant; with attitudes being the most important predictor of self-reported drink driving likelihood. A significant mediation model was found with the second aim of the study, such that attitudes mediated the relationship between risk-taking and self-reported likelihood of drink driving. Considerable effort and resources are utilised by traffic authorities to reducing drink driving on the Australian road network. Notwithstanding these efforts, some participants still had some positive attitudes toward drink driving and reported that they were likely to drink drive in the future. These findings suggest that more work is needed to address attitudes regarding the dangerousness of drink driving.

AB  - Background The increasing frequency of extreme weather events across the globe, the intensifying international debates about the political urgency to mitigate climate change, as well as the respective more action demanding social movements have caused a significant increase in climate change awareness among the population. Little research, however, has systematically analyzed the behavioral impact of this development. Using Germany as a case study, we therefore scrutinize whether the recent increase in climate change awareness triggered mainly changes in public perceptions concerning environmental and sustainability issues or whether it has led to sustainable behavioral shifts. Based on previous research, we considered two routes through which an increase in climate change awareness can instigate changes: (a) directly by leading to behavioral changes towards more sustainable consumption decisions, or (b) indirectly by exerting pressure on the political process. Results The analyzed data in the three consumption sectors of mobility, food consumption and housing confirm the continuing prevalence of an attitude-behavior gap: although there is a broad, strongly positive attitude towards climate protection and increasingly high problem awareness of climate change, so far this attitude does not immediately translate into notable behavioral changes. With regard to effects on political agenda setting, however, the effects are much more immediate. The results confirm strong pressure on the political process mainly through shifts in voter behavior. Conclusions The results show that the increase in climate change awareness has spurred dynamics in the debate around climate change both among the population and in the political realm. Fueled by the intense media coverage of the Fridays For Future movement and related activities, a snowball effect has been set off, opening a window of opportunity for significant shifts towards more effective and rigorous climate policies. Politicians and decision-makers now have the opportunity to implement sustainability measures with strong support of the population, even if these imply higher costs. Whether there will be further shifts in the current lifestyle towards a more sustainable one, lifestyle changes should be carefully monitored in the coming years, as relevant data are only now becoming available.

AB  - Background: Breast diseases in women, whether benign or malignant, are very commonly encountered. The breast is the commonest site for female cancer in Egypt (38.8%). Breast cancer screening can reduce morbidity and mortality and improve the survival rate for this malignancy. Mammogram can be used as a screening technique beside its role as diagnostic, especially in women over 40 years of age.
   Objectives: To assess knowledge, attitude and practice regarding breast cancer and awareness about mammogram as a screening method among a group of females attending Ain Shams University outpatient clinics.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed from August to September 2017. A systematic random sample was taken from attending females (18-70 years) in Ain Shams University outpatient clinics (Internal Medicine, Surgery, Pediatrics Hospital, and Maternity hospital). They were interviewed using a questionnaire inquiring about sociodemographic background, participants' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards breast cancer and its screening.
   Results: The mean age +/- SD of attending females (18-70 years) was 37 +/- 11 years. Most study participants had correct information about mammography. They showed poor knowledge level about risk factors. Mass media such as TV and internet were identified as the main source of information on breast cancer by 43% and 23.9%, respectively. In general, participants had positive attitude towards breast cancer screening by mammography. Around 90% agreed that mammogram was the best way to find a very small lump in the breast, and 91.4% agreed that women who have regular screening by mammogram have better disease outcome than those who do not screen. Regarding mammography practice rate, a small percent of participants (8.1%) was advised by their doctors to conduct a screening mammography. The level of knowledge was significantly and positively correlated with their attitude towards breast cancer screening.
   Conclusion: The poor knowledge and practices of women illustrate the need for health education program directed to Egyptian females to improve their knowledge about breast cancer-especially its risk factors-and its screening. Using TV and Internet as media for spreading information about this disease is crucial.

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have an increasing influence on the way we interact, learn, and live. The increase in teaching and learning methodologies that are mediated by ICT in the field of education and in the domestic settings encourages the design of new effective technological tools, supported by scientific research and development to improve student learning. The challenge psychology is facing in the education field is to promote those technologies and make them available to the education community. Technologies also would produce attractive items for users and realistic commercial issues for businesses. This also allows an effective transfer for scientific work, providing visibility to Research and Development. In this context, the main aim of the article is to describe the process to get an agreement between Babyradio (a children's entertainment company: https://babyradio.es/) and our research team, starting a collaborative work between two groups of people (Babyradio's technical designer and Psychologist-Engineers software designer), in order to create several educative applications (APPs) in the field of early mathematics cognition. The institutional framework of the relationship of the R&D project and a children's entertainment company is described. The article also focuses on experience in Psychology, Technological Innovation, and Entrepreneurship. In considering the efficiency of the agreement, we present different APPs designed for tablets and smartphone devices, adapted to the different operating systems (IOS, Android, Windows). APPs are designed to instill the cognitive fundamentals associated with early math learning for students aged 4 to 7 years. The study developed after this babyradio-university enterprise agreement contributes to the development of mathematics skills in children, aged 4-7 years, so that they can successfully meet the mathematics school requirements; it also contributes to encouraging a more positive attitude toward mathematics. This study also suggests how the education system and software and educational content developers' companies would manage verified instructional APPs, with a more realistic commercial perspective.

AB  - HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) has proven efficacy in reducing the risk of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM), but has not yet been commissioned in the UK. The aim of this study was to investigate perceived need and benefit (or experience of) PrEP among HIV-negative MSM attending sexual health clinics. HIV-negative MSM attending three sexual health centres in London, UK were opportunistically invited to complete a questionnaire. Data collected comprised demographic data and sexual and drug use behaviours as well as questions regarding perceptions of risk and need for PrEP. Logistic regression analysis was undertaken to identify variables predicting acceptability of, and intention to use, PrEP. In addition, data were gathered in respondents already taking PrEP. Eight hundred and thirty-nine questionnaires were analysed. The median age of respondents was 35 years (IQR 28-41, range 18-78), 650 (77%) were of white ethnicity and 649 (77%) had a university education. Four hundred and fifty-six (54%) reported at least one episode of condomless anal sex in the preceding three months, 437 (52%) reported recreational drug use in the preceding three months and 311 (37%) had been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection within the preceding six months. Four hundred and sixty-three (64%) of 726 strongly agreed with the statement I think I would benefit from PrEP'. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that having receptive anal intercourse (RAI) without condoms, having an awareness of the risk of unprotected RAI and having belief in the effectiveness of PrEP were independent predictors for someone thinking they would benefit from taking PrEP. Eight percent of respondents (59/724) had already taken or were currently taking PrEP. The results suggest that individuals at risk are likely to perceive themselves as benefiting from PrEP. The majority perceived their risk of acquiring HIV and benefit from PrEP accurately. Overall they appeared to have little concern over the use of PrEP and generally positive attitudes. Further investigation is warranted to understand why those at risk do not perceive benefit from PrEP.

KW  - CARE
AB  - Background Hong Kong has been embroiled in increasingly violent social unrest since June, 2019. We examined the associated population mental health burden, risk factors, and health-care needs.
   Methods In a population-based prospective cohort, adult participants aged 18 years or older were assessed at nine timepoints from 2009. Probable depression was measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (score >= 10) and suspected post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) by the PTSD Checklist-Civilian Version (score >= 14), plus direct exposure to traumatic events related to the ongoing social unrest. We used multivariable logistic regression to identify factors associated with both outcomes, adjusting for doctor-diagnosed depression or anxiety disorders before the unrest. On the basis of routine service statistics and respondents' intention to seek professional care, we projected the number of additional ambulatory specialist psychiatric visits required.
   Findings After the two baseline surveys, we followed up random subsets of 1213-1736 adults at each timepoint. Probable depression was reported by 11.2% (95% CI 9.8-12.7) of participants in 2019, compared with 1.9% (1.6-2.1) during 2009-14 and 6.5% (5.3-7.6) in 2017 after the Occupy Central Movement and before the current unrest. Prevalence of suspected PTSD in 2019 was estimated to be 12.8% (11.2-14.4). Age, sex, educational attainment, or household income were not associated with either outcome, whereas heavy social media use (>= 2 h per day) was associated with both. Political attitude or protest participation was not associated with probable depression, but neutrality towards the extradition bill approximately halved the risk of suspected PTSD. Family support mitigated against probable depression. We estimated that the mental health burden identified would translate into roughly an excess 12% service requirement to the public sector queue or equivalent.
   Interpretation We have identified a major mental health burden during the social unrest in Hong Kong, which will require substantial increases in service surge capacity. Health-care and social care professionals should be vigilant in recognising possible mental health sequelae. In a world of increasing unrest, our findings might have implications for service planning to better protect population mental health globally. Copyright (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the last decades, there have been substantial changes in public attitudes toward gender roles and in television's landscape and messages. Our meta-analysis of nearly 50 years of studies of television's contribution to gender role attitudes is based on 485 effect sizes from 69 independent samples (N = 57,542) and reveals an overall effect size of .102. While we found no evidence of any decline of this association over time, it is significantly weaker for gender role attitudes related to the public sphere. Our findings imply that television viewing may strengthen an "egalitarian essentialism ideology," that is, a discrepancy between the endorsement of gender equity in the public sphere/workplace and the persistence of traditional views regarding the private/domestic sphere.

AB  - Political parody, which is entitled to free speech protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, aims at criticizing politicians' policies and ideas with humor. As such, political parodies represent a serious threat to a politician's brand image and reputation. Despite their prevalence in political life and debates, the relative persuasive effects of political parodies based on their communication source (user-generated parody [UGP] vs. media-generated parody [MGP]) have been underexplored. To fill this gap, we developed two studies. The first study involved content analysis of more than 330 parody videos posted on YouTube between 2012 and April 2019 in France. Our findings, in Study 1, showed that MGP led to fewer likes and a more negative attitude toward the parody than UGP. The second study, based on controlled experiment, provided evidence through mediation; compared to UGP, MGP led to more negative attitudes toward the parody and less perceived influence of the parody because of a higher perception of the source's intention to manipulate. This mediating effect was significant only when individuals were highly skeptical of traditional media. These findings add to current theories of political parody, free speech and user-generated content and offer actionable insights to practitioners.

AB  - Early in the pandemic and prior to the development of the COVID-19 vaccine, prevention measures were promoted to help inhibit the spread of the virus. To optimize adherence to prevention practices, it's important to understand factors that may influence adherence. A study was conducted in the month of April, 2020, to explore the influence of perceptions of COVID-19 on prevention practices. The sample included members of a public social-media group focused on providing updates and information on COVID-19. A total of 719 individuals completed an online survey that assessed various aspects of COVID-19 which included experience, perceptions, and prevention practices. The perceptions of COVID-19 included perceived susceptibility of contracting the virus, and perceived potential severity if contracted COVID-19. To assess prevention practices, the survey included a 10-item prevention practices questionnaire that included items such as wearing a mask, and social distancing. Results revealed that perceived susceptibility of contracting COVID-19, and potential severity of COVID-19 were significant in predicting prevention practices. Further, results suggest that perceived potential severity predicts a greater proportion of the variance in prevention practices than susceptibility of contracting COVID-19. In addition, a moderation analysis revealed no interaction between perceived susceptibility and severity, which provides evidence that the variables do not influence one another. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic that marked its presence with the need for social distancing, mandatory self-isolations, quarantines and administrative regulatory lockdowns, has, in turn, ushered in a major transition into an all-consuming digital realm, from the physical, material world. The significance of the virtual interactions on digital platforms have increased manifold with tele-mediated interrelationships occurring at work (within the work-from-home mode), education (with stay-at-home schooling), in consumption patterns (online shopping and delivery of products) and political undertakings (such as mailed in polling). As a direct outcome, the idea of space - both physical and social - are undergoing transformations in the way they are being perceived today, more so, within the economic sectors and labour processes. Remote working in India skyrocketed under the influence of COVID-19 and set newer trends in motion making it intriguing to understand how work patterns have changed under this modus operandi. Adopting a primary survey method, conducted online, among IT sector employees of India, results have been generated across various socio-demographic categories to answer questions of efficiency and productivity, availability of infrastructure and work environment, major challenges and benefits encountered and the desired continuity of work-from-home. Through this, the study seeks to highlight whether changing work practices is leading to an overarching sense of digitality over space.

AB  - Background
   A pilot study about the effectiveness of a universal school-based programme, "The Little Prince is Depressed", for preventing depression in Chinese adolescents in Hong Kong was conducted and reported previously. This study used a larger sample to examine the effectiveness and sustainability of the programme.
   Methods
   This study used quasi-experimental design. Twelve schools enrolled in "The Little Prince is Depressed" programme either as an intervention or a control condition. The intervention schools carried out the 12-session programme in two phases: the professional-led first phase and the teacher-led second phase. All participants were required to complete a questionnaire at three time points measuring their (1) depressive, anxiety, and stress levels; (2) knowledge of mental health; (3) attitudes towards mental illness; (4) perceived social support; and (5) help-seeking behaviours.
   Results
   A total of 3,391 students participated in the study. The level of depressive symptoms did not reduce significantly at post-intervention; however, a delayed effect was observed at follow-up assessment for the participants of the teacher-led group in reducing anxiety and stress levels. Also, the knowledge of mental health and attitudes towards mental illness of the intervention-group participants significantly improved at post-test, and the outcomes were maintained at 4 to 5 months after the intervention in both the professional-led and the teacher-led conditions (p<.05). A preference among schoolchildren for whom to seek help from was identified.
   Conclusions
   The universal depression prevention programme was effective in enhancing knowledge of mental health and promoting a more positive attitude towards mental illness among adolescents in Hong Kong. In particular, the teacher-led group showed better outcomes than the professional-led group in reducing students' anxiety and stress at follow-up period. The programme can achieve sustainability in schools if teachers are provided with adequate support.

AB  - In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic and current era of social distancing, video conferencing platforms have taken on a new importance as virtual gathering spaces in lieu of face-to-face interactions. Online interactivity has expanded the ways in which individuals experience connection, intimacy, and touch. Although digital media has traditionally been thought of as disembodied, I argue that it has the ability to elicit intense feelings of embodied touch. This essay will address the embodied nature of digital spaces and the urgent need for both physical distance and virtual closeness. Using Laura Marks's theory of haptic visuality, in which vision takes on a tactile quality, and the concept of virtual touch, a term I developed during my doctoral research in which an affective sensory response of touch is elicited through non-tactile senses, I analyze two performance works that I developed in the HopKins Black Box Performance Laboratory at Louisiana State University: Being Present (2016). Directed by Naomi Bennett, Performances by Jason Jedrusiak and Gabi Vigueira, HopKins Black Box, Louisiana State University. , and (dis)embodied in space: an interactive art installation (2019). Created by Naomi Bennett, Sound Design by Hal Lambert, Performances by Kalli Champagne, Emily Graves, Ethan Hunter, Greg Langner, Josiah Pearsall, and Montana Jean Smith, HopKins Black Box, Louisiana State University. . Using telepresence, which allows individuals to interact remotely in real-time using digital technology, or telematics, these two performances explore new possibilities for virtual intimacy, connection, and touch.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the pre and post-vaccination effects of vaccination on various COVID SOPs and to determine whether or not HCWs take adequate precautions.
   METHODOLOGY: This cross-sectional study was conducted between May and July 2021. Online survey forms were distributed via social media platforms, completed by male and female house officers, medical officers, postgraduate trainees, residents, and specialists/consultants at Holy Family Hospital in
   RESULTS: Our study enrolled 104 volunteers. The participants ranged in age from 18 to 30 years, and males constituted more than half of the study population. The most frequently used designation was postgraduate trainees/residents, which accounted for 34% of all participants. 100% of medical professionals used masks before vaccination, and 45% of medical professionals practiced social distancing. Fourteen of the participants discontinued the use of masks following vaccination. Hand washing and sanitizing habits decreased by 14.
   CONCLUSION: Vaccination has made life easy for HCWs, as negative trends are observed towards preventive measures. The pandemic timeline and physical and mental well-being depreciation also played a crucial role in the COVID-19 SOPs. So let us all hope that the whole population gets vaccinated and the virus gets eradicated.

AB  - Religious beliefs, practices, and social support facilitate coping with psychologically distressful events and circumstances. However, COVID-19 and governmental mandates for social distancing and isolation make in-person communal forms of religious coping difficult. While some congregations began holding virtual rituals, this was not an option for Amish and conservative Mennonite groups that restrict communication and media technologies as a religious sacrament. Governmental mandates placed a disproportionate burden on these groups whose members could not conduct rituals or interact virtually with other members and family. What religious coping strategies did the Amish and Mennonites use to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic given their restricted ability to participate in in-person rituals? We collected data from The Budget and The Diary, two Amish and Mennonite correspondence newspapers, which provide information on the experiences of community members. We content analyzed all entries from March 2020 to April 2020 and identified several themes related to religious coping focused on the positive benefits of the pandemic, specifically how it helps and reminds the Amish and Mennonites to refocus on the simple and important things in life, including God, spirituality, family, tradition, gardening, and other at-home hobbies, all of which reflect their religious commitment to a slower pace of life.

AB  - Researching people in their chaotic and complex everyday lives is challenging for researchers at any time but especially during the application of social distancing measures. In this article, we make the case for the methodical potential of mobile messengers such as WhatsApp for qualitative mobile in situ research. We exemplify the productive use of the Mobile Instant Messaging Interview (MIMI), a research method developed by Kaufmann and Peil in 2020, to study participants' everyday life in real-time. Based on two case studies from geography and communication studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, we expound our experiences in the practical application of the MIMI approach and give recommendations. We conclude that MIMIs are a low-cost, easily feasible and short-term implemented approach for research interests across disciplines and possessing great potential for exceptional circumstances like the COVID-19 pandemic. They allow direct access to the practices and experiences of people in situ and in real-time that would otherwise stay hidden and inaccessible to social sciences. The method is suitable for research projects of any size, and can be applied as part of multi- and mixed methods designs and as well for longitudinal designs. Nonetheless, the MIMIs have to be well prepared, demand smart ways of nudging participants into elaborating their responses and require careful coordination between larger teams of researchers.

AB  - Minority groups are especially vulnerable to the negative psychological and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study focused on one prominent minority group in Israel: ultra-Orthodox Jews. It examined the rate of exposure to COVID-19, adherence to COVID-19 mitigation guidelines, difficulties with adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, COVID-related concerns, financial hardships, the need for help, and microaggression during the first wave of the pandemic (April-May 2020). It then examined multivariate prediction of COVID-related concerns, the need for help, and microaggression. The sample comprised 252 respondents, with 67% female and a mean age of 32.85 (SD = 10.63). Results showed that 78.8% of the participants knew at least one person who had tested positive for COVID-19, and 31.4% knew at least one person who had passed away from COVID-19. Only 59.7% of the participants reported high adherence to social distancing guidelines. Perceived microaggression was predicted by the difficulties with adherence to COVID-19 guidelines, the level of stress associated with exposure to the media, and financial hardships. The study's implications point to the centrality of perceived microaggression and the necessity of adopting culturally sensitive approaches to engage minorities in public efforts to fight the spread of viruses.

AB  - Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in March 2020 in Jordan that has continued to grow and impact all spheres of our lives, the government has been struggling to curb the pandemic through a range of safety and health measures. To this end, the government officials have employed diverse linguistic strategies in different media outlets to realize persuasion on the target audience in order to increase their awareness about the ongoing crisis and win public compliance and cooperation. Therefore, the present paper seeks, as its overriding goal, to explore the common linguistic strategies used by the Jordanian government to enhance its credibility and convince the public of the importance of effective adherence to its Covid-19 related policies (e.g. social distancing, face mask wearing, and self-hygiene). As an eclectic method of inquiry, the study draws generally on the perspective of discourse analysis and pragmatics. In addition, our analysis is informed by a corpus-based approach. The synthesis of our findings demonstrates that the government consistently and systematically utilizes various strategies for its persuasive intention (e.g. metaphor, repetition, and religious quotation). It also shows that the rationale beyond the respective persuasive techniques seems to win public compliance and cooperation, reassure the public, undermine opponent's counterclaims, and project a trustworthy and praiseworthy image.

AB  - As a response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has temporarily relaxed restrictions to serve people who are opioid dependent during social distancing mandates. Changes include allowing patients to take home more doses of methadone and buprenorphine rather than coming to the clinic every day (for methadone) or weekly (for buprenorphine) and relaxed restrictions on telehealth delivery. Telemedicine Program representatives have described the relaxing of federal regulations as a "silver lining" to the COVID-19 pandemic. Drawing from medical anthropology approaches to epidemic surveillance and understandings of risk, we critically evaluate media representations of recent changes to telemedicine, prescribing, and opioid treatment delivery. Ethnographic research with providers and stakeholders in Arizona from 2017 to the present add insight to our analysis of media reports on these topics. Our findings demonstrate that media portrayal of access to medication-assisted treatment (MAT) as the key to preventing both COVID-19 and overdose among people who are opioid dependent misses important risks and potential inequities. Applied social science questions raised by the new guidelines include: who receives take-home doses of methadone and buprenorphine and why; and how media representations of risk and benefit rationales shape real-world policy and practice.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study is to determine the main variables associated with nurses' sickness absence (SA) and to improve the prediction of SA based on pandemic-related experiences. The second aim is to examine the differences between COVID-19 (CoV) and non-COVID-19 (non-CoV) nurses in levels of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, personality traits, coping strategies and professional stressors experienced. Methods: This historical prospective study enrolled 1305 nurses from the University Hospital of Split, Croatia. A total of 380 subjects participated in the study, 163 non-CoV and 217 CoV subjects. Nurses' pandemic-related experience questionnaires, Big Five Inventory (BFI), Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5), Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations (CISS) and Occupational Stress Questionnaire, were used for evaluation. Results: Non-CoV nurses felt more fear of infection, were more socially distanced, had more PTSD symptoms and neuroticism and felt more stress due to public criticism and job requirements compared to CoV nurses; p < 0.001. The groups of SA users and non-SA users could be distinguished based on predictor variables in CoV and non-CoV nurses, with a correct classification of 84.8% vs. 79.1%. Conclusions: It was possible to predict the probability of using SA among nurses due to pandemic professional experience, personality traits and coping strategies.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has quickly spread around the world, and since currently no treatments that are safe and effective for large groups of people nor a vaccine are available, the best way to prevent the illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus causing it. The purpose of this study was to examine the predictive effects of both demographic and psychosocial factors originating with the Health Belief Model on reported intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive behaviors (e.g., social distancing, hand washing, and not attending large gatherings). Method A Qualtrics survey of 500 U.S. adults was conducted to explore the relationships of demographics and psychosocial factors with the intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive measures. Results Gender was a predictor of taking preventive action, with women more likely to take action. Health Belief Model constructs predicted uptake of most COVID-19 preventive actions, but the constructs often appeared to work independent of the model. Race/ethnicity was an infrequent predictor, but when it did, minorities were less likely to report intent to adhere to COVID-19 preventive behaviors. Conclusion/Implications While not a perfect model for this pandemic, the Health Belief Model and its constructs should continue to be considered for use by public health communicators focusing on preventive measure campaign design in both the COVID-19 pandemic era and beyond.

AB  - Background: Individuals with drug convictions are at heightened risk of poor health, due in part to punitive public policies. This study tests the effects of message frames on: (1) public stigma towards individuals with felony drug convictions and (2) support for four policies in the United States (U.S.) affecting social determinants of health: mandatory minimum sentencing laws, 'ban-the-box' employment laws, and restrictions to supplemental nutrition and public housing programs.
   Methods: A randomized experiment (n = 3,758) was conducted in April 2018 using a nationally representative online survey panel in the U.S. Participants were randomized to a no-exposure arm or one of nine exposure arms combining: (1) a description of the consequences of incarceration and community reentry framed in one of three ways: a public safety issue, a social justice issue or having an impact on the children of incarcerated individuals, (2) a narrative description of an individual released from prison, and (3) a picture depicting the race of the narrative subject. Logistic regression was used to assess effects of the frames.
   Results: Social justice and the impact on children framing lowered social distance measures and increased support for ban-the-box laws.
   Conclusion: These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma and advocacy efforts to support the elimination of punitive polices towards individuals with drug convictions.

AB  - Research attention on smokeless tobacco (SLT) has focused on SLT use, health risks, harm-reduction potential, and risk perceptions, but few studies have examined mediated communications about SLT. This study aims to contribute to the literature by providing the first description of SLT coverage in the news, an important communication channel given its ability to educate and shape public opinion about tobacco issues.
   A content analysis was conducted on SLT-related news and opinion articles between 2006 and 2010 from top circulating national and state newspapers and select news wires. Articles were coded for the main SLT topic, SLT risk references, and slant of opinion articles.
   SLT was discussed in news/feature articles (n 677) in terms of business (28%), new products, product regulation and harm reduction (19%), prevention/cessation (11.4%), taxation (10.2%), profiles/trends in use (9%), bans (8.1%), and tobacco industry promotional activities (4.9%). Health risk references (i.e., addictiveness, carcinogenicity, and specific health effects including oral cancer) were found in 40% of articles, though frequency differed by article topic. Although the majority of opinion articles (n 176) conveyed an anti-SLT slant (64%), 25.6% were pro-SLT.
   SLT topics of both national and local importance are covered in the news. Public health professionals can participate in SLT coverage by sending in press releases about new study findings, events, or resources and by submitting opinion pieces to share views or respond to previous coverage. Research on SLT news should continue given its potential to shape the publics SLT knowledge and opinions.

AB  - Background: Hong Kong (HK) is a densely populated city near the epicentre of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. Stringent border control together with aggressive case finding, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine measures were implemented to halt the importation and spread of the virus.
   Methods: We performed an epidemiological study using government information covering the first 100 confirmed cases to examine the epidemic curve, incidence, clusters, reproduction number (R-t), incubation period and time to containment.
   Results: A total of 93 of the 100 cases were HK residents (6 infected in Mainland China, 10 on the Diamond Princess Cruise). Seven were visitors infected in Mainland China before entering HK. The majority (76%) were aged >= 45 years, and the incidence increased with age (P< 0.001). Escalation of border control measures correlated with a decrease in the proportion (62.5% to 0%) of cases imported from Mainland China, and a reduction in R-t (1.07 to 0.75). The median incubation period was 4.2 days [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.0-4.5; 5th and 95th percentiles: 1.3 and 14.0). Most clusters with identifiable epidemiological links were households involving 2-4 people. Three medium-spreading events were identified: two from New Year gatherings (6-11 people), and another from environmental contamination of a worship hall (12 people). Despite intensified contact tracing, containment was delayed in 78.9% of cases (mean =5.96 days, range = 0-24 days). An unusual transmission in a multi-storey building via faulty toilet plumbing was suspected with >100 residents evacuated overnight. Our analysis indicated that faulty plumbing was unlikely to be the source of this transmission.
   Conclusion: Timely stringent containment policies minimized the importation and transmission of COVID-19 in HK.

AB  - Media portrayals of older people, such as those in newspapers, both inform and reflect public attitudes. By becoming aware of culturally influenced attitudes about older people, and how these attitudes are reflected in the ways older people are viewed, treated, and cared for in society, the healthcare profession can better understand how to provide high-quality care. By applying an ethnographic approach in textual reality, this paper explores how newspaper articles focusing on health portray older people in society, using Finland as an example. The data consist of articles selected from three of the main Finnish daily newspapers during a 3-month period in the spring of 2012. The findings show that, overall, the society regards older people and their care as important. However, there were suggestions of paternalistic attitudes towards older people. Furthermore, the perceptions regarding different groups of older people could lead to the possibility of inequality. The media portrayals of older people worldwide seem to share similarities, although the findings of this study are particularly in accordance with the cultural attributes of the Nordic countries and societies.

AB  - BackgroundThere is a lack of research investigating the confluence of risk factors in urban slums that may make them accelerators for respiratory, droplet infections like COVID-19. Our working hypothesis was that, even within slums, an inverse relationship existed between living density and access to shared or private WASH facilities.MethodsIn an exploratory, secondary analysis of World Bank, cross-sectional microdata from slums in Bangladesh we investigated the relationship between intra-household population density (crowding) and access to private or shared water sources and toilet facilities.ResultsThe analysis showed that most households were single-room dwellings (80.4%). Median crowding ranged from 0.55m(2) per person up to 67.7m(2) per person. The majority of the dwellings (83.3%), shared both toilet facilities and the source of water, and there was a significant positive relationship between crowding and the use of shared facilities.ConclusionThe findings highlight the practical constraints on implementing, in slums, the conventional COVID19 management approaches of social distancing, regular hand washing, and not sharing spaces. It has implications for the management of future respiratory epidemics.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on socio-economic fronts, public health related aspects and human interactions is undeniable. Amidst the social distancing protocols and the stay-at-home regulations imposed in several countries, citizens took to social media to cope with the emotional turmoil of the pandemic and respond to government issued regulations. In order to uncover the collective emotional response of Moroccan citizens to this pandemic and its effects, we use topic modeling to identify the most dominant COVID-19 related topics of interest amongst Moroccan social media users and sentiment/emotion analysis to gain insights into their reactions to various impactful events. The collected data consists of COVID-19 related comments posted on Twitter, Facebook and Youtube and on the websites of two popular online news outlets in Morocco (Hespress and Hibapress) throughout the year 2020. The comments are expressed in Moroccan Dialect (MD) or Modern Standard Arabic (MSA). To perform topic modeling and sentiment classification, we built a first Universal Language Model for the Moroccan Dialect (MD-ULM) using available corpora, which we have fine-tuned using our COVID-19 dataset. We show that our method significantly outperforms classical machine learning classification methods in Topic Modeling, Emotion Recognition and Polar Sentiment Analysis. To provide real-time infoveillance of these sentiments, we developed an online platform to automate the execution of the different processes, and in particular regular data collection. This platform is meant to be a decision-making assistance tool for COVID-19 mitigation and management in Morocco.

TI  - Is it Safe to Be Transplanted From Living Donors Who Recovered From COVID-19? Experience of 31 Kidney Transplants in a Multicenter Cohort Study From India
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION
LA  - English
AB  - Background. There is lack of data on feasibility and safety of kidney transplants from living donors who recovered from COVID-19. Methods. Here, we present a retrospective cohort study of 31 kidney transplant recipients (KTR) from living donors who recovered from polymerase chain reaction confirmed COVID-19 across 19 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020, to December 5, 2020. We detailed demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, treatment, and outcomes. Donors with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative polymerase chain reaction tests with complete symptom resolution for at least 28 days and significant social distancing for 14 days before surgery. Results. COVID-19 clinical severity in donors ranged from completely asymptomatic (71%, n = 22) to mild infection (29%, n = 9). None progressed to moderate or severe stages of the disease in the entire clinical course of home treatment. Patient and graft survival was 100%, respectively, with acute cellular rejection being reported in 6.4% (n=2) recipient. All recipients and donors were asymptomatic with normal creatinine at median follow-up of 44 days after surgery without any complications relating to surgery and COVID-19. Conclusions. Our data support safety of proceeding with living donation for asymptomatic individuals with comprehensive donor, recipients screening before surgery, using a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory criteria. It could provide new insights into the management of KTR from living donors who have recovered from COVID-19 in India. To the best of our knowledge, this remains the largest cohort of KTR from living donors who recovered from COVID-19.

AB  - The BBC's The British Empire (1972) and Channel Four's Empire (2003) generated significant negative comment during and after their respective broadcasts. Their topic, the British Empire, was an important reason for this, but other factors, including their approach to production and marketing, public and critical expectations, and contemporary politics, were also significant. Despite these similarities, an examination of the critical reactions to each series reveals how public attitudes changed in the 30 years between their broadcasts, to British imperialism, public service television and public discourse.

AB  - Inspired by similar methods shown to be effective in reducing online racist harassment, we designed two tweets aimed at reducing online gender harassment. Our interventions were based on the principles of social re-norming and appealing to harassers' empathy. In a sample of 666 Twitter users engaging in sexist or misogynist tweeting, we found that our intervention tweets did not reduce the number of sexist slurs or sexist users, either 7 days or 31 days after being sent. Our attempts also affected neither the valence nor the arousal of subsequent tweets posted by our sample of Twitter users. We discuss the conceptual, methodological, and ethical challenges associated with activist research aimed at reducing online gender harassment and discuss some of the implications of our attempts to do so.

TI  - Human resources for nephrology in South Africa: A mixed-methods study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE
KW  - RISK
AB  - Introduction
   The global nephrology workforce is shrinking and, in many countries, is unable to meet healthcare needs. Accurate data pertaining to human resources in nephrology in South Africa is lacking. This data is critical for the planning and delivery of renal services and the training of nephrologists in South Africa to meet the challenge of the growing burden of chronic kidney disease.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study of adult and paediatric nephrologists currently delivering nephrology services in South Africa was conducted. Participants were identified using various data sources, including the register of the Health Professions Council of South Africa. This cohort of doctors was described in terms of their demographics and distribution. A survey was then conducted among these nephrologists to collect additional information on their training, scope of practice, job satisfaction, challenges and future plans. Finally, two focus group interviews were conducted to probe themes identified from the survey data.
   Results
   A total of 120 adult nephrologists and 22 paediatric nephrologists were identified (an overall density of 2.5 per million population). There is a male predominance (66%) and the median age is 45 years. The bulk of the workforce (128 nephrologists, 92%) is distributed in three of the nine South African provinces, and two provinces have no nephrologist at all. The survey was completed by 57% of the nephrologists. Most reported positive attitudes to their chosen profession; however, 35 nephrologists (43%) reported an excessive workload, 9 (11%) were planning emigration and 15 (19%) were planning early retirement. A higher frequency of dissatisfaction regarding remuneration (39% vs. 15%) and unsatisfactory work conditions (35% vs. 13%) was observed amongst nephrologists working in the public sector compared to the private sector. A total of 13 nephrologists participated in the focus group interviews. The themes which were identified included that of a rewarding profession, an overall shortage of nephrologists, poor career planning, a need for changes to nephrologists' training, excessive workloads with inadequate remuneration, and challenging work environments.
   Conclusion
   There are insufficient numbers of nephrologists in South Africa, with a markedly uneven distribution amongst the provinces and healthcare sectors. Qualitative data indicate that South African nephrologists are faced with the challenges of a high workload, obstructive policies and unsatisfactory remuneration. In the public sector, a chronic lack of nephrologist posts and other resources are additional challenges. A substantial proportion of the workforce is contemplating emigration.

AB  - BackgroundMajority of causes of maternal and newborn mortalities are preventable. However, poor access to and low utilization of health services remain major barriers to optimum health of the mothers and newborns. The objectives of this study were to assess maternal and newborn health services utilization and factors affecting mothers' health service utilization.MethodsA community based cross-sectional survey was carried out on randomly selected mothers who gave birth within a year preceding the survey. The survey was supplemented with key informant interviews of experts/health professionals. Multivariable logistic model was used to identify factors associated with service utilization. Adjusted odds ratios (AORs) were used to assess the strength of the associations at p-value 0.05. The qualitative data were summarized thematically.ResultsA total of 789 (99.1% response rate) mothers participated in the study. The proportion of the mothers who got at least one antennal care (ANC) visit, institutional delivery and postnatal care (PNC) were 93.3, 77.4 and 92.0%, respectively. Three-forth (74.2%) of the mothers started ANC lately and only 47.5% of them completed ANC(4)+ visits. Medium (4-6) family size (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.9), decision on ANC visits with husband (AOR: 30.9; 95% CI: 8.3, 115.4) or husband only (AOR: 15.3; 95%CI: 3.8, 62.3) and listening to radio (AOR: 2.5; 95%CI: 1.1, 5.6) were associated with ANC attendance.Mothers whose husbands read/write (AOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.1, 2.), attended formal education (AOR: 2.8; 95% CI: 1.1, 6.8), have positive attitudes (AOR: 10.2; 95% CI: 25.9), living in small (AOR: 3.0; 95% CI: 1.2, 7.6) and medium size family (AOR: 2.3; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.1) were more likely to give birth in-health facilities. The proportion of PNC checkups among mothers who delivered in health facilities and at home were 92.0 and 32.5%, respectively. The key informants mentioned that home delivery, delayed arrival of the mothers, unsafe delivery settings, shortage of skilled personnel and supplies were major obstacles to maternal health services utilization.ConclusionsHealth information communication targeting husbands may improve maternal and newborn health services utilization. In service training of personnel and equipping health facilities with essential supplies can improve the provider side barriers.

AB  - Japanese workers suffer high rates of mental health symptoms, recognised recently by the Japanese government, which has enacted workplace well-being initiatives. One reason for poor mental health concerns negative attitudes about mental health problems such as shame, which may be mediated by self-reassurance and self-criticism. This study aimed to evaluate shame-based attitudes toward mental health problems and explore the relationship between mental health attitudes, self-criticism, self-reassurance, and mental health symptoms. Japanese workers (n = 131) completed three measures: attitudes toward mental health problems, mental health symptoms, and self-criticism/reassurance. A high proportion of workers reported negative attitudes about mental health problems. There were strong relationships between mental health attitudes, mental health symptoms, self-criticism, and self-reassurance. Path analyses revealed that the total and indirect effects (through self-criticism and self-reassurance) of mental health attitudes on mental health were larger than the direct effect alone. Hated-self and family reflected shame were identified as predictors for mental health symptoms. The findings suggest the importance of self-criticism and self-reassurance in mental health and mental health attitudes. Implications for help-seeking behaviours also are discussed. Interventions aimed at reducing self-criticism and enhancing self-reassurance are recommended to improve mental health attitudes and increase help-seeking in Japanese workers.

TI  - "Our migrant" and "the other migrant": migration discourse in the Albanian media, 2015-2018
T2  - HUMANITIES & SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS
LA  - English

KW  - REPRESENTATION
KW  - CRISIS
AB  - The expansion of research on migration over recent decades has neglected sending and transit countries. Whether in terms of their internal development, their diaspora policy, their shift from primarily sending countries to (potential) transit or destination countries, or the issue of return migration and reintegration into home societies - all these topics deserve further exploration. This paper seeks to redress this by examining Albania, a sending country with almost a third of its population living externally, and which is recently shifting to a transit and potential destination country. Media discourse on migration was analysed, recalling its power to reflect as well as shape public opinion. Employing a quantitative approach, media discourse on migrants from 2015 to 2018 was examined. Some 55 web-based media were identified, along with twenty TV channels, 61 TV programs, and 317 articles. A qualitative analysis was then used to detect the tone of the discourse and gain a deeper understanding of the messages conveyed. Results showed that migration from the perspective of a sending country has dominated Albanian media discourse over the monitoring period. Major identified issues include: migration and demographic challenges, migration and multiculturalism in societies receiving Albanian migrants, and asylum seeking as a recent trend in Albanian emigration often standing in the way of potential Albanian EU membership. The regional migration "crisis" and the potential of Albania becoming a transit or destination country for refugees has only gained limited attention. The binary of "our migrant" versus "the other migrant" became a key distinction.

AB  - Prior research indicates that criminal thought content and criminal thought process mediate the peer influence effect (peer delinquency -> participant delinquency). This study sought to model the temporal order of these two categories of antisocial cognition in mediating peer influence. Responses provided by 1,795 (847 male, 948 female) members of the Gang Resistance Education and Training study (mean age = 12.11 years) on measures of criminal thought content (negative attitude toward the police) and criminal thought process (proactive criminal thinking in the form of neutralizing techniques) were analyzed. Only the "content before process" model achieved significance, however. Thus, while peer associations may stimulate criminal thought content and criminal thought process, the effect on criminal thought content may be more proximal and the effect on criminal thought process may be mediated by criminal thought content.

AB  - Vaccine hesitancy (uncertainty or unwillingness to receive vaccinations) is a major barrier to manage the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term. This study aimed to explore the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among the public in Kuwait, to understand their attitudes towards vaccines in general, and to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 4147 adults aged >= 18 years. The snowball sampling strategy was used for data collection through social media and e-mails. A total of 3061 (73.8%) respondents indicated that they were vaccinated or intending to be vaccinated against the COVID-19 infection, while 1086 (26.2%) expressed their vaccine hesitancy. The most common reasons for vaccine hesitancy were the concerns about the vaccine's possible side effects, its rushed development, and its efficacy in preventing the infection. Over half (57.2%) of respondents expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitude towards vaccines in general. On the multivariable logistic regression analysis, the findings revealed that vaccine hesitancy was significantly more prevalent among respondents aged 30-64 years; females; married or divorced; residents of Hawalli, Al-Farwaniyah, Al-Jahra, and Mubarak Al-Kabeer; had intermediate monthly average income; non-smokers; not feeling worried about catching the infection; do not know whether any of their family members have been infected or died because of COVID-19 infection; do not have a large extent of confidence in the Kuwait health system's ability to handle the pandemic; did not receive influenza vaccine during the last year; refused or elected to forego a doctor-recommended vaccine; did not receive adequate information from the public health authorities/healthcare providers about the COVID-19 vaccines; none of their first-degree family members received or were intending to receive the vaccine; and expressed intermediate to high levels of negative attitudes towards vaccines in general. The present findings provide a steer as to the groups that most need to be reached to increase the rates of vaccine uptake.

AB  - Background Understanding public attitudes towards death and dying is important to inform public policies around End of Life Care (EoLC). We studied the public attitudes towards death and dying in Wales. Methods An online survey was conducted in 2018. Social media and the HealthWiseWales platform were used to recruit participants. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results 2,210 people participated. Loss of independence (84%), manner of death, and leaving their beloved behind were the biggest fears around death and dying. In terms of EoLC, participants sought timely access to care (84%) and being surrounded by loved ones (62%). Being at home was less of a priority (24%). Only 50% were familiar with Advance Care Planning (ACP). A lack of standard procedures as well as of support for the execution of plans and the ability to revisit those plans hindered uptake. The taboo around death conversations, the lack of opportunities and skills to initiate discussion, and personal fear and discomfort inhibited talking about death and dying. 72% felt that we do not talk enough about death and dying and advocated normalising talking by demystifying death with a positive approach. Health professionals could initiate and support this conversation, but this depended on communication skills and manageable workload pressure. Participants encouraged a public health approach and endorsed the use of: a) social media and other public platforms, b) formal education, c) formal and legal actions, and d) signposting and access to information. Conclusions People are ready to talk about death and dying and COVID-19 has increased awareness. A combination of top-down and bottom-up initiatives across levels and settings can increase awareness, knowledge, and service-utilisation-drivers to support health professionals and people towards shared decisions which align with people's end of life wishes and preferences.

AB  - Purpose Hong Kong has experienced four waves of COVID-19 since the first case was confirmed in January 2020. Several studies have highlighted the psychological impacts of the outbreak in Hong Kong but have largely ignored the protective factors that contribute to resilience among vulnerable families. This study adopted an ecological resilience framework to explore the impact of this epidemic on members of families with youth with a delinquent tendency/mental health concerns and the ecological protective factors for these vulnerable families. Methods Random sampling based on a sampling frame provided by one of the largest local social service organizations in Hong Kong led to the recruitment of 407 respondents who were interviewed using a battery of standardized questionnaires. Results The results showed that 30.6% and 11.5% of respondents reported a moderate and a severe level of psychological distress, respectively, almost double the percentages reported in a previous study conducted in Hong Kong before the COVID-19 outbreak. Around 36.6% of respondents indicated they had encountered financial problems and almost 40% indicated aggravated financial circumstances since the outbreak. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that financial stress was the strongest predictor of psychological distress. Structural equation modeling indicated that family support, indoor leisure activities and community resources significantly mediated the negative influence of COVID-19-related stressors on psychological distress of family members. Conclusion Family leisure activities, family support, community spirit and mutual help within the context of social-distancing restrictions may need to be promoted to benefit vulnerable families in Hong Kong under the COVID-19 epidemic.

AB  - We hypothesized that an adaptive form of emotion regulation-cognitive reappraisal-would decrease negative emotion and increase support for conflict-resolution policies. In Study 1, Israeli participants were invited to a laboratory session in which they were randomly assigned to either a cognitive-reappraisal condition or a control condition; they were then presented with anger-inducing information related to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Participants in the reappraisal condition were more supportive of conciliatory policies and less supportive of aggressive policies compared with participants in the control condition. In Study 2, we replicated these findings in responses to a real political event (the recent Palestinian bid for United Nations recognition). When assessed 1 week after training, participants trained in cognitive reappraisal showed greater support for conciliatory policies and less support for aggressive policies toward Palestinians compared with participants in a control condition. These effects persisted when participants were reassessed 5 months after training, and at both time points, negative emotion mediated the effects of reappraisal.

AB  - Background: Sexualized drug use (SDU; the use of any psychoactive substance before or during sexual intercourse) is prevalent among men who have sex with men (MSM) and may aggravate the worsening HIV epidemic in this key population.
   Objective: This observational prospective cohort study investigated factors predicting the occurrence of SDU within a 6-month follow-up period among a sample of MSM in Hong Kong. We hypothesized that perceptions related to SDU would mediate the association between the influence of social media/gay social networking apps and SDU during the follow-up period.
   Methods: Participants were Chinese-speaking men in Hong Kong, China who had anal intercourse with at least one man in the past year. Among 600 participants who completed the baseline telephone survey, 407 (67.8%) completed another telephone survey 6 months later. Logistic regression models and path analysis were fitted.
   Results: At Month 6, 6.9% (28/407) and 4.4% (18/407) of participants reported SDU and chemsex during the follow-up period. After adjustment for significant baseline background variables (use of pre-exposure prophylaxis; history of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections; anal intercourse with nonregular male sex partners, condomless anal intercourse with men, multiple male sex partnerships, and SDU at baseline), three constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) were significantly associated with SDU during the follow-up period: (1) positive attitudes toward SDU (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.19, 95% CI 1.05-1.36), (2) perceived support for SDU from significant others (AOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.01-1.30), and (3) perceived behavioral control of refraining from SDU (AOR 0.76, 95% CI 0.59-0.98). Exposure to information supporting SDU on social media and gay social networking apps was also significantly associated with SDU (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01-1.22). Bootstrapping analyses indicated that social media influence was indirectly associated with SDU through TPB-related perceptions of SDU (beta =.04; B=.002, 95% CI 0.001-0.01).
   Conclusions: Social media and gay social networking apps may be a major source of influence on MSM's perceptions and actual behaviors related to SDU.

TI  - Exploring the optimized social advertising strategy that can generate consumer engagement with green messages on social media
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING
LA  - English
KW  - Online consumer behavior
KW  - Social media advertising
AB  - Purpose
   Given that many consumers are skeptical about environmentally based advertising campaigns, the purpose of this study is to propose an optimized message strategy to facilitate consumer engagement with green messages in social media contexts.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Four empirical studies are conducted using self-report questionnaires to test proposed hypotheses with a focus on the interplay between claim specificity and benefit appeals in green advertising on social media.
   Findings
   The current study examines the interaction effects of claim specificity and benefit appeals on consumer engagement in social media. Specifically, the results reveal that when the message claim is abstract, using other-benefit appeals produces more positive consumer engagement than using self-benefit appeals. Moreover, the results illustrate that self-enhancement motivates consumers to engage with green product advertising messages when the advertising appeal is abstract and the advertising message is associated with benefits for others. Finally, it is found that consumers' self-construal level moderates the interaction effect of claim specificity and benefit appeals type on consumer engagement on social media.
   Practical implications
   This paper has practical implications to both social media managers and advertisers in the green product industry: a match with advertising claim specificity and construal level (i.e. social distance: self-benefit vs other-benefit) should be ensured to increase consumer engagement on social media. In addition, self-enhancement and self-construal should be considered for a better message strategy in social media contexts.
   Originality/value
   The findings make important contributions to the literature in that we extend the applications of construal level theory to social media contexts as a valid theoretical tool to identify optimized green message strategies. As such, it provides future researchers and practitioners in the domain of green campaigns with useful guidelines to boost more consumption of green products.

AB  - Rumors and conspiracy theories thrive in environments of low confidence and low trust. Consequently, it is not surprising that ones related to the COVID-19 pandemic are proliferating given the lack of scientific consensus on the virus's spread and containment, or on the long-term social and economic ramifications of the pandemic. Among the stories currently circulating in US-focused social media forums are ones suggesting that the 5G telecommunication network activates the virus, that the pandemic is a hoax perpetrated by a global cabal, that the virus is a bio-weapon released deliberately by the Chinese, or that Bill Gates is using it as cover to launch a broad vaccination program to facilitate a global surveillance regime. While some may be quick to dismiss these stories as having little impact on real-world behavior, recent events including the destruction of cell phone towers, racially fueled attacks against Asian Americans, demonstrations espousing resistance to public health orders, and wide-scale defiance of scientifically sound public mandates such as those to wear masks and practice social distancing, countermand such conclusions. Inspired by narrative theory, we crawl social media sites and news reports and, through the application of automated machine-learning methods, discover the underlying narrative frameworks supporting the generation of rumors and conspiracy theories. We show how the various narrative frameworks fueling these stories rely on the alignment of otherwise disparate domains of knowledge, and consider how they attach to the broader reporting on the pandemic. These alignments and attachments, which can be monitored in near real time, may be useful for identifying areas in the news that are particularly vulnerable to reinterpretation by conspiracy theorists. Understanding the dynamics of storytelling on social media and the narrative frameworks that provide the generative basis for these stories may also be helpful for devising methods to disrupt their spread.

AB  - By 29 May 2020, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by SARS-CoV-2 had spread to 188 countries, infecting more than 5.9 million people, and causing 361,249 deaths. Governments issued travel restrictions, gatherings of institutions were cancelled, and citizens were ordered to socially distance themselves in an effort to limit the spread of the virus. Fear of being infected by the virus and panic over job losses and missed education opportunities have increased people's stress levels. Psychological studies using traditional surveys are time-consuming and contain cognitive and sampling biases, and therefore cannot be used to build large datasets for a real-time depression analysis. In this article, we propose a CorExQ9 algorithm that integrates a Correlation Explanation (CorEx) learning algorithm and clinical Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) lexicon to detect COVID-19 related stress symptoms at a spatiotemporal scale in the United States. The proposed algorithm overcomes the common limitations of traditional topic detection models and minimizes the ambiguity that is caused by human interventions in social media data mining. The results show a strong correlation between stress symptoms and the number of increased COVID-19 cases for major U.S. cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, New York, and Miami. The results also show that people's risk perception is sensitive to the release of COVID-19 related public news and media messages. Between January and March, fear of infection and unpredictability of the virus caused widespread panic and people began stockpiling supplies, but later in April, concerns shifted as financial worries in western and eastern coastal areas of the U.S. left people uncertain of the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives.

AB  - Objectives Interventional radiology (IR) is a growing field but is underrepresented in most medical school curricula. We tested whether endovascular simulator training improves medical students' attitudes towards IR. Materials and methods We conducted this prospective study at two university medical centers; overall, 305 fourth-year medical students completed a 90-min IR course. The class consisted of theoretical and practical parts involving endovascular simulators. Students completed questionnaires before the course, after the theoretical and after the practical part. On a 7-point Likert scale, they rated their interest in IR, knowledge of IR, attractiveness of IR, and the likelihood to choose IR as subspecialty. We used a crossover design to prevent position-effect bias. Results The seminar/simulator parts led to the improvement for all items compared with baseline: interest in IR (pre-course 5.2 vs. post-seminar/post-simulator 5.5/5.7), knowledge of IR (pre-course 2.7 vs. post-seminar/post-simulator 5.1/5.4), attractiveness of IR (pre-course 4.6 vs. post-seminar/post-simulator 4.8/5.0), and the likelihood of choosing IR as a subspecialty (pre-course 3.3 vs. post-seminar/post-simulator 3.8/4.1). Effect was significantly stronger for simulator training compared with that for seminar for all items (p < 0.05). For simulator training, subgroup analysis of students with pre-existing positive attitude showed considerable improvement regarding "interest in IR" (x 1.4), "knowledge of IR" (x 23), "attractiveness of IR" (x 2), and "likelihood to choose IR" (x 3.2) compared with pretest. Conclusion Endovascular simulator training significantly improves students' attitude towards IR regarding all items. Implementing such courses at a very early stage in the curriculum should be the first step to expose medical students to IR and push for IR.

AB  - Purpose: This study aimed to assess the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19-related aspects on self-reported sleep quality, considering the moderator role of some psychological variables.
   Methods: During the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, 2286 respondents (1706 females and 580 males; age range: 18-74 years) completed an online survey that collected socio-demographic information and data related to the experience with the COVID-19 pandemic. Some questionnaires assessed sleep quality, psychological well-being, general psychopathology, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders symptoms, and anxiety. The path analysis was adopted.
   Results: The study confirms a direct effect of some aspects ascribable to the pandemic, with a mediator role of the psychological variables. Lower sleep quality was directly related to the days spent at home in confinement and the knowledge of people affected by the COVID-19. All the other aspects related to the COVID-19 pandemic influenced sleep quality through the mediator effect of psychological variables.
   Conclusion: This study highlighted that the psychological condition of the population has been influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the government actions taken to contain it, but it has also played an important role in mediating the quality of sleep, creating a vicious circle on people's health. The results suggest that a health emergency must be accompanied by adequate social support programs to mitigate the fear of infection and promote adequate resilience to accept confinement and social distancing. Such measures would moderate psychological distress and improve sleep quality.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has changed working conditions for emergency surgical teams around the world. International surgical societies have issued clinical recommendations to optimize surgical management. This international study aimed to assess the degree of emergency surgical teams' adoption of recommendations during the pandemic. Methods Emergency surgical team members from over 30 countries were invited to answer an anonymous, prospective, online survey to assess team organization, PPE-related aspects, OR preparations, anesthesiologic considerations, and surgical management for emergency surgery during the pandemic. Results One-hundred-and-thirty-four questionnaires were returned (N = 134) from 26 countries, of which 88% were surgeons, 7% surgical trainees, 4% anesthetists. 81% of the respondents got involved with COVID-19 crisis management. Social media were used by 91% of the respondents to access the recommendations, and 66% used videoconference tools for team communication. 51% had not received PPE training before the pandemic, 73% reported equipment shortage, and 55% informed about re-use of N95/FPP2/3 respirators. Dedicated COVID operating areas were cited by 77% of the respondents, 44% had performed emergency surgical procedures on COVID-19 patients, and over half (52%), favored performing laparoscopic over open surgical procedures. Conclusion Surgical team members have responded with leadership to the COVID-19 pandemic, with crisis management principles. Social media and videoconference have been used by the vast majority to access guidelines or to communicate during social distancing. The level of adoption of current recommendations is high for organizational aspects and surgical management, but not so for PPE training and availability, and anesthesiologic considerations.

AB  - This paper discusses the role of design and material practices on the weaponization of quietness through the deployment of sound bombs by the Military Police of Sao Paulo, Brazil. Probing the contradiction of using a device that produces loudness to enforce silence laws, I offer an account of how designed artifacts and techniques can be instrumentalized by the State for the policing of racialized bodies and their sonic and musical practices. These artifacts and techniques create and reproduce mechanisms that produce both physical and social distance between bodies perceived to be "loud" and their silence-enforcing counterpart (i.e. the police). This extends the reach and scope of the segregation of (auditory) space with techniques besides architecture and urban planning alone. I begin with an analysis of a few, violent strategies employed by the Military Police to enforce silence laws in lower-class neighborhoods in the city, as depicted in a filmed raid edited and posted on their own social media channels. I then read these practices through the history of the so-called "stun grenade," or sound bomb, and its use in both military and civilian contexts. Lastly, I examine a semi-fictional proposition found in Adirley Queiros' 2015 film Branco Sai, Preto Fica (White Out, Black In) for disrupting the enforcement of silence, which in turn proposes a decolonizing shift in the perception of loudness and noise vis-a-vis racialized bodies.

AB  - IMPORTANCE The COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affected mental health in socioeconomically disadvantaged children in the US. However, little is known about the relationship of preexisting and time-varying social determinants of health (SDoH) at individual and structural levels, vaccination eligibility/rates, and the racial and ethnic differences to trajectories of child mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   OBJECTIVE To estimate the association of trajectories of child mental health to multilevel SDoH and vaccination eligibility/rates.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective longitudinal cohort study, conducted from May 16, 2020, to March 2, 2021, integrated structural-level, pandemic-related data with the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) cohort data (release 4.0). The ABCD study recruited 11878 children (baseline) and conducted 6 COVID-19 rapid response surveys across 21 US sites (in 17 states) from May 16, 2020, to March 2, 2021.
   EXPOSURES Preexisting individual (eg, household income) and structural (area deprivation) SDoH and time-varying individual (eg, food insecurity, unemployment) and structural (eg, social distancing, vaccination eligibility/rates) SDoH.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Perceived Stress Scale, the National Institutes of Health-Toolbox emotion measures, and COVID-19-related worry.
   RESULTS The longitudinal sample included 8493 children (mean [SD] age, 9.93 [0.63] years; 5011girls [47.89%]; 245 Asian [2.34%), 1213 Black [11.59%], 2029 Hispanic [19.39%1 5851 White [55.93%), and 1124 children of other/multiracial ethnicity [10.74%]). Trajectories of stress, sadness, and COVID-19-related worry decreased after adult vaccination rollout. Compared with younger children, boys, White children, or those living with married parents, those who reported greater perceived stress included older children aged 12 to 15 years (beta = 0.26; 95% CI, 0.12-0.41; P < .001); girls (beta = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.61-0.89; P < .001); Hispanic children (beta = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.01-0.47; P = .04); children living with separated parents (beta = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.03-0.96; P = .04); children experiencing disrupted medical health care access (beta = 0.19; 95% CI, 0.01-0.36; P = .04); children living in economically deprived neighborhoods (beta = 0.28; 95% CI, 0.05-0.51; P = .02); children living in areas with more full-time working-class adults who were unable to social distance (beta = 135; 95% CI, 0.13-2.67; P = .04); and children living in states with fewer fully vaccinated adults (beta = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.16-1.02; P = .007). COVID-19 pandemic-related worry was higher among Asian children (beta = 0.22; 95% CI, 0.08-0.37; P = .003), Black children (beta = 0.33; 95% CI, 0.22-0.43; P < .001), children of other/multiracial ethnicity (beta = 0.17; 95% CI, 0.09-0.25; P < .001), and children with disrupted medical health care (beta = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.09-0.21) and disrupted mental health treatment (beta = 0.11; 95% CI, 0.06-0.16). Inability to afford food was associated with increased sadness (beta = 1.50; 95% CI, 0.06-2.93; P = .04). States with later vaccination eligibility dates for all adults were associated with greater COVID-19-related worry (beta = 0.16; 95% CI, 0.01-0.31; P = .03) and decreased positive affect (beta = -1.78; 95% CI, -3.39 to -0.18; P = .03) among children.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Results of this study suggest a disproportionately adverse association of the COVID-19 pandemic with child mental health among racial and ethnic minority groups, which may be improved by addressing modifiable individual (food insecurity, unemployment, health services, parental supervision) and structural (area deprivation, job protection, vaccination) SDoH.

AB  - The current researches have been shown high prevalence and incidence of children's teeth caries, especially for the first permanent molar, which might do a lot of harm to their general health. Fortunately, early detection and protection can reduce the difficulty of treatment and protect children's oral health. However, traditional diagnostic methods such as dentist's visual inspection and radiographic imaging diagnosis are non-automatic and time-consuming. Given the COVID-19 epidemic, these methods should not be taken into consideration, since they fail to practice social distancing and further increase the risk of infection. To address these issues, in this paper we propose a novel caries detection and assessment (UCDA) framework to achieve a new technique for fully-automated diagnosis of dental caries on the children's first permanent molar. Inspired by an efficient in-network feature pyramid and anchor boxes, the proposed UCDA framework mainly contains a backbone network that is initialized with ResNet-FPN, and two parallel task-specific subnetworks for region regression and region classification. Due to the lack of the image database, we also present a novel children's oral image database, namely "Child-OID", which comprises 1, 368 primary school children's oral images with standard diagnostic annotations and labels, to evaluate the effectiveness of our UCDA method. Experiments on the Child-OID database demonstrate that commonly occurring caries on the first permanent molar can be more accurately detected via the proposed UCDA framework. Database and code are available at https://github.com/GipinLinn/UCDA-and-Child-OID.git.

AB  - Despite decades of research, no scholarly consensus has been achieved regarding the potential impact of video games on youth aggression or other public health concerns. In recent years, hypotheses have been raised that scholarly opinions on video games may resemble past moral panics, with attitudes reflective of generational conflicts. These hypotheses are tested in a sample of 175 criminologists, psychologists, and media scholars, examining both overall negative attitudes about video games and perceived linkages with youth assaults specifically. Results reflected continued lack of scholarly consensus on the issue of video game influences with only 15.3% of scholars endorsing the view that violent video games contribute to youth assaults. As hypothesized, older scholars endorsed more negative views of video games generally, although this appeared to be related to experience with games rather than age per se. Scholars with more negative attitudes toward youth themselves were also more negative about games. Criminologists and media scholars were more skeptical of violent video games contributing to youth assaults than were psychologists. These results are discussed in relation to Moral Panic Theory.

AB  - Background: In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures such as stay-at-home orders were implemented for all non-essential workers. The consequent disruption in the defined daily work routine has impacted both the quality and duration of sleep. Our aim was to evaluate the quality of sleep in the Indian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: The data were collected between April 17, 2020 and May 24, 2020, and participants were invited openly through social media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram). Sleep quality was evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) Questionnaire.
   Results: The study population consisted of 808 participants (mean age 30.85 years, 56.7% female). The mean sleep score of the study population was 6.78 +/- 3.19 on the PSQI, with a majority (57.2%) of respondents showing 'poor' sleep quality (>5 on PSQI). The mean sleep duration of the study population was found to be 6.9 +/- 1.4 h, and sleep latency was 42.64 +/- 51.6 min. The PSQI scores were comparable for age, gender, and work status and were not significant. However, a significant association between self-reported mental health and quality of sleep was found (p<0.05). Participants who reported a deterioration in mental health were more likely to have poor sleep quality than those who reported an improvement in their mental health.
   Conclusions: The results of this study show that poor sleep quality is widely prevalent among the the general population in India during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: How nursing students perceive themselves as potential nurses in the future is defined as their nursing professional identity. Many undergraduate nursing students present positive attitudes regarding the use of social media. However, the influence of social media usage by undergraduate nursing students on the development of their professional identity is yet to be determined.
   Objective: To determine the relationship between social media usage by undergraduate nursing students and the development of their professional identity.
   Design: Descriptive, correlational, cross-sectional study.
   Setting(s): Two universities in western Saudi Arabia.
   Participants: Undergraduate nursing students who used social media.
   Methods: An online questionnaire was designed, and its contents were validated. It was then distributed via a Qualtrics link to students' email addresses and via social media between 4th September 2019 and 28th October 2019. Descriptive analysis including frequencies, percentages, medians, and interquartile ranges were reported. Additionally, a number of non-parametric tests were conducted to investigate the relationships in question.
   Results: In total, 484 questionnaires were included in the analysis. The participants who used social media for educational (p = 0.004), or for professional purposes (p = 0.015) had high scores on the PI scale. The professional identity scores were also positively associated among the participants who followed nurses (p < 0.001), shared their nursing experiences (p < 0.001), and acted as societal educators about the nursing profession (p < 0.001) on social media platforms.
   Conclusions: Engagement with social media positively influenced undergraduate nursing students in the development of their professional identity. However, it is notable that the pedagogy of nursing education has been slow to adopt social media into nursing curricula. Nursing students require guidance in terms of how to use social media for their professional development.

AB  - Research has demonstrated widespread negative attitudes held toward people with mental health problems. Our study investigated whether a new prejudice reduction technique, imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009), could combat stigma against people with mental illness, and the mediating processes through which it may exert this beneficial effect. We found that compared to a control condition, participants who imagined a positive encounter with a schizophrenic person reported weakened stereotypes and formed stronger intentions to engage in future social interactions with schizophrenic people in general. Importantly, these intentions were formed due to reduced feelings of anxiety about future interactions. We discuss the implications of these findings for improving the social inclusion of people with mental health problems.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of gender ideology, religiosity and political conservatism on attitudes toward same-sex parenting in Italy at a time when same-sex parent families are undergoing attacks from ideological campaigns opposing non-traditional gender roles and families. We collected data from 4,187 heterosexual respondents about attitudes towards two-father and two-mother parenting, homonegativity, attitudes toward traditional masculinity and femininity, religious involvement and political conservatism. We conducted multiple group structural equation model analyses to test whether sex moderated any of the estimated associations among variables. Results showed that traditional beliefs about femininity were directly associated with negative attitudes towards two-mother and two-father parenting, while traditional beliefs about masculinity had a significant direct effect only on two-father parenting. Homonegativity partially mediated the association between religiosity, political conservatism and traditional beliefs about masculinity and femininity on negative attitudes toward both types of same-sex parenting. Gender differences were found for the indirect effects of political conservatism and religiosity on attitudes towards same-sex parenting. The theoretical contributions and implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - According to the extended contact hypothesis, direct intergroup contact is not necessary for prejudice reduction; it suffices to know that ingroup friends have outgroup friends. However, extended contact is typically measured in a way that does not clarify whether people know the outgroup friend of their ingroup friend or whether they are even direct friends. A social network approach is used to compare extended contact when ingroup friends' outgroup friends are not direct friends (open triads) to when there is a direct friendship with some (mixed triads) or all of the ingroup friends' outgroup friends (closed triads). Results from a nonprobability sample in the US predicting feelings toward Black people (N = 313) and from a representative sample in the Netherlands predicting attitudes toward immigrants (N = 818) show that extended contact reduces prejudice only when some of the outgroup friends of one's ingroup friends are known. This suggests that the extended contact effect should not be interpreted as providing a solution for situations where direct contact with outgroup members is not possible.

AB  - As more and more students from diverse families populate 21st century classrooms, the need for more culturally sensitive pedagogical approaches intensifies. Although literature suggests that differences of parenting styles between immigrant and native-born American parents will influence children's learning, classroom teaching, and policy making, little is known about whether there is any difference in parental involvement in the video game process and parental perceptions of integrating video games into the regular classroom. In this aspect, an online survey was conducted. Consistent with our hypotheses, although the sampled native parents were more likely to hold an overall negative attitude toward violence in games, they were less worried about the integration of video games in the classroom than immigrant parents were. Results also suggested that the sampled immigrant parents were less involved in the game playing process than their counterpart native-born parents were. Additional correlation analyses revealed that if parents held more negative attitudes toward social effects brought on by the violence in video games, they would most likely use stricter mediation techniques toward their children's video game playing. On the other hand, the more negative the attitude was, the more involved parents were in their children's gameplay. Implications, limitations and future research opportunities were discussed.

AB  - Background Little is currently known about the effects of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on neurointerventional (NI) procedural volumes or its toll on physician wellness. Methods A 37-question online survey was designed and distributed to physician members of three NI physician organizations. Results A total of 151 individual survey responses were obtained. Reduced mechanical thrombectomy procedures compared with pre-pandemic were observed with 32% reporting a greater than 50% reduction in thrombectomy volumes. In concert with most (76%) reporting at least a 25% reduction in non-mechanical thrombectomy urgent NI procedures and a nearly unanimous (96%) cessation of non-urgent elective cases, 68% of physicians reported dramatic reductions (>50%) in overall NI procedural volume compared with pre-pandemic. Increased door-to-puncture times were reported by 79%. COVID-19-positive infections occurred in 1% of physician respondents: an additional 8% quarantined for suspected infection. Sixty-six percent of respondents reported increased career stress, 56% increased personal life/family stress, and 35% increased career burnout. Stress was significantly increased in physicians with COVID-positive family members (P<0.05). Conclusions This is the first study designed to understand the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on NI physician practices, case volumes, compensation, personal/family stresses, and work-related burnout. Future studies examining these factors following the resumption of elective cases and relaxing of social distancing measures will be necessary to better understand these phenomena.

AB  - COVID-19 significantly altered individual patterns of interaction across the globe. The impediment on physical contact and emphasis on social distancing as measures of curbing its spread gave rise to new forms of interactions among individuals. In the ensuing new normal, digital life took the center stage, anchoring engaging and meaningful interactions of individuals in both public and private spheres. This study appraises the adoption of digital life in Nigeria during this period. Hinged on the technological determinism theory, the study examines the sudden digital migration in Nigeria and identifies the factors that facilitated the process, on the one hand, and the obstacles that inhibited it, on the other. Using secondary data derived from books, official websites, and media reports, the study has established that although the Nigerian society adopted digital life as alternative to face-to-face interactions out of expedience, a combination of systemic, structural, socioeconomic, and environmental factors constrained the process with grave implications on the overall (expected) impact to both individual and national developments. The study concludes that effective digitization in Nigeria requires a holistic approach toward addressing germane issues that retard socioeconomic development in the country-such as endemic poverty, structural inequality and class differences, uneven development between urban and rural communities, low computer literacy and information and communications technology (ICTs) access, poor electricity supply, poor global system for mobile communication (GSM) and Internet access, gender factor and vulnerable groups, and digital frauds-in order to create the enabling environment for productive digitization to thrive.

AB  - This is a cross-sectional study investigating the factors affecting brazilians' self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on data from the web-based behavior survey. Carried out from April 24 to May 24, 2020, the survey recruited participants by a chain sampling procedure. Its outcome was the worsening of self-rated health during the pandemic. Statistical analysis was based on a hierarchical model of determination. Logistic regression models were used to test the associations between sociodemographic characteristics, pre-existing health conditions, lifestyle indicators and intensity of social restraint measures, and biological and psychological issues during the pandemic. From the total sample of 45,161 participants, 29.4% reported worsening of health state during this period. After adjusting for hierarchical distal factors, the health problems mostly associated with worsening health state were: bad self-rated health (adjusted OR = 4.35, p < 0.001), health care seeking for mental health problem (adjusted OR = 3.95, p < 0.001), and for COVID-19 (adjusted OR = 3.60, p < 0.001). People who experienced sleep problems, worsening of back pain, depression and at least one flu symptom during the pandemic were twice as likely to report worsening of health status. Sedentary and eating behaviors and adherence to social distancing measures showed significant correlation with the outcome. There exists a relation between social, biological, and psychological factors, mediated by lifestyles and variables pertaining to confinement. Altogether, these factors have negatively affected self-rated health during the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil.

AB  - Objective: To explore the emic perspective of survivors and their family members with regards to their lived experience with COVID-19
   Study Design: Cross sectional qualitative research using phenomenological approach with a constructivist paradigm. Telephonic interviews of patients from Punjab and KP for 2 weeks during May 2020, as approved by the ethical review committee of Fauji Foundation Hospital, Rawalpindi
   Methods: Non-probability maximum variation purposive sampling technique was employed to conduct semi structured interviews with 22 individuals; including those who had tested positive for COVID-19 on PCR test and recovered after minimum 2 weeks of isolation, along with their family members. Braun and Clarke's thematic analysis was done concurrently with data collection and management.
   Results: 5 data-driven themes with 21 subthemes were; "Perceived Susceptibility": symptoms, risk factors, causes/origin, modes of transmission, "Knowledge and Experience with Precautionary Behaviors": use of masks, hygiene practices, social distancing, religiosity, "Treatment seeking behavior: Perceived costs and benefits": experience with test, complementary home remedies, medical treatment, mistrust for quarantine facilities, interaction with health care practitioners, less priority to other diseases, "Psycho-social dimensions of COVID-19": guilt and fear, caregiver burden, family quarantined, renewed spiritual connections, "Barriers to Care": health care workers: dichotomy of praise and stigma, media: dramatic and traumatic, stigma-behavior of others.
   Conclusion: This study revealed the lived experiences of COVID-19 survivors and their family members, detailing their conceptualization with regards to disease vulnerability and associated precautionary behaviors. It mainly showed how survivors and family members navigate through biomedical systems, complementary healing practices, resilience and stigma.

KW  - VALUES
KW  - BREAST
AB  - To mitigate the impacts and spread of COVID-19, drastic mitigative actions are demanded from individuals worldwide, including social distancing, health behaviors, and self-quarantining. A key question is what motivates individuals to take and support such actions. Early in the COVID-19 crisis, we hypothesized and found in two studies (in the Netherlands and United States) that stronger worries about potential consequences of COVID-19 for oneself and close others (i.e., family and friends), as well as more "distant" others (e.g., citizens in general, vulnerable populations), are associated with stronger engagement in actions to mitigate COVID-19. In line with reasoning on norm activation, we found that these associations were partly mediated by personal norms, reflecting individuals' feelings of being morally compelled and personally responsible to take mitigative actions. Importantly, individuals generally reported to worry more about consequences of COVID-19 for distant others than for themselves, and worries about distant others were more strongly related to mitigative actions than worries about oneself and close others. Our outcomes offer key novel insights to the health domain, highlighting the potential relevance of worrying about distant others and personal norms in motivating actions to mitigate global health crises.

AB  - The paper examines the multi-tasked role of women in caregiving and career during the COVID-19 partial lockdown in Ghana. One hundred fifty three mothers with careers within the Accra Metropolis participated in the study through purposive and snow balling sampling methods of non-probability sampling technique. To observe the COVID-19 protocols of social distancing, the research instrument was designed using Google forms and distributed to respondents via social media platforms (emails and WhatsApp). The results revealed that caregiving mothers generally reported to work late from home than if there were in the office and were less effective and productive working from home but were assured of job security because they mostly worked in the public sector. Hours used for domestic activities rose steadily during the lockdown period and social support from non-relatives in caregiving increased. The paper's finding suggests that mothers working from home are faced with difficult and conflicting roles which puts more pressure on women during the pandemic period. Women who are unable to access social support continue to be stressed and burdened in an attempt to combine family, care giving, and career roles which ultimately affect their overall wellbeing.

AB  - The low HDI in Pandalungan is a government-focused development priority, especially in the healthcare sector. The attempts to break the COVID-19 chain must be made to improve the quality of government services in the region. In optimizing the activities, the sub-district leaders play a significant role. There is an appeal to the sub-district leaders to enforce social distance since there is no face-to-face meeting with the appliance assigned. The Camat (a sub-district head) needs to adjust to this situation, so the Camat uses new media to perform his tasks. The COVID-19 pandemic affects several aspects of life, including the style of leadership. Digital leadership has become a model of leadership that is successful during the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study, based on those evaluations, is aimed at assessing the impact of digital leadership on the performance of public services by the subdistrict chief Pandalungan. To meet the goal of the study, a qualitative approach is applied. It can be concluded that transformational leadership is oriented towards the organization's vision and goals, which are outlined in action.

AB  - Emergence of autonomous machines is a hotly debated topic in mass-media. However, previous research has not empirically investigated whether the perceived autonomy of robots affects their social acceptance. In this study we examined the impact of perceived robot autonomy on realistic threats (threats to human jobs, resources and safety) and identity threats (threats to human identity and distinctiveness), attitude toward robots, and support for robotics research. US based participants watched a video of robots performing-Various tasks these robots were presented as either autonomous and capable of disregarding human commands or non-autonomous and only capable of following human commands. Participants who watched videos of supposedly autonomous robots perceived robots in general to be significantly more threatening to humans (both realistic and identity threats) than those who watched a video of non-autonomous robots. Furthermore, exposure to autonomous robots evoked stronger negative attitude towards robots in general and more opposition to robotics research than exposure to non-autonomous robots. Both realistic and identity threats mediated the increase in negative attitudes toward robots and opposition to robotics research, although realistic threats were often the stronger mediator of the two. Our findings have practical implications for research on AI and open new questions on the relationship between robot autonomy and their social impact.

AB  - Cancer in the head and neck region is among the most common cancer around the world, the incidence of which keep increasing in past years. Treatment of disease is usually done by the surgical excision which often leads to some degree of facial disfigurements which cause mutilation in patients. Mutilation imparts the feeling of stigma in patients, and patients usually tend to hide facial disfigurements using additional clothing. As a prevention strategy, awareness regarding the disease conveys to the mass population via media commercials. Media commercials which highlight the adverse outcomes of cancer are found to target the stigmatized perspective of disease. On the brighter side, more stigmatized is the patient image in the commercials, more motivation it will create in masses to avoid risk factors like tobacco, smoking and alcohol. But on the darker side, stigmatized commercials create a social environment in which people tend to maintain social distance to cancer patients, and patients have to bear social disapproval by society for their whole life. It reduces the self-esteem and quality of life of patients which affects their overall survival. In the present article, we review the status of stigma in head and neck cancer patients, tools that are available for assessment of stigma, and effects of the stigmatized media commercials on the patient's self-esteem. The present article represents the accurate picture of the problem and highlights the policies which could be employed to balance the paradox of stigmatized media commercials and a healthy social environment for cancer patients.

The use of protections such as sanitary masks has become increasingly common, restrictions in our daily lives, such as social distancing or confinements, have had serious consequences on the economy and our welfare state. Although the measures imposed throughout the world follow the same pattern, they have been applied with different criteria depending on the country. Over extended periods of time, people tend to change their perception of an event and its magnitude, or in other words, they stop being so concerned despite the seriousness of the matter. In this paper, we introduce a new metric to quantify the degree of emotional concern of people being affected by a topic, and we confirm how populations from different countries follow this trend of downplaying the effect of the pandemic and reach a state of indifference. To do this, we propose a method to analyze the social media stream over time extracting the different emotional states from the Russel Circumplex plane and computing the shifting created by the tragic event-the pandemic. We complete this metric by incorporating searching behavior to reflect not only push contents but also pull inquiries. The resulting metric establishes a relationship between the pandemic and the emotional response by defining the degree of Emotional Concern. Although the method can be applied to any location with a significant and varied amount of geo-localized social media streams, the scope of this paper covers the most representative cities in Europe.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has caused huge economic and societal disruptions. To fight against the coronavirus, it is critical for policymakers to take swift and effective actions. In this article, we take Hong Kong as a case study, aiming to leverage social media data to support policymakers' policy-making activities in different phases. First, in the agenda setting phase, we facilitate policymakers to identify key issues to be addressed during COVID-19. In particular, we design a novel epidemic awareness index to continuously monitor public discussion hotness of COVID-19 based on large-scale data collected from social media platforms. Then we identify the key issues by analyzing the posts and comments of the extensively discussed topics. Second, in the policy evaluation phase, we enable policymakers to conduct real-time evaluation of anti-epidemic policies. Specifically, we develop an accurate Cantonese sentiment classification model to measure the public satisfaction with anti-epidemic policies and propose a keyphrase extraction technique to further extract public opinions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which conducts a large-scale social media analysis of COVID-19 in Hong Kong. The analytical results reveal some interesting findings: (1) there is a very low correlation between the number of confirmed cases and the public discussion hotness of COVID-19. Themajor public concern in the early stage is the shortage of anti-epidemic items. (2) The top-3 anti-epidemic measures with the greatest public satisfaction are daily press conference on COVID-19 updates, border closure, and social distancing rules.

AB  - Background: The use of the internet and web-based platforms to obtain public health information and manage health-related issues has become widespread in this digital age. The practice is so pervasive that the first reaction to obtaining health information is to "Google it." As SARS-CoV-2 broke out in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and quickly spread worldwide, people flocked to the internet to learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease, COVID-19. Lagging responses by governments and public health agencies to prioritize the dissemination of information about the coronavirus outbreak through the internet and the World Wide Web and to build trust gave room for others to quickly populate social media, online blogs, news outlets, and websites with misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in people's deviant behaviors toward public health safety measures.
   Objective: The goals of this study were to determine what people learned about the COVID-19 pandemic through web searches, examine any association between what people learned about COVID-19 and behavior toward public health guidelines, and analyze the impact of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic on people's behavior toward public health measures.
   Methods: This infodemiology study used Google Trends' worldwide search index, covering the first 6 months after the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak (January 1 to June 30, 2020) when the public scrambled for information about the pandemic. Data analysis employed statistical trends, correlation and regression, principal component analysis (PCA), and predictive models.
   Results: The PCA identified two latent variables comprising past coronavirus epidemics (pastCoVepidemics: keywords that address previous epidemics) and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic (presCoVpandemic: keywords that explain the ongoing pandemic). Both principal components were used significantly to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and explained 88.78% of the variability. Three principal components fuelled misinformation about COVID-19: misinformation (keywords "biological weapon," "virus hoax," "common cold," "COVID-19 hoax," and "China virus"), conspiracy theory 1 (ConspTheory1; keyword "5G" or "@5G"), and conspiracy theory 2 (ConspTheory2; keyword "ingest bleach"). These principal components explained 84.85% of the variability. The principal components represent two measurements of public health safety guidelines-public health measures 1 (PubHealthMes1; keywords "social distancing," "wash hands," "isolation," and "quarantine") and public health measures 2 (PubHealthMes2; keyword "wear mask")-which explained 84.7% of the variability. Based on the PCA results and the log-linear and predictive models, ConspTheory1 (keyword "@5G") was identified as a predictor of people's behavior toward public health measures (PubHealthMes2). Although correlations of misinformation (keywords "COVID-19," "hoax," "virus hoax," "common cold," and more) and ConspTheory2 (keyword "ingest bleach") with PubHealthMes1 (keywords "social distancing," "hand wash," "isolation," and more) were r=0.83 and r=-0.11, respectively, neither was statistically significant (P=.27 and P=.13, respectively).
   Conclusions: Several studies focused on the impacts of social media and related platforms on the spreading of misinformation and conspiracy theories. This study provides the first empirical evidence to the mainly anecdotal discourse on the use of web searches to learn about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19.

AB  - Lockdowns and social distancing measures in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic have made remote participation a necessity for a wide range of social situations. This article examines one example: the abrupt transformation of the Finnish doctoral defence into a remote-access experience facilitated by video-conferencing technologies. The event is regularly centred on a formal public academic debate, rife with local academic ritual and ceremonial formality and firmly tied to the assumption of physical co-presence in the material space. Following the tradition of spatial conceptualisations of the digital, we draw inspiration from Henri Lefebvre's theory on the production of space, particularly the analytical framework of the spatial triad, which enables regarding the doctoral defence as a social space made up of relations between things. As remote-access tools are introduced, new actants enter the field; the relations they mediate are affected, as is the social space that the relations constitute. This facilitates the examination of the effects that remote-access technologies have on conceiving, perceiving and living the doctoral defence, and ultimately on the social space as holistically understood. Our analysis is based on observations of remote-access defences and interviews with doctoral candidates who defended their doctoral theses remotely. Our findings highlight how the social space of the defence is both curtailed and broadened by remote-access technologies; some relations that make up space are narrowed while others stretch sufficiently to be included. As a result, the remote-access defence conceptually counts as the real thing in our material, but it remains unsatisfactory as an experience. This finding suggests how to mediate social space without reducing it: focusing on the lived experience and ensuring that it is not inadvertently distorted.

AB  - Introduction Some evidence suggests that knowledge and attitudes towards rational antibiotic use influences dispensing practice in community drug retail outlets. However, there is limited evidence in resource limited countries, including Ethiopia. We aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes surrounding antibiotic use or supply and antibiotic resistance, and the non-prescribed antibiotic dispensing practices in community drug retail outlets in non-urban Ethiopia. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional survey of community drug retail outlet staff in the Amhara region, Ethiopia with a focus on non-urban towns. An expert validated self-administered questionnaire was used. Following exploratory factor analysis and best items selection, we summarised our findings and assessed factors associated with non-prescribed antibiotic dispensing. The data were analysed using Stata Statistical Software version 17. P-values < 0.05 were considered significant. Results A total of 276 participants from 270 drug outlets completed the questionnaire. The participants median age was 30 (Interquartile range (IQR) = 25-35) years and 79.7% were pharmacy assistants. The majority demonstrated good levels of knowledge about antibiotic use or supply and antibiotic resistance (77.9% and 76% of the participants responded correctly to more than half of the items, respectively). We identified four attitude domains: the role of antibiotics in recovering from diseases regardless of their cause (median score = 2 (IQR = 2-4), beliefs inconsistent with good practice); professional competency to supply non-prescribed antibiotics, and the non-prescribed antibiotics supply (median score for each domain = 4 (IQR = 4-5), attitudes consistent with good practice); and positive attitudes towards actions to prevent antibiotic resistance and promote appropriate antibiotic use (median score = 4 (IQR = 4-5). Fifty eight percent of the participants reported that they had dispensed antibiotics without a prescription. Participants who did not perceive that they were competent to supply non-prescribed antibiotics (adjusted odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = 0.78-0.93) were less likely to report non-prescribed antibiotics dispensing. Conclusion While most of the participants had appropriate knowledge about and attitudes to antibiotic use and antibiotic resistance, basic knowledge and attitude gaps remain. Despite Ethiopia's regulatory restrictions, the non-prescribed antibiotic provision continues to be a common practice. Our study highlights the need for multifaceted interventions that may include a strict regulatory system, staff training and public education.

AB  - Background: The incidence rate of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is increasing in several countries despite that public health measures are put in place. Given that COVID-19 is a newly emerging disease, there is little knowledge about the disease. The present study aims to assess knowledge, perception, and preventive practices toward COVID-19 among health workers in Tigray, North Ethiopia. Materials and Methods: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted among health professionals working in public hospitals. Data were collected between April and May 2020. The researchers included 403 participants and recruited them via a simple random sampling technique. To collect data, the researchers prepared a structured questionnaire guided by the WHO survey questions. Data were entered into Epi-info 7 and exported to SPSS version 20.00 for analysis. The researchers applied descriptive and inferential statistical analyses. Tables and graphs were used to describe data, and multivariate binary logistic regression was used to determine factors affecting knowledge, perception, and practices toward COVID-19 prevention. Results: Among the participants, 79, 88, and 64.3% of them had adequate knowledge, positive perception, and good practice toward preventing COVID-19, respectively. Besides, 92% of the study participants knew that the COVID-19 virus does not have curative treatment and vaccine. The findings revealed that 55% of the respondents did not use the necessary personal protective equipment (PPE) at all times. The result showed that being female [AOR: 2.43, 95% CI (1.50-3.94)] and having a work experience of 2-5 years [AOR: 2.44, 95% CI (1.10-5.39)], news media as a source information [AOR: 7.11, 95% CI (3.07-16.49)], social media as a source information [AOR: 4.59, 95% CI (2.15-9.84)], and governmental website as a source information [AOR: 4.21, 95% CI (2.15-8.27)] were reported as protective factors; and being single [AOR: 0.15, 95% CI (0.03-0.75)] was reported as risk factor toward the prevention of COVID-19. Conclusion: Most health workers had adequate knowledge and positive attitude toward COVID-19; nevertheless, a significant proportion of health workers had poor practice toward the prevention of COVID-19, including the use of PPE. Additionally, some groups of health professional showed poor practices of implementing the public health measures, hence the call for them to improve in the prevention and control of COVID-19.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In contemporary times, employers use information available on the social media (SM) to assess attitudes before interviews and recruitment of potential employees. It is used as one of the criteria to rank applicants for acceptance as residents in the Middle East. In this study, an evaluation was done of this new practice in which program directors (PDs) take into account e-professional ism for the acceptance of applicants. It was a national study of all 41 hospitals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia involved in Saudi board family medicine training programs.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 36-item questionnaire was administered to PDs. Next, a focus group discussion (FGD) was held, after which there was social listening. We recorded the FGD. There was verbatim transcription and coding of the qualitative data. We held social listening using Keyhole. The percentage of positive attitudes (PPAs) was normally distributed; we tested its relationship with different factors by comparing the mean score values among categories using the Student's Mest and one-way analysis of variance.
   RESULTS: The average PPA toward the ranking of applicants by using their SM was 55.5% +/- 17.3% (median: 56.6%). The average PPA was higher in those who used SM to communicate with residents (60.2% +/- 19.5%) than those who did not (49.4%+/- 12%; P. 0.04), even after adjusting for familiarity with Internet use. Directors in hospitals of the Ministry of Education had higher percentages: these figures, however, are not statistically significant. PDs considered the importance of establishing culturally acceptable guidelines for the assessment of e-professionalism and social reputation.
   CONCLUSIONS: Culturally appropriate, bioethical regulations that meet the needs of modem times should be designed. We need to solve ethical dilemmas, especially with regard to privacy in SM.

AB  - Although existing studies have suggested that gender stereotypes affect human perceptions about robots, neither what type of robot tasks or roles are expected to show gender characteristics nor whether expected gender characteristics are directly related to conventional gender conceptions have been sufficiently investigated. To explore these issues, this study conducted two online surveys. In the first survey (N = 500) a total of 30 items related to interaction scenes asked whether male, female, or neutral gender was preferred in terms of the appearance of communication partners in these scenes, and five categories regarding the roles and tasks of robots were extracted based on expected gender appearances. The results revealed a weak effect showing higher gender conceptions inviting a female gender appearance preference in some categories. The second survey (N = 400) measured participants' gender conception, negative attitudes toward robots, gender appearance preferences for the categories of robot roles and tasks extracted in the first survey, and occupations to investigate relationships between them. The results revealed that the influence of gender stereotypes and negative attitudes toward robots on gender appearance preferences changed depending on human occupation, in particular, those with the occupations of counselor, adviser, nurse, and caregiver were not associated with stereotypes, attitudes, or gender preferences toward robots playing roles in their own field of expertise.

AB  - Background: The emerging field of artificial intelligence (AI) will probably affect the practice for the next generation of doctors. However, the students' views on AI have not been largely investigated.Methods: An anonymous electronic survey on AI was designed for medical and dental students to explore: (1) sources of information about AI, (2) AI applications and concerns, (3) AI status as a topic in medicine, and (4) students' feelings and attitudes. The questionnaire was advertised on social media platforms in 2020. Security measures were employed to prevent fraudulent responses. Mann-Whitney U-test was employed for all comparisons. A sensitivity analysis was also performed by binarizing responses to express disagreement and agreement using the Chi-squared test.Results: Three thousand one hundred thirty-three respondents from 63 countries from all continents were included. Most respondents reported having at least a moderate understanding of the technologies underpinning AI and of their current application, with higher agreement associated with being male (p < 0.0001), tech-savvy (p < 0.0001), pre-clinical student (p < 0.006), and from a developed country (p < 0.04). Students perceive AI as a partner rather than a competitor (72.2%) with a higher agreement for medical students (p = 0.002). The belief that AI will revolutionize medicine and dentistry (83.9%) with greater agreement for students from a developed country (p = 0.0004) was noted.

AB  - The present study uses a qualitative approach to understand the impact of COVID-19 on family life. Australian parents of children aged 0-18 years were recruited via social media between April 8 and April 28, 2020, when Australians were experiencing social distancing/isolation measures for the first time. As part of a larger survey, participants were asked to respond via an open-ended question about how COVID-19 had impacted their family. A total of 2,130 parents were included and represented a diverse range of family backgrounds. Inductive template thematic analysis was used to understand patterns of meaning across the texts. Six themes were derived from the data, including "Boredom, depression and suicide: A spectrum of emotion," "Families are missing the things that keep them healthy," "Changing family relationships: The push pull of intimacy," "The unprecedented demands of parenthood," "The unequal burden of COVID-19," and "Holding on to positivity." Overall, the findings demonstrated a breadth of responses. Messages around loss and challenge were predominant, with many families reporting mental health difficulties and strained family relationships. However, not all families were negatively impacted by the restrictions, with some families reporting positive benefits and meaning, including opportunities for strengthening relationships, finding new hobbies, and developing positive characteristics such as appreciation, gratitude, and tolerance.

KW  - Resident
KW  - Virtual-learning
KW  - Volume
AB  - Rationale and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly impacted radiology departments across the country. The pandemic has also disrupted resident education, both due to departmental social distancing efforts and reduced imaging volumes. The purpose of this study was to assess the differential impact the pandemic had on radiology resident imaging volumes by training year and imaging modality.
   Materials and Methods: All signed radiology resident reports were curated during defined prepandemic and intrapandemic time periods. Imaging case volumes were analyzed on a mean per resident basis to quantify absolute and percent change by training level. Change in total volume by imaging modality was also assessed. The number of resident workdays assigned outside the normal reading room was also calculated.
   Results: Overall percent decline in resident imaging interpretation volume from the prepandemic to intrapandemic time period was 62.8%. R1s and R2s had the greatest decline at 87.3% and 64.3%, respectively. Mammography, MRI and nuclear medicine had the greatest decline in resident interpretation volume at 92.0%, 73.2%, and 73.0%, respectively. During the intrapandemic time period, a total of 478 resident days (mean of 14.5 days per resident) were reassigned outside of the radiology reading room.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic caused a marked decrease in radiology resident imaging interpretation volume and has had a tremendous impact on resident education. The decrease in case interpretation, as well as in-person teaching has profound implications for resident education. Knowledge of this differential decrease by training level will help residency programs plan for the future.

KW  - utilization
KW  - volumes
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has reduced radiology volumes across the country as providers have decreased elective care to minimize the spread of infection and free up health care delivery system capacity. After the stay-at-home order was issued in our county, imaging volumes at our institution decreased to approximately 46% of baseline volumes, similar to the experience of other radiology practices. Given the substantial differences in severity and timing of the disease in different geographic regions, estimating resumption of radiology volumes will be one of the next major challenges for radiology practices. We hypothesize that there are six major variables that will likely predict radiology volumes: (1) severity of disease in the local region, including potential subsequent "waves" of infection; (2) lifting of government social distancing restrictions; (3) patient concern regarding risk of leaving home and entering imaging facilities; (4) management of pent-up demand for imaging delayed during the acute phase of the pandemic, including institutional capacity; (5) impact of the economic downturn on health insurance and ability to pay for imaging; and (6) radiology practice profile reflecting amount of elective imaging performed, including type of patients seen by the radiology practice such as emergency, inpatient, outpatient mix and subspecialty types. We encourage radiology practice leaders to use these and other relevant variables to plan for the coming weeks and to work collaboratively with local health system and governmental leaders to help ensure that needed patient care is restored as quickly as the environment will safely permit.

AB  - Face masks (FM) play a role in limiting the spread of viral infections; despite this, their role is influenced by the population's adherence to wearing the FM. However, the impact on the effectiveness of the FM is variable in various communities. This study aimed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward FM use during COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia. This observational "cross-sectional questionnaire-based study was conducted in the Department of Physiology, College of Medicine, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia." The data was collected using an online questionnaire survey from September 8-21, 2021, during the COVID-19 pandemic. The questionnaire was distributed via social media platforms to assess knowledge, attitude, and practices using single choice questions and a five-point Likert scale. Among 1,356, respondents' the rate was 678 (50%), 207 (30.5%) were males and 471 (69.5%) females. Among the participants, Saudi citizens were (649; 95.7%), with University education (502; 74%) and were mostly (368; 54.3%) between 16 and 24 years of age. The participants (384; 56.6%, p < 0.001) had good knowledge about face masks, and more than half of the respondents, 531 (78.3%) (p < 0.001), showed a positive attitude. Most of the respondents (477, 70.2%) believed that everyone could use the face mask to minimize the spread of the disease; however (111; 16.4%) reported that they would not wear a face mask if the government did not recommend wearing it in public places during the COVID-19 pandemic. Saudi citizens have above-average knowledge and optimistic attitudes toward using face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic. The community is convinced about the face masks and believes that face masks play a predominant role in limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mothers' perceptions about attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are central to the management of the disorder. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge, experiences, and attitudes of mothers with ADHD children toward ADHD and identify their common sources of information and service barriers from the perspectives of these mothers in the Dammam, AI-Khobar, and Al-Qatif areas.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study comprised mothers of 132 children with ADHD who attended private and government sector special education schools and day-care centers in the Al-Khobar, Dammam, and Al-Qatif cities of Saudi Arabia. All the mothers completed self-administered structured questionnaires.RESULTS: About 47% mothers of children with ADHD had poor knowledge of ADHD, 74.2% had a positive attitude toward the condition, and 51.5% had a neutral perception of their children. Most of the children received combined therapy, with 69.5% exhibiting improved behavior. The most common concern of mothers was fear of the side effects of medication (39.4%). The mothers were the first family members to seek advice; the most common reason for first visit to clinic were poor social skills (45.5%), and attention hyperactive aggressive behavior (45.5%). The most common reason for the delay in diagnosis was failure to recognize the child's aberrant behavior (67.4%), whereas the most common source of information was internet (63.6%).CONCLUSION: It is important for clinicians to address the mothers' perceptions of ADHD as part of the treatment for ADHD to improve the children's quality of life. It is also important to develop educational materials and awareness campaigns that target mothers and facilitate good communication between the services through the social media.

AB  - Recovery-oriented transformation of mental health service systems not only necessitates changes in mental health policies and practices, it also requires an adoption of recovery-oriented mindset, which includes knowledge and attitudes, among service providers. It is also important that service users are informed about the changes and can fully participate in the process. The present study developed and evaluated the efficacy of a recovery psychoeducation program in enhancing recovery-oriented knowledge and attitudes among mental health service providers and users in Hong Kong. In study 1, 111 service providers were randomly assigned to 2-day psychoeducation group or control group. Results showed that participants in psychoeducation group had significantly better recovery knowledge and more positive attitudes towards recovery after the intervention than the control counterparts. The effect of the recovery psychoeducation program on recovery attitudes was fully mediated by the improvement in recovery knowledge. In study 2, 93 people with mental illness were randomized into 2-week psychoeducation group or control group. Participants in the psychoeducation group had a significant improvement in the level of recovery-oriented knowledge immediately after the workshops, but the effect could not be sustained at follow-up. To transform into a recovery-oriented service system, having an effective program to orient service providers and users to recovery is essential. This study provided initial support to the use of a brief psychoeducational program for recovery-oriented knowledge enhancement. Given the short-term efficacy and feasibility of the interventions, service leaders and managers in different clinical and social service settings should consider implementing the programs as part of staff and users' service orientation to build a recovery-supporting workforce and empower their service users early in the recovery process.

AB  - Context. Cancer Behavior Inventory-Brief Version (CBI-B) is a simple and non-burdensome tool used to evaluate the self-efficacy of the cancer patients.
   Objectives. The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of the Turkish version of the CBI-B.
   Methods. This methodologic study was conducted on 143 cancer patients who received radiotherapy at the Department of Radiation Oncology at a Training and Research Hospital in Turkey. Data were collected using Medical and Demographic Information Form, CBI-B, Satisfaction With Life Scale, and European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30). Descriptive statistics, exploratory factor analysis, and correlation coefficients were used for the analysis of data.
   Results. Exploratory factor analysis confirmed four-factor structure explaining 74.7% of the total variance: 1) Maintaining Independence and Positive Attitude, 2) Participating in Medical Care, 3) Coping and Stress Management, and 4) Managing Affect. The CBI-B had acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach alpha= 0.87) and test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.961) and concurrent validity with Satisfaction With Life Scale and EORTC QLQ-C30 scores. The measures of life satisfaction and quality of life were positively correlated with CBI-B, whereas the symptom levels and the functions (with the exception of the role function) were negatively correlated.
   Conclusion. The CBI-B was found to be a valid and reliable inventory for assessing the self-efficacy of Turkish cancer patients. The CBI-B, is a simple and brief measure of self-efficacy for coping with cancer, could be easily used in clinical and research settings. (C) 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

AB  - Objective: To characterize public health workers who specialize in informatics and to assess informatics-related aspects of the work performed by the public health workforce.
   Methods (Design, Setting, Participants): Using the nationally representative Public Health Workforce Interests and Needs Survey (PH WINS), we characterized and compared responses from informatics, information technology (IT), clinical and laboratory, and other public health science specialists working in state health agencies.
   Main Outcome Measures: Demographics, income, education, and agency size were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Weighted medians and interquartile ranges were calculated for responses pertaining to job satisfaction, workplace environment, training needs, and informatics-related competencies.
   Results: Of 10 246 state health workers, we identified 137 (1.3%) informatics specialists and 419 (4.1%) IT specialists. Overall, informatics specialists are younger, but share many common traits with other public health science roles, including positive attitudes toward their contributions to the mission of public health as well as job satisfaction. Informatics specialists differ demographically from IT specialists, and the 2 groups also differ with respect to salary as well as their distribution across agencies of varying size. All groups identified unmet public health and informatics competency needs, particularly limited training necessary to fully utilize technology for their work. Moreover, all groups indicated a need for greater future emphasis on leveraging electronic health information for public health functions.
   Conclusions: Findings from the PH WINS establish a framework and baseline measurements that can be leveraged to routinely monitor and evaluate the ineludible expansion and maturation of the public health informatics workforce and can also support assessment of the growth and evolution of informatics training needs for the broader field. Ultimately, such routine evaluations have the potential to guide local and national informatics workforce development policy.

AB  - This study investigated information dissemination need in the era of COVID-19 pandemic taking into cognizance the role of librarians in Borno State public library. Three research questions were raised. This study adopted a descriptive survey research design. It was found that librarians' roles included advising the public on how to avoid misinformation; highlighting the importance of social distancing; giving general instructions to library users on the use of face masks, handwashing and use of sanitizers; enlightening library users to avoid handshakes in or outside the library. Public libraries in Borno State can support researchers by drawing attention to the latest developments regarding vaccination; drawing relevant studies published in medical journals; providing free access to the latest literature on coronavirus. Based on this finding, it was recommended that librarians should disseminate information via existing and digital media platforms to educate users.

AB  - Stigma is an important barrier to recovery from depression. Individuals of Asian origin show greater levels of depression stigma compared with individuals of European origin. This study examined the mediators of the relationship between ethnicity and depression stigma in a North American context. A sample of university students, including 199 Canadian Europeans and 249 Canadian Asians, completed a variety of measures through an online study. Stigma toward an individual with depression was measured using both the Depression Attribution Questionnaire-27 and a Social Distance Scale. The perception of social norms, the belief that depression brings shame to one's family, a social dominance orientation, and conservative values mediated the relationship between ethnicity and depression stigma with perceived norms and familial shame having the largest indirect effects. These findings are consistent with social identity theory and suggest avenues for anti-stigma interventions.

AB  - In two studies, the authors examined the effects of intergroup contact in inclusive and non-inclusive environments on children's explicit and implicit prejudices. In both studies, supervised contact with Roma peers, instructed by inclusive program, led to a more positive explicit evaluation of Roma and less social distance, while it had no significant impact on implicit attitudes. In contrast, implicit attitudes were related to mere exposure to Roma (Study 2). Intergroup anxiety and self-disclosure mediated the effect of inclusiveness level on explicit, but not on implicit attitudes. The results indicate that two types of attitudes might be formed via different routes, and that mere exposure and supervised contact influence them differently. This information could help tailor future prejudice reduction programs.

AB  - This study investigates the impact of global infection rates on social media posts during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study analysed over 179 million tweets posted between March 22 and April 13, 2020 and the global COVID-19 infection rates using evolutionary clustering analysis. Results showed six clusters constructed for each term type, including three-level n-grams (unigrams, bigrams and trigrams). The frequent occurrences of unigrams ("COVID-19", "virus", "government", "people", etc.), bigrams ("COVID 19", "COVID-19 cases", "times share", etc.) and trigrams (COVID 19 crisis, things help stop and trying times share) were identified. The results demonstrated that the unigram trends on Twitter were up to about two times and 54 times more common than the bigram terms and trigram terms, respectively. Unigrams like "home" or "need" also became important as these terms reflected the main concerns of people during this period. Taken together, the present findings confirm that many tweets were used to broadcast peoples prevalent topics of interest during the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the results indicate that the number of COVID-19 infections had a significant effect on all clusters, being strong on 86% of clusters and moderate on 16% of clusters. The downward slope in global infection rates reflected the start of the trending of "social distancing" and "stay at home". These findings suggest that infection rates have had a significant impact on social media posting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: The literature demonstrated a positive impact of medication therapy management (MTM) services provided by the pharmacists to improve the overall health outcomes. Nevertheless, limited data is available with regard to MTM service implementation by community pharmacists and its associated factors in Jordan. Objective: To evaluate community pharmacists' knowledge, attitude and practice of MTM service and to explore the challenges and barriers for its implementation. Methods: The present cross-sectional study utilized a validated online survey which was filled by community pharmacists in different areas across Jordan. In addition to the socio-demographic variables, the study questionnaire evaluated pharmacists' knowledge and attitudes towards MTM service, extent of MTM implementation and its associated challenges and barriers. Results: A total of 250 pharmacists completed the survey. The study pharmacists showed moderate knowledge level (median of the total knowledge score = 6 (4-7) out of 10) and positive attitude (median of the attitude score was 23 (19-26) out of 30) towards MTM services. The participating pharmacists recognized performing or obtaining necessary assessments of patient's health status as the most frequently provided MTM service (84.8%), while the least one was documenting the care delivered and communicating essential information to other healthcare providers (62%). Furthermore, collecting patient-related information was the most commonly recognized challenge to MTM service provision (36.8%), followed by referring the patient to a physician or consultant (36%) and collaboration with them (35.6%). The most reported barrier was negative physician attitudes (40.4%), followed by the lack of training on MTM provision (38.4%), and lack of adequate support staff (37.2%). Conclusion: Efforts are needed to enhance collaboration between pharmacists and other health care professional, to develop documentation systems that would preserve and facilitate access to patient information, and to implement appropriate training programs which aim to overcome the challenges and barriers for MTM implementation.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to identify the antecedents of giving charitable donations (Sadaqah) during the pandemic in a majority-Muslim country. This paper proposes and tests a theoretical framework in which attitude toward giving donations mediates the effects of perceived behavioral control, subjective norms and past behavior on giving charitable donations (Sadaqah). The authors also investigate the mediating effect of attitude toward giving donations and the moderating effect of Islamic religiosity in an emerging nation characterized by the dominance of the Islamic doctrine. Gender, age and income have been examined as control variables. Design/methodology/approach Survey data from a sample of 377 respondents from Morocco were analyzed to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings The results indicate that past behavior, subjective norms, attitude toward giving donations and intention to donate are key predictors of giving charitable donation during the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper also confirms the mediating effect of attitude toward giving donations, e.g. subjective norms trigger positive attitude toward giving donations, which increases respondents' donation frequency. The results also suggest a significant moderating effect of Islamic religiosity, e.g. individuals who feel themselves as highly religious are more likely to develop a favorable attitude toward giving donations and are therefore more likely to donate during the pandemic. Practical implications The findings suggest practical and social implications for both academics and practitioners. As attitude, subjective norm, past behavior and intention are found to significantly influence giving charitable donations (Sadaqah), fundraising organizations should give serious attention on these factors to improve individuals' charitable giving (Sadaqah). Such organizations should also consider the use of faith-based messages and religious morals when planning their advertising campaigns in majority-Muslim markets. Originality/value Although preliminary studies have already attempted to provide knowledge about the factors influencing giving donations among both Muslims and nonMuslims, potential antecedents of giving donations (Sadaqah) during the COVID-19 pandemic have not been considered and are yet to be empirically investigated. This paper provides new perceptions on factors influencing giving donations on a majority-Muslim majority country where no zakat institution operates. Such findings can be useful for both academicians, fundraising organizations and policymakers in Morocco to promote charitable actions and boost its socio-economic affects.

AB  - Background HIV education targeting children and adolescents is a key component of HIV prevention. This is especially important in the context of increasing HIV prevalence rates among adolescents and young people. The authors sought to examine the role and effectiveness of an extra-curricular school based programme, Soul Buddyz Clubs (SBC) on HIV knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and biomedical outcomes. Methods This paper employs a mixed methods approach drawing on data from independent qualitative and quantitative sources. Secondary data analysis was performed using survey data from a nationally representative sample that was restricted to 10-14 year-old males and females living in South Africa. Ten focus group discussions and ten in-depth interviews conducted with SBC members and facilitators from 5 provinces, as part of a process evaluation are used to triangulate the effectiveness of SBC intervention. Results The analysis of survey data from 2 198 children indicated that 12% of respondents were exposed to SBC with 4% reporting that they had ever belonged to a club. Children exposed to SBC were more likely to be medically circumcised (AOR 2.38; 95%CI 1.29 -4.40, p=0.006), had correct HIV knowledge (AOR 2.21; 95%CI 1.36 - 3.57, p<0.001) and had less HIV stigmatising attitudes (AOR 0.54; 95%CI 0.31-0.93, p=0.025), adjusting for age, sex, province and exposure to other media - in comparison to those not exposed. Propensity Score Matching findings were consistent with the regression findings. Qualitative findings also supported some of the quantitative results. SBC members reported having learnt about HIV prevention life skills, including condom use, positive attitudes towards people living with HIV, and alcohol abuse. Conclusions Participation in SBC is associated with accessing biomedical HIV prevention services, specifically MMC, correct HIV prevention knowledge and less HIV stigmatizing attitudes. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of a school-based extracurricular intervention using a club approach targeting boys and girls ages 10-14 years on some of the key HIV prevention biomarkers as well as knowledge and attitudes. The article suggests that extra-curricular interventions can form an effective component of school-based comprehensive sexuality education in preventing HIV and promoting medical male circumcision.

AB  - Aims.
   To investigate patients' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine, the education nurses provided about complementary and alternative medicine for treating depression and to test whether such education mediates the effect of complementary and alternative medicine use and attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine.
   Background.
   Although we know that attitudes influence behaviour, very few studies simultaneously explore the relationship between attitudes, education and complementary and alternative medicine use.
   Design.
   Survey.
   Methods.
   This study was conducted as part of a larger survey, using face-to-face survey interviews with 206 adult patients aged 50 years or over and hospitalised in conventional hospitals in Taiwan for treatment of depression. The attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine and patient education about complementary and alternative medicine instruments were specially developed for the study.
   Results.
   Participants expressed slightly favourable attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine. Many participants (50%) expressed that they were willing to try any potential treatment for depression. They believed that complementary and alternative medicine helped them to feel better and to live a happier life. However, 66 center dot 5% of participants reported that they had inadequate knowledge of complementary and alternative medicine. Participants with a higher monthly income, longer depression duration and religious beliefs hold more positive attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine. Most participants were not satisfied with the education they received about complementary and alternative medicine. Patient education about complementary and alternative medicine was found to be a mediator for the use of complementary and alternative medicine.
   Conclusion.
   Patient education from nurses may predict patients' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine. Continuing nursing education is needed to enable nurses to respond knowledgeably to concerns patients may have about complementary and alternative medicine and treatment options.
   Relevance to clinical practice.
   This study highlights the potential role of patient education about complementary and alternative medicine as an effective way of adjusting patients' attitudes toward complementary and alternative medicine and to link both patients' preferences for complementary and alternative medicine and health professionals' concerns about the proper use of complementary and alternative medicine for depression management and adverse drug interactions.

AB  - The use of technology in preschool teaching practices plays a key role in making the learning process easier and more effective. It is significant to use technology in the preschool period by the teachers when the learning capacity is high. This study aims to investigate the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) by teachers in the preschool period with an explanatory sequential design, which is one of the mixed research methods. There were 327 participants in the quantitative stage, and 35 participants in the qualitative stage of the research. Research data were collected in the quantitative part of the study with the "ICT Use in Early Childhood Education Scale", and in the qualitative part, an interview form consisting of four research questions was used. As a result of the research, it was revealed that teachers' ICT use was high. According to the variable of teachers' participation in in-service training, it was determined that the use of ICT created a significant difference in favor of the teachers participating in the training. To support the basic ICT skills, it was determined that participants benefited from enabling ICT use by children, using ICT in the classroom, giving ICT training to children, online applications and coding studies. In order for the children to develop positive attitudes towards ICT, it was revealed that the participants made use of doing activities, giving information, attracting attention and being a role model. It was revealed that the participants used ICT in the teaching process in preparing activities, presenting visual materials, watching videos and online applications. For teachers to support individual learning needs, it was found that they planned individual activities, enabled individual ICT use and performed online sharing.

AB  - Objectives One effective approach of tobacco control is to encourage the role and the participation of healthcare workers in the prevention efforts against tobacco use. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of tobacco use among governmental healthcare workers in Qatar, to assess healthcare workers' knowledge, attitude and practice of tobacco cessation and to predict factors associated with above average tobacco cessation practice scores. Design A cross-sectional survey study was conducted among healthcare workers working in Hamad Medical Corporation and Primary Healthcare Centres in Qatar using a self-administered online questionnaire in 2019. Setting Hamad Medical Corporation and Primary Healthcare Centres in Qatar. Participants Governmental healthcare workers aged 18 years and above (n=7214). Results The response rate of our online survey was 20.6% (7214/35 000). Of the 7214 healthcare workers, 16.3% (n=1178) were current tobacco users. In particular, the prevalence of tobacco use among physicians was 11.0%. Fifty-two per cent of healthcare workers (n=2338) attained an average knowledge score (12-17), 71.8% (n=3094) attained positive attitude scores (8-12) and 57.1% (n=3052) attained above average practice scores (12-26). Among the different professions, physicians were having the highest mean knowledge (15.3 +/- 4.7), attitude (9.4 +/- 1.9) and practice (13.7 +/- 6.1) scores. Multivariate analysis showed that having good knowledge (adjusted OR (AOR)=2.8; p<0.0001) and training (AOR=2.4; p<0.0001) were the strongest factors associated positively with above average tobacco cessation practice scores. Conclusions Healthcare workers in Qatar have a relatively similar prevalence of tobacco use than earlier studies with no significant increase. Investing more in training programmes for healthcare workers are needed to root out this negative behaviour and to increase their skills to assist users to quit.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has emerged as a pandemic. The updated knowledge and a positive attitude of health care professionals (HCPs) towards fighting any pandemic is the key to success. Thus, the present study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of HCPs towards COVID-19 in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A cross-sectional study was conducted across the KSA, covering its five geographical regions with a non-probability quota sample. Twenty-nine, close-ended questions evaluating the knowledge and attitude domain were included in the questionnaire. It was developed with the help of Qualtrics software and circulated among the HCPs through the electronic mode. We analyzed data from about 1040 HCPs using the statistical package of social sciences (SPSS) v.21. All variables were presented in number and percentages. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the odds ratio (OR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) of independent variables for inadequate knowledge and attitude. Considering the "good" level of the respective domain, the HCPs have displayed better knowledge (48.2%) over attitude (33.8%). Female (aOR: 1.55; 95% CI: 1.15-2.09; p = 0.004), Diploma degree (aOR: 2.51; 95% CI: 1.64-3.83; p < 0.001), 7-10 years' experience (aOR: 1.47; 95% CI: 1.01-2.15; p = 0.045) were at higher risk of having inadequate knowledge compared to their contemporaries. Among the sources, the Ministry of Health (MOH) website was the most popular source of information (76%). The knowledge and attitude of HCPs regarding COVID-19 was similar across all the regions of KSA. However, the continuing education program is warranted to fill the potential gap in knowledge for HCPs in higher-risk groups.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to empirically verify the role of determinants of information quality in shaping attitudes and intention of respondents from major metro cities of India towards electronic word of mouth (e-WOM) using personal identifying information (PII) as a moderator.
   Design/methodology/approach For the purpose of measuring the role of information quality in predicting attitude towards e-WOM (moderated by PII), the study proposes and validates the research framework by collecting responses from 375 respondents with diverse demographics, belonging to select metro cities of India.
   Findings All the constructs of information quality have a significantly positive effect on attitude of travellers towards e-WOM. Attitude further impacts the behavioural intention to book via an online travel agency/agent (OTA). PII successfully moderated all the hypothesized relationships with attitude except review sidedness.
   Research implications The study offers a rationale to fill the gap between information quality and attitude as well as exploring new relationships using PII as a moderating variable. It further opens new avenues in researching the behavioural intention of travellers from metro cities of India with the disruptions created by Web 2.0.
   Practical implications OTAs in this competitive time must try to harmonize their systems to create content that is timely updated, unique, convincing and useful to build long-term relationships and generate continued revenues.
   Originality/value In the context of OTAs in India, this study has successfully identified the most relevant constructs of information quality and examined their effectiveness in creating a positive attitude towards e-WOM. The use of contemporary construct "PII" as a moderator will help marketers develop effective strategies for reducing anonymity in reviews and capturing the intention of experience-oriented travellers from the metro cities of India.

AB  - The present study proposes a new threat-benefit theoretical model explaining attitudes of local people toward immigrants. Based on the theory of human values and extending Integrative Threat Theory, the threat-benefit model suggests that the local population perceives immigrants as both threatening and beneficial for the receiving society. The model assumes that appraisal of an immigrant group as threatening or beneficial for the receiving society influences opinions regarding immigration policy related to the immigrant group. The study assessed the new model investigating attitudes toward asylum seekers in a representative sample of 283 social workers in Israel. Results of the study support a conceptualization of immigrant appraisal involving four types of threats (economic, physical, social cohesion, and modernity) and four types of benefits (economic, physical, cultural diversity, and humanitarian), which represent different types of realistic and symbolic threats and benefits. Findings showed that appraisal of asylum seekers as beneficial or threatening to the receiving society mediated the connections between personal preferences for values of universalism, power, social security, and tradition and support for immigration policy directed either at defending immigrants' rights or defending the receiving society. Application of the model for understanding attitudes toward different minorities as well as for creation of value-based interventions and programs aimed at reducing negative attitudes toward various stigmatized groups in society are discussed.

AB  - Background: Patient-accessible electronic health records give patients quick and easy access to their health care data, enabling them to view their test results online prior to a clinic visit. Hospital reports can be difficult for patients to understand, however, and can lead to unnecessary anxiety.
   Objective: We aimed to investigate the attitudes and experiences of Danish patients with metastatic breast cancer in using electronic health records to view their own scan results.
   Methods: We conducted a prospective mixed methods study in a sequential design at our institution during 2018. Participants were women with metastatic breast cancer who were having scans every 3 months (combined positron emission tomography and computed tomography or computed tomography alone) to monitor treatment effects. Participants first received an online questionnaire about their knowledge and use of online access to scan results. We then conducted semistmctured interviews with 4 women who used the online access to view their scan results.
   Results: A total of 46 patients received the questionnaire (median age 66, SD 11.8, range 34-84 years). Of these women, 38 (83%) completed the survey (median age 69, SD 10.7, range 42-84 years). Most patients (34/38) were aware of the opportunity to access their reports online, but only 40% (15/38) used this access to read their scan results. Barriers to online access were (1) anxiety over reading the scan results in the absence of clinician support, and (2) a preference to receive all disease information at their next hospital appointment. The patients who read their scan result found that facilitators were greater transparency and empowerment, and barriers were the consequences of reading bad news, the feeling of dilemma about the access, and the medical terminology.
   Conclusions: Patients with metastatic breast cancer generally had a positive attitude toward electronic access to their scan results, and those who used this opportunity played a greater participatory role in their disease and its management. Others described the potential distress this opportunity caused. The study findings suggest that immediate online access to scan results should be available to patients, but it needs a support function alongside that ensures optimal patient care.

AB  - Objective Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranked second in terms of cancer mortality worldwide. It is associated with a substantial global disease burden. We aimed to examine whether the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) could predict the uptake of faecal immunochemical test to inform novel strategies for enhancing CRC screening participation in population-based programmes. Design Cross-sectional study. Settings A Hong Kong-based and territory-wide telephone survey was conducted during the study period from October 2017 to November 2018. Participants 4800 asymptomatic individuals aged 61-70 years who can communicate in Cantonese were recruited during the survey period. Those who had a history of CRC, chronic bowel inflammation, two or more first-degree relatives with CRC, and received colonoscopy in the past 10 years or faecal occult blood test in the past 5 years were excluded. Outcome measures The association between CRC screening uptake and the factors pertinent to TPB was analysed by univariable and multivariable regression models and the mediating effect of intention. We adjusted for age, gender, educational level, marital and working status, as well as household income. Results Multivariable regression analysis showed that high perceived behavioural control (adjusted OR (AOR)=12.35, 95% CI 8.21 to 18.60, p<0.001), high intention for CRC screening (AOR=7.86, 95% CI 6.60 to 9.36, p<0.001) and positive attitude towards CRC screening (accuracy and effectiveness: AOR=1.19, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.38, p<0.05; embarrassment and apprehension: AOR=4.27, 95% CI 3.13 to 5.82, p<0.001) were significantly associated with CRC screening uptake. Mediation analysis found that the effect of social norms on screening behaviour was primarily mediated by intention (83.2%), and this indirect, mediated effect accounted for 21.7% to 24.1% of total effects of other constructs in TPB on screening behaviour. Conclusions The variables pertinent to TPB could successfully predict CRC screening uptake. Promotion of CRC screening based on interventions that increase perceived behavioural control and behavioural intention could potentially enhance screening uptake. Further studies are needed to establish the cause and effect relationship among these variables and screening uptake, as well as to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such interventions.

TI  - Telehealth During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Registered Dietitian Nutritionists
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE ACADEMY OF NUTRITION AND DIETETICS
LA  - English
AB  - During the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, health care practices have shifted to minimize virus transmission, with unprecedented expansion of telehealth. This study describes self-reported changes in registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN) practice related to delivery of nutrition care via telehealth shortly after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was administered from mid-April to mid-May 2020 to RDNs in the United States providing face-to-face nutrition care prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. This survey included 54 questions about practitioner demographics and experience and current practices providing nutrition care via telehealth, including billing procedures, and was completed by 2016 RDNs with a median (interquartile range) of 15 (6-27) years of experience in dietetics practice. Although 37% of respondents reported that they provided nutrition care via telehealth prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, this proportion was 78% at the time of the survey. Respondents reported spending a median (interquartile range) of 30 (20-45) minutes in direct contact with the individual/group per telehealth session. The most frequently reported barriers to delivering nutrition care via telehealth were lack of client interest (29%) and Internet access (26%) and inability to conduct or evaluate typical nutrition assessment or monitoring/evaluation activities (28%). Frequently reported benefits included promoting compliance with social distancing (66%) and scheduling flexibility (50%). About half of RDNs or their employers sometimes or always bill for telehealth services, and of those, 61% are sometimes or always reimbursed. Based on RDN needs, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics continues to advocate and provide resources for providing effective telehealth and receiving reimbursement via appropriate coding and billing. Moving forward, it will be important for RDNs to participate fully in health care delivered by telehealth and telehealth research both during and after the COVID-19 public health emergency.

AB  - Objectives: To analyze the role of pharmacists during the COVID-19 pandemic, to measure pharmacists' attitude toward COVID-19 safety measures (wearing masks, wearing gloves, isolation shield, good hygiene, etc.), and explore their perspectives regarding a second wave of the virus. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak in July 2020 to discuss Jordanian pharmacists' awareness of safety at their workplace during the COVID-19 outbreak, their sources of information, and their predictions for COVID-19 vaccination. Results: The participants (n = 311) were all pharmacists mostly aged between 23-30 years old (45%) and female (83%). The primary source of information about COVID-19 was social networking (38.9%). Pharmacists were committed to social distancing (86.5%) and wearing masks (76.2%). They expressed levels of agreement to their role in decreasing COVID-19 spread (94.2%) and correcting false information (94.5%); they expressed levels of expectation toward concern about a second COVID-19 wave (83%) that would be more severe than the previous one (43.4%). Pharmacists expected that an influenza vaccine might be helpful in decreasing severity and spread of the COVID-19 pandemic (56.9%). Pharmacists expected COVID-19 vaccine development within 6 months of administering our study survey (84.9%) and that vaccination might be effective in preventing COVID-19 (93%) infection. Conclusion: Pharmacists expressed positive roles on COVID-19 spread through exemplary actions, self-commitment to protection measures, and public health awareness. Social media as a source of health information should be cautiously investigated, and pharmacists should always refer to evidence-based sources. The role of pharmacists is particularly important for the upcoming era of COVID-19 vaccination administration and awareness.

AB  - Background: In Italy, the response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic upgraded from social distancing on February 23, 2020, to national lockdown on March 11, 2020. We described how the pandemic affected a tertiary care children hospital with a dedicated COVID-19 regional center. Methods: We analyzed the characteristics of emergency department (ED) visits, urgent hospitalizations and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-COV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction testing, and COVID-19 patients across 3 response phases: before the first Italian case, before national lockdown and during lockdown. Results: ED visits decreased from a daily mean of 239.1 before the first COVID-19 Italian case, to 79.6 during lockdown; urgent hospitalizations decreased from 30.6 to 21.2. As of April 20, 2020, 1970 persons were tested for SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and 2.6% were positive. Positive rates were 1.2% in the ED, 21.1% in the COVID center and 0.5% in other wards. The median age of COVID-19 patients (N = 33) was 6.7 years, 27% had coexisting conditions and 79% were related to family clusters. Conclusions: The pandemic strongly impacted on the use of hospital services, with a 67% reduction in ED visits and a 31% reduction in urgent hospitalizations. Separating the flows of suspected patients from all other patients, and centralization of suspected and confirmed cases in the COVID center enabled to control the risk of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Delay in hospital use for urgent care must be avoided, and clear communication on infection prevention and control must be provided to families. Further studies are needed to assess how the reduction in hospital use affected children healthcare needs during the pandemic.

AB  - Purpose: Radiology departments around the world have been faced with the challenge to adapt, and recover to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study is part of a worldwide survey of radiologists' responses to COVID-19 in 18 different countries in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The purpose of this study is to analyze the changes made in international radiology departments and practices in response to the pandemic.
   Methods: The 18-item survey was sent via email from April to May 2020 to radiologists in Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America to assess their response to COVID-19. Our survey included questions regarding imaging, workforce adjustments, testing availability, staff and patient safety, research and education, and infrastructure availability.
   Results: Twenty-eight survey responses were reviewed. Of the 28 respondents, 42.9% have shortages of infrastructure and 78.6% responded that COVID-19 testing was available. Regarding the use of Chest CT in COVID-19 patients, 28.6% respondents used Chest CT as screening for COVID-19. For staff safety, interventions included encouraging use of masks in patient encounters, social distancing and PPE training. To cope with their education and research mission, radiology departments are doing online lectures, reducing the number of residents in rotations, and postponing any non-urgent activities.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, there are disparities in infrastructure, research, and educational initiatives during COVID-19 which also provides opportunity for the global radiology community to work together on these issues. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Parents can significantly impact their adolescent child's sexual and relationship decision-making, yet many parents are not effectively communicating with their teens about these topics. Media are sexual socialization agents for adolescents, which can encourage early or risky sexual activity. Media Aware Parent is a web-based program for parents of adolescents that was designed to improve adolescent sexual health by providing parents with the skills to have high-quality communication with their child about sex and relationships as well as to mediate their media usage. This web-based randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018-2019 with parent-child pairs (grades 7, 8, or 9; N = 355) from across the United States. Parent participants identified as mostly female (75%), white/Caucasian (74%); and non-Hispanic (92%). The youth sample was more balanced in terms of gender (45% female) and more diverse with respect to race (66% white) and ethnicity (86% non-Hispanic). Twenty-eight percent of the families identified as a single parent household, and 35% of the youth were eligible for free school lunch. The present study assessed the short-term effects of Media Aware Parent on parent-adolescent communication, adolescent sexual health outcomes, and media-related outcomes across a one-month timeframe. Parents were randomly assigned to the intervention (Media Aware Parent) or active control group (online access to medically-accurate information on adolescent sexual health). The intervention improved parent-adolescent communication quality as rated by both parents and youth. Youth were more likely to understand that their parent did not want them to have sex at this early age. Youth reported more agency over hook-ups, more positive attitudes about sexual health communication and contraception/protection, and more self-efficacy to use contraception/protection, if they decide to have sexual activity. The intervention improved media literacy skills in both parents and youth, and resulted in youth being more aware of family media rules. Parents gave overwhelming positive feedback about Media Aware Parent. The results from this pretest-posttest study provide evidence that Media Aware Parent is an effective web-based program for parents seeking to enhance parent-adolescent communication and media mediation, and positively impact their adolescents' sexual health outcomes.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous impact on many aspects of children's day-to-day lives, including their play. Measures such as lockdowns, school and playground closures, quarantine, isolation and social distancing introduced to curb transmission have resulted in major consequences for where, when, how and with whom children can play.
   This article reports on interim findings from 'The Play Observatory', a 15-month project researching children's play experiences during the COVID-19 pandemic. Collecting data through an online survey and online case studies, the research offers insights into ways in which children's play has endured, adapted and responded to restrictions brought about by the pandemic.
   This article focuses on children's digital play throughout this period, including examples of digital gaming, online play, social media, playful creation of digital media texts and hybrid online-offline play. Drawing on theories relating to dynamic literacies, multimodal perspectives and the Reggio Emilia concept of the 'hundred languages', this article examines the role of the digital in children's contemporary play practices and the specific affordances of digital play during times of stress, uncertainty and physical distancing.
   The findings highlight ways in which digital play continued, adapted, evolved and reflected children's experiences and understandings of the pandemic. The study reveals the complexity of digital play and its place within contemporary digital childhoods, troubling simplistic notions of 'screen time' and highlighting the increasingly blurred boundaries around digital and non-digital practices, calling for educational approaches that value digital play as significant meaning-making.

AB  - People tend to predict their preferred political candidate will win an election. The resulting surprised losers are examined as playing a role in the established gap between electoral winners and losers on such important outcomes as trust in government and satisfaction with the electoral process and democracy. Exposure to Fox News programming can increase wishful thinking among Republican candidate supporters, but among surprised losers, it does not increase negative attitudes.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to examine the role of extraversion and agreeableness personality traits on Generation Y (Gen Y) consumers' attitudes toward and willingness to pay for green hotels. Gen Y is a large and influential generational group, with a significant interest in green issues. There has been a lack of research on the consumer decision-making process toward green hotels. Specifically, the impact of personality on green attitudes and behavioral intentions is rarely investigated.
   Design/methodology/approach - A major survey consisting of 406 final respondents was conducted. The 29-item survey questionnaire comprises items for extraversion, agreeableness, attitudes toward green hotels and behavioral intention toward green hotels. Numerous statistical techniques, including structural equation modeling, were used to evaluate the data collected.
   Findings - The results show that extraversion and agreeableness personality traits are positively associated with respondents' attitudes toward green hotels. Stronger and more positive attitudes toward green hotels lead to greater willingness to pay for green hotels. Moreover, attitudes toward green hotels mediate the relationship between the two personality traits and willingness to pay. These findings of Gen Y subsegments can be useful to hotel managers in identifying who are more likely to stay in and pay for environmentally friendly hotels.
   Originality/value - Gen Ys are an influential consumer age group in the service industry, and their general attitudes toward "green" products are important to modern hoteliers. However, few researchers have examined Gen Ys' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward green issues. No research has examined the role of personality traits on consumers' perceptions of green hotels. The present study found that the extraversion and agreeableness traits of Gen Y individuals are linked to their attitudes toward and willingness to pay for green hotels.

AB  - According to the challenge-hindrance model, challenge stressors contain both stressful and challenging aspects, hindrance stressors only stressful aspects. Typically, negative outcomes of challenge stressors refer to well-being (strain), positive outcomes to so-called work outcomes (e.g., productivity, intention to quit). As both effects occur simultaneously, the positive outcomes often emerge only when controlling for the negative effects. We suggest that the negative and the positive effects of challenge stressors may refer to well-being. Specifically, we propose challenge to indicate competence, thus fostering organization-based self-esteem (OBSE), which, in turn, should enhance more general indicators of positive well-being. We explored the effect of time pressure (a prototypical challenge stressor) on a general well-being variable (positive attitude towards life; PAL). We postulated challenge stressors to be associated with PAL positively via OBSE and negatively via strain. These processes should (a) result in a non-significant bivariate association, which should (b) become significant once strain is controlled (suppression), but (c) become insignificant again once OBSE is controlled (mediation). Using structural equation modeling, we could confirm our hypotheses in a cross-sectional study. Results confirm the inherently ambivalent nature of time pressure, containing both positive and negative variance. In line with our theoretical position, results suggest that the negative and the positive outcomes may be conceived in terms of different aspects of well-being, in addition to "work outcomes" that do not refer to well-being. This concept of challenge stressors may help to explain why many people do not reduce challenge stressors even when they could: Feeling good about themselves and their lives may, at least temporarily, outweigh the strain.

AB  - Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society.

AB  - The article analyses the centrality of new media platforms in the everyday life of contemporary India. It claims that the representations of everyday life saturated with media technology in films and web series helps us to understand the ways new media has become central to the life experience in India over a rather short period. By engaging with philosophical and sociological theories, and by approaching the question and the theory through several cinematic examples, the article shall probe the ways in which we have become digital beings, and to which extent this has been mediated by neoliberal capitalism, as the platforms are lucrative business ventures of different global media corporations. The article claims that COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns in 2020 and 2021 resulted in many different attempts to articulate the centrality of technology to our everyday life. Various films and web series released during the pandemic and commenting on the effect of the pandemic on our everyday life, attempt to demonstrate, at least in part, the creative power of technology in India and shows ways how technology helps forge an alternative sociality under the regime of social distancing. However, the article takes a critical stance in demonstrating that media technologies, their impact on our everyday life and the logic that govern them are far more problematic than it seems.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) viral course and behavior remain unpredictable. This study describes incubation time and viral clearance of COVID-19 hospitalized cases in Northern Jordan.
   Methods: All COVID-19 confirmed cases hospitalized from March 15 to June 09, 2020, were included. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected, and COVID-19 reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed every two days in all cases. The viral cure was defined when two negative RT-PCR tests were obtained >= 24 hours apart. Viral clearance time (VCT) reflects the time from the first positive nasopharyngeal swab to the first of two consecutive negative tests.
   Results: In this cohort, a total of 157 patients were included. Most cases resulted from two major outbreaks. The median incubation period was 6 days (IQR, 3-10) and ranged from 1 to 17 days. The median VCT was 13 days (IQR, 7-2) and ranged from 1 to 40 days. Symptomatic presentation and abnormal chest radiograph were predictors for a prolonged VCT (p=0.015 and p=0.014, respectively). The median time of resolution of symptoms was 7 days (IQR, 3-10 days). Most symptomatic cases (91.7%) remained RT-PCR positive for up to 20 days after symptoms resolution, with a median of 13.5 days. VCT significantly correlated with the incubation period (p=0.013).
   Conclusion: Viral cure lagged for as long as 20 days after resolution of symptoms. Continuing with social-distancing, frequent hand hygiene, and wearing facial mask remains essential and is recommended even after clinical resolution of symptoms.

AB  - Background: Swedish municipalities are facing demographic challenges due to the growing number of older people and the resulting increased need for health care services. Welfare technologies are being launched as possible solutions for meeting some of these challenges.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore the perception, experimentation, evaluation, and procurement of welfare technology practices among professionals working in municipal elder care in relation to their gender, age, and profession.
   Methods: Data for this explorative cross-sectional study were collected from 393 responses to a web-based survey on municipal elder care in Sweden. Chi square tests were performed to determine the associations.
   Results: The results revealed gender, age, and professional differences in perspectives of municipal elder care workers. Differences were particularly evident in attitudes toward technology, both the use of technology in general and in the workplace, and involvement and participation in decision making regarding the procurement of new welfare technologies. Men (37/53, 70%) expressed a more positive attitude toward and curiosity regarding new technologies than women (157/336, 46.7%) (P=.03). Regarding age, the younger respondents (18-24 years old) perceived the digital transformation in the workplace as "too slow" (4/4, 100%), whereas the majority of older respondents (65-74 years old) perceived it as happening at the "right pace" (4/7, 57%). The elder care personnel felt encouraged by management to explore and experiment with new welfare technologies, but never did so either for management or with patients. Even though the majority of the respondents were women, more men (4/7, 57%) were involved in the procurement process for welfare technology devices and solutions than women (98/336, 29.2%) (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Personnel working within municipal elder care were generally very positive toward new technologies. However, both gender and age differences may influence these perspectives such as the personnel's resistance to welfare technology and patients' participation in welfare technology usage and deployment. Different levels of participation in the decision-making process regarding new technology deployment may negatively affect the overall digital transformation within municipal elder care.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the knowledge. attitude. and practice toward COVID-19 among residents/citizens of Saudi Arabia (KSA), the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and Kuwait.
   PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional online survey on 3.920 citizens/residents from three Gulf-countries (KSA, UAE, and Kuwait) was conducted between June 15 and August 25, 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 4 items on attitudes. and 7 items on practice towards prevention and control of COVID-19. The Survey link was constructed to be available in Arabic and English. Descriptive statistics of frequency distribution and percentages were calculated, and non-parametric tests were applied to compare the mean knowledge. attitude, and practice scores among different countries.
   RESULTS: This study included participants from KSA (2.938, 74.9%). UAE (403, 10.3%), and Kuwait (579, 14.8%). The study subjects from KSA. UAE, and Kuwait showed significant differences in the mean knowledge (10.13. 10.52, and 9.19, p<0.001). attitude (2.84, 3.12, and 5.98. p<0.001), and practice (6.11, 5.98 and 5.38, p<0.001) scores towards COVID-19. In addition. Kuwaiti citizens and residents showed significantly lower knowledge, attitude, and practice scores toward COVID-19 than UAE and KSA participants. Participants from Kuwait showed significantly lower knowledge, attitude, and practice scores than the UAE and KSA. However, in general (38.2%), the study participants were optimistic about controlling Coronavirus. Nearly 48.6% started to take an immune-boosting diet to protect themselves from the Coronavirus.
   CONCLUSIONS: Study participants from KSA. UAE. and Kuwait demonstrated adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and acceptable practices towards COVID-19 control. Electronic and social media should be effectively utilized to spread awareness of COVID-19 among the public.

AB  - PurposeIn the current study, the views of Jordanian regarding sharing medical reports for research purposes were investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, motivators and barriers regarding sharing of medical records were examined. MethodsThis observational survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted using an electronic questionnaire during the COVID-19 pandemic (second half of 2020). The questionnaire link was disseminated through two social media platforms (WhatsApp and Facebook), targeting Jordanian adults (age >18 years). ResultsIn this study, 1,194 participants agreed to complete the study survey. Results showed that 58.3% of them (n = 696) reported to be willing to share their medical data. while 17.6% of the participants (n = 210) showed hesitancy to share their medical information. The most important motivators as perceived by the study participants were helping other patients who have similar health conditions (n = 995, 83.3%). Moreover, fearing from stigma (n = 753, 63.1%), and the lack of confidence in data security and privacy (n = 728, 61.0%) were among the main barriers preventing participants from sharing their information. Finally, results showed that participants with higher educational level (bachelor or higher) (OR = 0.299, P<0.001), or those living in center of Jordan (OR = 0.270, P<0.001) showed a lower tendency to share their medical data. While participants those who have shared data before showed a higher tendency to share their medical data (OR = 2.524, P<0.001). ConclusionIn this study, many of the participants had a positive attitude towards sharing biomedical data for scientific research during the COVID-19 pandemic, many had doubts in the control over their data. Thus, policymakers and data users should address the concerns and values of patients and understand their preferences in favor of an ethically scrupulous use of data in research.

AB  - The issues of whether mobile-assisted English as a foreign language (EFL) reading is effective have become increasingly important for EFL teachers and policy-makers. However, empirical studies investigating EFL students' reading comprehension performance on mobile phones and students' perceptions of these reading formats are lacking. The present research employed questionnaire surveys and semistructured interviews to investigate whether differences exist between mobile-assisted and paper-based EFL reading in terms of participants' reading comprehension accuracy, reading speed, and reading strategy used (i.e. general, problem-solving or support strategies) and explore EFL learners' perceptions of mobile-assisted EFL reading. A sample of 81 first-year college students participated in a quasiexperiment, 6 participants participated in a semistructured interview, and a sample of an additional 10 students participated in a pilot study. The analyses, including qualitative descriptions, mixed-design analysis of variance (ANOVA), paired-sample t-tests, and independent-sample t-tests, indicated that participants achieved superior reading comprehension accuracy when reading from printed paper compared to reading from mobile phones. Superior reading speed from paper was observed only when participants were instructed to read and complete the comprehension test the first time, while no difference in speed between the two reading media was observed the second time. Additionally, participants' use of reading strategies during mobile-assisted EFL reading was not as effective as that during paper reading. Regarding participants' preferences, most participants (79%) preferred reading from paper over mobile phones because hard copies provided a better reading experience and promoted active reading engagement. However, participants held positive attitudes toward mobile-assisted EFL learning and wanted to continue to read from mobile phones to assist their foreign language learning due to their convenient built-in functions and portability. The implications for the use of mobile devices to assist language pedagogical practice are discussed.

AB  - Objective: To examine the psychosocial factors that influence Australian women's intentions to freeze their eggs.
   Design: Initially, a qualitative elicitation study followed by a larger-scale quantitative study.
   Setting: Both studies were conducted online.
   Patients: A total of 234 Australian women 25 +/- 43 years of age, who identifed as heterosexual, had no children, were open to the idea of having children, were currently not pregnant, and did not have a diagnosis of medical infertility.
   Intervention: None.
   Main Outcome Measure(s): Intentions and willingness of women to freeze their eggs.
   Result(s): Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that after accounting for demographic variables, there was strong support for the psychosocial predictors of attitude, pressure from others, and control perceptions as predictors of women's intentions to freeze their eggs. Of the additional variables, cognitive bias (influence of the media) was significant, and the final model accounted for 52.7% of variance in women's intentions to freeze their eggs.
   Conclusion(s): This study was the first to predict women's intentions to freeze their eggs using a well-established decision-making model, the theory of planned behavior. Messages designed to develop a positive attitude toward egg freezing, and to encourage an increased perception of personal control of the egg freezing process, as well as approval from others, could support women to investigate egg freezing, in consultation with appropriate medical advice, as an option when faced with possible future infertility. Effective strategies broaden fertility options for women faced with age-related fertility decline, maximize women's chances of a successful pregnancy, and, critically, prevent the often substantial psychological distress associated with involuntary childlessness.

AB  - Objectives This study investigated what kinds of experiences influence regional quota (chiikiwaku) medical students' motivation to practice community healthcare (CH), and the mechanism of this influence, by focusing on their experiences in a community-based medical education (CBME) programme. Design A qualitative thematic analysis based on interviews. Setting Participants were recruited from the chiikiwaku students of Kobe University, Japan, using purposive sampling. Participants Fourteen students participated. The median (IQR) age of participants was 23 (23-24); half were sixth-year and half fifth-year students. Analysis From September to December 2018, the interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed according to the 'Steps for Coding and Theorisation' method. Our theoretical framework comprised three internal motives (ie, needs, cognitions and emotions) and their subordinate motivation theories self-determination theory, expectancy-value theories, and positive and negative emotions, respectively. Results Three mechanisms and corresponding experiences emerged. The first mechanism, envisioning and preparing for practising CH, included corresponding experiences-empathy for the community, grasping the demands for CH, understanding the practices of CH, finding a role model and diminishing the conflicts between personal life and career. The second mechanism, belonging to a supportive community, included the robust construction of students' CH community and harmonisation with community residents. The third mechanism, psychological effects included the affect heuristic and framing effect. Student experiences brought about the changes and influences described in the presented mechanisms, and had both positive and negative impacts on their motivation towards CH. These results can be interpreted through the multifaceted lenses of motivation theories. Conclusions The authors revealed that motivation mechanisms of medical students towards CH derived from positive interaction with community residents, healthcare professionals and other students, and from exposure to attractive community environments and cultures. These experiences should be incorporated into CBME programmes to further encourage positive attitudes towards CH.

AB  - Purpose: We performed a survey amongst attendees of the 4th Annual Meeting of Indian Brachytherapy Society to study the patterns of brachytherapy practice and attitude towards brachytherapy use.
   Material and methods: A 19-point questionnaire was designed and e-mailed to the attendees immediately after the conference. Descriptive analysis of the responses were done and satisfaction index was used as a tool for evaluation of the program effectiveness. Binomial test was used to assess the difference between distributions of responses and Mann-Whitney U test was used to assess the correlation between responses. P value (2-tailed) of < 0.05 was taken significant for all statistical analysis.
   Results: Of a total of 202 attendees, 90 responded to the survey (response rate: 4-4.5%). Seventy-two percent belonged to an academic institute while 28% belonged to non-academic institutes. Eighty-six percent were radiation oncologists and 10% were medical physicists. Eighty-nine percent respondents used high-dose-rate, 14% - pulse-dose-rate, and 13% used low-dose-rate brachytherapy facility. Orthogonal X-rays, computed tomography, and magnetic resonance imaging was used for brachytherapy planning by 56%, 69%, and 14%, respectively. Ninety-three percent of them thought that lack of training is a hurdle in practicing brachytherapy and 92% opined that brachytherapy dedicated meetings can change their perception about brachytherapy. Seventy percent respondents admitted to make some changes in their practice patterns after attending this meeting. Ninety-seven percent of them would like to attend future meetings and 98% felt the need to include live workshops, hands on demonstrations, and video presentations in the scientific programme.
   Conclusions: The survey highlights a positive attitude towards increasing brachytherapy use, and may serve as an important guiding tool in designing teaching and training programmes; thus overcoming the hurdles in successful and widespread use of a quality brachytherapy programme at radiotherapy centers.

AB  - Background: The federal government is promoting adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) through financial incentives for EHR use and implementation support provided by regional extension centers. Small practices have been slow to adopt EHRs.
   Objectives: Our objective was to measure time to EHR implementation and identify factors associated with successful implementation in small practices receiving financial incentives and implementation support. This study is unique in exploiting quantitative implementation time data collected prospectively as part of routine project management.
   Methods: This mixed-methods study includes interviews of key informants and a cohort study of 544 practices that had worked with the Primary Care Information Project (PCIP), a publicly funded organization that since 2007 has subsidized EHRs and provided implementation support similar to that supplied by the new regional extension centers. Data from a project management database were used for a cohort study to assess time to implementation and predictors of implementation success.
   Results: Four hundred and thirty practices (79%) implemented EHRs within the analysis period, with a median project time of 24.7 weeks (95% CI: 23.3 - 26.4). Factors associated with implementation success were: fewer providers, practice sites, and patients; fewer Medicaid and uninsured patients; having previous experience with scheduling software; enrolling in 2010 rather than earlier; and selecting an integrated EHR plus practice management product rather than two products. Interviews identified positive attitude toward EHRs, resources, and centralized leadership as additional practice-level predictors of success.
   Conclusions: A local initiative similar to current federal programs successfully implemented EHRs in primary care practices by offsetting software costs and providing implementation assistance. Nevertheless, implementation success was affected by practice size and other characteristics, suggesting that the federal programs can reduce barriers to EHR implementation but may not eliminate them.

AB  - The access of the general public and of the Romanian students to the use of the computer and the internet has been possible only since the middle of the 90's, research on the topic having no object up to that date. The variety of results obtained by studies conducted on different samples or at different time spans support the usefulness of the research in other cultural contexts than the ones in the Western countries. The current study examines the relationships between computer and internet anxiety, computer self-efficacy and other personal characteristics in a Romanian context. A full mediated model was tested. According to our findings, low computer self-efficacy predicts anxiety, the previous education in the field of computer science has direct negative effects on computer anxiety and on the negative attitudes towards the internet The results show that there are no significant differences between the male and the female participants concerning computer anxiety, self-efficacy and the negative attitudes towards the internet Significant differences between participants enrolled at different education levels and study programs, Science and Humanities, are obtained.

AB  - Understanding the effect of media on disease spread can help improve epidemic forecasting and uncover preventive measures to slow the spread of disease. Most previously introduced models have approximated media effect through disease incidence, making media influence dependent on the size of epidemic. We propose an alternative approach, which relies on real data about disease coverage in the news, allowing us to model low incidence/high interest diseases, such as SARS, Ebola or H1N1. We introduce a network-based model, in which disease is transmitted through local interactions between individuals and the probability of transmission is affected by media coverage. We assume that media attention increases self-protection (e.g. hand washing and compliance with social distancing), which, in turn, decreases disease model. We apply the model to the case of H1N1 transmission in Mexico City in 2009 and show how media influence measured by the time series of the weekly count of news articles published on the outbreak helps to explain the observed transmission dynamics. We show that incorporating the media attention based on the observed media coverage of the outbreak better estimates the disease dynamics from what would be predicted by using media function that approximate the media impact using the number of cases and rate of spread. Finally, we apply the model to a typical influenza season in Washington, DC and estimate how the transmission pattern would have changed given different levels of media coverage.

AB  - BackgroundLesotho has one of the highest rates of tuberculosis (TB) incidence and TB-HIV co-infection in the world. Our study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and associated factors towards TB in the general population of Lesotho.MethodsA cross-sectional analysis from the Lesotho Demographic and Health Survey (LDHS) 2014 was carried out among 9247 respondents. We used the chi-square test as well as univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to assess the associations of socio-demographic variables with respondent knowledge of and attitude towards TB.ResultsThe overall knowledge of TB in the general population of Lesotho was adequate (59.9%). There was a significant difference between female and male respondents regarding knowledge about TB (67.0% vs. 41.8%). Almost 95% of respondents had heard of an illness called tuberculosis, and 80.5% knew that TB can be cured. Only 11.5% knew the correct cause of TB (TB is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis). Female respondents were relatively aware of TB, knew about the correct cause and mode for transmission of TB and knew that TB is a curable disease compared to male respondents. A higher proportion of respondents (72.8%) had a positive attitude towards TB. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.45, 95% CI: 2.10-2.86; p<0.001), age (AOR) =1.76, 95% CI: 1.29-2.41; p<0.001), educational level (AOR=6.26, 95% CI: 3.90-10.06; p<0.001), formerly married or cohabitated (AOR=1.42, 95% CI: 1.10-1.85; p=0.008), mass media exposure (AOR=1.33, 95% CI: 1.08-1.64; p=0.008) and occupation (AOR=1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.44; p=0.049) were strongly associated with respondent knowledge of TB. Sex (AOR=1.19, 95% CI: 1.01-1.41; p=0.034), educational level (AOR=1.661, 95% CI: 06-2.60; p=0.028), mass media exposure (AOR=1.31, 95% CI: 1.06-1.62; p=0.012) and occupation (AOR=1.26, 95% CI: 1.04-1.52; p=0.016) were strongly associated with respondent attitude towards TB.ConclusionStrategies to improve the knowledge of Lesotho's people about TB should focus on males, young residents, those who are illiterate, those who are unmarried and farmers. Special attention should be given to males, young residents, rural residents, those who are illiterate and farmers to improve their attitude towards TB in Lesotho.

AB  - Background Management of the COVID-19 pandemic has been plagued by an online 'infodemic', not least on the topic of vaccine safety. Failure to vaccinate is often addressed with corrective, factually based information. However, this may be overly simplistic. European vaccine hesitancy levels correlate closely with popularity of populist parties while scientific populism refers specifically to populist distrust in scientific expertise. Aims and method Combining an evaluation of risk through the health belief model and the cognitive constructs from the theory of planned behaviour, with the influence of populist statements, anticipated regret, trust, and past healthcare behaviour, an online survey explored the components of vaccine decisions amongst a demographically representative Irish adult sample (N = 1995). Results The regression model accounted for a large proportion of variance amongst the total sample. A primary set of influences suggests a considered risk evaluative decision-making approach while a second tier of weaker influences incorporates a broader set of values beyond cost-benefit analysis. Six ideological subsets were identified through K-means analysis. Segments were differentiated by subjective norms attitudes (particularly around social media), populist political attitudes, self-efficacy, perceptions of COVID-19 severity, and susceptibility to the condition. Conclusions While the 'right thing to do' is clear when viewed through a lens of scientific expert advice, this is precisely the paradigm which populist movement rejects. Segmentations, such as the outputs from this study, validate the importance of proactively engaging with diverse communities both on and offline and afford a framework for developing and evaluating more refined, targeted, policies and interventions.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus disease 19 is a pandemic affecting millions worldwide. Since February 2020, new cases are reported in Saudi Arabia, and regulations have been imposed to control the spread of the disease and raise awareness. This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the Kingdom's residents toward coronavirus disease 19 during the early stages of the pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional study of 2071 participants who were recruited from various cities in Saudi Arabia. An online questionnaire was shared through social media, which contained questions about demographic data, general knowledge of coronavirus disease 19, and participants' attitudes. Results: The mean age of the study population was 34 +/- 12.4 years. Most of the participants agreed that coronavirus disease 19 is a pandemic and is more serious than seasonal influenza. More than 90% believed that handwashing and social distancing are effective in preventing disease transmission. No significant results were observed when comparing the knowledge of high-risk participants and the normal population. More than half of the cohort were strictly compliant with curfew regulations, handwashing, and face mask. Around 80% of the population is following coronavirus disease 19 news and information through official authorities' press releases. Conclusion: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia residents showed decent knowledge of coronavirus disease 19. Nevertheless, some information needs emphasizing and proper education. Frequent communication between healthcare authorities and the public is highly recommended.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic poses unprecedented challenges for healthcare services and has led to changes in the usage pattern of the pediatric population. We aimed to describe the impact of COVID-19 on children's health, wellbeing, and access to medical care in Portugal.
   Material and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study through an anonymous online survey via social media. The collected data refers to a period between the 16th of March and the 17th of May 2020.
   Results: We obtained responses to the survey on 19 745 children. Of the previously scheduled outpatient consultations, 54.2% were postponed by healthcare institutions and 21.6% of planned vaccinations were missed. Parents expressed concerns regarding psychological, social, and physical consequences for their children due to the pandemic.
   Discussion: The observed reduction of pediatric emergency department visits and the postponement of outpatient consultations and vaccine administrations are potentially harmful for non-COVID patients. The current pandemic and the imposed social distance might have an important negative impact on the mental health of children.
   Conclusion: Further studies are necessary to fully comprehend the outcomes of the decreased access to medical care, as well as the collateral damage for children beyond the clinical aspects of the pandemic. Defining strategies regarding the urge to vaccinate children and not postpone urgent evaluations should be a public health priority.

AB  - Social media has become an essential channel for posting disaster-related information, which provides governments and relief agencies real-time data for better disaster management. However, research in this field has not received sufficient attention, and extracting useful information is still challenging. This paper aims to improve disaster relief efficiency via mining and analyzing social media data like public attitudes toward disaster response and public demands for targeted relief supplies during different types of disasters. We focus on different natural disasters based on properties such as types, durations, and damages, which contains a total of 41,993 tweets. In this paper, public perception is assessed qualitatively by manually classified tweets, which contain information like the demand for targeted relief supplies, satisfactions of disaster response, and public fear. Public attitudes to natural disasters are studied via a quantitative analysis using eight machine learning models. To better provide decision-makers with the appropriate model, the comparison of machine learning models based on computational time and prediction accuracy is conducted. The change of public opinion during different natural disasters and the evolution of peoples' behavior of using social media for disaster relief in the face of the identical type of natural disasters as Twitter continues to evolve are studied. The results in this paper demonstrate the feasibility and validation of the proposed research approach and provide relief agencies with insights into better disaster management.

AB  - The mass media has a powerful impact on public attitudes about mental health and psychiatry. The question of identity of psychiatry as a medical profession as well as of the future of psychiatry has been the subject of much controversial discussion. Psychiatry today has the historical opportunity to shape the future of mental health care, medicine and society. It has gained in scientific and professional status by the tremendous increase of knowledge and treatment skills. Psychiatry should build up new transdisciplinary and integrative image of a specialized profession, promote it and make it public. Good public relations are very important for the future of psychiatry.

AB  - Background: Infections affecting the middle ear are a common childhood occurrence. Some cases may present with ear discharge through a tympanic membrane perforation which may heal spontaneously. However, up to 5% or more cases of those affected have persistent ear discharge. A number of barriers contribute towards delayed presentation at health facilities for treatment of ear infections. We conducted a study to evaluate parents' and caregivers' knowledge and care seeking practices for ear infections in children under five in Gasabo district in Kigali, Rwanda.
   Methods: Parents/guardians (n = 810) were interviewed using a structured questionnaire to elicit their knowledge of ear infections in children under five and their attitude to seeking care for their children.
   Results: The mean age of the respondents was 31.27 years (SD = 7.88, range 17-83). Considering an average of knowledge parameters which included causes, symptoms, prevention, treatment and consequences of ear infections, we found that 76.6% (622) of respondents were knowledgeable about ear infections. We defined a positive practice as seeking medical treatment (community health workers or health facility) and this was found in 89.1% (722) respondents. Correlating knowledge with choice of seeking treatment, respondents were 33% less likely to practice medical pluralism (OR = 0.33, CI 0.11-0.97, P = 0.043) if they were familiar with infections. Moreover, urban dweller were 1.7 times more likely to know ear infections compared to rural dwellers (OR = 1.70, CI 1.22-2.38, P = 0.002).
   Conclusion: The majority of respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes and practices about ear infection. However, medical pluralism was common. There is need to improve the community's awareness and access to primary health care facilities for the care of ear infections especially in rural areas of Rwanda.

AB  - Measures implemented to combat the spread of COVID-19 have included stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and self-isolation, all of which have limited in-person interactions. Given the key role of technology in maintaining social connections during this period, the current study examined the experiences of young adults who shifted from predominantly offline to online interaction with friends during COVID-19. Specifically, we investigated whether changing from interacting predominantly with friends in-person to interacting predominantly with friends online (conceptualized as a major change in context of interaction) was associated with lower social well-being (i.e., greater loneliness and lower social connectedness), and examined whether perceived changes in friendship satisfaction as a result of the pandemic mediated these effects. Participants (N = 329; 68.1% female) were Australian young adults, aged between 17 and 25 years (M-age = 20.05 years, SD = 1.97). Data were collected between April 15th and May 24th, 2020, during the nationwide lockdown in Australia. Results indicated that for young adults who primarily interacted offline with friends prior to COVID-19 (as compared to those who interacted predominantly online or equally online and offline before the pandemic), the shift away from face-to-face interactions was associated with a greater perceived reduction in satisfaction with friendships, which, in turn, was associated with greater loneliness and lower social connectedness. Our results highlight the need to consider how young adults adjust to changes in contexts for engaging with friends and how they maintain meaningful social interactions with others during times of extended physical isolation.

KW  - MODEL
AB  - Societal responses crucially shape the course of a pandemic, but are difficult to predict. Mitigation measures such as social distancing are here assumed to minimize a utility function that consists of two conflicting sub-targets, the disease related mortality and the multifaceted consequences of mitigation. The relative weight of the two sub-targets defines the mitigation readiness H, which entails the political, social, and psychological aspects of decision making. The dynamics of social and behavioral mitigation thus follows an adaptive rule, which in turn is mediated by a non-adaptive dynamics of H. This framework for social dynamics is integrated into an epidemiological model and applied to the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Unperturbed simulations accurately reproduce diverse epidemic and mitigation trajectories from 2020 to 2021, reported from 11 European countries, Iran, and 8 US states. High regional variability in the severity and duration of the spring lockdown and in peak mortality rates of the first SARS-CoV-2 wave can be explained by differences in the reconstructed readiness H. A ubiquitous temporal decrease of H has greatly intensified second and third waves and slowed down their decay. The unprecedented skill of the model suggests that the combination of an adaptive and a non-adaptive rule may constitute a more fundamental mode in social dynamics. Its implementation in an epidemic context can produce realistic long-term scenarios relevant for strategic planning, such as on the feasibility of a zero-infection target or on the evolutionary arms race between mutations of SARS-CoV-2 and social responses.

AB  - On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic. Hospitals throughout the USA and the residency programs housed therein have drastically altered their standard operations to slow the spread of disease. Maintaining the educational mission of a residency program within the parameters of social distancing mandates is an unprecedented challenge to graduate medical education and will remain so for the near future. We evaluated resident perception of our efforts to transition educational activities within the residency to an online, remote format utilizing Microsoft SharePoint. Educational conferences were transitioned to a videoconferencing platform on March 13, 2020 in conjunction with the deployment of an intradepartmental Microsoft SharePoint site to provide educational resources, disseminate scheduling changes, and provide wellness resources in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. An 11-question survey available from 4 Jan 2020-4 Jun 2020 surveyed resident perceptions of the instituted changes. Twenty-six of 31 residents (83.8%) responded to the resident survey invitation. Twenty-four of 26 residents (92.3%) characterized the SharePoint as useful. Twenty of 26 residents (76.9%) desired attending guidance as to how to utilize the online resources for each resident rotation. A total of 92.3% (24/26) of residents felt that the program's response utilizing SharePoint engendered a greater sense of belonging to their work community. Resident perception of the transition to online learning utilizing Microsoft SharePoint as a distribution platform was generally positive, helping to mitigate untoward educational consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The last few decades have seen growing concerns among parents regarding the safety of childhood vaccines, arguably leading to the rise of the anti-vaccine movement. This study is an effort to understand situational and cross-situational factors that influence individuals' negative attitudes toward vaccines, referred to as vaccine negativity. In doing so, this study elucidated how situational and cross-situational factors influence vaccine negativity. Specifically, this study tested how knowledge deficiency, or acceptance of scientifically inaccurate data about vaccines, and institutional trust influenced negative attitudes toward vaccines. Using the situational theory of problem solving as the theoretical framework, this study also identified and tested a knowledge-attitude-motivation-behavior framework of vaccine negative individuals' cognitions and behaviors about the issue.

AB  - Background: Many aspects of the Covid-19 pandemic may make living with or recovery from an eating disorder (ED) particularly challenging. Understanding the processes which underlie the psychological and behavioral responses of people with EDs during this time are key to ensure tailored support in these unprecedented circumstances.
   Methods: People with lifetime EDs (n = 32) were recruited through social media from May to June 2020 during a period of strict infection control measures in the United Kingdom (i.e., "lockdown," "social distancing"). They completed open-ended questions in an online anonymous questionnaire that invited them to reflect on how various aspects of their lives have been affected by the Covid-19 pandemic, including ED symptoms and coping strategies. Responses were analyzed using thematic analysis.
   Results: Most respondents reported that their ED worsened or resurfaced. Isolation, low mood, anxiety, lack of structure, disruption to routines, and media/social media messages around weight and exercise seemed to contribute to this. There was a clear sense that individuals struggled with which aspects of psychological distress to prioritize, i.e., mood vs. ED cognitions and behaviors, particularly as attempts to cope with one often exacerbated the other. Nonetheless, some participants reported "silver linings" of the pandemic.
   Conclusions: In this self-selected sample, deterioration or recurrence of ED symptoms were the norm. This has implications for the provision of treatment and care for people with EDs both in the immediate short-term and in potential future waves of the pandemic, with a significant surge of new and re-referrals expected.

AB  - Nature conservation can only be an efficient process if involving different society actors, especially those that have long-term and multiplying effects on how society relates with nature, such as children/students. To delineate nature conservation strategies, we need to understand the drivers that shape peoples' behaviors and attitudes towards nature; for students this is mostly determined by their past experience and influence of their socio-economic and familiar context. To test these assumptions, we develop a study focused on elementary school students from Portugal and Brazil. In each country we selected two student's groups representing two distinct socio-environmental contexts: rural and urban populations. Based on a written questionnaire, we aimed at understanding the effect of parental and socio-environmental contexts, gender, prior contact with nature and online news-associated environmental information, on how students prioritize taxa to be conserved. Furthermore, we analyzed how health, economic and touristic values constrain pro-conservation attitudes. Students from urban areas and from Portugal showed a lower probability of having a pro-conservation attitude. Brazilian and rural students may have a more frequent contact with nature and live in regions of higher biodiversity, two factors that may act synergistically to produce those patterns. Positive attitudes towards conservation seem to be over-ruled by health (i.e. self-preservation) and economical (i.e. financial subsistence) interests and values. Moreover, students prioritize for conservation species that are commonly mentioned in the online news, particularly mammals, and plants. Acknowledging that students rank higher health and economical values over conservation ones, as well as the perceptible importance of contacting with nature and the apparent relevance of online news as information vehicles, may increase the chances of improving the efficacy of nature conservation strategies. Furthermore, this information can lead to an improvement of environmental awareness and literacy.

TI  - Ear Talk Project: Participatory co-composition on YouTube and the Web
T2  - ORGANISED SOUND
LA  - English
AB  - In this article, we present Ear Talk - a co-composition and live performance project that enables remote music collaboration through technologically mediated systems. The Ear Talk project currently exists in two distinct implementations, one that repurposes YouTube's live-streaming technology, and one that utilises a stand-alone website. Although Ear Talk was conceived prior to the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, the necessity for remote collaboration became more apparent during the lockdown, when a vast majority of live events and music concerts were cancelled. The Ear Talk project enables a socially distanced form of online musical collaboration and offers a platform through which to respond to such a crisis, and has grown to be adopted and presented by many different performing groups across the world. In addition to describing the technical implementations of these two systems, we discuss issues that arise from our participatory practice: from musical quality concerns in regard to social aesthetics and artistic ingenuity, to accessibility concerns when designing technologically mediated collaborative systems. Ear Talk embraces continuous musical loops as well as highly asynchronous (i.e., perpetual) collaborative paradigms among remote participants, which raises a conceptual inquiry as to which part of its sonic and social experience constitutes music in the end. Finally, we evaluate performer-audience relationships (i.e., hierarchical versus horizontal interactions) and the efficacy of the Ear Talk systems at enabling socially engaged co-composition.

AB  - Youths living in crowded impoverished urban areas face higher risk of infection by SARS-CoV-2. This article presents lessons learned from a preventive intervention project intersected by the COVID-19 crisis that moved from a mix-methods study design to online ethnography. The 'home-officed' research team e-witnessed high-school students' daily lives and collaborated in youths' and community-based organisations' responses in the territories where they study and live. Psychosocial distress increased, also driven by the disastrous governmental response to the health and economic crises. There was growing anxiety about meeting friends and dating, with structural limits for sustaining the recommended social distancing, which added to gender/sexuality-based violence. Simultaneously, we observed students becoming relevant actors through co-producing preventive practices, surpassing risk-group notions and combining SARS-CoV-2 prevention with sexuality, gender, racism and mental-health issues. They managed internet-mediated applications to promote critical thinking and collective actions aimed at health promotion among their peers, from their homes. Freire's concept of 'untested-feasibility' fostered researchers', students' and community leaders' imaginations in the face of this unprecedented crisis, thereby enhancing social responses to the epidemic to become rights-based comprehensive dialogical preventive activities. This ongoing intervention-research stresses how prevention sciences can go beyond reduction of this pandemic to a viral event.

AB  - Background:
   The demographic characteristics and transmission dynamics of the community-acquired coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in Taiwan were analyzed for more effective control and prevention of the community transmission of this novel disease.
   Methods:
   Open-access data and press releases on COVID-19 in Taiwan were collected on the website of the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control. All 55 community-acquired cases of COVID-19 confirmed from January 28 to April 12, 2020, in Taiwan were included. Basic demographic characteristics, symptom presentation, infection source, route of identification, and transmission dynamics were analyzed.
   Results:
   Of the 55 cases, 52.7% were female and 74.5% were between 20-59 years of age. One-sixth (16.4%) of community-acquired cases were asymptomatic. More than half (58.2%) of the cases were identified via contact tracing. The median incubation period was 6 days (range 1-13 d) and the median serial interval was 4 days (range -3-24 d). Twenty-six cases (47.3%) were transmitted from presymptomatic cases, 11 cases (20%) from symptomatic cases, and 2 cases (3.6%) from an asymptomatic case. The contagious period of symptomatic cases was from 7 days before to 15 days after the onset of symptoms.
   Conclusion:
   The high proportion of asymptomatic cases and the transmissibility in the presymptomatic and asymptomatic periods make control of COVID-19 challenging. Protective measures such as social distancing, wearing face masks, and hand washing are mandatory to prevent community transmission.

AB  - This research aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes and preventive behaviors (KAP) of adults in relation to dengue vector control measures in the communities of Vientiane, the capital of the Lao PDR. A total of 207 respondents were actively participating in this cross-sectional descriptive study in 2011. Representatives of households were interviewed face-to-face by six trained interviewers using a structured questionnaire. KAP reliabilities of 0.89, 0.91 and 0.95 were reported in the pilot sample of 30 cases. The associations between each independent variable and prevention behavior were tested with chi-square tests. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the factors that were significantly associated with preventive behavior while controlling for the other variables. The results revealed that 51.69% of the respondents had a high level of knowledge. More than 94% of the respondents knew that dengue fever is a dangerous communicable disease and that dengue fever is transmitted from person to person via mosquitoes. More than half (56.52%) of the participants had positive attitudes toward vector control measures, and 52.17% exhibited a high level of preventive behavior in terms of dengue vector control measures. Preventive behaviors were significantly associated with information provided from sources that included health personnel (p = 0.038) and heads of villages (p = 0.031) and with knowledge levels (p < 0.001). This study suggests that proactive health education through appropriated mass media and community clean-up campaigns should strengthen and encourage community participation, particularly in terms of addressing mosquito larvae in overlooked places, such as the participants' own homes, for example, in flower vases and ant traps.

AB  - Companies pay close attention to how consumers react on social media to their products or services. Our work focuses on the identification of Consumer Cynicism, defined as a negative attitude that can have a broad or specific focus and comprises cognitive, affective, and behavioral components. We create a corpus of 619 Spanish-language comments on YouTube car reviews, annotated for four cynicism constructs: Dissatisfaction, Alienation, Skepticism, and Hostility. We compare different classification formulations (binary vs. multi-label) and different pre-trained models (Spanish BETO vs. multilingual BERT). We find binary classifiers derived from BETO consistently outperform multi-label classifiers and classifiers derived from BERT. Our best models achieve F1 of 0.83 for Dissatisfaction, 0.77 for Hostility, 0.71 for Skepticism and 0.70 for Alienation.

AB  - This study employed digital footprints to explore why people engage in genetically modified (GM) food rumormongering on Chinese social media, Sina Weibo at both the group level and individual level. 9070 posts about GM food were obtained from 1 million users. Social network analysis was used to analyze the effect of peer influence on GM food rumormongering at the group level, and we did not find any effect that users would depend on their friendship network on social media to spread GM food rumors. To determine the effect of social media extravert, reputation and attitude on scientific rumormongering at the individual level, we used logistic regression. Results revealed that people who hold negative attitudes towards GM food and who are social media extraverts are more likely to spread rumors, while social reputation did not influence the spread of rumors.

AB  - Background: Ultrasound is the frontline diagnostic tool of choice for perinatal care. It is usually provided in ideal settings by experts. Objectives: The objective of this study is to determine the knowledge, perception, and attitude of health-care professionals toward obstetric ultrasound in internally displaced persons (IDPs) camps in Maiduguri, Borno state, North-east Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A prospective survey was conducted in three selected IDPs camps in Maiduguri from January to May 2017. Healthcare personnel from the antenatal clinics of the selected IDPs camps were enrolled in the study. A 26-item structured questionnaire was used to elicit responses on demography, knowledge, perception, and attitude. Data collected were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 21 and descriptive statistics were generated for the data. Results: Out of the fifty questionnaires distributed, forty-five were filled and returned appropriately; given a returned rate of 90.0%. The respondents consisted of community health extension worker (37.8%, n = 17), nurses (24.4%, n = 11), midwives (24.4%, n = 11), and doctors (13.3%, n = 6). Respondents had average knowledge about obstetric ultrasound (59%); however, their levels of perception and attitude toward obstetric ultrasound were high, 84% and 69%, respectively. Nevertheless, 31.1% of the respondents believed ultrasound to be harmful to the baby, 3.8% believed it can lead to cancer or can be painful, and 2.2% felt that there is no need for ultrasound scan during pregnancy. Doctors had the highest level of knowledge, right perception, and positive attitude toward obstetric ultrasound (100%). Conclusion: A good number of the respondents had the right perception and attitude toward obstetric ultrasound, but generally most respondents had inadequate knowledge.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is affecting families and children worldwide. Experiencing the pandemic leads to stress in families resulting from fear of infection and social isolation derived from social distancing. For families raising preschoolers, the prolonged closure of childcare centers puts additional childcare burden on family members, especially mothers. Due to the limited research exploring the impact of COVID-19 on preschool children's problem behaviors, this study examines the association between stress due to COVID-19 and preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors related to mother's depression and parenting behavior. The study sample included data collected from 316 South Korean mothers raising preschool-aged children aged 3 to 5. The study findings suggest that mother's COVID-19 stress was indirectly associated with preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors resulting from the mother's depression and parenting behaviors, although the direct effect of COVID-19 stress on preschool children's outcomes was not statistically significant. Increase in mother's COVID-19 stress was associated with increase in depression, and sequentially decreased positive parenting behaviors, which in turn resulted in preschool children's internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors. The study findings highlight the need to focus on enhancing mental health of mothers and preschool children's adjustment by implementing supportive interventions to reduce the adverse impacts of the prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The advantages provided by the drones with regards to three dimensional mobility and ease of deployment makes them a viable candidate for 5G and beyond (B5G) networks. Significant amount of research has been conducted on the aspect of networking for using drones as base stations to provide different services. In this work, we deviate from the traditional use of drones to provide connectivity and explore the delivery of products through drones in the context of maintaining social distancing. However, drone delivery process for critical applications such as delivering medical supplies is vulnerable to attacks such as impersonation attacks. The security of drone operation is important to save the users from any breaches that can lead to financial and physical losses. To cope with these security issues and to make the delivery process transparent, we propose a blockchain-based drone delivery system that registers and authenticates the participating entities including products (medical supplies), warehouse (medical centers) and drones. To this end, we utilize Ethereum platform for implementation of blockchain and smart contract and we present an analysis of different factors that influence the authentication process in terms of time and the number of transactions. Furthermore, to make the communication of a drone with command and control center more secure and robust, we use machine learning (ML)-based intrusion detection system.

TI  - Community knowledge, perceptions and attitudes regarding leprosy in rural Cameroon: The case of Ekondotiti and Mbonge health districts in the South-west Region
T2  - PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Although leprosy is one of the oldest diseases known to humanity, it remains largely misunderstood. Misconceptions about leprosy lead to stigma towards people with the disease. This study aimed at exploring the knowledge, perceptions and attitudes regarding leprosy in rural Cameroon.
   Methods
   We carried out a cross-sectional community survey of 233 respondents aged 15-75 years, free from leprosy, and living in two rural health districts of the South-west Region of Cameroon. A questionnaire designed to evaluate knowledge, perceptions and attitudes about leprosy was used. Binary logistic regression was used to determine independent predictors of negative attitudes.
   Results
   About 82% of respondents had heard about, and 64.4% knew someone with leprosy. Information on leprosy was mainly from community volunteers (40.6%), friends (38.0%), and the media (24%). Only 19.7% of respondents knew the cause of leprosy, and a considerable proportion linked it to a spell (25.3%), unclean blood (15.5%) and heredity (14.6%). About 72% knew that leprosy is curable and 86.3% would advise medical treatment. Attitudes towards leprosy patients were generally negative. Only 42% would shake hands, 32.6% would share the same plate, and 28.3% and 27% respectively, would allow their child to play or marry a person with leprosy. Furthermore, only 33.9% approved of participation of leprosy patients, and 42.9% of their employment. Independent predictors of negative attitudes were: the belief that leprosy is a curse; is caused by a germ; and having seen a leprosy patient. The negative attitudes were dampened by: the beliefs that leprosy is a punishment, is hereditary and is due to poor personal hygiene.
   Conclusion
   An awareness intervention using community volunteers and the media, with information on the cause of leprosy, its clinical manifestations and curability, and sensitization messages correcting the misconceptions and beliefs regarding leprosy, could improve the community knowledge and attitudes towards leprosy. This would ultimately contribute to the reduction of leprosy burden in the community.

AB  - Purpose: Limited information is available about the current practices of generalist speechlanguage pathologists (SLPs) in relation to their management of childhood apraxia of speech (CAS). This study was designed to investigate four primary questions separately for the US and Canada; 1. What treatment approaches are used by SLP clinicians to treat CAS? 2. What treatment format and intensity are used to deliver CAS treatment? 3. What are the attitudes and perspectives of SLPs to evidence-based practice (EBP) as it pertains to CAS treatment? and 4. What are the perceived barriers to the implementation of EBP in CAS treatment?
   Method: An online questionnaire was used to investigate the four primary research questions. The questionnaire was distributed online through social media, some state-based associations and through forums affiliated with national speech-language-hearing associations.
   Results: Most survey respondents reported frequently using an eclectic approach to treat CAS (US 85%; Canada 89%). Although no intervention emerged as the most preferred primary treatment for CAS, US-based clinicians more commonly reported using the Kaufman Speech to Language Protocol (K-SLP) (33%) and Dynamic, Temporal and Tactile Cueing (DTTC) (28%); while clinicians in Canada used PROMPT (R) (31%). SLPs demonstrated a positive attitude towards EBP however, they identified a range of perceived barriers that impacted their implementation of EBP.
   Conclusion: SLPs in the US and Canada frequently used an eclectic approach to treat CAS which is consistent with previous findings both in the CAS literature and the wider speech disorders literature. The more commonly used primary interventions were the K-SLP and DTTC (US); and PROMPT (R) (Canada), with one of the strongest factors that influenced clinicians' choice of intervention being familiarity with the treatment approach. Face to face therapy was preferred by clinicians across both countries, with clinicians in the US providing therapy between 2-5 times per week, while those in Canada delivered therapy up to once per week. Clinicians identified a number of barriers to implementing evidence-based practice, among which, being time poor was most commonly selected across clinicians in both the US and Canada.

KW  - PROFESSIONAL-DEVELOPMENT
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Background: The pharmacy profession has changed enormously in the recent decades. Pharmacist role has been expanded beyond formulating and dispensing medications to include the provision of pharmaceutical care and public health services to patients. Patient-centred care requires sustained competency through improving pharmacist's knowledge, skills, and performance. Such improvements require pharmacist's involvement in continuing education activities although it is optional in Kuwait.
   Objective: To explore pharmacists' attitudes towards continuing education in Kuwait, and to investigate the perceived barriers that hinder pharmacists from being involved in continuing education activities.
   Setting.
   All governmental hospitals and polyclinics and private pharmacies in all the five health regions of Kuwait (Capital, Hawalli, Ahmadai, Farwaniyah, and Jahra).
   Method: A descriptive cross-sectional study conducted with full licensed pharmacists working in Kuwait. Pharmacists were asked to complete an adapted validated questionnaire composed of 14 items to measure their attitudes towards continuing education. In addition, it contains open-ended questions to obtain the type of learning activity undertaken by the pharmacists, and whether they have barriers that hinder them from being involved in continuing education.
   Results: A total of 409 pharmacists completed the questionnaire. The participants had a median score of 44 (interquartile range = 41-47); good to excellent attitudes. Attitude scores were correlated with age and years of experience. Almost 70% of the participants had attended a continuing education activity within one year. The activity undertaken most by pharmacists was attending a seminar, compared to other activities. The main barriers to continuing education were lack of personal time (n = 383), lack of scientific databases and books (n = 187) and conferences are not regularly organized locally (n = 154).
   Conclusion: Pharmacists in Kuwait have positive attitudes towards continuing education overall. However, there are many obstacles that avert pharmacists to practice continuing education. Further studies are required to explore how to overcome the reported barriers and provide more feasible and relevant continuing education to pharmacists. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Lung cancer (LC) patients experience high symptom burden and significant decline of physical fitness and quality of life following lung resection. Good quality of survivorship care post-surgery is essential to optimize recovery and prevent unscheduled healthcare use. The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can improve post-surgery care, as it enables frequent monitoring of health status in daily life, provides timely and personalized feedback to patients and professionals, and improves accessibility to rehabilitation programs. Despite its promises, implementation of telehealthcare applications is challenging, often hampered by non-acceptance of the developed service by its end-users. A promising approach is to involve the end-users early and continuously during the developmental process through a so-called user-centred design approach. The aim of this article is to report on this process of co-creation and evaluation of a multimodal ICT-supported cancer rehabilitation program with and for lung cancer patients treated with lung resection and their healthcare professionals (HCPs).
   Methods: A user-centered design approach was used. Through semi-structured interviews (n = 10 LC patients and 6 HCPs), focus groups (n = 5 HCPs), and scenarios (n = 5 HCPs), user needs and requirements were elicited. Semi-structured interviews and the System Usability Scale (SUS) were used to evaluate usability of the telehealthcare application with 7 LC patients and 10 HCPs.
   Results: The developed application consists of: 1) self-monitoring of symptoms and physical activity using on-body sensors and a smartphone, and 2) a web based physical exercise program. 71 % of LC patients and 78 % of HCPs were willing to use the application as part of lung cancer treatment. Accessibility of data via electronic patient records was essential for HCPs. LC patients regarded a positive attitude of the HCP towards the application essential. Overall, the usability (SUS median score = 70, range 35-95) was rated acceptable.
   Conclusions: A telehealthcare application that facilitates symptom monitoring and physical fitness training is considered a useful tool to further improve recovery following surgery of resected lung cancer (LC) patients. Involvement of end users in the design process appears to be necessary to optimize chances of adoption, compliance and implementation of telemedicine.

AB  - The arrival of the coronavirus pandemic in (West) Africa announced a health crisis that required increasing levels of care, on the physical as well as on the emotional level. At the same time, societies had to respect social distancing rules that impeded regular care relationships. This article analysed social media as one means for West African-diasporic actors to practice care in this situation of physical immobility. It is based on a critical discourse analysis of postings on Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and WhatsApp. This analysis showed that West African-diasporic actors used social media to perform emotional practices of care through informing on COVID-19-related issues, raising awareness and encouraging compliance with anti-COVID-19 measures. In addition, these practices of care unveil negotiations of sociopolitical power relations that oscillate between opportunities for solidarity and sociopolitical change, on the one hand, and intersectional exclusions, on the other hand.

AB  - This study examined the influence of political ideology and perceptions of benefits and risks upon State Forest recreationists' support and opposition towards shale natural gas energy development (SGD) on public and private lands in Pennsylvania. Much of the ongoing and proposed Pennsylvania SGD infrastructure is either within or adjacent to public lands, waters, and protected areas, raising concerns about the potential environmental and social impacts upon recreation stakeholders. On-site face-to-face survey interviews were used to gather data from Pennsylvania State Forest recreationists from June to September of 2018 (n = 392). The predominantly local, educated, experienced, and politically moderate sample in this study demonstrated relatively low levels of support towards SGD on Pennsylvania public lands and relatively neutral stances towards support for SGD on private lands in Pennsylvania. Structural equation modeling results suggested that political ideology and perceptions of risks were significant predictors of support for SGD on both public and private lands in Pennsylvania. The relationship between political ideology and support for SGD on public and private lands was also partially mediated through the perceived risk of SGD in the model. Study findings contributed to previous research suggesting political attitudes may influence and supersede other factors when predicting support for SGD. A series of one-way analyses of variance further explored differences by political ideology in this study. In each of these analyses, a similar statistical trend prevailed. Those identifying themselves as conservative were significantly more likely than their moderate and liberal counterparts to support SGD on both public and private lands in Pennsylvania and perceive fewer risks from SGD on Pennsylvania State Forests. This research lent itself to the theory of landscape fit and construal level theory as State Forest recreationists may have perceived the 'fit' of SGD negatively and could have construed SGD abstractly, lending themselves to political ideology. From a policy and management standpoint, study findings highlight the importance of assessing and communicating State Forest recreationists' perceptions and subsequent opinions when planning, developing, and managing SGD and related decisions in the United States.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes towards individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) have been consistently reported within the general population, as well as among health professionals and medical students. Objectives: To explore attitudes towards SUDs held by students in the social sciences, the future-to-be mental health professionals, as well as factors, which may affect these attitudes. Methods: Undergraduate and graduate students in the social sciences (psychology, social work, criminology; N = 184), were presented a vignette describing an individual with substance-related problems. Participants were randomly assigned with one of two vignettes, either addressing him as "suffering from substance use disorder" or as an "addict." Attitudes were assessed by exploring the degree to which participants perceive the described individual as posing social threat and in need of treatment. Results: Women generally perceived individuals with SUDs as in more need for treatment compared to men. Men, but not women, were significantly affected by the terminology used, with less negative attitudes reported when using medical terminology. Conclusion: Gender differences in attitudes towards individuals with SUDs may be present in earlier stages of mental health professionals' career. More emphasis should be given on the use of non-stigmatizing terminology among students in the social sciences, particularly men.

AB  - This article sheds light on how adults in Barcelona (ES), Groningen (NL), and Milan (IT) utilized WhatsApp to compensate for the lack of face-to-face interactions and to fight social isolation during the first 2 months of the COVID- I 9 lockdown. We argue that practices of WhatsApp usage have multiplied and diversified experiences of co-presence at distance and made group socialities even more important than before. Building on the concepts of "scalable socialities" and "polymedia," the article formulates the concept of "scalable co-presence" to account for ways in which WhatsApp has enabled multiple experiences of proximity to others across different scales of sociality, from one-to-one to large groups interactions. In this article, we also argue that the concept of "scalable co-presence" is relevant to bring the study of mediated co-presence out of media and migration studies into the broader field of media and cultural studies. With reduction in mobility, increased social distancing, and ubiquitous connectivity, the role of communication technologies in mediating proximity at distance has become crucial for many more people around the world outside the context of transnational migration. The concept is also relevant to acknowledge the increased importance of mediated group interactions and communications in (post)-pandemic digital societies.

Algorithmic and qualitative textual analysis techniques are combined to uncover the ideologies and interests that structure the discourse and shape its outcome. The analysis reveals that U.S. media, irrespective of their perceived liberal or conservative orientation, treat users' online privacy as subservient to the business interests of technology companiesin line with the country's lax legal approach. The coverage is more diverse in Britain, where the legal concept of privacy is also more stringent.

AB  - Abortion is seen as a violation of a woman's presumed role of being a mother. As the female population grows diverse, women are acting in multiple social roles outside traditional motherhood. Whether this development will challenge social perceptions of women and further affect public attitudes toward abortion remains less known. Based on the Stereotype Content Model (SCM), this study found both stereotypical and attributional factors influenced attitudes toward abortion. Female and male perceivers differed in terms of compassion as an emotional mediator of attitudes. The study provides empirical evidence and theoretical implications that explains the stereotypical processing toward women with abortion.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) virus is spreading rapidly, and there are obvious concerns for the immunocompromised patient population including transplant recipients. Creating awareness and understanding patient concerns will play an important role in protecting this vulnerable group in developing timely and appropriate healthcare interventions. Methods: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted between 23rd March 2020 and 1st April 2020 among 154 liver transplant recipients, transplanted between October 2018 and February 2020. An 18-point questionnaire explored their knowledge of COVID-19, awareness of recipient's high-risk status, interventions to minimize cross-infections, and concerns of this patient group regarding the pandemic. Results: There were 112 (73%) respondents, with median age of 53 years (81% males). There was no difference in demographics between those who responded (n = 112) and those who did not respond to the survey (n = 42). Most of the recipients were aware of the main symptoms of COVID-19, such as fever (92%), breathlessness (86%), and dry cough (87%), but less than half were aware of diarrhea (39%) as a symptom. Awareness about spread from asymptomatic individuals was limited (26%). Majority (95%) understood their high-risk status, but worryingly, 23% of the respondents felt that there was no risk in visiting the hospital for routine clinic visit and blood tests. Concerns were raised by the recipients mostly regarding the uncertainties of COVID-19 infection and its treatment options, the quality of information on social messaging platforms, and lack of access to routine tests/immunosuppression levels because of lockdown/social distancing. Conclusions: Our liver transplant recipients have a reasonable awareness regarding COVID-19. Problems in accessing the healthcare system during prolonged periods of lockdown was a major concern. It is important for each transplant unit to educate, support, and remain accessible to this vulnerable patient cohort as the pandemic continues to progress worldwide.

AB  - Background Positive breastfeeding experiences positively influence subsequent attitudes towards breastfeeding, and increase mothers' confidence, self-efficacy, motivation and intention to breastfeed. However, the strategies that mothers find useful and effective for creating positive breastfeeding experiences remain largely unknown. The aim of our study was thus to describe experience-based knowledge from mothers about strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences. Methods The study followed a qualitative design involving the critical incident technique. Data were collected with an online survey containing open-ended questions that was administered to a Sweden-based parenting group on Facebook in September 2018. Ultimately, 340 incidents from 176 women were identified as offering strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences. Data from the written replies were extracted as textual units, condensed and categorised until categories were mutually exclusive, which resulted in six categories. Results Participating women were on average 31.2 years old and the median number of children per participant was two. Mothers' strategies for creating positive breastfeeding experiences generally included being calm and accepting that initiating breastfeeding takes time and can be difficult initially. Participants described feeling close to the baby by maintaining skin-to-skin contact and being present in the moment by taking time to appreciate the child and the breastfeeding situation, and temporarily forgetting about the world and simply being with the child in the here and now. Participants advocated baby-led breastfeeding and following correct techniques. They also described the importance of keeping an effortless mindset about breastfeeding to prevent perceiving breastfeeding as a compulsion. Mothers described acquiring knowledge about breastfeeding so that they could be prepared if breastfeeding problems occurred and getting support from professionals and family was described as significant for having a positive breastfeeding experience. Caring for oneself and one's body, with aids if necessary, were described as important strategies, as were having a positive attitude and a strong desire to breastfeed. Conclusion Because positive breastfeeding experiences and support are predictors of future breastfeeding initiation and duration, assisting women in creating positive breastfeeding experiences is important. Asking mothers to formulate strategies that they find useful could facilitate breastfeeding by making their approaches more conscious and visible.

AB  - Background: Social media provides people with easy ways to communicate their attitudes and feelings to a wide audience. Many people, unfortunately, have negative associations and feelings about dental treatment due to former painful experiences. Previous research indicates that there might be a pervasive and negative occupational stereotype related to dentists and that this stereotype is expressed in many different venues, including movies and literature.
   Objective: This study investigates the language used in relation to dentists and medical doctors on the social media platform Twitter. The purpose is to compare the professions in terms of the use of emotional and pain-related words, which might underlie and reflect the pervasive negative stereotype identified in relation to dentists. We hypothesized that (A) tweets about dentists will have more negative emotion-related words than those about medical doctors and (B) pain-related words occur more frequently in tweets about dentists than in those about medical doctors.
   Methods: Twitter content ("tweets") about dentists and medical doctors was collected using the Twitter application program interface 140Dev over a 4-week period in 2015, scanning the search terms "dentist" and "doctor". Word content of the selected tweets was analyzed using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count software. The research hypotheses were investigated using nonparametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.
   Results: Over 2.3 million tweets were collected in total, of which about one-third contained the word "dentist" and about two-thirds contained the word "doctor." Hypothesis A was supported since a higher proportion of negative words was used in tweets about dentists than in those about medical doctors (z=-10.47; P<.001). Similarly, tests showed a difference in the proportions of anger words (z=-12.54; P<.001), anxiety words (z=-6.96; P<.001), and sadness words (z=-9.58; P<.001), with higher proportions of these words in tweets about dentists than in those about doctors. Also, Hypothesis B was supported since a higher proportion of pain-related words was used in tweets about dentists than in those about doctors (z=-8.02; P<.001).
   Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that stereotypes regarding dentists and dental treatment are spread through social media such as Twitter and that social media also might represent an avenue for improving messaging and disseminating more positive attitudes toward dentists and dental treatment.

KW  - TAXONOMY
AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, public health communication campaigns have been targeted at reducing viral transmission, specifically among populations most vulnerable to infection and death from the virus (e.g. older adults). However, other individuals who have not been defined as vulnerable populations may also suffer from a decrease in health because of the measures aimed at reducing viral transmission, such as social distancing. To illuminate this issue, we investigate the role of social and media resources in complementing limited offline communication and supporting mental and physical health during this pandemic. We then suggest an alternative audience segmentation strategy based on social and media resources for public health interventions. Based on online survey data from 723 adults in South Korea, the regression analysis results indicated that individuals with lower levels of social resources suffered more during the pandemic. The cluster analysis results revealed that, contrary to the traditional definition of vulnerable populations, a cluster of younger people were unhealthier than a cluster of older people because of a lack of social resources. Clusters with different levels of ICT skills and uses for health-related activities also experienced the pandemic differently. These findings imply public health interventions should focus on social resources beyond the demographic factors to determine target audiences, and that they should take advantage of the target audiences' media resources to encourage them to forge intimate connections with others and to engage in health-related activities.

AB  - Purpose During the COVID-19 pandemic, government risk communication to the public was among the critical works, as the governments had to fight two enemies at once: the pandemic itself and the infodemic surrounding the COVID-19. Government risk communication could provide the public with prompt and accurate information as well as eliminate fake news, rumors and misinformation, thereby raising the public's knowledge and risk perception and, thus, shaping their compliance with the government's advices and directives. The purpose of this paper is to examine the effects of government risk communication through mass media on the public's knowledge, risk perception and compliance with safety measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The ordinary least square and probit regression models were used for analyzing data collected from citizens living in Vietnam during the COVID-19 social distancing. Findings The results of this paper show that government risk communication enhances the public's knowledge of the COVID-19 and raises their risk perception of the virus. In addition, government risk communication is found to shape the public's compliance with most safety measures. Practical implications This paper offers practical implications for containing a pandemic (especially in the context that vaccines are unavailable or insufficient) by emphasizing the role of government risk communication. Originality/value This paper is among the first attempts that examine the role of government risk communication through mass media in enhancing the public's knowledge, their risk perception and their compliance with safety measures during a pandemic.

AB  - Negative attitudes of non-Singaporeans towards Singapore Colloquial English (SCE) are often used to support the "Speak Good English Movement" in Singapore. This article examines spontaneous metalinguistic discourse about SCE in an online Facebook group where Taiwanese migrants in Singapore gather for mutual support. Based on the idea that metalinguistic discourse is mediated through the social relation between interlocutors, this study reveals how the language ideologies surfacing in the investigated online space are formed through stance-taking processes between people sharing a nationality. We argue that this spatial context elicits and escalates negative ideologies of SCE, which are situated in popular hierarchies of varieties of English, and also hierarchies of Mandarin.

AB  - This paper discusses the results of a research' that integrates Digital Interactive Storytelling (DIST), competence-oriented mathematical activities, and argumentation called DIST-M. The general aim is to support a reflective knowledge of mathematical concepts by implementing a digital educational device based on collaborative and dialogical activities proposed by researchers. Within a dialogical dimension of interactions (Bakhtin, 1981), argumentative practice is considered a social activity, where the acquisition and elaboration of new knowledge take place within a social space with multiple interlocutors in a dynamic process. The participants are engaged in constructing and negotiating mathematical meanings within a specific context. This dialogical approach to argumentation tends to create an authentic argumentative culture that is a system of implicit and explicit rules where the exchanges and interactions among participants require a joint elaboration of new meanings, within a given mathematical context, through a dialogical exchange. Learning and development result from a dialogical negotiation process during which new knowledge is developed and those already possessed are re-organized and systematized (Bakhtin, 1981; Vygotskij, 1978). In the current pandemic circumstances, technologies are the main tools to uphold the educational processes. Despite the fact that the DIST-M was implemented and tested before the Covid-19 era, its epistemic bases of dialogism mediated by technology could significantly keep alive the dialogic interaction in educational settings that have been heavily affected by the social distancing and promote mathematical thinking. The articles focus on the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal n. 4," Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all."

AB  - Purpose: Online health information (OHI) and social media have become prominent health resources for people with arthritis-related fatigue. More research is needed to understand how OHI and online social support may influence illness experiences and patient-practitioner relationships in people with arthritis-related fatigue. The present study aimed to explore how OHI and social media shape these experiences by using an inductive qualitative analysis.
   Method: Seven focus groups were conducted with 21 participants aged 28-77 diagnosed with a range of rheumatic diseases. Within the focus groups, participants were asked questions about OHI, online social support and the role of OHI in their health care. The focus groups were recorded, transcribed and analysed using a combination of interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) and thematic analysis.
   Results: The analysis resulted in three themes: (a) how online social support changes illness experiences, (b) communicating fatigue to health professionals using OHI and (c) health care experiences online. These themes provide insight into the ways people with arthritis-related fatigue benefit from online social support, use OHI to support communication with health professionals and how they share health care for arthritis in online spaces.
   Conclusion: This research expanded on previous literature addressing the role of OHI and social media in the illness experience of arthritis-related fatigue. As technology use is increasing, particularly in the current extraordinary environment of social distancing, it is critical to address the role of OHI and social media in health care. In this study, OHI and social media played a prevalent role in the health care of many participants.

AB  - Background: Participation in continuing professional development (CPD) is a professional and regulatory expectation of general practitioners (GPs). Traditionally, CPD activity was undertaken face-to-face in educational settings, but internet based formats have found increasing favour. The need for doctors to use the internet for service and educational purposes is growing, particularly in support of specialty training and appraisal. We aimed to determine how GPs in Scotland utilise online resources in support of their CPD. This involved identifying which resources are used and how frequently, along with their preferences as to how and why they access these resources.
   Methods: A cross sectional study was undertaken using an online questionnaire to survey general practitioners across Scotland. Data were subjected to descriptive analysis and differences in attitudinal responses between groups and Fischer's exact tests were calculated.
   Results: Three hundred and eighty-three GP responses were received, with the majority being female (n = 232, 60.6 %) and GP partners (n = 236, 61.6 %). The majority used the internet on three or more working days per week or more frequently (n = 361, 94.3 %) with the three most common reasons being to obtain information for a patient (n = 358, 93.5 %), answering a clinical question (n = 357, 93.2 %) and CPD purposes (n = 308, 80.4 %). Of 37 online resources used by respondents, the top five were SIGN Guidelines (n = 303, 79.3 %), BMJ Learning (n = 279, 73.0 %), NICE Guidelines (n = 255, 66.8 %), GP Notebook (n = 243, 63.6 %) and Google (n = 234, 61.3 %). Low use of social media such as Facebook (n = 11, 2.9 %) and Twitter (n = 11, 2.9 %) was reported for CPD. A majority agreed that 'reading information online' (95.0 %) and 'completing online learning modules' (87.4 %) were the most valued online activities. Slow internet connections (n = 240, 62.7 %), website access restrictions (n = 177, 46.2 %) and difficulties logging into online CPD resources (n = 163, 42.6 %) were reported barriers. Significant response differences (P < 0.05) were found between groups based on high volume online usage, gender and age.
   Conclusions: The majority of respondents had positive attitudes to using online resources for continuing professional development, and a preference for evidence-based and peer reviewed online resources. Information technology (IT) difficulties remain a barrier to effective utilisation. The findings have implications for future planning and design of online resources and IT infrastructure.

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this study was to examine the potential mechanism underlying the association between learning flow and learning outcomes in nursing students in South Korea during the pandemic. In particular, we examined the mediation effect of distance e-learning satisfaction moderated by social-evaluative anxiety related to COVID-19 on the relationship between learning flow and learning outcomes. Background: Despite the COVID-19 pandemic, the education of nursing students has continued by shifting the manner of delivering their education. Distance e-learning is being widely used under the strong social distancing policies currently in place and many educators are struggling to enhance the efficiency of this distance e learning. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 310 nursing students attending two colleges in South Korea. Data were collected from December 2-15 in 2020 by using an online survey. Results: As a result, an association was observed between learning flow and learning outcomes and distance e learning satisfaction mediated this association. Importantly, social-evaluative anxiety caused by COVID-19 moderated the mediation effect of distance e-learning satisfaction. Students' anxiety related to COVID-19 played a negative role in the distance e-learning mechanism for nursing students. Conclusions: It is thus necessary for educators and staff in nursing schools to exert effort to reduce students' COVID-19-related anxiety to enhance the outcomes of distance e-learning in nursing students.

AB  - What role does information concerning the beliefs of others play in the correction, or persistence, of misperceptions? Can social pressure affect whether someone will change their mind on a salient political issue? Building on the "backfire effect" and informational context literatures, we theorize that informational social influence can affect one's willingness to accept new information. Specifically, when individuals receive partisan cues, their attitudes will be different compared to individuals without similar social influence. We test our theory and hypotheses using a unique experimental between-subjects design using a student sample (N = 839) as well as a nationally representative sample (N = 777). Using the salient debate over voter identification laws, we find some evidence for our theory. We conclude by considering the policy implications of our analysis and directions for future research.

AB  - The large-scale infection of COVID-19 has led to a significant impact on lives and economies around the world and has had considerable impact on global public health. Social distancing, mask wearing and contact tracing have contributed to containing or at least mitigating the outbreak, but how public awareness influences the effectiveness and efficiency of such approaches remains unclear. In this study, we developed a discrete compartment dynamic model to mimic and explore how media reporting and the strengthening containment strategies can help curb the spread of COVID-19 using Shaanxi Province, China, as a case study. The targeted model is parameterized based on multi-source data, including the cumulative number of confirmed cases, recovered individuals, the daily number of media-reporting items and the imported cases from the rest of China outside Shaanxi from January 23 to April 11, 2020. We carried out a sensitivity analysis to investigate the effect of media reporting and imported cases on transmission. The results revealed that reducing the intensity of media reporting, which would result in a significant increasing of the contact rate and a sizable decreasing of the contact-tracing rate, could aggravate the outbreak severity by increasing the cumulative number of confirmed cases. It also demonstrated that diminishing the imported cases could alleviate the outbreak severity by reducing the length of the epidemic and the final size of the confirmed cases; conversely, delaying implementation of lockdown strategies could prolong the length of the epidemic and magnify the final size. These findings suggest that strengthening media coverage and timely implementing of lockdown measures can significantly reduce infection.

AB  - We investigate the incentives for social communication in the new social media technologies. Three features of online social communication are represented in the model. First, new social media platforms allow for increased connectivity; i.e., they enable sending messages to many more receivers, for the same fixed cost, compared to traditional word of mouth. Second, users contribute content because they derive status-or image-based utility from being listened to by their peers. Third, we capture the role of social differentiation, or how social distance between people affects their preferences for messages. In the model, agents endogenously decide whether to be a sender of information and then compete for the attention of receivers. An important point of this paper is that social communication incentives diminish even as the reach or the span of communication increases. As the span of communication increases, competition between senders for receiver attention becomes more intense, resulting in senders competing with greater equilibrium messaging effort. This in turn leads to lower equilibrium payoffs and the entry of fewer senders. This result provides a strategic rationale for the so-called participation inequality phenomenon, which is a characteristic of many social media platforms. We also show that social differentiation may enhance or deter sender entry depending on whether it can be endogenously influenced by senders. Finally, we examine how the underlying network structure (in terms of its density and its degree distribution) affects communication and uncover a nonmonotonic pattern in that increased connectivity first increases and then reduces the entry of senders.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to define and quantify significant factors that shape the quality of the business environment in the SME segment and to create the business environment quality index. A part of this aim was a comparison of defined factors in the Czech Republic (CR) and the Slovak Republic (SR). In regards to the aim defined, a survey-based research was conducted with enterprises operating in the SME segment. 312 enterprises in CR and 329 enterprises in SR were approached during this research. To verify the defined scientific hypotheses, a custom Business Environment Quality Index was created that was quantified separately for CR and SR. The research results brought interesting findings. The aggregated Business Environment Quality Index in the Slovak Republic reached the value of 0.460, which was higher than that of the Czech Republic (0.418). Slovak entrepreneurs gave the economic factors a higher rating than Czech entrepreneurs. Similarly, Slovak entrepreneurs rated the importance of the Central Bank in establishing a stable business environment and the role of commercial banks in financing business needs more positively. The evaluation of political factors is relatively negative in both countries. Slovak entrepreneurs evaluated more positively the judicial system in the area of commercial law, the state's influence on the business environment, and the administrative burden on enterprises. Czech entrepreneurs had a minor issue with the state bureaucracy's impact on the business environment. The evaluation of technological factors is relatively negative in both countries, as the value of this index is slightly below 0.250. Slovak entrepreneurs better assessed the situation on the job market and the cooperation of the public sector with the business environment. On the contrary, Czech entrepreneurs gave the infrastructure level in the area of research and development a better rating. The evaluation of social factors is relatively positive in both countries. Entrepreneurs in the Slovak Republic perceive a more positive attitude of the society towards entrepreneurs and a more intense influence of the family on entrepreneurship, and positively evaluate media's activities in regards to the business environment. The evaluation of the competitive environment is more positive in Slovakia. When evaluating the narrower competitive environment, it was discovered that Slovak entrepreneurs think that customers, suppliers, and employees play a positive role in their business.

AB  - Rationale and objectives: During the COVID-19 pandemic, medical educators and students are facing unprecedented challenges while navigating the new virtual landscape that social-distancing policies mandate. In response to these challenges, a new virtual introduction to radiology elective was established with unique online resources and curriculum.
   Materials and methods: A previously in-person 2-week introductory radiology elective was converted into a completely virtual experience using an internally developed, open-source, peer-reviewed, web-based teaching modules combined with virtual lectures, interdisciplinary conferences, and readout sessions of de-identified cases loaded to a DICOM viewer. Students from the first four months of course enrollment completed a multiple choice pre- and post-course knowledge assessments and a 5-point Likert Scale survey as part of their educational experience.
   Results: In total, 26 4th-year medical students participated over 4 separate 2-week sessions from July to October of 2020. This included 12 students from the home intuition and 14 visiting students. On average, students scored 62.2% on the 55-question pre-test and 89.0% on the same test upon completion of the course, a statistically significant increase (p < 0.001). All 26 students felt engaged throughout the course. All 26 agreed (23 "strongly agreed") that they were more comfortable looking at imaging studies following the course. All 26 also agreed (21 "strongly agreed") that the course helped them prepare for their future clinical rotations and careers.
   Conclusion: Initial pilot program using unique web-based resources and student encounters during a two-week virtual introductory radiology elective proved to be a positive educational experience for the first 26 students enrolled.

AB  - What visual features characterize online migration data visualizations, and what do they suggest for the politics of representing migration and informing public attitudes? Audiences increasingly encounter quantitative information through visualization, especially in digital environments. Yet visualizations have political dimensions that manifest themselves through "conventions," or shared symbols and practices conveying meaning. Using content analysis, I identify patterns of representation in a sample of 277 migration data visualizations scraped from Google Images. I find evidence of several conventions including appeals to objectivity and traceability as well as perspectives and units of analysis centered on states-particularly higher income migrant destinations. Then, by locating my analysis within the growing field of digital migration studies, I argue these conventions potentially shape public attitudes and understandings about migrants, and contribute to broader migration politics involving categorization and quantification that have relevance both on- and off-line.

AB  - This article draws on researcher vignettes to explore ethical decisions made in the process of collecting and analysing mobile messaging data as part of a team ethnographic project exploring multilingualism in superdiverse UK cities. The research involves observing key participants at work as well as recording them at home and collecting their digital interactions. The nature of ethnographic research raises ethical issues which highlight the impossibility of divorcing ethics from project decision-making. We therefore take on board a reconceptualisation of research ethics not as an external set of guidelines but as being at the core of research, driving decision-making at all steps of the process. The researcher vignettes on which we draw in exploring this process facilitate a reflexive approach and enable us to identify and address ethical issues in our research. In this article, we focus on the potential impact that digital communication technologies can have on the kinds of relationships that are possible between researchers and research participants, and on the roles that both carry out within the project. In doing so, we explore the part that digital communications play in the co-construction of social distance and closeness in research relationships. Our discussions around these issues highlight the need for an awareness not only of how our participants' media ideologies shape their use and perceptions of digital technologies, but also how our own assumptions inform our handling of the digital data.

AB  - The media often link Black characters and violence. This is especially true in video games, in which Black male characters are virtually always violent. This research tested the effects of playing a violent game as a Black (vs. White) avatar on racial stereotypes and aggression. In Experiment 1, White participants (N = 126) who played a violent video game as a Black avatar displayed stronger implicit and explicit negative attitudes toward Blacks than did participants who played a violent video game as a White avatar or a nonviolent game as a Black or White avatar. In Experiment 2, White participants (N = 141) who played a violent video game as a Black (vs. White) avatar displayed stronger implicit attitudes linking Blacks to weapons. Implicit attitudes, in turn, related to subsequent aggression. Black violent video game avatars not only make players more aggressive than do White avatars, they also reinforce stereotypes that Blacks are violent.

AB  - Decision makers use public opinion as an indicator of social acceptance for land use changes. However, public opinion is informed by, inter alia, the media, which tends to "frame" issues of public interest in terms of social conflict rather than the substantive details of the issue. Previous research about the influence of conflict on public opinion about politics has yielded contradictory results about the effect of this "conflict framing." Some studies have shown that conflict framing polarises public opinion, whereas others have found that it moderates public opinion. Similarly, there is no clear understanding of how conflict framing may affect public opinion about the social acceptance of land use changes. This study presents an experimental survey with a quota sample of the Australian population (n = 1,147) where fictional land use change headlines were manipulated to represent three levels of conflict framing (no conflict; conflict; and conflict between identified parties). The results showed that heightened conflict framing led to the strength of support or opposition for land use changes to become weaker. Importantly, these findings show that perceived social conflict can shape public opinion on land use change. As a consequence, public opinion may not represent genuine social acceptance of land use change in cases where conflict is pronounced in the media. This raises the need for attentiveness to disentangling the influence of conflict framing from the substantive issues of land use change.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its intensity are harbingers of demographic change. In the context of social demography, it is crucial to explore the social challenge emerging from the coronavirus disease. The main purpose of this study is (i) to explore the determinants that affected the population in Greece in terms of social isolation during the lockdown period and (ii) to examine possible differences in the assessment of the social isolation factors depending on whether individuals live in urban or rural areas or regions with relative geographical isolation. Field research was conducted with 4216 questionnaires during the first wave of COVID-19 (March to April 2020). Multivariate analysis methods were applied to detect the main factors that impacted the feeling of social isolation, and nonparametric tests were performed to detect possible differences between population groups. Despite the resistance shown to the spread of the disease, the Greek population totally complied with the measures of social distancing and thus was socially and psychologically affected. The results indicate that psychosomatic disorders, employment situations, changes in sleep habits, socialization on the Internet, demographic status, health concerns, and trust in government and the media response determine the Greeks' social isolation feeling. Pandemic and confinement measures have consequences for individuals and social groups and may prejudice social cohesion at multiple levels. By understanding how the pandemic affected the societies, interventions and public policies may be implemented to ensure both social cohesion and populations' wellbeing by addressing the social isolation feeling.

AB  - Based on two theoretical approaches contact-theory and threat perception theory-(i)n combination with meaningful encounter and media perspective and using the example of two neighbourhoods in Zagreb, this paper aims to explore several issues related to asylum seekers: (1) the deftnition and perceptions of asylum seekers expressed by locals; (2) attitudes towards asylum seekers in relation to vicinity to an asylum seeker centre and contact with asylum seekers on the neighbourhood level; and (3) the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The survey was conducted in the period of November 2015 to January 2016, using a systematic random sample (N = 299) in two selected neighbourhoods of the City of Zagreb: Dugave and Trnje. Each neighbourhood represents a specific surrounding in relation to the proximity of asylum seekers. In terms of location and contact with the asylum seekers, significant differences were found in all obtained latent dimensions of attitudes towards asylum seekers and attitudes based on locational attributes regarding asylum seeker reception: Dugave residents (located closer to the reception and accommodation centre) expressed, in general, more negative attitudes towards asylum seekers and their reception in Croatia than their counterparts in Trnje. The specific timeframe (the 2015-2016 sequence usually referred to as "European Migration Crisis") and the spatial context chosen for conducting the survey allows for spatialised and comparative findings. The discussion further develops the perceptive role played by media in a context of highly-mediatised migration, and the nature of contact in shaping more positive or negative attitudes towards refugees and migrants.

AB  - This study aims at exploring the linguistic habits of Iraqi Arab speakers and the situations wherein Iraqis invoke religion and the lexicon of Allah in their daily online communication. Throughout this work, it was sought to answer the question whether the religious belief of Iraqis is reflected in online chats Iraqi by involving situation-bound rituals in their CMC and the functions these expressions fulfil in this communication. Although computer-mediated communication lacks nonverbal behaviour and prosodic features support the speakers' polite intention, many researchers assert that there are many resources whereby individuals can resort to in demonstrating their solidarity. The Methods is based on examining synchronic messages exchanged on WhatsApp and Viber in four groups with the participation of 99 participants in total whose age ranged from 15 to 70 years old, with different educational qualifications and religious orientations. Social distance between the participants varied from intimate to neutral, and large. Likewise, social rank ranged from equal footing to low-high relationships and high-low relationships. The setting involved different occasions such as congratulations, greetings, farewell, thanking, offering condolences as well as receiving bad news. The findings of this research have shown that Iraqi Arabic speakers incline to enhance the politeness of their message by involving religious vocabularies that take mostly the form of supplication. Besides, the religious lexicon stands as a form of etiquette that promotes the speakers' and the addressee's faces. FIt is hoped that this work would lead to further studies related to religious expressions across computer mediated communication.

AB  - Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals' voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of self-interested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.

AB  - Introduction: Cannabis users are at higher risk for any mental disorder than the general population. However, there remains a shortage of research that examines the relationship between reluctance to seek mental health treatment and subsequent frequent cannabis use. This study evaluates whether negative attitudes toward mental health treatment (i.e. attitudinal barriers) predict a high frequency of cannabis use and whether using cannabis to cope with mental health symptoms (i.e., coping motives) explains this relationship.
   Methods: Participants were students at Washington State University (WSU) who received violations for illegal cannabis use or possession. Data were collected from participants 60 days after a mandated two-part course for cannabis harm reduction (n = 98). A cross-sectional path analysis was performed to assess whether coping motives mediated the relationship between attitudinal barriers to mental health treatment and frequency of cannabis use after controlling for mental health symptoms.
   Results: Coping motives fully mediated the relationship between negative attitudes toward treatment and frequency of use (indirect effect: (beta = 0.087, bootstrap CI: 0.016-0.541). The direction of results was confirmed by switching the mediator and criterion variable. The model fit well with the data (x(2) (2) = 0.367, p = 0.83, RMSEA = 0.00, CFI = 1, SRMR = 0.008).
   Conclusions: Reluctance to seek mental health treatment may be related to higher levels of cannabis use through coping motives. Addressing attitudes toward mental health treatment may be an alternative way to decrease frequency of use or possibly promote mental health treatment-seeking behaviors when needed. Further studies are needed to confirm the implications of this finding. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Social media are important information dissemination platforms that can augment traditional channels communicating public health recommendations. The objective of the study was to assess the effectiveness of COVID-19 public health messaging on Twitter when delivered by emergency physicians and containing personal narratives.
   Methods On April 30, 2020, we randomly assigned 2,007 U.S. adults to an online survey using a 2 x 2 factorial design. Participants rated one of four simulated Twitter posts varied by messenger type (emergency physician vs. federal official) and content (personal narrative vs. impersonal guidance). The main outcomes were perceived message effectiveness (35-point scale), perceived attitude effectiveness (PAE; 15-point scale), likelihood of sharing Tweets (7-point scale), and writing a letter to their governor to continue COVID-19 restrictions (write letter or none).
   Results The physician/personal (PP) message had the strongest effect and significantly improved all main messaging outcomes except for letter writing. Unadjusted mean differences between PP and federal/impersonal (FI) were as follows: perceived messaging effectiveness (3.2 [95% CI = 2.4 to 4.0]), PAE (1.3 [95% CI = 0.8 to 1.7]), and likelihood of sharing (0.4 [95% CI = 0.15 to 0.7]). For letter writing, PP made no significant impact compared to FI (odds ratio = 1.14 [95% CI = 0.89 to 1.46]).
   Conclusions Emergency physicians sharing personal narratives on Twitter are perceived to be more effective at communicating COVID-19 health recommendations compared to federal officials sharing impersonal guidance.

AB  - Objective: To investigate school-aged children's and parents' attitudes, social influences, and intentions toward excessive screen-related sedentary behavior (S-RSB).
   Design: A cross-sectional study using a survey methodology.
   Setting: Elementary schools in London, Ontario, Canada.
   Participants: All grades 5 and 6 students, their parents, and their teachers in the participating schools were invited to voluntarily participate; 508 student-parent pairs completed the surveys.
   Main Outcome Measure: Children's screen-related behaviors.
   Analysis: Data were analyzed using the Independent Student t test to compare differences of continuous variables and the chi-square test to test for differences of categorical variables.
   Results: Children spent 3.3 +/- 0.15 (standard error) hours per day engaged in screen-related activities. Entertainment, spending time with family, and boredom were cited as the top 3 reasons for television viewing and video game playing. Compared to "low-screen users" (ie, < 2 hours/day), "high-screen users" (ie, ! 2 hours/day) had a less negative attitude toward excessive S-RSB and perceived loosened parental rules oil screen use. Parents of high-screen users had a less negative attitude toward children's S-RSB, had fewer rules about their children's screen use, and were more likely to be sedentary themselves.
   Conclusions and Implications: Intervention strategies aimed at reducing S-RSB should involve both parents and children and should focus oil fostering behavioral changes and promoting parental role modeling.

AB  - The majority of research on the fear of missing out (FOMO) has focused on understanding how social media posts about attractive unattended experiences taking place in the physical world (e.g., a friend's vacation) influence individuals' affective states. With quarantine measures in place, and in the absence of travel and party photos on social media, do individuals feel they are missing out on enjoyable experiences? The current work shows that FOMO has not disappeared during the pandemic, even when socially distancing at home, but has been replaced by feelings towards new online activities (e.g., online concerts, virtual gatherings). As a consequence, we find that FOMO threatens well-being by causing important psychological and health issues, such as sleep deprivation, loss of focus, declined productivity, and finding relief in knowing that others have difficulty keeping up with abundant digital content. Importantly, we find these consequential effects both during the initial (May 2020) and late stages (December 2020) of the pandemic. With excessive Internet use and virtual FOMO likely to be a continuing reality of life, questions remain as to how one can refrain from its negative effects and stay healthy during the pandemic and in the post-pandemic era. We discuss remedies and suggest new research avenues that may help elevate the negative consequences of FOMO on well-being.

AB  - Background: The debate about returning research results has revealed different perspectives among researchers, participants and advisory groups with participants generally interested in obtaining their results. Given this preference, policies regarding return of individual research results may affect whether a potential subject chooses to participate in a study. Public attitudes, particularly those of African-Americans, toward this issue have been understudied. Methods: In 2008-2009, we convened 10 focus groups in Durham, N.C. to explore attitudes about returning research results and how different policies might influence their likelihood to participate in genetic/genomic studies. Transcripts were complimented by a short anonymous survey. Of 100 participants, 73% were female and 76% African-American with a median age of 40-49 years. Results: Although there was general interest in obtaining genetics research results, particularly individual results, discussants recognized many potential complexities. The option to obtain research results (individual or summary) was clearly valued and lack thereof was potentially a deterrent for genetic/genomic research enrollment. Conclusions: Providing the option to learn research results may help strengthen relationships between investigators and participants and thereby serve as a positive influencing factor for minority communities. Consideration of the broader implications of returning research results is warranted. Engaging diverse publics is essential to gain a balance between the interests and burdens of participants and investigators. Copyright (C) 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The Delta variant became dominant during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic due to its competitive advantage, the ability to reduce close contact duration from minutes to seconds, and, consequently, increase the risk of exposure to COVID-19. We used game theory to model the most effective public health response to this new threat. We compared the absolute and relative risk of exposure to COVID-19 before and after the emergence of the Delta variant. The absolute risk of exposure was defined as the product of crowding (people within a six feet distance) and visit duration. Our epidemiological investigation used aggregated and anonymized mobility data from Google Maps to estimate the visit duration for 808 premises in the metropolitan area of Genoa, Italy, in June 2021. The relative risk of exposure was obtained by dividing the risk of exposure of each activity by the lowest value (gas stations = 1). The median absolute risk of exposure to COVID-19 increased by sixty-fold in the first semester of 2021, while the relative risk did not significantly differ from the risk of exposure to the ancestral form of Covid-19 (5.9 in 2021 vs. 2.5 in 2021). The Delta variant represents an evolution of the game against COVID-19, but it is not a game-changer. The best response is to commit to our original strategy based on population-wide vaccination and social distancing. Unilateral deviations from the dominant strategy could offer COVID-19 a fighting chance against humanity.

AB  - Introduction: The stigma of epilepsy continues to negatively impact people with epilepsy (PWE) in many Arab Middle Eastern countries, including Saudi Arabia. Socioreligious, cultural, and philosophical ideas prevalent in the region may contribute to the underpinnings of stigma toward PWE, but this has not been sufficiently studied.
   Materials and methods: This study recruited a convenience sample of people without epilepsy from clinic waiting rooms and through social media. Participants completed a questionnaire with questions about demographics, mind-body dualism (MBD), supernatural beliefs (SB), attitudes toward epilepsy (ATE), and religiosity.
   Results: A total of 210 participants were recruited. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant difference in the mean total ATE scores, indicating better ATE with higher education (p < 0.001). Despite the relatively high level of education and a high proportion of participants with medical training, only slightly more than half rejected the possibility that demonic possession may be a cause of epilepsy. Attitudes toward epilepsy were correlated with MDB and SB but not with religiosity. Mind-body dualism and religiosity correlated significantly with negative attitudes toward PWE (p < 0.05). A linear regression model using ATE as the dependent variable and MDB, SB, and educational level as independent variables significantly predicted ATE (F = 15.6, p 0.001, R2 = 0.24), although SB dropped out as a predictor of ATE in that model. Another regression used SB as the dependent variable, and MBD, religiosity, and educational level as independent variables were also significant with all three variables predicting SB (F = 64.0, p < 0.001).
   Conclusions: Mind-body dualism was related to the cognitive process leading to supernatural misconceptions about epilepsy and negative attitudes toward PWE in Saudi Arabia. Although misconceptions that supernatural possession was the cause of epilepsy (justifying treatment by religious healing) and was likely derived from prevalent religious beliefs of the region, religiosity was not associated with negative attitudes toward PWE. The merits and efficacy of an intervention focused on reducing the negative effects of MBD and SB on ATE warrants further investigation. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Israel's strategy for dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic was to keep the general population in home quarantine and to maintain social distancing. This strategy can lead to psychological and behavioral symptoms known to have detrimental long-term effects on health. This study examines the prevalence of these symptoms among the general, non-infected community in comparison to people with adjustment difficulties, and investigates whether psychological and behavioral symptoms and demographic characteristics are associated with levels of adjustment.
   Method: In the first two weeks of April, when restrictions were at their most severe, we surveyed adjustment (ADNM-4), anxiety, depression, and stress (DASS21), sleep quality (PSQI), and emotional eating (DEBQ) among 421 participants. We used a snowball sampling strategy via social media. Comparisons in outcome measures between adjustment difficulties groups (with/without) were analyzed via one-way ANCOVA, with age as a covariate.
   Results: Significant psychological and behavioral effects on coping strategies were found among the full sample and differences between the group with adjustment difficulty and the group without in anxiety, depression, stress, sleep quality, and emotional eating. The group with adjustment difficulties included more women, more avid news consumers, and more people whose economic situation was affected by COVID-19.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that the quarantine strategy unintentionally created risk groups of potential future morbidity. Gathering more information about people with adjustment difficulties is essential in order to accelerate diagnosis and treatment.

AB  - We sought to understand how attachment orientation influenced attitudes towards different types of psychological therapies. In two studies, we (1) examined attachment orientation as a predictor of attitudes towards different therapies and (2) tested whether attachment security priming could improve attitudes. Study 1 (n = 339) found associations between attachment orientation and attitudes towards, and likelihood of using different therapies. Positive and negative attitudes about different therapies mediated the relationship between attachment avoidance and likelihood of use. Study 2 (n = 412) showed that primed security (vs. neutral prime) improved attitudes towards relational, non-relational and distanced-relational therapies for those with a fearful-avoidant attachment orientation. For relational and distanced-relational therapies, the mechanism of this effect was increased cognitive openness. Attachment orientation is a determinant of therapy attitudes and anticipated help-seeking behaviour. Priming security may promote open-minded decision-making about some therapies. Findings are discussed with relevance to attachment theory, research and clinical practice.

AB  - Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and its related disease (COVID-19) continue to represent a challenge for humans. To date, vaccination programs have represented an opportunity to navigate the pandemic. However, the advent of new genetic COVID-19 variants has increased more attention representing a worrying threat not only for not vaccinated but also for vaccinated people as virus infections have been shown also in the last ones. Herein, we report different clinical cases and radiological findings of COVID-19 pneumonia in six fully vaccinated patients. Two patients had a history of Rituximab therapy for follicular lymphoma and with persistent positivity for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs and with moderate pneumonia on the chest computed tomography (CT). One patient who resulted to be positive to delta variant 8 days after the second vaccination dose, died shortly after. Two patients were hospitalized due to the worsening of fever and dyspnea in presence of mild pneumonia on CT. In one patient mild pneumonia was found on the chest-CT performed after a lipothymic episode associated with chest pain and positive NP/OP swab tested for SARS-CoV-2. These data suggested that in fully vaccinated people, caution should be preserved, and the use of masks and social distancing should be continued in all closed environments. However, further clinical trials should be done to better understand how various factors can influence vaccine immunogenicity as the presence of virus mutations, age factors, and the presence of an immunocompromised state.

AB  - Background: In Ghana, adolescents constitute about a quarter of the total population. These adolescents make reproductive health decisions and choices based on their knowledge and the availability of such choices. These reproductive health decisions and choices can either negatively or positively affect their lives. This study therefore explored adolescents' reproductive health knowledge and choices, the type of choices they make and the factors that affect these choices.
   Methods: This qualitative study adopted a narrative approach to qualitative enquiry. Eight focus group discussions (N = 80) were conducted among both in-school and out-of-school adolescents aged 10-19 years. The discussions were stratified by sex and studentship. In addition, nine in-depth interviews were conducted with various stakeholders in reproductive health services and community opinion leaders. Both the focus group discussions and in-depth interviews were recorded, transcribed and analysed using NVivo 11. Thematic analysis was employed in analysing data.
   Results: The study found that knowledge on reproductive health choices was low among respondents with majority of them relying on their peers for information on sexual and reproductive health. Having a sexual partner(s) and engaging in premarital sex was common and viewed as normal. Adolescents engaged in unprotected sexual practices as a way of testing their fertility, assurance of love, bait for marriage and for livelihood. Inserting herbs into the vagina, drinking concoctions and boiled pawpaw leaves were identified as local methods employed by adolescents to induce abortion. Reproductive health services were available in the community but received low utilization because of perceived negative attitude of health workers, confidentiality and social norms.
   Conclusions: Adolescents in this study generally engaged in risky reproductive health choices that can negatively affect their reproductive health. Adolescents in this part of Ghana have challenges utilizing available reproductive health services because of socio-cultural and health system barriers.

AB  - According to social psychology models of adult attachment, a fundamental dimension of attachment is anxiety. Individuals who are high in attachment anxiety are motivated to achieve intimacy in relationships, but are mistrustful of others and their availability. Behavioral research has shown that anxiously attached persons are vigilant for emotional facial expression, but the neural substrates underlying this perceptual sensitivity remain largely unknown. In the present study functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine automatic brain reactivity to approach-related facial emotions as a function of attachment anxiety in a sample of 109 healthy adults. Pictures of sad and happy faces were presented masked by neutral faces. The Relationship Scales Questionnaire (RSQ) was used to assess attachment style. Attachment anxiety was correlated with depressivity, trait anxiety, and attachment avoidance. Controlling for these variables, attachment-related anxiety was positively related to responses in left inferior, middle, and medial prefrontal areas, globus pallidus, claustrum, and right cerebellum to masked happy facial expression. Attachment anxiety was not found to be associated with brain activation due to masked sad faces. Our findings suggest that anxiously attached adults are automatically more responsive to positive approach-related facial expression in brain areas that are involved in the perception of facial emotion, facial mimicry, or the assessment of affective value and social distance.

AB  - Background: There is a prevalence of vitiligo in Saudi Arabia, with low reports regarding the burden of the disease. Thus, the current study aimed to assess the knowledge and perception of vitiligo in Saudi Arabia. Methodology: This cross-sectional study involved 1004 volunteers' participants living in the city of Hail, Northern Saudi Arabia. Contributors were selected randomly regardless of age or sex. A purposeful questionnaire was designed and used to collect data regarding vitiligo. Results: About 77% claimed to know what vitiligo is. The Odds Ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95%CI) for Knowledge was OR (95%CI) = 1.193 (1.032-1.378), P-value = 0.007. The most common source of knowledge was the internet, followed by physicians and friends, constituting 25%, 23%, and 13%, respectively. Conclusion: The knowledge and perception of vitiligo are averages among the Saudi community. Distribution of educational and awareness materials through internet and social media can potentially reduce negative attitudes toward vitiligo patients and improves their life quality.

AB  - The emergence of online disability hate speech on social media platforms is the latest form of ableist expression. This was highlighted when an alarming amount of negative attitudinal responses emerged towards people with Down syndrome and their parents on the 60 Minutes Facebook platform to their segment 'Does Australia really want to see the end of Down syndrome?'
   This article analyses the varying contours of ableism within these responses. The responses could be categorised into three broad themes: the construction of Down syndrome as an economic burden on society and a drain on public resources; social attitudes to Down syndrome; and bias related to information provided by the medical profession to pregnant women with a high probability of a Down syndrome birth.
   These findings allowed us to interrogate what this means in terms of how Australians view difference associated with Down syndrome, and to consider the operationalisation of ableism within the Australian social landscape.

TI  - The grief experience during the COVID-19 pandemic across different cultures

LA  - English
KW  - Grief
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Culture
AB  - Grief is the physical or mental suffering experienced after a major loss, usually the death of a loved one. It is a universal experience, but sociocultural factors, such as cultural or ethnic identity and religious beliefs predict and shape the expression of grief. The circumstances under which people are experiencing grief during the coronavirus outbreak have adversely affected the grieving process. Unexpected deaths, social distancing rules and visitor restrictions in healthcare facilities have posed a heavier burden on the loss and have heightened the risk of grievers experiencing complicated or persistent grief. This concern led us, as early career psychiatrists (ECPs) from 14 different countries connected by the Early Career Psychiatrists Section of the World Psychiatric Association (WPA), to share our country-specific experiences on the mourning, grief tradition, and burial rites during the COVID-19 pandemic. In this paper, we discuss our experiences, similarities and differences with relation to the: 'Effect of the pandemic on mourning', 'Restrictions and Guideline on burial rites due to the pandemic', 'Effect of the pandemic on social support' and 'Role of media and telecommunication on mourning practices and burial rites'. We conclude that while telecommunication means have attempted to bridge the gap and provide some form of social connectedness, the total and global effect of the pandemic is yet to be fully seen and understood.

AB  - Objective: Digital surveillance has shown mixed results as a supplement to traditional surveillance. Google Trends (TM) (GT) (Google, Mountain View, CA, United States) has been used for digital surveillance of H1N1, Ebola and MERS. We used GT to correlate the information seeking on COVID-19 with number of tests and cases in India. Methods: Data was obtained on daily tests and cases from WHO, ECDC and covid19india.org. We used a comprehensive search strategy to retrieve GT data on COVID-19 related information-seeking behavior in India between January 1 and May 31, 2020 in the form of relative search volume (RSV). We also used time-lag correlation analysis to assess the temporal relationships between RSV and daily new COVID-19 cases and tests. Results: GT RSV showed high time-lag correlation with both daily reported tests and cases for the terms "COVID 19," "COVID," "social distancing," "soap," and "lockdown" at the national level. In 5 high-burden states, high correlation was observed for these 5 terms along with "Corona." Peaks in RSV, both at the national level and in high-burden states corresponded with media coverage or government declarations on the ongoing pandemic. Conclusion: The correlation observed between GT data and COVID-19 tests/cases in India may be either due to media-coverage-induced curiosity, or health-seeking curiosity.

AB  - Background Iraq has been exceptionally challenged by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the already exhausted healthcare system.
   Objectives To describe the epidemiological situation of COVID-19 in Iraq, the government's response to the pandemic, and provide recommendations for further action.
   Methods A desk review of secondary data using the available reports on the epidemiological situation in Iraq as well as official governmental sources was conducted.
   Results The major surge in the number of COVID-19 cases occurred in the first week of June and continued to increase dramatically until mid-October when a significant decrease happened. With a few exceptions, the reproductive number R has been consistently above 1. Patients aged 30-39 years (25.6%) were the most affected, while those aged 60-69 years (26.7%) had the highest deaths rates. Iraq tried to contain the pandemic through several regulations: border control, enforcing curfew, mask-wearing, and social distancing, COVID-19 isolation centers, expanding lab capacity, contact tracing, as well as several supportive economic measures. However, the extent of implementing these regulations is questionable.
   Conclusion Additional administrative and scientific measures with special emphasis on handling mass gathering, coordination with media and better training of healthcare workers particularly on infection prevention and control.

AB  - Background: Social distancing and school suspension due to the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) may have a negative impact on children's behavior and well-being. Problematic smartphone use (PSU), problematic social media use (PSMU) and perceived weight stigma (PWS) are particularly important issues for children, yet we have a poor understanding of how these may have been affected by lockdowns and physical isolation resulting from COVID-19. This research aimed to understand how these psychosocial and behavioral variables may be associated with psychological distress, and how these associations may have changed during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A total of 489 children completed a three-wave longitudinal study from January 2020 to June 2020. The first wave was conducted before the COVID-19 outbreak. The second wave was conducted during the outbreak. The third wave was conducted during post-COVID-19 lockdown. Questionnaires measured psychological distress, PSU, PSMU, and PWS.
   Results: PSU, PSMU, PWS and psychological distress were all significantly associated with each other. PSU was significantly higher during outbreak. PWS was significantly higher before outbreak. We found an increased association between PSMU and PWS across three waves in all three models. The association between PSU and depression/anxiety decreased across three waves; however, association between PSMU and depression/anxiety increased across three waves.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 initiated school suspension and associated lockdowns appear to have exacerbated PSU and depression among children. However, PWS was reduced during this period. Children should use smartphones and social media safely and cautiously, and be aware of the potential exposure to weight stigmatization.

AB  - This study illustrates the discursive construction of the househusband in Japanese TV shows as a situated gender practice. Although the category of sengyoshufu 'househusband' has existed since at least the 1980s in Japan, the dominance of the ideology of 'salaryman masculinity' has ensured its marginalisation. The recent emergence of the househusband as a topic in mainstream media discourse reflects a social change in the gendered division of labour in Japan. Employing conversation analysis and membership categorisation analysis, this study explores how participants in TV shows constitute the identity and category of househusband drawing on verbal and embodied resources in interaction. Through this analysis, the study reveals both positive and covertly negative attitudes towards househusbands, suggesting that the 'traditional' gendered division of labour in Japan is in transition.

AB  - Aim In response to the SARS-CoV-2 emergency, the Competence Centre on digital health 'TrentinoSalute4.0' has developed TreC_Televisita, a tele visit solution that meets the needs of the Trentino healthcare system and maintains high-quality patient-doctor interactions while respecting social distancing. This paper highlights how 'TreC_Televisita' was integrated into the Trentino healthcare system and its potential to become a structural and durable solution for the future local healthcare service provisioning. Subject and methods This paper presents the multifactorial context that TreC_Televisita has faced for its implementation and the strategies adopted for its structural integration into the healthcare system. The analysis focuses on the main issues faced for the integration of the tele visits (e.g. privacy, payments) and how the context of TrentinoSalute4.0 permitted responding quickly to its implementation during the pandemic. It also describes how TreC_Televisita fits into the healthcare continuum from the organisational and technological standpoint, the end-user perspective and the barriers that could hamper the solution scalability. Results TreC_Televisita has demonstrated to be a technological solution that can be contextualised for different clinical domains beyond SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, it has shown its potential to scale up the solution beyond the COVID-19 emergency to the whole healthcare provisioning system in the long term. Conclusion Being a positive experience in the first months of its implementation, the long-term goal is to transform TreC_Televisita into a structural pillar of the Trentino healthcare system, setting the bases for a sustainable, win-win situation for all the stakeholders involved in healthcare service provisioning.

AB  - While much of the scholarship on populist political communication focuses on its content and a verbal style, less is known about the nonverbal cues accompanying populist messages. This paper aims in filling that gap by providing findings of the study on characteristics of nonverbal communication of two Polish presidential candidates: Bronislaw Komorowski and Andrzej Duda, traced during two debates broadcast on television before the second round of the presidential elections in 2015. The results revealed that both candidates employed nonverbal cues such as appearance, eye contact, facial expressions, or gestures that emphasized their references towards the people or negative attitudes towards elites expressed in their verbal messages. The study also proved that the methods used previously in research on nonverbal content on television (observational protocols and analysis of facial expressions) may be successfully employed in studies on nonverbal components of the populist style of communication.

AB  - It is important to understand public attitudes when designing policy instruments to motivate actions. Attitude is partially socially constructed and thus must be studied locally rather than inferred from other settings. This study explored public attitudes toward air pollution among Beijing residents through interviews and thematic analysis. In contrast to previous studies mostly focusing on a certain dimension of attitudes, we attempted to show an initial picture of attitudes in three dimensions, knowledge and belief, perception and concern, and covert and overt behaviors, and identify underlying factors accounting for such attitudes. The results showed that the interviewees largely knew the sources and impacts of air pollution but also demonstrated misunderstandings; half of them perceived air pollution as 'severe' and three-fourths of them showed little concern about air pollution; their protective and mitigation responsive behaviors were inadequate. Factors affecting such attitudes, both existing and missing in current literature, were identified. Perceived air pollution is determined by sensory cues and imagination, and mediated by lived experiences and place identity. Lack of concern about air pollution can largely be explained by a feeling of uncontrollability and the crowding effect in competing for attention. This lack is further influenced by the perceived benefits of living in large cities, perceived fairness of the impact across the population, and perceived delay of the health impacts posed by air pollution. Protective behaviors, specifically wearing facemasks, are influenced by perceived severity, vulnerability, efficacy, and barriers. Mitigation behavior, which refers to reducing car use in this case, is discouraged by a lack of feeling responsible and by perceived inconvenience and ineffectiveness. At an academic level, the results of this exploratory study are expected to provide a base for further investigations of factors affecting public attitudes. From a policy perspective, the results should provide information for designing policy instruments to raise awareness and motivate actions to cope with air pollution.

AB  - While research on migration and diasporas tends to be heteronormative, research on sexual minorities tends to ignore migrants and ethnic minorities. The current paper aims to problematize both tendencies by taking a queer perspective on migration and a diasporic perspective on sexuality. As part of a larger project on diasporic LGBTQs living in Belgium, this paper discusses the social positions and identifications of six non-heterosexual women with a migration background, as narrated in individual in-depth interviews. Drawing on intersectionality theory, the relative importance and mutual interplay between their sexual and ethno-cultural identifications are analysed. This analysis discloses the irreducible individuality of each narrative, where the balance and interaction between ethno-cultural and sexual identifications is part of an intricate interplay of social positions and contexts. The participants' migration background is a key structuring element, leading to a combination of geographic and/or social distance from their family and ethno-cultural community in which religious, family and gender norms lead to a range of expectations and pressures. Sexual identifications tend to be more salient when they are strongly rejected, in which case they lead to more social and often also geographic distancing. This is further modulated by race, as non-white participants tend to identify more strongly along racial lines because they are continuously reminded of their otherness.

AB  - Over five million athletes with intellectual disability (ID) currently participate in Special Olympics (SO) worldwide with the broader aim of promoting their inclusion in society. The public's knowledge of SO was determined in 17 selected countries globally and the characteristics of those most actively involved identified. Online, self-completion surveys were completed by 36,508 nationally representative respondents. Around 1 in 7 people globally reported an active involvement with SO and a further third were aware of it through the media. Engagement was greater among respondents who had experience in volunteering, playing sports and frequent personal contact with people with ID. Only one quarter of respondents correctly distinguished SO from Paralympics and the Olympic Games. There is scope to make the public more aware of, and better informed about SO. Further research examines the relationships between engagement with SO and public attitudes towards the inclusion of persons with ID in wider society.

AB  - In the context of current changes in the education process due to the pandemic, the main aims of this study were to highlight social capital factors within the school community that are associated with better students' outcomes in the context of distance learning. This study was a cross-sectional population-based study. The research sample consisted of 1483 students, whose ages varied from 11 to 19 years old (56.9% were girls). Academic success in this study was measured in terms of average grade and students' perception of their learning process or outcomes by six single items. A Five-item WHO-5 questionnaire was used to measure students' psychological well-being. Social capital was measured in terms of relationship, trust, reciprocity, and communication within different social contexts in the school community in total by 16 items. School social capital and social support scales were developed from these items. Students' gender and age were also taken into consideration. The research results show that although social capital from parents and peers also matters, the relationship with teachers emerges as the main and the most important resource in supporting positive attitudes and outcomes in to learning (std.beta varied from 0.116 to 0.439). The results also show that higher psychological wellbeing is associated with higher perceived school social capital (std.beta 0.260) and social support (std.beta 0.326) and mediates the effects of the latter two for better academic success outcomes. The findings also highlight the importance of close and trusting social ties, especially between students and their teachers as well as parents for better learning outcomes in times of crises and in the context of distance learning. The study results prove that social support and social capital at school are essential factors for sustainable psychological development. The results presumably support the idea that the school is sustainable if it is developing as an ecosystem not solely aimed at academic outcomes. The results of the current study may aid policymakers and practitioners in developing interventions, policies and practices that focus resources where they will have the greatest benefit.

AB  - Background To evaluate cycling participation and identify barriers and facilitators related to cycling participation in people with a lower limb amputation (LLA) in the Netherlands. Methods A questionnaire was sent to adults with a LLA between March and August 2019 to obtain information regarding prosthesis, individual's characteristics, amputation, cycling barriers and facilitators, and prosthetic satisfaction. The questionnaires were distributed via 8 orthopedic workshops, post and were given directly. To find cycling predictors, variables associated with cycling (p < 0.1) were entered into a logistic regression analysis. Non-significant variables were removed manually. Results Participants (n = 207, 71% males) had a mean age of 62.0 +/- 13.0 years. The most frequent level of amputation was transtibial (42%), and trauma was the most frequent cause of amputation (43%). After the LLA, 141 participants (68%) cycled for recreation (80%), physical fitness (74%), and transport (50%). In the past six months, cyclists cycled for recreation (79%) and transport (66%). Most cycled less than once a day. Recreational cyclists cycled alone (75%) for a median duration of 45 min or 14 km per ride. Cyclists with a transportation purpose usually cycled to go shopping (80%) or to visit friends (68%), with a median duration of 20 min or five kilometers per ride. Cyclists reported more facilitators (median (IQR) = 5 (3, 7) than non-cyclists 0 (0, 3). The majority of cyclists reported a positive attitude toward cycling (89%) and cycled because of health benefits (81%). A dynamic foot (odds ratio: 5.2, 95% CI 2.0, 13.3) and a higher number of facilitators (odds ratio: 1.3, 95% CI 1.2, 1.5) positively predicted cycling, whereas the presence of other underlying diseases (odds ratio: 0.4, 95% CI 0.2, 0.9) negatively predicted cycling (R-2: 40.2%). Conclusion In the Netherlands, the majority of adults cycled after a LLA, mainly for recreational purposes. A dynamic foot, a higher number of facilitators, and no other underlying diseases increases the likelihood of cycling after a LLA. The results suggest that personal motivation and a higher mobility level could be the key to increasing cycling participation. Future research should determine the association between motivation, mobility levels, and cycling with a LLA.

AB  - Introduction: Financial incentives effectively increase smoking cessation rates, but it is unclear via which psychological mechanisms incentives influence quit behavior. The current study examines how receiving financial incentives for smoking cessation leads to quitting smoking and investigates several mediators and moderators of that relationship.
   Aims and Methods: The study sample consisted of 604 tobacco-smoking employees from 61 companies in the Netherlands who completed a baseline and follow-up questionnaire. The current study is a secondary analysis from a cluster randomized trial where employees received smoking cessation group counseling at the workplace. Participants in the intervention group additionally received financial incentives of Euro350 in total for 12-month continuous smoking abstinence. We used a two-level path analysis to test a model that assesses the effects of financial incentives through smoking cessation program evaluation, medication use, nicotine replacement use, attitudes, self-efficacy, and social influences on quit success. We additionally tested whether an individual's reward responsiveness moderated the influence of incentives on quit success.
   Results: The effect of financial incentives on quit success was mediated by a higher self-efficacy. Financial incentives were also associated with a higher use of cessation medication. A more positive program evaluation was related to higher self-efficacy, more social influence to quit, and more positive attitudes about quitting. The results did not differ significantly by individual reward responsiveness.
   Conclusions: The results of the current study suggest that financial incentives may be used to increase medication use and self-efficacy for quitting smoking, which offers an indirect way to increase successful smoking cessation.
   Implications (1) This is the first study investigating via which psychological pathways financial incentives for quitting smoking can lead to long-term quit success. (2) The results showed a path between financial incentives and a higher likelihood of medication use. Incentives may encourage smokers to use medication in order to increase their chance of quitting smoking and receive the reward. (3) There was a path from financial incentives to quit success via a higher self-efficacy. (4) The effects of financial incentives did not depend on individual reward responsiveness.

AB  - Background: Epilepsy is the most common noninfectious neurologic disease in Nigeria and other developing African countries. Epilepsy remains a stigmatized disease. The stigma stems from the traditional African belief, which views epilepsy as a spiritual disease. A lack of information and illiteracy has been blamed as the cause of the stigmatization.
   Aims: The aim of the present study was to assess the awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards epilepsy among secondary school students in Nsukka.
   Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey using a validated, self-administered questionnaire comprising four sections: demographic characteristics, awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards people living with epilepsy (PLWE). Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 23. Descriptive analysis (frequencies, percentage, mean, and standard deviations) were used to summarize the data. The relationship between sociodemographic characteristics and knowledge score and attitude score was performed using chi-square analysis. Statistical significance was set as a p-value <0.05.
   Results: The majority of the students (87.4%) had heard of epilepsy as a disease. The most common source of information was the electronic media (21.5%). More than half (61.6%) had witnessed a convulsion in the past, and 36.9% knew someone with epilepsy. The majority of the students (66.7%) believed that epilepsy is caused by witchcraft. Jerking (773%) and loss of consciousness (82.4%) were identified as the commonest manifestation of epilepsy. Regarding treatment management of epilepsy, 81.3% of the students believe the use of orthodox medicine, while 85.4% would insert a spoon in the mouth when a seizure occurs as part of first-aid treatment. Nearly half of the students had good knowledge (48.1%) of epilepsy and a positive attitude (46.5%) towards the disease. The students' knowledge was associated with their school (X-2 = 23.21, p = 0.001). However, students attitude towards epilepsy was associated with their schools (X-2 = 5.93. p 0.015) and their guardians' level of education (X-2 = 14.65, p = 0.012).
   Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest poor knowledge and attitude towards epilepsy among secondary school students in Nsukka, Enugu State, Nigeria. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Community engagement is important for advancing Clinical and Translational Science (CTS), but face-to-face engagement has limited reach and scale. We examined the feasibility of a novel virtual Facebook community platform for public engagement on health research statewide in Minnesota. Methods: The Facebook platform, MN Research Link, was evaluated from June 19, 2019 to June 30, 2020. Facebook advertisements and boosts were used to recruit followers. Content, based on prior formative work, included health research information and interactive postings (e.g., live interviews with researchers). Standard metrics obtained from Facebook analytics included participation (followers), content reach (views), and engagement (likes, shares, comments, clicks). Results: During the 12-month period, we acquired 1406 followers (31% rural residents), with a retention of followers of 99.7%. Mean number of views per month was 9379.83 (Mdn = 2791, range 724-41,510). Engagement metrics indicated a mean of 535.2 likes, shares, comments, and/or clicks per month (Mdn = 296.5, range 55-1535). The page continued to acquire new followers, but a slight decrease in engagement was observed in the final months after state COVID-19 mitigation strategies were implemented. Conclusion: As the complexity of CTS continues to grow, along with social distancing measures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the availability of virtual digital platforms to reach and engage community stakeholders in conversations about health and research has increasing importance. Preliminary findings from this program evaluation indicate that a Facebook community platform is feasible to engage Minnesota residents in conversations around health and research topics.

AB  - Researches reveal that approximately one-third of the general population has high sensory processing sensitivity and the highly sensitive individuals are more prone to have psychological problems. This study aimed to examine the relationships among sensory sensitivity, emotion regulation skills, dysfunctional attitudes, depression, anxiety, and stress. The study group consisted of 355 undergraduate students (239 females [67.3%], 116 males [32.7%]) aged between 17 and 32 (Mean = 20.8, SD = 1.90). Using the mixture structural equation modeling, at the first step, the direct and indirect relationships between the variables were analyzed through structural equation modeling. In the second step, using latent class analysis it was aimed to determine individual differences based on the relationships between the variables determined by the structural equation model. There was a positive relationship between depression, anxiety, stress and sensory sensitivity. Besides, emotion regulation skills and dysfunctional attitudes had a mediating effect in this relationship. Latent class analysis extracted two latent classes. The first group (30.1%) has higher levels of depression, anxiety, stress sensory sensitivity and negative attitudes, and they used suppression more but cognitive reappraisal less. The second group (69.1%) has lower levels of depression, anxiety, stress, sensory sensitivity and negative attitudes, and they used cognitive reappraisal more but suppression less. Individuals with psychological problems such as depression, anxiety, and stress might show different characteristics in terms of sensory processing sensitivity and that it might be useful to consider this differentiation in mental health interventions.

AB  - Intergroup contact is undoubtedly associated with lower levels of self-reported prejudice. In some situations, however, contact may have little or no association with prejudice. Studies conducted in apartheid South Africa rarely found such an association. Apartheid was overturned in 1994, but there have been few explicit tests of the relationship since then. The present study explored the relation between contact and prejudice in a large (N = 2,599) and diverse nonprobability sample of South Africans. Participants were recruited from four universities. In addition, factors were explored that might modulate the contact-prejudice relation, or have independent effects. The relation between prejudice and contact was larger for affective prejudice (r approximate to vertical bar.35 vertical bar) than for social distance (r approximate to vertical bar.2 vertical bar). Analysis showed that the effects of contact were not reducible to those of other variables, although the contact-prejudice relation was mediated in many instances.

AB  - Objectives The COVID-19 pandemic changed daily routines, including physical activity, which could influence physical and mental health. In our study, we describe physical activity and sedentary behaviour patterns in relation to the pandemic and estimate associations between anxiety and physical activity and sedentary behaviour in community-dwelling adults. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Participants Between April and June 2020, a random sample of 1124 adults (>= 18 years) completed an online questionnaire. Primary and secondary outcomes The online questionnaire captured current walking, moderate intensity, vigorous intensity and total physical activity and sedentary behaviour (ie, sitting and leisure-based screen time), perceived relative changes in physical activity, sedentary and social behaviours since the pandemic, perceived seriousness and anxiety related to COVID-19, and sociodemographic characteristics. Differences in sociodemographic characteristics, perceived relative change in behaviour and current physical activity and sedentary behaviour were compared between adults with low and high anxiety. Results Our sample (n=1047) included more females (60.3%) and fewer older adults (19.2%). Most participants (88.4%) considered COVID-19 as extremely or very serious and one-third (32.9%) felt extremely or very anxious. We found no differences (p>0.05) in current physical activity or sedentary behaviour by anxiety level. The largest perceived change in behaviours included social distancing, driving motor vehicles, use of screen-based devices, watching television and interactions with neighbours. We found anxiety-related differences (p<0.05) in perceived changes in various behaviours. Conclusions Changes in physical activity, sedentary behaviour and social behaviour occurred soon after the COVID-19 pandemic was declared, and some of these changes differed among those with low and high anxiety.

AB  - As a concept, intimacy has been a powerful way of understanding how the ongoing pandemic has affected gender relations, expression and access. The pandemic's effects on women have been disproportionately adverse, with social distancing, intermittent lockdowns and travel restrictions that have changed the socialisation scenario, impacting relationships. Women's expression and connections are increasingly mediated through technology which is shaped by gendered dynamics of access and availability.
   Community networks (CNs) and community radio stations (CRs) have been central to ensuring last-mile connectivity through the use of frugal technologies. This has been an effective source of information dissemination, especially over the course of the pandemic. Through qualitative data from CRs in India, we show that care work and intimacy are strong elements of communications as mediated by CNs and CRs. Against the backdrop of gendered care work, we explore the conceptual depth that different aspects of intimacies and intimate economies offer to understand communications as mediated through CNs and CRs over the course of the pandemic, at the levels of personal expression, interpersonal communications and community conversations. We seek to understand how these forms of mediating technologies play a role in furthering, challenging and reimagining our understanding of intimacies as a concept.

AB  - Background The elderly are more vulnerable to COVID-19 and therefore need to adopt long-term social distancing measures. The duration of quarantine impacts the psychological status of the general population. However, until now no study has explored the psychological impact of the pandemic and quarantine together with longitudinal changes in the mental health status of Italian elderly.
   Methods An online questionnaire including an assessment of depression, anxiety, anger, post-traumatic stress, subjective cognitive failures, resilience, coping style, and other dimensions related to the pandemic was completed by participants during (T0) and two months after the end (T1) of the quarantine.
   Results The sample recruited at T0 included 334 elderly participants. About 45% of the participants experienced depression, anxiety, or anger. Moreover, more fear of getting infected was related to more severe depression, anxiety, and anger, but resilience was found to mediate these relationships. More severe depressive and anger symptoms were related to more severe cognitive failures. No significant difference was observed in mental health scores between T0 and T1.
   Finally, more severe depression at T0 was associated with the development of post-traumatic stress symptoms at T1.
   Conclusions The fear of getting infected, probably due to perceived vulnerability to disease, seems to play a crucial role in the development of psychological symptoms in the elderly, but resilience seems to mediate the impact of fear. The presence of long-term psychological consequences and the possible risk of developing PTS symptoms in the elderly suggest the need for targeted interventions to reduce possible long-term psychological and cognitive consequences.

AB  - To assess the current epidemic trend of COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 in India, the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19 cases in India in terms of Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Case Recovery Rate (CRR) and Mortality rate (MR) COVID-19 have been evaluated during Lockdown-1. The analysis includes (i) epidemic curve of Covid-19 cases (ii) demographic analysis (iii) calculation of the CFR and CRR by different methods (iv) calculation of MR (v) Geo-temporal analysis (vi) epidemiological transmission factor (vii) evaluation of the effects and impact of infection, prevention and control in India. A total of 10,815 COVID-19 confirmed cases have been reported in 31 states/union territories as of April 14, 2020 with 9272 active cases (85.73%), 1190 cured/discharged (11%), and 353 deaths (3.23%). Among confirmed cases, most cases (59%) are aged 20-49 which is working age in India and 76% cases are reported for men. The median age of Indian COVID-19 patients found to be 39. As of April 14, the CFR per total cases in India is 3.32% and per closed cases is 23.27%. The CRR per total cases in India is 11.00% and per closed cases is 76.72%, which indicates that the recovery rate of COVID-19 is more than the fatality rate in India. The prevention and control measures taken by the state and central governments at all levels and measure of maintenance of social distancing by people have resulted in effective curbing in the COVID-19 transmission in India.

AB  - In this paper, we study the interplay between the epidemic spreading and the diffusion of awareness in multiplex networks. In the model, an infectious disease can spread in one network representing the paths of epidemic spreading (contact network), leading to the diffusion of awareness in the other network (information network), and then the diffusion of awareness will cause individuals to take social distances, which in turn affects the epidemic spreading. As for the diffusion of awareness, we assume that, on the one hand, individuals can be informed by other aware neighbors in information network, on the other hand, the susceptible individuals can be self-awareness induced by the infected neighbors in the contact networks (local information) or mass media (global information). Through Markov chain approach and numerical computations, we find that the density of infected individuals and the epidemic threshold can be affected by the structures of the two networks and the effective transmission rate of the awareness. However, we prove that though the introduction of the self-awareness can lower the density of infection, which cannot increase the epidemic threshold no matter of the local information or global information. Our finding is remarkably different to many previous results on single-layer network: local information based behavioral response can alter the epidemic threshold. Furthermore, our results indicate that the nodes with more neighbors (hub nodes) in information networks are easier to be informed, as a result, their risk of infection in contact networks can be effectively reduced.

AB  - Empirical research on sources of prejudice and anti-immigrant hostility has grown considerably over the years, and the literature on the topic has become substantial firstly in classical receiving countries and in recent years also in Europe. This work analyses the anti-immigrant attitudes in Italy. The main results of this study are three. The first is the importance of individual characteristics in explaining anti-immigrant hostility: much of the variability in anti-immigrant hostility is due to individual characteristics, and in particular to the educational level achieved. Second, contacts have opposite effect on hostility: real contacts (i.e., real interpersonal contacts) decrease anti-immigrant hostility, while abstract contacts (i.e., contacts mediated by mass media) increase hostility towards migrants. Third, anti-immigrant hostility is lower among issues concerning family immigration dynamics.

TI  - Evaluation of community-based CT abdomen for acute abdominal pain during COVID-19
T2  - NEW ZEALAND MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - AIM: The purpose of this study was to determine the utility of community-based imaging to reduce use of inpatient surgical resources and enforce social distancing at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHOD: A prospective evaluation of community-based CT for patients presenting to Christchurch general practitioners with acute abdominal pain from April to November 2020. Eligible patients were discussed with the on-call general surgical team, and then referred for CT abdomen rather than hospital assessment. The positivity rate of CT scans, the 30-day all-cause hospital admission rate, and the proportion of patients wherecommunity scanning altered management setting and the number of incidental findings, were all assessed.
   RESULTS: Of 131 included patients, 67 (51%) patients had a positive CT scan. Thirty-nine (30%) patients were admitted to hospital within 30 days, 34 (87%) of whom had a positive CT scan and were admitted under a surgical specialty. Ninety-two (70%) patients did not require hospital admission for their acute abdominal pain, thirty-three (35%) of whom had a positive CT scan. There were three deaths within 30 days of the community CT, and the setting of the community CT did not contribute to the death of any of the cases. Forty patients (30%) had incidental findings on CT, 10 (25%) of which were significant and were referred for further investigation.
   CONCLUSION: Community based abdominal CT scanning is a feasible option in the management of acute abdominal pain. While trialed in response to the initial nationwide COVID-19 lockdown in New Zealand, there may be utility for acute community-based CT scanning in regular practice.

AB  - This paper builds new theory and provides supporting evidence to contain the Not-Invented-Here Syndrome (NIHS) - a persistent decision-making error arising from an attitude-based bias against external knowledge. Conceptually, we draw on the 4i framework of organizational learning to develop a novel process perspective on NIHS. This allows us not only to unpack how and where NIHS impedes organizational learning, but also to identify the key requirements for effective NIHS countermeasures. Importantly, countermeasures fall into two categories: those that seek to change the negative attitude directly (direct NIHS countermeasures) and those that seek to attenuate the behavioral impact of negative attitudes without addressing the attitudes as such (indirect NIHS countermeasures). While the evidence base on direct NIHS countermeasures has grown over the last decade, indirect NIHS countermeasures have received little research attention. To address this gap, we adopt a mixed methods research design composed of two complementary empirical studies - the first qualitative and the second quantitative. Study 1 explores the prevalence of distinct NIHS countermeasures in collaborative R&D practice. Based on 32 interviews and three focus group meetings with R&D employees, we find that a broad array of primarily direct NIHS countermeasures is employed in R&D practice. Study 2 addresses the scarcity of scholarly and managerial insights on indirect NIHS countermeasures by testing the effectiveness of perspective taking as a debiasing technique to contain negative attitudes at the level of the individual. Based on quantitative survey data from 565 global R&D projects, it provides empirical evidence not only for the prevalence and negative effects of NIHS on project success as mediated by external knowledge absorption, but also for the effectiveness of perspective taking as an exemplary indirect NIHS countermeasure.

AB  - This paper analyzes representations of Simone Biles in media coverage of two major gymnastics events in 2019. It asks which, if any, gendered and racial stereotypes identified in previous scholarship about media coverage of Black and women athletes are also present in coverage of Biles. It also interrogates in what ways these stereotypes intersect as distinct forms of representation of Biles as a Black woman. Employing the tenets of feminist theory and Black feminist thought through an intersectional lens, a qualitative textual analysis of 34 articles revealed that both gendered and racial stereotypes were present in coverage of Biles. The most prominent stereotypes include feminized emotions, lack of mental fortitude, negative attitudes, and physicality. These intersecting representations underscore the persistence of these stereotypes in contemporary discourse. This paper contributes to, and advances, the literature on media representations of women athletes, Black athletes, and Black women athletes.

AB  - Utilizing a longitudinal, observational study, grocery store health and safety controls implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic across stores in two cities were characterized. Sixteen stores between Seattle, WA (n = 9) and Portland, OR (n = 7) were visited monthly by the study team from May 2020 to January 2021, and observations of controls were recorded using a standardized checklist in REDCap. The checklist included questions on the presence or absence of controls such as physical barriers, social distancing markers, required masking of customers, cleaning of check-out stands, and closures of store areas. Descriptive analyses were conducted to determine the proportion of stores with a certain control each month. Mixed-effects logistic regression was used to explore how controls changed over time, and whether differences were observed between cities or by income of the area the store serves. Source control (e.g., mask requirements) and engineering controls (e.g., physical barriers at checkout) were the most common and consistent controls observed across stores and over the study period. Controls such as having special hours for vulnerable populations, demarcations on aisles for directionality, and cleaning check-out stands between customers varied significantly over time (p < 0.05 in the mixed-effects model). Having an employee present to clean baskets and carts, as well as physical barriers between self-checkouts, were significantly more common in stores in areas above the median income (p < 0.05 in the mixed-effects model). To best protect workers and shoppers from infectious agents, controls should be evidence-based, consistently implemented across grocery stores, and coupled with administrative practices and policies to promote worker wellbeing.

AB  - Background During the initial COVID-19 pandemic, young United Kingdom (UK) kidney patients underwent lockdown and those with increased vulnerabilities socially isolated or 'shielded' at home. The experiences, information needs, decision-making and support needs of children and young adult (CYA) patients or their parents during this period is not well known.
   Methods A UK-wide online survey co-produced with patients was conducted in May 2020 amongst CYA aged 12-30, or parents of children aged < 18 years with any long-term kidney condition. Participants answered qualitative open text alongside quantitative closed questions. Thematic content analysis using a three-stage coding process was conducted.
   Results One-hundred and eighteen CYA (median age 21) and 197 parents of children (median age 10) responded. Predominant concerns from CYA were heightened vigilance about viral (68%) and kidney symptoms (77%) and detrimental impact on education or work opportunities (70%). Parents feared the virus more than CYA (71% vs. 40%), and had concerns that their child would catch the virus from them (64%) and would have an adverse impact on other children at home (65%). CYA thematic analysis revealed strong belief of becoming seriously ill if they contracted COVID-19; lost educational opportunities, socialisation and career development; and frustration with the public for not following social distancing rules. Positive outcomes included improved family relationships and community cohesion. Only a minority (14-21% CYA and 20-31% parents, merged questions) desired more support. Subgroup analysis identified greater negative psychological impact in the shielded group.
   Conclusions This survey demonstrates substantial concern and need for accurate tailored advice for CYA based on individualised risks to improve shared decision making.

TI  - Telemedicine during the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic: A Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Outpatients Service Perspective
T2  - NEUROLOGY INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - multiple sclerosis
KW  - telemedicine
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the need for a broader implementation of telemedicine for many diseases has become apparent. Televisits are one type of telemedicine in which clinical visits are conducted remotely using an audio-visual connection with the patient at home. The use of televisits is more established in Stroke care but was also recently formally evaluated for Multiple Sclerosis (MS). This retrospective case series describes patient characteristics and reasons for televisits in persons with MS during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak in Italy, which was declared in February 2020. Methods: Recruitment occurred in a general hospital based MS clinic during Italy's lockdown months period (9 March-18 May). Each subject completed at least one televisit. The baseline data included were demographics and MS history; reasons for the remote house calls were analyzed focusing on COVID-19 related needs. Results: Forty-six participants completed at least one study visit. The patients enrolled were more often females suffering from Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS). Half of the patients had an intermediate level of education and lived within a 60 min drive from the clinic. These patients predominately had a short disease duration and were mostly involved in oral treatment. The main reasons for the call were drug use and counseling on social distancing. In 5 cases, COVID-19 infection was reported. Conclusions: Televisits during the COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated their utility as a care delivery method for MS. Hence, it is vital to facilitate the implementation of this technology in common practice to both face infectious threats and increase accessibility of the health care system.

AB  - BackgroundThe Novel Corona virus SARS-CoV-2 emerged to affect the human population in 2019 causing COVID-19 pandemic. The only preventive measures available are social distancing, hand washing and face masks. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of the Sudanese people towards COVID-19.MethodsAn online cross-sectional study targeting adult Sudanese people was conducted in April 2020. The study used a self-administered questionnaire containing 18 knowledge questions, 5 questions for attitude and six questions for practices. Social media such as Facebook and WhatsApp were utilized to disseminate the questionnaire. The total number of eligible questionnaires available for analysis by the end of the period was 987.ResultsThe mean (SD) age of respondents was 30.13 (+/- 9.84) years with males representing 55.4%. The majority were university and higher education levels (95.2%), residing in Khartoum (71.7%). The mean (+/- SD) knowledge score of the participants was 15.33 (+/- 2.24) and was found to be associated with education level and age groups (p-value=0.022, P value =0.010) respectively. The mean (+/- SD) attitude score was 04.15 (+/- 0.97) and was significantly associated with older groups and better-educated participants (p-value =0.001, p-value=0.048) respectively. The practices related to COVID-19 preventive measures mean (+/- SD) was 02.58 (+/- 1.73) with a significant difference between age groups and area of residence.ConclusionsThis study showed that the participants had good knowledge and satisfactory attitude that was not similarly expressed into practice. Efforts are needed in health education and law enforcement to improve the practices among all groups with special emphasis on younger and less educated males.

AB  - In the present study, we assessed changes in screen time exposure among 3-6-year-old children in Ceara, Brazil, in 2017 and in 2020 during the pandemic. We analyzed data from a state-wide repeated cross-sectional survey. The COVID impact research was conducted by phone interviews. American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines were used to define elevated screen exposure. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proportion of children with screen exposure above recommended levels was 96.8% among 3-4-year-old and 84.2% among 5-6-year-old children. There was a significant increase in proportion of 3-4-year-old children with elevated screen time (risk difference 15.8%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 12.3-19.2; p-value < 0.001). Children participating in remote learning activities had significantly lower television time with a mean difference of -0.8 hours daily (95% CI -0.3 - -1.3; p-value: 0.003) as compared to children not participating in remote learning. The necessary COVID-19 response measures appear to increase screen time among 3-6-year-old children in Ceara, Brazil. Interventions to reduce excess screen time, potentially participation in remote early learning activities should be developed and evaluated in Brazil.
   Prior State of Knowledge: The necessary COVID-19 response measures appear to increase sedentary time in children in developed countries.
   Novel contributions: COVID-19 response measures (social distancing and school closures) appear to increase screen time among 3-6-year-old children in Ceara, Brazil. In addition, children participating in remote learning activities had significantly lower television time than children not participating in remote learning.
   Practical implications: Public health officials should engage in helping support parents by creating safe areas for children to increase physical activity and reduce screen time, monitoring/setting limits on screen time that does not promote learning, and counsel and promote parents to be creative to engage children at home in active play during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Wearing masks is an easy way to operate and popular measure for preventing epidemics. Although masks can slow down the spread of viruses, their efficacy in gathering environments involving heterogeneous person-to-person contacts remains unknown. Therefore, we aim to investigate the epidemic prevention effect of masks in different real-life gathering environments. This study uses four real interpersonal contact datasets to construct four empirical networks to represent four gathering environments. The transmission of COVID-19 is simulated using the Monte Carlo simulation method. The heterogeneity of individuals can cause mask efficacy in a specific gathering environment to be different from the baseline efficacy in general society. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of gathering environments causes the epidemic prevention effect of masks to differ. Wearing masks can greatly reduce the probability of clustered epidemics and the infection scale in primary schools, high schools, and hospitals. However, the use of masks alone in primary schools and hospitals cannot control outbreaks. In high schools with social distancing between classes and in workplaces where the interpersonal contact is relatively sparse, masks can meet the need for prevention. Given the heterogeneity of individual behavior, if individuals who are more active in terms of interpersonal contact are prioritized for mask-wearing, the epidemic prevention effect of masks can be improved. Finally, asymptomatic infection has varying effects on the prevention effect of masks in different environments. The effect can be weakened or eliminated by increasing the usage rate of masks in high schools and workplaces. However, the effect on primary schools and hospitals cannot be weakened. This study contributes to the accurate evaluation of mask efficacy in various gathering environments to provide scientific guidance for epidemic prevention.

AB  - Covid-19 pandemic imposes crucial social distancing rules and restriction measures; therefore, the access to facilities and sites, in order to perform on-site inspections, became difficult or not feasible. Greek Atomic Energy Commission (EEAE) adopted remote virtual inspections (RVIs) of facilities and practices applying ionising radiation and magnetic resonance imaging installations, in order to continue discharging its regulatory duty of inspection, effectively. This study presents the experience gained and lessons learnt from the implementation of the RVIs and explores the RVIs perception by the stakeholders. Moreover, the effectiveness and the capability of RVIs to identify 'findings', is assessed by comparing the on-site and the remote inspections outcomes. The presented study showed that RVIs could not replace the on-site inspections, entirely; however, they could support and contribute to the inspection activities and program, in certain circumstances. RVIs were proven to be a valuable tool for the inspection of procedures, documents and records as well as the design and operational conditions of the facilities. The performance of remote verification tests and measurements, although feasible, was challenging, due to the technical issues needed to be resolved in advance. The comparison between remote and on-site inspections outcomes showed that both inspection options had similar capability to identify 'findings', indicating the validity of the RVIs as an inspection methodology in certain inspection thematic areas. The perception of the RVIs was positive and the added value and usefulness was acknowledged by the inspected facilities' personnel and the EEAE's inspectors, although the latter mainly considered RVIs as complementary and supportive to the on-site inspections.

The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught.The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.

AB  - Despite the importance of companies' corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to support the issue of empowering women, little is known about which communication strategies are effective for a successful CSR initiative. This research investigated how CSR messages influences consumer evaluations of a CSR activity supporting women's empowerment via consumers' cause involvement by conducting two experimental studies. In Study 1, a 2 (CSR message type: in-group vs. out-group) x 2 (gender: female vs. male) online factorial experiment (n = 140) was employed. The results indicate that consumers evaluated the CSR activity more positively when they were exposed to an in-group message than an out-group message. To increase the validity and explain the process by which CSR message types influence consumer evaluations of a CSR activity, Study 2 was conducted. Psychological distance manipulated by CSR campaign messages increased an individual's level of cause involvement, which in turn influenced the individuals' response to the CSR activities. Implications are discussed.

AB  - The Protestant work ethic (PWE), or the belief that hard work leads to success, is a popular belief across cultures. Much work indicates that PWE contributes to negative evaluations of disadvantaged groups presumably through the notion that they deserve their disadvantage for not working hard enough (PWE-Justifier). But there is another dimension of PWE that expresses the belief that everyone could succeed through hard work (PWE-Equalizer). We propose that the PWE-Justifier is meaningful in cultures that emphasize individualism and personal responsibility, but not in others. In a cross-cultural study, we compare how PWE-Justifier relates to evaluations of poor persons in the USA (individualist culture) and the Philippines (low individualist culture). In the USA sample, regression analysis indicated that internal attributions of poverty mediated the relationships of PWE-Justifier with negative stereotypes (R-2 = .32) and with negative attitudes towards poor persons (R-2 = .13). Bootstrapping analysis indicated that both indirect effects of PWE-Justifier were significant: Negative stereotypes, B = .17, SE = .03, p < .0001, 95% CI [.11, .24]; negative attitudes, B = 2.52, SE = 1.11, p = .014, 95% CI [0.49, 4.84]. The results were not found in the Philippine sample, where instead, PWE-Equalizer negatively predicted negative attitudes (R-2 = .05) and positively predicted empathy (R-2 = .05) for poor persons. The results are discussed in terms of how the negative consequences of PWE may derive from the cultural syndrome of individualism that emphasizes personal control and responsibility.

AB  - Robots that can communicate with people are one of the goals reached by the technology developed for automation in work life. Experts aim to improve the communication skills of these robots further in the near future. Besides, various studies emphasize that people may interact with robots in a similar way as they interact with other people. In line of this idea, this study examines the possible causal chain in which the social anxiety affects the robot anxiety which in turn affects the attitude toward interacting with robots. Data obtained from university students were analyzed in a simple and parallel mediation model. The results showed that robot anxiety and in particular two of its sub-dimensions mediate the relationship between social anxiety and negative attitudes toward interaction with robots. Researchers should carry out new studies about the common structural characteristics of the anxiety felt by people due to interacting with humans and robots.

AB  - The influx of refugees to Europe is a topic that dominates the political and media agenda. Furthermore, the installation of asylum-seeker centres (ASCs) has made asylum seekers and refugees highly visible in the everyday life of many European citizens. Drawing on theories of ethnic threat and intergroup contact, we examine how geospatial proximity to ASCs translates into threat or contact in an everyday context and how this affects attitudes toward asylum seekers. By taking advantage of a natural experiment, where the ASCs are assigned to city districts as-if at random, as well as innovating measures of outgroup exposure and geospatial proximity, we find that, although higher numbers of asylum seekers in one's own neighbourhood are related to an increased perception of their local presence, the actual presence of asylum seekers does not lead to more negative attitudes or a greater threat perception, nor to more frequent contact. It is only when the number of asylum seekers in one's own direct neighbourhood suddenly increases that attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorate.

AB  - Addressing the problem of increasing sponsored eWOM and diverse and confusing disclosure practices, this study examined the effects of different types of sponsorship disclosure messages on (1) consumers' trust in the sponsored product reviewer and (2) attitudes toward the reviewer and the sponsoring brand. An online experiment revealed several key effects of sponsorship disclosure and disclosure message types. Overall, sponsorship disclosure messages generated lower consumer trust in the reviewer and attitudinal responses. In terms of the effects of different types of disclosed commercial gain, reviews disclosing the receipt of a free product were perceived to be equally acceptable as reviews without sponsorship disclosure. Disclosure revealing that the reviewer received payment or a sales commission led to lower trust in a reviewer, and disclosure of a sales commission generated more negative attitude toward the sponsoring brand. The disclosure message type effects on attitude were mediated by trust.

AB  - As children age, they are less likely to experience spontaneous recovery from stuttering and are likely to develop negative attitudes about talking, necessitating counselling to address these feelings. The current exploratory case study examines children's response to traditional speech therapy to address fluency combined with a programmed message to modify negative attitudes about talking. A standard narration, saved to a compact disk (CD), was used as a counselling experience for children, ages 6, 7, and 10;11 years, recruited from a university clinic predominantly serving African American children. A one-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test was performed to examine differences in stuttering across three pretreatment sessions to treatment results from two experimental sessions. The analysis indicated that participants who completed the two treatment sessions stuttered significantly less during the sessions that included the CD, with a moderate clinical effect size as indicated by r, (Mdn = 9), U = 12, p ? 0.05, r = .53. For 2 of 3 participants who completed post-testing with the Stuttering Severity Instrument-3 (SSI-3), testing indicated a reduction in overall scores and stuttering severity (Riley, 1994). There is a need for future studies to examine the content of motivational messages as components of therapy to address stuttering.

AB  - In spite of alarming increases in obesity, little is known concerning the influence of emotional distress about weight gain on perceived self-efficacy in maintaining self-control when controlling for racial identity. This study found that emotional distress toward goal achievement failure mediated the influence of ethnicity on perceived self-efficacy in resisting eating temptations. White females reporting higher emotional distress about weight gain than their black counterparts displayed lower self-regulatory efficacy, particularly when negative emotions were involved. Negative attitudes toward goal achievement failure among whites played a critical role in undermining perceived self-regulatory efficacy. The implications for public policy are discussed.

AB  - Between 2000 and 2018, the number of fights in professional hockey decreased by more than half, reflecting rule changes intended to preserve player health. A 2019 playoff fight ignited debate on social media over the place of fighting in hockey. This research involved a content analysis of an incendiary tweet and the 920 replies it solicited. Content analysis confirmed that cultural backlash exists in sport and provided insight into manifestations of backlash. Comments exhibiting backlash varied by subject (i.e., what or who is being discussed in the tweet) and attitude (i.e., positive approval for fighting and negative attitude toward change), with many defending hockey masculinity. Connections are drawn to manifestations of backlash in the political realm, the extant hockey masculinity literature, and implications for sociological theory and the sport of hockey are discussed.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, the World Health Organization recommended measures to mitigate the outbreak such as social distancing and confinement. Since these measures have been put in place, anecdotal reports describe a decrease in the number of endovascular therapy (EVT) treatments for acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel occlusion. The purpose of our study was to determine the effect on EVT for patients with acute ischemic stroke during the COVID-19 confinement. In this retrospective, observational study, data were collected from November 1, 2019, to April 15, 2020, at 17 stroke centers in countries where confinement measures have been in place since March 2020 for the COVID-19 pandemic (Switzerland, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, Germany, Canada, and United States). This study included 1600 patients treated by EVT for acute ischemic stroke. Date of EVT and symptom onset-to-groin puncture time were collected. Mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval and mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time were calculated before confinement measures and after confinement measures. Distributions (non-normal) between the 2 groups (before COVID-19 confinement versus after COVID-19 confinement) were compared using 2-sample Wilcoxon rank-sum test. The results show a significant decrease in mean number of EVTs performed per hospital per 2-week interval between before COVID-19 confinement (9.0 [95% CI, 7.8-10.1]) and after COVID-19 confinement (6.1 [95% CI, 4.5-7.7]), (P<0.001). In addition, there is a significant increase in mean stroke onset-to-groin puncture time (P<0.001), between before COVID-19 confinement (300.3 minutes [95% CI, 285.3-315.4]) and after COVID-19 confinement (354.5 minutes [95% CI, 316.2-392.7]). Our preliminary analysis indicates a 32% reduction in EVT procedures and an estimated 54-minute increase in symptom onset-to-groin puncture time after confinement measures for COVID-19 pandemic were put into place.

Three separate attitude groups were identified in relation to the effect of Russian second home owners in property prices; the Russians as an economic opportunity; and, the Russians as a threat. Negative attitudes were common, and it is possible that the relations between the Russian second homeowners and local residents will become more contested over time.

AB  - Restorative justice (RJ) is oriented to respond to crime in ways that would repair individual, relational, and social harm. This study examined the relationship between type of offense and public attitudes toward RI in addition to the psychological mechanisms undergirding this relationship. We examined a model of three offense types (sexual, violent, and property) and their differential effect on support for RJ. Moreover, we examined whether this relationship was mediated by incremental beliefs, i.e., that human character is malleable. We also explored two control variables previously found predictive of attitudes toward punishment: perceived seriousness of the offense and fear of crime. Participants (N = 608) read a definition of one offense and completed a survey regarding incremental beliefs, fear of crime, perceived seriousness of the offense, and support for RI The findings indicated main effects of offense type on attitudes toward RJ. Additionally, differences between offense types were found in incremental beliefs and attitudes toward RI such that for both variables, sexual offenses were rated the lowest followed by violent and property offenses. An indirect effect of offense type on attitudes toward RJ through incremental beliefs was also found, but not through fear of crime or perceived seriousness.

AB  - Against the backdrop of an increase in reported hate crimes, we present the development of a U.K.-focussed instrument designed to evaluate the nature of public beliefs about hate crime, legislation, offenders and victims. In Study 1, 438 participants completed an Anglicized version of the Hate Crime Beliefs Scale (HCBS). Factor analyses revealed three subfactors: Denial (high scores represent a denial of hate crime severity and need for legislation), Compassion (high score reflect compassion toward victims and affected communities) and Sentencing (higher scores reflect more punitive attitudes). In Study 2 (N = 134) we show that scores on Denial are positively associated with those on Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO), ideologies known to be associated with prejudice. Compassion was negatively associated with these ideologies. Mediation analyses showed that Big Five personality traits Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness predicted Denial and Compassion via RWA, whereas Agreeableness and Openness predicted scores via SDO, consistent with a dual-process motivation model of hate crime beliefs. Results are discussed in terms of the nature of hate crime beliefs and the importance of understanding public attitudes which may support undesirable social norms and influence jury decision making in trials of hate related offenses.

AB  - During these times of escalating tensions between the police and the communities they serve, the news and social media have been full of images of police officers wearing military gear, armed with military weapons, and driving military vehicles. This study surveyed a sample of undergraduate college students taking criminal justice classes at a Midwestern university and examined whether the blurred lines between police officers and soldiers have caused the public to perceive police officers who work in urban areas as being equivalent to soldiers in war zones. The findings indicate that holding a conservative crime ideology and having negative attitudes towards people who live in poor, high crime neighborhoods ('the policed') are strong predictors of a belief in police-military equivalency. Discussions for future research and tests of this theory are discussed.

AB  - Background Exercise is safe and provides considerable benefits for patients with heart failure (HF) including improved function, quality of life, and symptoms. However, patients with HF have difficulty initiating and adhering to an exercise regimen. To improve adherence, our team developed Heart Failure Exercise and Resistance Training (HEART) Camp, a multicomponent, theory-driven intervention that was efficacious in a randomized controlled trial of long-term adherence to exercise in patients with HF. Identifying active components of efficacious interventions is a priority.
   Purpose The purpose of this study is to use mediation analysis to determine which interventional components accounted for long-term adherence to exercise in patients with HF.
   Methods This study included 204 patients with HF enrolled in a randomized controlled trial. Instruments measuring interventional components were completed at baseline, 6, 12, and 18 months. Hierarchical linear models generated slope estimates to be used as predictors in logistic regression models. Significant variables were tested for indirect effects using path analyses with 1,000 bootstrapped estimates.
   Results Significant mediation effects were observed for the interventional components of negative attitudes (beta(NA) = 0.368, s.e. = 0.062, p < .001), self-efficacy (beta(SE) = 0.190, s.e. = 0.047, p < .001), and relapse management (beta(RM) = 0.243, s.e. = 0.076, p = .001).
   Conclusions These findings highlight improving attitudes, self-efficacy, and managing relapse as key interventional components to improve long-term adherence to exercise in patients with HF. Future interventions targeting adherence to exercise in patients with HF and other chronic illnesses should consider the incorporation of these active components.

AB  - Aim: We examinted the attitude, knowledge and perceived barriers to evidence-based practice of radiology (EBPR) among residents in radiology.
   Study design and setting: We used the McColl questionnaire (1) and the BARRIERS scale (2) to assess the issues among radiology trainees attending an annual refresher course. Ninety six residents from 32 medical colleges from Southern India attended the course.
   Results: Eighty (83.3%) residents, 55 male and 25 female of age range 24-34 years, consented and returned the questionnaire. The majority of the participants had a positive attitude towards EBPR. However, 45% were unaware of sources for evidence based literature although many had access to Medline (45%) and the internet (80%). The majority (70%) were aware of the common technical terms (e.g. odds ratio, absolute and relative risk) but other complex details (e.g. meta-analysis, clinical effectiveness, confidence interval, publication bias and number needed to treat) were poorly understood. Though majority of residents (59%) were currently following guidelines and protocols laid by colleagues within their departments, 70% of residents were interested in learning the skills of EBPR and were willing to appraise primary literature or systematic reviews by themselves. Insufficient time on the job to implement new ideas (70.1%); relevant literature is not being complied in one place (68.9%); not being able to understand statistical methods (68.5%) were considered to be the major barriers to EBPR. Training in critical appraisal significantly influence usage of bibliographic databases (p < 0.0001).
   Attitude of collegues (p = 0.006) influenced attitude of the trainees towards EBPR. Those with higher knowledge scores (p = 0.02) and a greater awareness of sources for seeking evidence based literature (p = 0.05) held stronger beliefs that EBPR significantly improved patient care.
   Conclusions: The large knowledge gap related to EBPR suggests the need to incorporate structured training into the core-curriculum of training programmes in radiology. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective Data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is limited in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Design A community-based concurrent mixed-method study. Setting In a community setting. Participants Adult residents (n=422) of Akaki Kality subcity who were recruited by a two stage sampling technique and 24 adults who were selected purposively were included for the quantitative and qualitative part of the study respectively. Outcome measures Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semistructured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. Results One out five (19.1%, 95% CI 15.3% to 24.6%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.89), having negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.02), and primary information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.37). Study participants have predominantly stated that they did not have enough information about the vaccine, feared it would not be effective or have too many side effects, and reflected their uncertainty towards the quality of the vaccine. Conclusions A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccines and unwilling to accept them. This was due to the misconceptions, negative attitudes and use of social media as their primary source of information. Providing the community with health education and consistent efforts to enhance the prevention measures are important, particularly using different medias including social media.

AB  - Background Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most prevalent mental health disorder after childbirth, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, PPD is known to have a long-term influence on the mother and the newborn, and the role of social support network is crucial in early illness recognition. This study aims to evaluate the social support networks' level of knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding PPD and examine their sociodemographic variables and exposure to the public information relating to PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online Google Form disseminated to people in Klang Valley through WhatsApp, Email, Facebook, Instagram and other available social media among postpartum women's social support networks aged 18 years and living in the Klang Valley area (N = 394). Data were collected from 1 March to 5 July 2021 and analysed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and generalised linear mixed models. Results During the COVID-19 epidemic in Klang Valley, most participants had good knowledge, negative attitudes and awareness of PPD. Marital status, gender and parity all had significant correlations with the amount of awareness regarding PPD. Ethnicity, gender, parity and educational level showed significant association with attitude towards PPD. No significant relationship was noted between sociodemographic variables and PPD beliefs. Public awareness of PPD was also associated with knowledge and attitude towards it. Conclusions A significant positive knowledge, negative attitude and negative awareness level of PPD exist among social support networks for postnatal women. However, no significant effect of belief on PPD awareness level was noted. Implications Insight campaigns and public education about PPD should be conducted to enhance postnatal mothers' awareness and knowledge. Postnatal care, mental check-ups and counselling sessions for the new mothers are recommended. In future studies, a closer assessment of postpartum social support, variances and similarities across women from diverse racial/ethnic origins is critical. Strengths and limitations This cross-sectional study is one of the early studies on the area of PPD in the Malaysian region during COVID-19. Numerous data have been collected using low-cost approaches using self-administered surveys through Google Forms in this research.

AB  - The potential of mitigating the spreading rate and consequences of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) currently depends on adherence to sanitary protocols (e.g., hand hygiene and social distancing). The current study aimed to investigate the role of fatalism and comparative optimism for adherence to COVID-19 protocols. We also tested whether these factors are directly associated with adherence or associated through attitudinal mediation. The results were based on a web survey conducted among university students (n = 370) in Tehran, Iran. The respondents completed a multidimensional measure of fatalism (general fatalism, internality, and luck) and measures of comparative optimism, attitudes toward COVID-19 health measures, and adherence. The estimated structural equation model explained approximately 40% of the total variance in attitudes toward COVID-19 protocols and adherence. As expected, high internality was associated with stronger adherence, whereas luck was associated with weaker adherence. Comparative optimism was more strongly associated with adherence than fatalism, and somewhat unexpectedly comparative optimism was associated with stronger adherence. Analyses of direct and indirect effects suggested that fatalism was mainly mediated through attitudes, whereas comparative optimism had both direct and mediated effects. The findings are discussed in relation to the role of these social psychological factors for COVID-19 mitigation.

AB  - Radiotherapy is life-saving treatment which ought to be guaranteed for all cancer patients who are indicated. While this is so, it is incumbent on the management of radiotherapy centres to ensure that patients, patient care-givers and radiotherapy personnel are at all times safe within the radiotherapy facility. Cancer patients are known to have increased risk for respiratory viruses like Covid-19 due to the compromised immune state of such persons. It is thus important to institute adequate safety measures in radiotherapy centres to prevent infection of cancer patients during the global Covid-19 pandemic. A survey conducted in 12 radiotherapy centres in 8 African countries has highlighted key measures needing implementation to ensure safety against Covid-19 infections. The safety measures were indexed on a 16-point questionnaire covering 5 main areas of staffing, radiotherapy environment, equipment and treatment protocols, patient condition and scheduling, and education/sensitization. The study shows that use of personal protective equipment, provision of hand washing and sanitizing facilities, social distance observance, restrictions for patient care-givers, provision of isolation unit meant for holding suspected Covid-19 cases, existence of working protocols, and Covid-19 safety education for staff are fully complied with by the surveyed radiotherapy centres. A greater portion of the centres, are however, without radiotherapy facilities solely dedicated for suspicious and confirmed Covid-19 cases. Strict adherence of the safety measures is highly essential to contain the spread and prevent infection of the disease to patients, care-givers and staff of the radiotherapy departments.

AB  - Aims: Quantitative survey research findings reveal that Western countries have lower rates of public stigma surrounding mental illness than other nations. However, qualitative media research across selected Western countries reports differences in stigmatising messages. Here, we take an in-depth look at country-level data exploring both similarities and differences in this stigma across three countries. Specifically, we use previous findings on global differences in public stigma and media to examine whether there is a correspondence between themes in newspaper reporting and variations in attitudes across seven stigma dimensions. Methods: The Stigma in Global Context - Mental Health Study provides nationally representative data from Iceland (N=1033; response rate=71%), Germany (N=1255; response rate=63.16%) and the USA (N=1425; response rate=67.31%). We limit analyses to respondents who received a vignette describing an individual meeting clinical criterion for schizophrenia or depression. Exploratory data analyses are used to examine overall patterns and cross-national differences. Results: Graphical analyses show patterned similarities, especially for more individuals endorsing social distance as contact becomes more intimate. However, results also corroborate cross-national differences documented in media research. More Americans endorse evaluations of dangerousness, to both self and others. Fewer Icelanders report exclusionary tendencies, whilst Germans report the most consistently moderate levels of stigma. Conclusions: While Western nations tend to report similar, lower levels of stigma globally, they each have unique areas of concern. Anti-stigma programs must take note of both similarities and differences to tailor their efforts to the local context.

KW  - HEALTH
KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Objective: To examine how video messages from a recent media campaign affected public attitudes about obesity prevention and weight-based stigma toward obese children.
   Design and Methods: A survey-embedded experiment in May-June 2012 with nationally representative sample (N = 1,677) was conducted. Participants were randomized to view one of three messages of children recounting struggles with obesity, or to a control group. It was examined whether message exposure affected attitudes about: 1) the seriousness of childhood obesity and its consequences; 2) responsibility for addressing obesity; 3) support for prevention policies, and 4) stigma toward obese children.
   Results: Participants viewing the messages attributed greater responsibility for addressing childhood obesity to the food and beverage industry, schools, and the government, compared to those in the control group. Overweight and female respondents viewing the messages reported lower weight-based stigma compared with overweight and female respondents in the control group, but messages had no effect on healthy weight and male respondents. Messages did not affect attitudes about the seriousness of childhood obesity, its consequences, or support for obesity prevention policies.
   Conclusions: It will be critical to assess on an ongoing basis how communication campaigns addressing childhood obesity shape public attitudes about obesity prevention.

KW  - Science education
AB  - Problem Statement: With the Internet becoming an inseperable part of our lives, the role of social media in daily life is rapidly increasing with each passing day. In this respect, it is important to identify the purposes of teacher candidates in using social media tools that rapidly improve and become widespread in teacher training institutions.
   Purpose of the Study: In this study, it is intended to identify the variables by which the purposes of science teacher candidates in using social media vary and their opinions about the use of social media in education.
   Methodology: For this purpose, a scale on the use of social media by teacher candidates has been applied to a sample group of 255 people. The data was evaluated quantitatively with SPSS 17.00 software. In order to identify the views of science teacher candidates on the use of social media in education, five open-ended questions were asked to five people who were randomly selected from the sample group.
   Findings and interpretation: The research results show that the purposes of science teacher candidates in using social media vary according to demographic characteristics (sex, grade level, family income) and to variables related to Internet usage (frequency of Internet usage, the time spent on the Internet, blog ownership, the purpose of using the Internet, the frequently used social media tools). It is found that science teaching students generally have a positive attitude towards the use of social media in education.
   Conclusion and Discussion: It is possible to create educational settings for scientific discussions and for sharing ideas on social media. With the use of these settings in education, a lot of activities that will be time-consuming in the class environment can be carried out on social media and science teaching students can be offered many opportunities and tools such as enjoyable homework assignments, complementary videos etc. For example, after the lesson on the subject of cell is completed in the class environment, a video about the structures forming the cell can be shared with the group on the Facebook and a related discussion can be initiated between students where the teacher can also contribute with comments. Or the followers of the teacher can share the stages of an experiment on Twitter and everybody can contribute to the design of a new experiment.

AB  - This study seeks to contribute to the growing body of scholarship about the Internet's role in authoritarian and transitioning countries. Based on two original surveys of Russian and Ukrainian Internet users, online behaviors were classified as either primarily capital enhancing or recreational in terms of their democratic potential. Indirect and differential models of how these types of Internet use are associated with citizen demand for democracy were tested using serial mediation. Capital-enhancing use exhibited an indirect positive effect on demand for democratic governance by increasing critical appraisals of the incumbent regime, whereas recreational Internet was associated with satisfactory evaluations of non-democratic regimes and more entrenched authoritarian worldviews.

AB  - Social media plays a crucial role in controlling the epidemic spreading by creating awareness. Epidemic spreading processes over the multiplex network where epidemic spreading in one layer and awareness spreading in another layer, are well suitable to study the spreading of infection in a small region. Using the Microscopic Markov chain approach (MMCA), the dynamical interplay between the spreading of epidemics over the physical contact layer and human awareness diffusion over the virtual contact layer over a multiplex network framework is analyzed. SEIR process for epidemic spreading and UAU process for awareness diffusion are assumed to study the spreading process of COVID-19. The basic-reproduction number R-0 is determined using the next generation matrix approach. The stability of disease-free equilibrium (DFE) and endemic equilibrium (EE) is analyzed. Using Pontryagins Minimum Principle, optimal parametric values are determined analytically for testing and cleaning the virus-contaminated surfaces. The impact of various parameters over the epidemic spread is analyzed numerically. Through numerical illustrations, the effect of early identification of exposed people and immediate cleaning of virus-contaminated surfaces over R-0 studied. The sensitivity analysis is performed to show the importance of wearing face-mask, following social distancing, washing hands frequently and, avoiding unnecessary travel. Through numerical simulations, the results obtained coincide with real data of COVID-19 spreading in the city Chennai, India. The results obtained show that in order to control or discard the spreading of COVID-19, each people should follow the self-preventive measures without relaxation till the epidemic comes nearer to the disease free state.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government took security measures to try to limit infections. Restrictive measures included social distancing, home confinement and the closure of all public structures like gyms and swimming pools. The impact of these limitations on health and lifestyle was inevitably negative. The purpose of this study was to establish the level of physical activity (PA), expressed as energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) in a Southern Italian population before and during the COVID-19 lockdown.
   METHODS: An adapted version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form (IPAQ-SF) was published on the official Website of the National Institute of Gastroenterology IRCCS S. de Bettis, Castellana Grotte, Bari, Italy and on several social media in May 2020.
   RESULTS: Three hundred ten replies (72% women) from Apulia (60%), Calabria (28%), Campania (11%) and Sicily (1%) were included in the study. The COVID-19 lockdown had a negative effect on the vigorous PA intensity level and on walking, but not on the moderate PA intensity level. Additionally. daily time spent sitting down increased by more than 12% during the COVID-19 lockdown.
   CONCLUSIONS: Isolation changed PA behaviors. The decreased energy expenditure (MET-minute/week) during the lockdown had a negative impact in both genders, especially on the young adults and adults' groups.

AB  - These days, it is common to see celebrities advocating various controversial, socio-political issues On digital platforms. However, existing research does not demonstrate how the public perceives this activist approach of celebrities and how it influences their brand image. Drawing a parallel from brand activism literature and its effect on consumer behavior, the current study examines the impact of celebrity activism on celebrities' brand value. The findings support that perception of authenticity and hypocrisy affect attitude towards the celebrity and celebrity brand self-connection, which influences celebrity brand loyalty, identification, and intention to purchase the brands endorsed by the celebrity. A negative attitude towards celebrity activism negatively moderates the effect of celebrity brand self-connection on celebrity brand identification. The study contributes to the literature on celebrity branding and celebrity activism. The findings can help celebrity brand managers and PR professionals to understand the strategic implications of celebrity activism.

AB  - This study tests the effects of the portrayal of negative consequences of alcohol use on beliefs and attitudes toward alcohol consumption. In a between-subjects experiment (N=108), participants were randomly assigned to watch one of three conditions. One group of participants watched a version of an edited episode of the reality program Jersey Shore in which alcohol use had negative consequences, another group watched a version of the episode in which alcohol use had more positive consequences, and a control group was not exposed to any program. Results showed that participants who saw the version with negative consequences had more negative beliefs about alcohol and more negative attitudes toward beer than participants who saw the more positive consequences and participants in the control condition. This indicates that the portrayal of negative consequences can have positive outcomes for viewers' health beliefs and attitudes, reducing their positivity toward alcohol use.

KW  - COMPENDIUM
AB  - Background: Social media became an integral part of the lives of people because it encourages social relations and shares interests, activities, and real-life connections. As quarantine and lockdown orders are prolonged, many people, as well as those physically active individuals, typically responded to this stressful condition by using social media platforms.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Objective: This study aimed to examine the level of physical activity of physically active individuals and their attitudes toward social media use during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Methods: A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted among physically active individuals in Saudi Arabia between June 2020 and July 2020. An online survey was employed among eligible participants who completed a self-administered questionnaire that covered reasons for physical activity and attitudes toward social media platforms during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
   & nbsp;</p>
   Results: Of these 323 participants, 29.1% were in the age group of 18-24 years, 66.6% were women, and 67.8% were single. The proportion of participants whose metabolic equivalent of tasks-min/week from vigorous activity < 1,680 was 31.9%, and all of the participants follow people or pages in social media related to sports teams and fitness models. The average number of hours spent on social media per day was 2.95 +/-& nbsp;0.90 h. The majority of the participants showed positive attitudes toward social media used for exercise and physical activity. Of the eight variables, age, level of physical activity, and the average of hours spent on social media emerged as significant predictors of attitudes toward the use of social media (P < 0.05).</p>
   Conclusions: The present survey results indicate adverse consequences of home quarantine as reflected by a small proportion of participants who had differences in levels of vigorous activities during the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia. Social media appears to be a key avenue to promote and disseminate health interventions to promote physical activity during this COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

AB  - Background: Worldwide, mental health is a big problem and Saudi Arabia is not far behind in observing this. It seems that progress in the field of mental health is slow. Interventions in mental health education have resulted in positive results. Participation by family members, sensitization to care and social integration include some of methods believed to target understanding and counter stigma surrounding mental illness. Aim: To assess mental health literacy among female students of secondary schools in Abha city, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study from May 2019 to 2020 was conducted at the female governmental secondary schools in Abha sector. A total sample of 350 female students from a total of 5000 students were included. Sampled students were selected from secondary schools using probability proportionate to size using two stage cluster sample technique. Data were collected from students directly using pre-structured questionnaire. The researchers created the study questionnaire after extensive literature review and expert consultation. Results: Almost half (48.9%) study participants had good awareness of the signs and indications of anxiety and depression. Loss of confidence and poor self-esteem were identified as signs of depression by 81%, sleep disturbance by 77% and disturbed appetite by 76.2% participants. Parent's education level and occupation, participant's educational performance and family living arrangement were significantly related with their awareness in univariate analysis. Father's education level (ORA = 1.45), maternal engagement with occupation (ORA = 4.18) and participant living with parents (ORA = 5.4) were identified as predictors of mental health awareness. Social media was reported as the most common source of awareness. The approach towards individuals with mental illness were helpful. Conclusions and recommendations: In conclusion, the study revealed that secondary school students had satisfactory awareness level regarding mental health and its impact. They exhibited positive attitude towards friendship with person having mental illness.

AB  - Introduction: Oral hygiene care during pregnancy is critically substantial. Nevertheless, previous studies indicated that pregnant women uptake less oral health care during pregnancy. There are some reasons that hinder pregnant women receive oral health care. Additionally, dentists are hesitant to treat pregnant women for fear of causing harm to the mother and foetus. Studies have not reported the perception of dentists about oral health care during pregnancy in Turkey.
   Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practices of dentists about oral health care during pregnancy.
   Materials and Methods: A questionnaire was prepared by reviewing the literature regarding dental care during pregnancy. A total of 210 questionnaire were distributed to dentists in Isparta and Burdur, Turkey and 200 (95.2%) completed surveys were returned. Statistical analyses were performed by chi-square test.
   Results: Most of the dentists were knowledgeable about oral health care during pregnancy but had limited knowledge about the safety of radiographs during this period and early childhood caries. Only 27.5% of the dentists were sure about radiographs could be securely taken during this period. Around 48% of the dentists believed that poor maternal oral health can contribute to early childhood decay. The majority of the dentists in this study knew that basic dental treatment is safe during pregnancy (84%) and were aware of the dental procedures that are safe to undertake during this period. The dentists were knowledgeable about the safety of using medications (51.5-100%). The dentists had rather positive attitude towards perinatal oral health (59.5-99.5%). Higher proportions of the dentists stated that they wanted further information about dental care during pregnancy (77%).
   Conclusion: The findings from this survey suggest a large consensus among dentists in the management of pregnant women. Nevertheless, further research with more national sample is recommended to confirm these findings. Education programs and practice guidelines on perinatal oral health can be beneficial for dentists to provide dental care during pregnancy.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to address the situation that although the theoretical benefits of using drama projects in the Teaching of English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) have been described in a number of studies, researchers have identified a lack of literature on their practical use, particularly in terms of different institutional settings, teaching styles, learning styles and proficiency levels. This paper therefore describes three case studies in universities in Korea, showing that the use of drama projects can be successfully used in different teaching situations and is an effective means of promoting meaningful language learning in students often demotivated by traditional methods and the test-driven classroom.
   Design/methodology/approach - In these adult-learner EFL settings, a process approach to drama projects aimed to promote meaningful language acquisition and holistic learning in students of different proficiencies and majors. Drama projects were used as: syllabus supplementation by an individual teacher in a Korean-mediated English program (Case Study 1); core content on an English-mediated pre-service teacher training course (Case Study 2); and syllabus content on a Freshman English program taught by 25 native-speaking instructors (Case Study 3). Data were collected from pre/post-course questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and students' evaluations. These were then triangulated to identify trends in participant perceptions.
   Findings - Results indicated positive attitude change and promotion of cognition, positive affect and social skills in all three case studies, confirming earlier research findings and showing that the drama project is a viable and effective educational tool for the foreign language teacher, from individual syllabus supplementation to incorporation into a language program curriculum. Rather than resisting the innovation presented by drama projects, the adult learners involved welcomed the opportunities for creativity, autonomy, group work and performance.
   Originality/value - The practical confirmation of the theoretical benefits of EFL drama projects across individual and institutional settings indicates the potential value of including them in university language programs and teacher-training EFL curricula, enabling and encouraging language teachers to promote holistic, meaningful language learning.

AB  - Simple Summary Long distance transport of livestock from one continent to another by ship raises concerns about the welfare of the animals on board the ship. Media exposes may have influenced the public towards negative views about the trade. A total of 522 members of the public in Brisbane, Australia, were surveyed just before and after an expose of cruelty to sheep on board ships destined for the Middle East in 2017. More respondents had negative than positive attitudes towards the trade and almost one half had seen the media expose. The expose increased the proportion of respondents indicating that they were familiar with the trade, and although it did not affect those indicating negative feelings towards it, it increased the proportion believing the trade should end.
   The long distance export of livestock from Australia to Asia has long aroused controversy for suspected animal welfare concerns during and after the voyage. However, there is little or no information on the attitude of the Australian public towards this trade. A total of 522 Australians were surveyed in Brisbane to find out about their understanding of the trade, their attitudes towards it and the influence of demographic factors. Approximately one half of respondents were surveyed just before a media expose of cruelty on sheep shipments in 2017 from Australia to the Middle East and one half just after the expose, to see the impact of media depiction of cruel treatment of live export sheep. Most respondents believed that they were familiar with the industry, and more after the media expose than before. More respondents had negative than positive feelings about the trade, and just over a quarter had no feelings. Twice as many thought it should be ended than maintained, particularly women, but 40% said that it depends, mainly on ethics and animal-based reasons. Those that thought it should not be ended mainly did so to support farmers and the country's economy. Almost one half had seen the media expose, particularly older respondents, and expressions of sadness, empathy for the animals and anger were the most common responses to such footage. Although it increased the number of people saying that they were familiar with the trade, it did not affect people's view of the trade, except that fewer indicated that ending the trade was dependent on other factors. It is concluded that the majority of Australian respondents in one capital city had negative views towards the live export trade, and that a media expose had some influence on this view.

AB  - Departing from the synchronic trend dominant in social semiotics research, this study examines the diachronic interplay between semiotic cues governing power relations, and global political power dynamics. It examines thirty years of photographic coverage given to Iran inTimeMagazine, focusing specifically on diachronic interaction analysis (Kress and van Leeuwen 2006, Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design. London: Routledge). The significance of these discourses is examined with an interdisciplinary conceptual lens comprising of social semiotics (Kress and van Leeuwen 2006, Reading Images: The Grammar of Visual Design. London: Routledge) and critical theory (Butler 1993, Bodies That Matter: On the Discursive Limits of Sex. New York: Routledge). The analysis reveals the even amongst a routinely "othered" national community, some actors are rendered more "valuable" by the camera. Specifically, the interactive cues of gaze, camera angle and social distance accord more power to male dissidents, and female trailblazers, discursive choices serving as an indictment of Iran's socio-political systems. Furthermore, this paper extends van Leeuwen's (2008, "Representing Social Actors." In Discourse and Practice, edited by T. van Leeuwen. New York: Routledge) work on visual "othering," and suggests three new categories for examining how visual cues create "valuable bodies": adjacency, subjectivation, and empowerment.

AB  - Emotion regulation deficits may link stigma to poor mental health, yet authors of existing studies have relied on self-reported stigma and have not considered contextual factors. In the present research, we examined associations among cultural stigma (i.e., objective devaluation of one's stigmatized status), emotion regulation deficits, and poor mental health. In Study 1, we created an index of cultural stigma by asking members of the general public and stigma experts to indicate desired social distance toward 93 stigmatized attributes. In Study 2, emotion regulation deficits mediated the association between cultural stigma and adverse mental health outcomes, including depressive symptoms and alcohol use problems, among individuals endorsing diverse stigmatized identities. The indirect effect of cultural stigma, via emotion regulation, on these outcomes was stronger among those reporting more life stress. These findings highlight the adverse impact of cultural stigma on mental health and its role in potentiating stigmatized individuals' susceptibility to general life stress.

AB  - During the last several years, the Croatian public has been shaken by tragic violent events involving children within the family. In 2017 a mother killed her threeyear-old son, and in 2019 a father attempted to murder his four minor children. When such things occur, the media and the public try to determine why they were not prevented and who is responsible for their prevention, and the ones who are most frequently considered as responsible are social workers. The aim of this research is to analyse discursive constructions (narratives, rhetorical techniques) within media articles on social workers on the occasion of high-profile cases of child abuse. Discursive psychology was used as an analysis method. 76 articles published on the most frequented news portals in Croatia were analysed. The portals were selected on the basis of the number of actual users according to the data by Gemius Rating and a Reuters survey of users' self-reports about visiting web sites. The analysed articles were published in the period from May 24, 2017 to October24, 2018 and in the period from February 28, 2019 to July 1, 2019. Results indicate that in reporting on critical events of child abuse the most frequent narrative in the media is "inadequate action of social workers". In that narrative the media and the public criticise social workers for failure to provide adequate protection to children and consider that they are not professional enough. In response to that narrative, there are narratives about "social workers as the victims of inadequate system", "social welfare system in crisis", and "positive attitude towards social workers". Within these narratives, social workers and professional organisations educate the public on shortcomings and difficulties within the social welfare system that hinder the work of social workers, which can lead to violations of the users' rights. They also call upon relevant authorities to undertake necessary reforms. Social workers are characterised as professional and committed to their work. Two additional narratives also appear: "problems in public services" and "a call for making changes". In the narrative about problems in public services, lawyers and judges mention problems in court proceedings related to the protection of the rights of children, but they also question the knowledge and professionalism of social workers. In the narrative about the need to make changes, professional or ganisations demand that the authorities and the public turn towards reforms instead of criticism of social workers.

AB  - Background
   Certified nursing assistants (CNAs) in palliative care units often encounter the death of patients and undergo emotional burdens because of their altruistic practices. However, the influences of altruism and perceptions of death on the work morale of CNAs remain unclear. The fact that morale can be improved by modifying related factors justifies the necessity of a theoretical model of morale for CNAs. However, such a model is currently absent. Based on relevant literature, factors including altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction are related to morale through the mediation of job stress.
   Aim
   This study was aimed toward determining the influencing factors and developing a structural model of morale with regard to CNAs working in palliative care units.
   Design
   The hypothesized model was tested in a cross-sectional design with structural equation modeling using AMOS 23.
   Setting/Participants
   A total of 413 CNAs from five hospice units in Taiwan participated in the survey.
   Results
   Goodness-of-fit indexes, including chi(2)/DF = 2.187, PGFI = 0.461, and PNFI = 0.462, among others, confirmed the modified model fit the data well. Altruism, social support, perceptions of death, and job satisfaction were negatively related to job stress (-0.238, -0.196, -0.204, and -0.131, respectively). Altruism and social support positively affected job satisfaction (0.635 and 0.553). Factors directly affecting morale included altruism, social support, job stress, and job satisfaction (0.837, 0.711, -0.244, and 0.540, respectively). The relationship between altruism and morale was the strongest among all the direct paths toward morale. Job stress was the major mediator in these relationships.
   Conclusion
   Altruism is imperative for morale. The confirmed model is called the Five Constructs to Morale (5CM) model. These findings indicate the need to assess the levels of altruism and perceptions of death during the recruitment of CNAs. From the perspective of human resource management and organizational behavior, CNAs with a high level of altruism and a positive attitude toward death assure the well-being of end of life patients because of work involvement and commitment to the challenging work of hospice care. The cultivation of a supportive environment and coping strategies are suggested for the management of CNAs facing patient death. Hospice care decision makers should carefully assess morale levels among health professionals by applying the 5CM model. Identifying modifiable factors that can improve morale among nursing staff in hospice care to ensure work fulfillment and quality care merits emphasis in clinical practice. The establishment of effective strategies to facilitate the work morale of nursing staff is suggested for palliative care units. Morale improvement related task should be a global public health priority.

AB  - Background: Recently, significant research effort has focused on using Twitter (and other social media) to investigate mental health at the population-level. While there has been influential work in developing ethical guidelines for Internet discussion forum-based research in public health, there is currently limited work focused on addressing ethical problems in Twitter-based public health research, and less still that considers these issues from users' own perspectives. In this work, we aim to investigate public attitudes towards utilizing public domain Twitter data for population-level mental health monitoring using a qualitative methodology.
   Methods: The study explores user perspectives in a series of five, 2-h focus group interviews. Following a semi-structured protocol, 26 Twitter users with and without a diagnosed history of depression discussed general Twitter use, along with privacy expectations, and ethical issues in using social media for health monitoring, with a particular focus on mental health monitoring. Transcripts were then transcribed, redacted, and coded using a constant comparative approach.
   Results: While participants expressed a wide range of opinions, there was an overall trend towards a relatively positive view of using public domain Twitter data as a resource for population level mental health monitoring, provided that results are appropriately aggregated. Results are divided into five sections: (1) a profile of respondents' Twitter use patterns and use variability; (2) users' privacy expectations, including expectations regarding data reach and permanence; (3) attitudes towards social media based population-level health monitoring in general, and attitudes towards mental health monitoring in particular; (4) attitudes towards individual versus population-level health monitoring; and (5) users' own recommendations for the appropriate regulation of population-level mental health monitoring.
   Conclusions: Focus group data reveal a wide range of attitudes towards the use of public-domain social media "big data" in population health research, from enthusiasm, through acceptance, to opposition. Study results highlight new perspectives in the discussion of ethical use of public data, particularly with respect to consent, privacy, and oversight.

AB  - Popular discourse provides a window into predominant social beliefs. To assess predominant beliefs about child sexual abuse, this exploratory, descriptive study examines the discourse surrounding a high-profile child abuse case that involved over 100 victims and culminated in the arrest of a well-known Delaware pediatrician in 2009. The Dr. Earl Bradley case, dominated local news media for more than a year. Online comments from the state's primary newspaper were collected and analyzed to identify themes. Coding analysis found that popular discourse overwhelmingly explained the abuse as the fault of the victims' parents, putatively, the mothers. Commenters engaged in direct blaming of parents, thus, at least to some extent, shifting blame from the offender and the institutional systems that failed to adequately react to the allegations of abuse to the victims' parents. Newspaper comments also demonstrated social distancing which, in addition to the comments attributing blame to the parents, served to excuse and distract from the responsibility of authority figs. or structural change. Although comments that defended parents did appear, these instances were far less frequent than comments blaming the parents, which illustrates a trend to individualize rather than activate collective challenges, therefore putting the onus on victims to police the powerful. Overall, institutional malfeasance eclipsed the well-being of children, and public commentary displayed an implicitly gendered parent-bashing, diminishing the responsibility of the professionals.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to study the impact of Chief Executive Officer's (CEO's) personality traits on open innovation (OI) strategies and the mediating effect of innovation climate by mobilizing the upper echelons theory and the OI literature. In fact, CEO's role in OI promotion has been under-investigated in the literature especially in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and in developing economies. Design/methodology/approach Based on the structural equation modeling, a survey is scheduled by administrating a questionnaire within 178 CEOs in Tunisian high-tech sector. The relevance of the empirical evidences is to disclose human levers to the success of OI strategies in the Tunisian context as a developing country. Findings The results show the importance of CEO's entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and attitude in promoting innovation climate and so then OI strategies. The study offers a reading grid for managers of high-tech SMEs to better lead and identify key factors for OI adoption. Innovative climate is found to be a relevant driver of OI encompassing the key role of attitude and EO of top managers. Practical implications Results highlight the relevance of the recruitment of appropriate top managers with high levels of EO and with positive attitude toward OI in order to facilitate OI integration and to enhance SMEs' competitiveness. Entrepreneurially oriented CEOs should be required in order to overcome "Not Invented Here" and "Not Shared Here" syndromes, to support innovative climate and to encourage knowledge import and export in the Tunisian SMEs. Originality/value This paper sheds light on the micro-foundation of OI by emphasizing the relevance of human factors and namely EO and attitude of CEOs in OI issue. It provides conceptual and empirical clarification of the extent to which CEO's traits affect OI through innovative climate. This would value initiatives exploring key individual's characteristics influence on OI strategies within SMEs.

AB  - Background The perception of organ donation and brain death among Syrian population has not been previously explored. The goal of this study is to evaluate the attitude and knowledge of organ donation among Syrians and the willingness of this population to donate their organs. Methods We conducted a survey-based cross-sectional study in four hospitals in Aleppo, Syria in November 2019. Patient demographic, awareness of brain death; and attitude toward organ donation were collected and analyzed. Results A total of 350 individuals were invited to participate in the survey among whom 303 (197 females, 106 males) agreed to participate in the study (87% response rate). The majority of our participants (n = 249, 82%) heard about organ donation with television (n = 166, 55%), social media (n = 77, 25%), and the internet (n = 77, 25%) being the most common sources of information. When assessing knowledge about brain death, only 40% (n = 116) answered 3 or more questions (out of 5) correctly. Fifty-eight percent (n = 176) of respondents agreed with the idea of organ donation and 183 (62%) would like to donate their organs one day. The leading motivation to organ donation was the desire to help (n = 234, 77%), while the most common reason to refuse donation was the refusal to disfigure a dead body by removing an organ (n = 125, 41%). Religious reasons were cited as motivation for organ donation by 43% of participants (n = 130), and a reason for refusing to donate organs by 24% (n = 71). Most respondents (n = 261, 88%) were unaware of the laws and legislations related to organ donation in Syria. When asked if religion and law were encouraging organ donation, 76% of respondents (n = 226) would donate their organs. Although more positive attitude was found in those with better brain death knowledge (score >= 3), this did not translate into more willingness to donate organs in this group of participants. Conclusions The promotion of organ donations from deceased donors is a necessity given the rising shortage of organs. The information provided by this study could help policy makers build future strategies to promote deceased organ donation programs and overcome current obstacles preventing such initiatives from achieving their goals.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdown and social distancing led to changes to breastfeeding support available to women in the United Kingdom. Face-to-face professional support was reduced, and face-to-face peer support was cancelled. Anecdotal media accounts highlighted practices separating some mothers and babies in hospitals, alongside inaccurate stories of the safety of breastfeeding circulating. Meanwhile, new families were confined to their homes, separated from families and support networks. Given that we know breastfeeding is best supported by practices that keep mother and baby together, high-quality professional and peer-to-peer support, and positive maternal well-being, it is important to understand the impact of the pandemic upon the ability to breastfeed. To explore this, we conducted an online survey with 1219 breastfeeding mothers in the United Kingdom with a baby 0-12 months old to understand the impact of the pandemic upon breastfeeding duration, experiences and support. The results highlighted two very different experiences: 41.8% of mothers felt that breastfeeding was protected due to lockdown, but 27.0% of mothers struggled to get support and had numerous barriers stemming from lockdown with some stopped breastfeeding before they were ready. Mothers with a lower education, with more challenging living circumstances and from Black and minority ethnic backgrounds were more likely to find the impact of lockdown challenging and stop breastfeeding. The findings are vital in understanding how we now support those women who may be grieving their loss of breastfeeding and are affected by their negative experiences and how we can learn from those with a positive experience to make sure all breastfeeding women are better supported if similar future events arise.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic is exerting major pressures on society, health and social care services and science. Understanding the progression and current impact of the pandemic is fundamental to planning, management and mitigation of future impact on the population. Surveillance is the core function of any public health system, and a multi-component surveillance system for COVID-19 is essential to understand the burden across the different strata of any health system and the population. Many countries and public health bodies utilise 'syndromic surveillance' (using real-time, often non-specific symptom/preliminary diagnosis information collected during routine healthcare provision) to supplement public health surveillance programmes. The current COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a series of unprecedented challenges to syndromic surveillance including: the impact of media reporting during early stages of the pandemic; changes in healthcare-seeking behaviour resulting from government guidance on social distancing and accessing healthcare services; and changes in clinical coding and patient management systems. These have impacted on the presentation of syndromic outputs, with changes in denominators creating challenges for the interpretation of surveillance data. Monitoring changes in healthcare utilisation is key to interpreting COVID-19 surveillance data, which can then be used to better understand the impact of the pandemic on the population. Syndromic surveillance systems have had to adapt to encompass these changes, whilst also innovating by taking opportunities to work with data providers to establish new data feeds and develop new COVID-19 indicators. These developments are supporting the current public health response to COVID-19, and will also be instrumental in the continued and future fight against the disease.

AB  - In the past three decades, email has become one of the most widely used forms of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in student-professor interactions in the academic context. In particular, language use in email writing by English as a foreign language (EFL) learners has been studied extensively. This research investigates the students' perceptions of email communication and the social factors which are perceived as influential to email communication. In this study, we implemented a questionnaire and focus-group interviews. Two-hundred and one Taiwanese EFL learners from a university located in central Taiwan were recruited for the questionnaire, and 20 learners were selected from the larger group to participate in the interviews. The questionnaire investigated the students' perceptions of email usage and their evaluation of emails. The interviews, on the other hand, were conducted to gather in-depth information. The findings from both the questionnaire and interviews indicated that the students tended to recognize the university context and email medium as formal. Furthermore, power asymmetry in the student-professor relationship played a more important role than social distance, which led to a choice of formal language style in the email correspondences. However, despite the fact that the students recognized email as a formal medium of communication and called for a formal style of language, they did not seem to be equipped with sufficient pragmalinguistic resources to perform appropriate requests. Instruction is therefore suggested for EFL learners to conduct form-function-context mapping to achieve appropriateness.

AB  - Introduction:Depictions of infant feeding practices in the media influence public attitudes toward breastfeeding and breastfeeding behaviors. Understanding how breastfeeding is represented in the media can provide insights into breastfeeding experiences and outcomes. This study describes trends in breastfeeding portrayals in the United States newsprint media between 2007 and 2016. Methods:We conducted a retrospective content analysis of 452 newspaper articles identified from the Nexis Uni database. Articles were coded for tone toward breastfeeding (supporting, neutral, or opposing), message frame, and region (Midwest, South, West, Northeast). We frequency weighted articles by publication circulation to account for differences in readership volume. Results:Findings indicate that breastfeeding has been positively portrayed and increasingly discussed. Among the four regions, the South had the most supportive tones, while the Midwest had the most opposing tones. The topics of Health Benefits and Breastfeeding Support and Resources received the most coverage. Positive portrayals surrounding Workplace/University Issues are increasing, while negative portrayals surrounding Indecent Exposure are decreasing. Conclusion:Positive portrayals of breastfeeding in newspapers may signify increased support for breastfeeding as a normal practice. Future research is needed to better understand the direct and indirect impact of newsprint messages on breastfeeding in the United States.

AB  - Individuals who are strongly oriented towards market-based values are more likely to devalue groups identified as "unprofitable" from an economic point of view. Drawing on insights from Institutional Anomie Theory (IAT), this study explores economically legitimized prejudice in light of a far-reaching economization of the institutional and cultural structure. Multilevel models using data from the European Social Survey (2018) show that hostility towards immigrants is expressed more among individuals who strongly embrace market-based values and in countries where the institutional structure is dominated by the economy and non-economic social institutions are enfeebled (institutional imbalance). Aggregated market-based values (a "marketized anomic culture") mediate the effect of a) individual market-based values and b) institutional imbalance on anti-immigrant attitudes. This study contributes to a better understanding of group prejudice under conditions of economization. It shows that applying IAT within a multilevel framework offers a fruitful explanation not only for crime but for other sociological phenomena.

AB  - Understanding the transmission process is crucial for the prevention and mitigation of COVID-19 spread. This paper contributes to the COVID-19 knowledge by analyzing the incubation period, the transmission rate from close contact to infection, and the properties of multiple-generation transmission. The data regarding these parameters are extracted from a detailed line-list database of 9,120 cases reported in mainland China from January 15 to February 29, 2020. The incubation period of COVID-19 has a mean, median, and mode of 7.83, 7, and 5 days, and, in 12.5% of cases, more than 14 days. The number of close contacts for these cases during the incubation period and a few days before hospitalization follows a log-normal distribution, which may lead to super-spreading events. The disease transmission rate from close contact roughly decreases in line with the number of close contacts with median 0.13. The average secondary cases are 2.10, 1.35, and 2.2 for the first, second, and third generations conditioned on at least one offspring. However, the ratio of no further spread in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th generations are 26.2, 93.9, and 90.7%, respectively. Moreover, the conditioned reproduction number in the second generation is geometrically distributed. Our findings suggest that, in order to effectively control the pandemic, prevention measures, such as social distancing, wearing masks, and isolating from close contacts, would be the most important and least costly measures.

AB  - Background: Social distancing and mask-wearing were recommended and mandatory for people during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: A web-based questionnaire was disseminated through social media assessing mask type preference and COVID-19 history amongst tertiary sector services and the rates of the triad of respiratory symptoms in each mask type, along with other respiratory-related parameters. Results: Amongst 4107 participants, 63.4% of the responders, mainly women, preferred medical/surgical masks; 20.5%, mainly men, preferred cotton cloth masks; and 13.8% preferred FFP/(K)N95 masks. COVID-19 history was less common in FFP/(K)N95 compared to medical/surgical (9.2% vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) or cloth masks (9.2% vs. 14.4%, p = 0.006). Compared to the control group (rare mask-wearing, nonsmokers and without lung conditions), those wearing one medical mask were more likely to report frequent sputum production (4.4% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.026) and frequent cough (4.4% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.013), and those wearing FFP/(K)N95 masks were more likely to report frequent cough (4.1% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.048). Compared to the control group, those preferring cotton cloth masks were more likely to report a frequent cough (7.3% vs. 1.6%, p = 0.0002), sputum production (6.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.003) and dyspnea (8% vs. 1.3%, p = 0.00001). Conclusions: Safe mask-wearing should be in parallel with a more personalized and social interaction approach.

AB  - Introduction: The spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is controlled by timely detection of infected patients using a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab test, followed by isolation and treatment. One challenge encountered with NP swab collection was to train healthcare providers (HCPs) with different training backgrounds and experience for collecting NP swab specimens across Nebraska, including a sizeable rural area. In-person training for NP swab collection skills was challenging due to social distancing. We developed a Just-In-Time-Online Training (JITOT) and delivered it using Facebook Live (TM) to meet our HCPs' training needs.
   Methods: Online training was held on April 21, 2020, and attended by 453 HCPs. A quasi-experimental study based on a survey and a multiple choice questionnaire (MCQ) was conducted to evaluate its effectiveness in improving the participants' knowledge and attitudes.
   Results: Group mean knowledge score increased from a pre-test score of 57%-95% in the post-test showing a large effect size (Hedges' g = 0.976877). On a five-point Likert scale, the majority (86.21%) of the survey respondents agreed/strongly agreed that this training increased their overall comfort for nasal swab specimen collection as compared to their pre-training comfort (37.93%) with this procedure. The majority of respondents (96.55%) in the post-training evaluation agreed/strongly agreed that "the delivery method was appropriate."
   Conclusion: A JITOT session is helpful to teach, demonstrate, clarify doubts, and improve the knowledge and comfort of the participants. It can be quickly delivered using a free social media platform for broader outreach during public health emergencies.

AB  - Purpose:
   To determine whether perceived changes (i.e. perception of engagement during the pandemic relative to pre-pandemic) in specific health behaviors differ by weight status (i.e. healthy weight, overweight, obese).
   Design:
   Cross-sectional. Recruitment took place between June-August 2020, via social media posts and Qualtrics online panels.
   Setting:
   Participants completed the survey online through the Qualtrics platform.
   Sample:
   Analyses included N = 502 participants (>= 18 years); 45.2% healthy weight (n = 227), 28.5% overweight (n = 143), and 26.3% obese (n = 132).
   Measures:
   Study-specific survey items included questions about demographics and perceived changes in health behaviors.
   Analysis:
   Logistic regression models, adjusted for age, race, ethnicity, gender, education, and COVID-19 diagnosis, assessed the odds of perceiving changes in health behaviors considered a risk for weight gain.
   Results:
   Participants with obesity, but not overweight, were significantly more likely to report deleterious changes to health behaviors compared to healthy weight peers, including: (1) decreased fruit/vegetable consumption [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.92; 95% confidence interval (CI): (1.13, 3.26)]; (2) increased processed food consumption [AOR = 1.85; 95%CI: (1.15, 3.00)]; (3) increased caloric intake [AOR = 1.66; 95% CI: (1.06, 2.61)]; (4) decreased physical activity [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.31, 3.28)]; and (5) deterioration in sleep quality [AOR = 2.07; 95%CI: (1.32, 3.25)].
   Conclusion:
   Our findings suggest that adults with obesity may be at greater risk for unhealthy behaviors during a period of prolonged social distancing, potentially exacerbating the obesity epidemic.

AB  - Individuals with depression encounter stigmatization from others. Accordingly, there have been numerous calls for theory-based approaches to reduce stigma. Attribution theory is a useful framework for antistigma efforts because it provides insight into emotional and behavioral responses toward those in need of assistance. In service of improving antistigma efforts, the purpose of the current studies was to investigate the effects of perceived controllability and perceived stability of depression on responses to individuals with the illness. Moreover, as the impact of depression-particularly perceived stability-is likely to have greater implications for a loved one than an acquaintance, the current studies tested the moderating effect of interpersonal relationship on the attribution-emotion-helping sequence. Moderated mediation analyses were conducted to test whether the indirect effect of attributions (i.e., perceived controllability and perceived stability) on behavioral intentions (i.e., willingness to provide social support [WPSS]; desire for social distance [DSD]) through affect (i.e., sympathy, anger) was moderated by interpersonal relationship (i.e., close other, acquaintance). Findings revealed that regardless of interpersonal relationship, perceiving depression as controllable elicited more anger and less sympathy, which in turn reduced WPSS and increased DSD. Further, results indicated that among close others, perceived stability led to less sympathy, more anger, and consequently, less WPSS and greater DSD. For acquaintances, however, perceived stability was not associated with differences in emotional responses. These results indicate that relational aspects of help provision are important to consider and that perceived stability may have untoward effects among loved ones of individuals with depression.

AB  - Objective: Individuals with serious mental illnesses are very likely to interact with police officers. The crisis intervention team (CIT) model is being widely implemented by police departments across the United States to improve officers' responses. However, little research exists on officer-level outcomes. The authors compared officers with or without CIT training on six key constructs related to the CIT model: knowledge about mental illnesses, attitudes about serious mental illnesses and treatments, self-efficacy for deescalating crisis situations and making referrals to mental health services, stigmatizing attitudes, deescalation skills, and referral decisions. Methods: The sample included 586 officers, 251 of whom had received the 40-hour CIT training (median of 22 months before the study), from six police departments in Georgia. In-depth, in-person assessments of officers' knowledge, attitudes, and skills were administered. Many measures were linked to two vignettes, in written and video formats, depicting typical police encounters with individuals with psychosis or with suicidality. Results: CIT-trained officers had consistently better scores on knowledge, diverse attitudes about mental illnesses and their treatments, self-efficacy for interacting with someone with psychosis or suicidality, social distance stigma, deescalation skills, and referral decisions. Effect sizes for some measures, including deescalation skills and referral decisions pertaining to psychosis, were substantial (d=.71 and .57, respectively, p<.001). Conclusions: CIT training of police officers resulted in sizable and persisting improvements in diverse aspects of knowledge, attitudes, and skills. Research should now address potential outcomes at the system level and for individuals with whom officers interact.

AB  - Misconception and stigma towards epilepsy have a profound impact on this disease in Africa. An unselected sample of Zambian people was interviewed to investigate their knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy. Proper/improper answers were scored, and a composite score was developed with negative values for unsatisfactory awareness and high stigma levels. The sample comprised 231 people residing in urban ( 107) or in rural ( 124) areas. The median and interquartile range of scores for epilepsy awareness and stigma were, respectively, -1 (-3;+1) and +1(-1;+6). Poor education was the only significant predictor of unsatisfactory awareness ( p = 0.0131), while education and residency were significantly associated with stigma ( p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0004). Rural people were mostly in the highest stigma level (44.2%) and urban people in the lowest stigma level (60.4%). Misconception and negative attitudes towards epilepsy among Zambian people reflect poor education and rural residency. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Hand-washing is regarded as a potentially important behavior for preventing transmission of respiratory infection, particularly during a pandemic.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to evaluate whether a Web-based intervention can encourage more frequent hand-washing in the home, and to examine potential mediators and moderators of outcomes, as a necessary first step before testing effects of the intervention on infection rates in the PRIMIT trial (PRimary care trial of a website based Infection control intervention to Modify Influenza-like illness and respiratory infection Transmission).
   Methods: In a parallel-group pragmatic exploratory trial design, 517 nonblinded adults recruited through primary care were automatically randomly assigned to a fully automated intervention comprising 4 sessions of tailored motivational messages and self-regulation support (n = 324) or to a no-intervention control group (n = 179; ratio 2:1). Hand-washing frequency and theory of planned behavior cognitions relating to hand-washing were assessed by online questionnaires at baseline (in only half of the control participants, to permit evaluation of effects of baseline assessment on effect sizes), at 4 weeks (postintervention; all participants), and at 12 weeks.
   Results: Hand-washing rates in the intervention group were higher at 4 weeks than in the control group (mean 4.40, n = 285 and mean 4.04, n = 157, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.42) and remained higher at 12 weeks (mean 4.45, n = 282 and mean 4.12, n = 154, respectively; P < .001, Cohen d = 0.34). Hand-washing intentions and positive attitudes toward hand-washing increased more from baseline to 4 weeks in the intervention group than in the control group. Mediation analyses revealed positive indirect effects of the intervention on change in hand-washing via intentions (coefficient = .15, 95% confidence interval [CI], .08-.26) and attitudes (coefficient = 0.16, 95% CI, .09-.26). Moderator analyses confirmed that the intervention was similarly effective for men and women, those of higher and lower socioeconomic status, and those with higher and lower levels of perceived risk.
   Conclusions: This study provides promising evidence that Web-based interventions could potentially provide an effective method of promoting hand hygiene in the home. Data were collected during the 2010 influenza pandemic, when participants in both groups had already been exposed to extensive publicity about the need for hand hygiene, suggesting that our intervention could add to existing public health campaigns. However, further research is required to determine the effects of the intervention on actual infection rates.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the types and sources of information sought by older adults along with their motivations in the Midwestern United States. Design/methodology/approach Interviews were conducted with 30 older adults residing in rural communities around the Midwestern United States during late-summer (July/August) 2020, using a protocol based on Dervin's Sense-Making Methodology. The resulting data was analyzed using standard content analysis procedures, guided by the theoretical frameworks based on Dervin's Sense-Making and Williamson's Ecological Model of Information Behavior. Implications of COVID-19 for the normative behaviors described in these models are discussed. Findings Findings show that older adults were concerned primarily with health and political information during this period, but that this information was not necessarily sought only to address an informational need, but also to satisfy the need to maintain social and emotional connections in coping with isolation and loneliness. Sources of information that allowed for social interaction with people were favored. Wider personal networks (community members) were strained by the social distancing measures and closures. These findings have theoretical and practical implications for considering the impact of social restrictions on information seeking behaviors of older adults in a time of crisis. Originality/value This study is the first, known to the authors, that applied the two adopted theoretical frameworks to explore information seeking behaviors of older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to propose and test a theoretical framework in which attitude towards COVID-19 cause-related campaigns mediates the effects of identification with the cause, donation size, emotional arousal and subjective norms on consumer purchase intention. The authors also explore the moderating effect of religiosity in an emerging nation marked by the dominance of the Islamic doctrine. Design/methodology/approach Survey data from a sample of 561 consumers from Morocco were analyzed to test the hypotheses using structural equation modeling. Findings First, attitude toward COVID-19 cause-related campaigns has a significant effect on consumer purchase intention; at the same time, it is influenced by identification with the cause, donation size, emotional arousal and subjective norms. Second, the results confirm the mediating effect of attitude toward COVID-19 cause-related campaigns, e.g. higher emotional arousal triggers positive attitude towards COVID-19 cause campaigns, which shapes consumer purchase intention. Third, Islamic religiosity acts as a moderator, e.g. individuals who feel themselves as highly religious are more likely to develop favorable attitude towards cause brands and therefore form stronger purchase intentions when exposed to COVID-19 cause campaigns. Practical implications The findings of this research suggest a number of practical and social implications for both academics and practitioners. Successful cause-related marketing (CrM) campaigns should include facets inducing emotional arousal, superior donation size, identification with the cause and subjective norms, which, in turn, enhances consumers' attitude toward the campaign, their attitude towards the brand and purchase intentions. Practitioners interested in expanding into majority-Muslim markets should also consider the use of faith-based messages and religious morals when planning CrM campaigns. Originality/value While preliminary studies have already attempted to provide knowledge about the impact of COVID-19 on individuals' health and well-being, potential effects on consumers' decisions and behavior have not been considered much and are yet to be empirically investigated. This original research is among the first to provide insights about the potential use of COVID-19 cause to shape consumer purchase intention and behavior. This will strengthen our cross-cultural appreciation of the disparities in consumer perception of CrM among Muslim and non-Muslim communities.

AB  - BackgroundPrenatal alcohol consumption is a serious public health concern that is considered as one of the preventable risk factors for neonatal and childhood morbidity and several adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to determine the individual- and community-level predictors of maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy in Gondar town, Northwest Ethiopia.MethodsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among pregnant women in Gondar town from 13 June to 24 August 2019. A cluster random sampling technique was used to select 1237 pregnant women. Data collection was carried out using the AUDIT-C pretested standard questionnaire. Bivariable and multivariable multilevel logistic regression analyses were computed to identify predictors of alcohol consumption using the odds ratio, 95% CI, and p-value<0.05.ResultsThe prevalence of alcohol consumption during pregnancy was found to be 30.26% (95% CI: 27.74%, 32.91%). The study revealed that pregnant women who have a low knowledge level on harmful effect of alcohol consumption (AOR=3.2; 95% CI: 1.9, 5.4), positive attitude towards alcohol consumption (AOR=7.5; 95% 5, 11), history of pre-pregnancy alcohol consumption (AOR=4.8; 95% CI: 3.4, 6.9), whose partner consume alcohol (AOR=3.9; 95% CI: 2.5, 6), a perception that alcohol consumption is culturally or socially acceptable (AOR=3.6; 95% CI: 2.4, 5.3), who were encouraged by their partners to consume alcohol (AOR=4; 95% CI: 1.9, 8) were significantly associated with pregnancy alcohol consumption. Concerning the community-level characteristics, who had not ever heard/media exposure about the risk of alcohol drinking during pregnancy (AOR=3; 95% CI: 1.7, 5.5), and who were from low community women's education attainment (AOR=4; 95% CI: 2.2, 7.7) were statistically significant predictors of alcohol consumption during pregnancy.ConclusionsThe study revealed that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is prevalent in Gondar town. Both individual- and community-level predictors were found to be associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy. Policymakers may take into account these predictors for individual and community-based interventions to which our results appear to point.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the sanitary measures of social distance brought impasses to Social Research and its future. Research in digital environments was already booming, but now that face-to-face activities are temporarily suspended, it becomes an alternative to enable the continuity of studies. Understanding it better is an epistemological and methodological need for all researchers. Thus, the objective of this essay is to propose some theoretical and methodological considerations on qualitative research in the different digital environments formed by the Internet 2.0. We point out some introductory aspects and tensions considered strategic for those who are going to start their work in social networks supported by the Internet. We organized the article based on the following topics: (1) digital sociality; (2) the "digital environment" and the blurring of boundaries between real-virtual; (3) the redefinition of the meaning of "field" in the digital environment; (4) the different cultural uses of digital platforms; (5) platforms as producers of discursive genres; (6) the production and extraction of collections. The essay seeks to demonstrate that research in digital environments reveals an exponential field of possibilities, whether to explore the forms that this sociality assumes in our daily lives, or to modulate our (inter)subjectivities, as it allows the production of identity narratives and performances, associations for different purposes, among many other possibilities. However, it demands an understanding of social action based on the synergy of the socio-technical-cultural contexts that structure it.

AB  - This essay examines how the Ukrainian and Russian government-owned newspapers, Uriadovyi Kurier and Rossiiskaya Gazeta, represent people displaced by the war in Donbas, analysing the political goals revealed by these publications' attitudes towards the displaced. While the Ukrainian publication delimits the nation by distinguishing 'real' internally displaced people (IDPs) deserving help and 'fake' IDPs guilty of siphoning Ukrainian taxpayers' money to rebel-held areas, the Russian paper foregrounds the Russian state's competence in managing displacement while silencing the displaced themselves.

KW  - MASI
AB  - Since November 1999, people arriving in Ireland to seek asylum have been dispersed throughout the country and confined in Direct Provision (DP) accommodation centres. Though initially meant for a six-month stay, by May 2020 7,700 people were living in 85 DP and emergency accommodation centres, many of them for up to nine years. The centres are operated by for-profit private companies who have been paid 1.6 billion euros since 2000, and are mostly sited in remote locations outside cities, on the periphery of society. The confinement of asylum seekers has been disavowed by state and society and continues the disavowal by Irish state and society of the coercive confinement of unwed mothers and poor children in church-run institutions, where women and children were confined and enslaved until late in the twentieth century.
   This article is based on interviews with and publicly available testimonies of asylum seekers in Direct Provision and on public and social media statements by the Movement of Asylum Seekers in Ireland (MASI). It theorizes the DP centres as racialized zones of nonbeing (Fanon 1967: 8) and the DP regime as racialized state violence. The segregation and racialization of asylum seekers in Direct Provision were poignantly demonstrated by asylum seekers' inability to observe social distancing in overcrowded DP centres during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, leading to a considerable number of them being infected.

AB  - Background: Efforts to explain negative attitudes toward obese people have centered on beliefs about the controllability of body weight, whereas other processes (such as the emotion of disgust) have been largely ignored. This study examined the role of disgust in evaluations of obese people, as well as other social groups (for example smokers, drug addicts, women, homosexuals, politicians).
   Method: In three studies, participants (total N = 524) made ratings of how much they believe that obesity is a matter of personal control, indicated how disgusted they are with obese people, and reported their attitudes toward obese people. In Study 1, participants also made similar ratings (perceptions of control over group membership, disgust, and attitudes) for 15 additional social groups.
   Results: Disgust was the strongest predictor of negative attitudes toward obese people, and disgust fully mediated the association between perceptions of control and attitudes toward obese people. In addition, obese people were rated less favorably, and as more disgusting, than almost all social groups. Across all social groups, perceived control over group membership was positively correlated with disgust ratings, and disgust mediated the link between perceived control and favorability ratings.
   Conclusion: These findings indicate that disgust is an important, yet understudied, component of weight bias. Furthermore, these findings situate representations of obesity in a broader context by establishing similarities with other social groups.

AB  - Latino immigrant men who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk for HIV and delayed diagnosis in the United States. This paper describes the evaluation of a pilot of the Tu Amigo Pepe, a multimedia HIV testing campaign aimed at Latino MSM in Seattle, WA particularly targeting immigrants who may not identify as gay, ages 18-30 years old. The 16-week campaign included Spanish-language radio public service announcements (PSAs), a Web site, social media outreach, a reminder system using mobile technology, print materials and a toll-free hotline. In developing the PSAs, the Integrated Behavioral Model was used as a framework to reframe negative attitudes, beliefs and norms towards HIV testing with positive ones as well as to promote self-efficacy towards HIV testing. The campaign had a significant and immediate impact on attitudes, beliefs, norms and self-efficacy towards HIV testing as well as on actual behavior, with HIV testing rates increasing over time.

AB  - Studies have shown individuals with chronic illnesses tend to experience poorer mental health compared to their counterparts without a chronic illness under the COVID-19 pandemic. The pervasive disruption on daily lifestyles due to social distancing could be a contributing factor. In this study, we collaborated with local patient support groups to explore the psychological adjustment among a group of community-dwelling individuals with chronic illnesses under the COVID-19 pandemic in Hong Kong. We collected responses from 408 adults with one or more chronic illnesses using an online survey. Results show that about one in four participants experienced moderate to high levels of depression (26.0%), anxiety (26.2%) and stress (20.1%) symptoms measured by the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale and the World Health Organisation-Five Well-Being Index. While 62.3% (gatherings) to 91.9% (contact with others) of participants reported changes in their daily lifestyles, these changes-both an increase and a decrease-were related to poorer mental health. The relationship was mediated by psychological resilience, measured by the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, with an estimate of indirect effect of -0.28 (95% confidence interval -0.44 to -0.10). In light of our findings, we urge social and healthcare professionals to support chronic illness patients to continue their daily lifestyles such as exercises and social contacts as much as possible by educating the public on feasible and practical preventive measures and enhance the psychological resilience of community-dwelling patients with scalable and efficacious psychological interventions.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has potential to disrupt and burden the mental health care system, and to magnify inequalities experienced by mental health service users. Methods We investigated staff reports regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in its early weeks on mental health care and mental health service users in the UK using a mixed methods online survey. Recruitment channels included professional associations and networks, charities, and social media. Quantitative findings were reported with descriptive statistics, and content analysis conducted for qualitative data. Results 2,180 staff from a range of sectors, professions, and specialties participated. Immediate infection control concerns were highly salient for inpatient staff, new ways of working for community staff. Multiple rapid adaptations and innovations in response to the crisis were described, especially remote working. This was cautiously welcomed but found successful in only some clinical situations. Staff had specific concerns about many groups of service users, including people whose conditions are exacerbated by pandemic anxieties and social disruptions; people experiencing loneliness, domestic abuse and family conflict; those unable to understand and follow social distancing requirements; and those who cannot engage with remote care. Conclusion This overview of staff concerns and experiences in the early COVID-19 pandemic suggests directions for further research and service development: we suggest that how to combine infection control and a therapeutic environment in hospital, and how to achieve effective and targeted tele-health implementation in the community, should be priorities. The limitations of our convenience sample must be noted.

AB  - South Africa ranks third among 22 high burden countries in the world. TB which remains a leading cause of death causes one in five adult deaths in South Africa. An in-depth understanding of knowledge, attitudes and practices of young people towards TB is required to implement meaningful interventions. We analysed young men and women (18-24 years)'s TB knowledge including TB/HIV coinfections, testing rates and factors associated with them. A cross sectional cluster-based household survey was conducted in two provinces. Participants completed computer-assisted self-interviews on TB knowledge, testing history and TB/HIV coinfections. A participant was regarded as knowledgeable of TB if s/he correctly answered the WHO-adopted TB knowledge questions. We built three multivariate regression models in Stata 13.0 to assess factors associated with knowing TB alone, testing alone and both knowing and testing for TB. 1955 participants were interviewed (89.9% response rate). Their median age was 20 years (IQR19-22). Sixteen percent (16.2%) of the participants were social grant recipients, 55% were enrolled in a school/college and 5% lived in substandard houses. A total of 72% had knowledge of TB, 21% underwent screening tests for TB and 14.7% knew and tested for TB. Factors associated with TB knowledge were being female, younger, a student, social grant recipient, not transacting sex and having positive attitudes towards people living with HIV (PLWH). Factors associated with TB testing were being a student, receiving a social grant, living in OR Tambo district, HIV knowledge and having a family member with TB history. Factors associated with both TB knowledge and testing were being female, a student, using the print media, living in OR Tambo district and having a family member with a TB history. The study demonstrates the importance of demographic factors (gender, economic status, family TB history, and location) and HIV factors in explaining TB knowledge and testing. We recommend extending community TB testing services to increase testing.

AB  - In theory, candidate debates can influence voters by providing information about candidates' quality and policy positions. However, there is limited evidence about whether and why debates influence voters in new democracies. We use a field experiment on parliamentary debates during Ghana's 2016 elections to show that debates improve voters' evaluations of candidates. Debates have the strongest effect on partisan voters, who become more favorable toward and more likely to vote for opponent-party candidates and less likely to vote for co-partisans. Experimental and unique observational data capturing participants' second-by-second reactions to the debates show that policy information was the most important causal mechanism driving partisan moderation, especially among strong partisans. A follow-up survey shows that these effects persist in electorally competitive communities, whereas they dissipate in party strongholds. Policy-centered debates have the potential to reduce partisan polarization in new democracies, but the local political context conditions the persistence of these effects.

AB  - Background and rationale: Ageism in nursing, particularly regarding oldest-old adults (age >= 80 years), adversely affects patient safety and care quality. Nurse education can reduce ageist attitudes. Swedish and Austrian nursing students' attitudes towards adults age >= 80 years have not been assessed.
   Aims: To analyse attitudes towards adults age >= 80 years among nursing students from universities in Sweden and Austria.
   Design: A prospective cross-sectional survey including the four-factor, 26-item validated Ageing Semantic Differential scale and demographic questions.
   Methods: A pen-and-paper survey was administered to nursing students at the Medical University of Graz, Austria (May-June 2019); an online survey was conducted at the University of Gothenburg, Sweden (January-June 2020). Demographic data were analysed descriptively; means and individual item ratings were calculated for each country. Multiple logistic regression was performed for each factor of the instrument: (1) Instrumentality, (2) Autonomy, (3) Acceptability and (4) Integrity. Six independent variables were included in the regression analysis.
   Results: In total, 136 Austrian and 222 Swedish students responded (88% women). Compared with Austrian students, Swedish students were older and had more positive attitudes about oldest-old adults. Swedish students' median factor ratings (7-point scale) were 3.62 (Factor 1), 3.50 (Factor 2), 2.71 (Factor 3) and 3.80 (Factor 4). Austrian students' median ratings were 4.25 (Factor 1), 3.83 (Factor 2), 3.28 (Factor 3) and 4.00 (Factor 4). Regression analyses showed that the variables country, older family member/acquaintance, and age were associated with the different factors.
   Discussion: Compared with Austrian students, Swedish students' attitudes towards oldest-old adults were more favourable. We discussed the findings at individual, interpersonal/intergroup and societal/cultural levels and present implications for education and research.
   Conclusions: Nurse education should address ageism as a multilevel phenomenon, and include the person-centred care perspective. Further research comparing nursing students' attitudes from different cultures is needed.

AB  - Background: Mobile eHealth apps are important tools in personal health care management. The Patient Journey app was developed to inform patients with musculoskeletal disorders during their perioperative period. The app contains timely information, video exercises, and functional tasks. Although the Patient Journey app and other health apps are widely used, little research is available on how patients appreciate these apps.
   Objective: The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the user-friendliness of the Patient Journey app in terms of its usability and the attitudes of users toward the app. The secondary aim was to evaluate positive and negative user experiences.
   Methods: A web-based questionnaire was sent to 2114 patients scheduled for surgery for a musculoskeletal disorder. Primary outcomes were usability (measured with the System Usability Scale) and user attitudes regarding the Patient Journey app (assessed with the second part of the eHealth Impact Questionnaire). The secondary outcomes were evaluated with multiple choice questions and open-ended questions, which were analyzed via inductive thematic content analyses.
   Results: Of the 940 patients who responded, 526 used the Patient Journey app. The usability of the app was high (System Usability Scale: median 85.0, IQR 72.5-92.5), and users had a positive attitude toward the Information and Presentation provided via the app (eHealth Impact Questionnaire: median 78.0, IQR 68.8-84.4). The app did not adequately improve the users' confidence in discussing health with others (eHealth Impact Questionnaire: median 63.9, IQR 50.0-75.0) or motivation to manage health (eHealth Impact Questionnaire: median 61.1, IQR 55.6-72.2). Three core themes emerged regarding positive and negative user experiences: (1) content and information, (2) expectations and experiences, and (3) technical performance. Users experienced timely information and instructions positively and found that the app prepared and guided them optimally through the perioperative period. Negative user experiences were overly optimistic information, scarcely presented information about pain (medication), lack of reference data, insufficient information regarding clinical course deviations and complications, and lack of interaction with clinicians.
   Conclusions: The Patient Journey app is a usable, informative, and presentable tool to inform patients with musculoskeletal disorders during their perioperative period. The qualitative analyses identified aspects that can further improve the user experiences of the app.

AB  - A growing body of research has given attention to issues surrounding genetic testing, including expanded carrier screening (ECS), an elective medical test that allows planning or expecting parents to consider the potential occurrence of genetic diseases and disorders in their children. These studies have noted the role of the mass media in driving public perceptions about such testing, giving particular attention to ways in which coverage of genetics and genetic testing broadly may drive public attitudes and choices concerning the morality, legality, ethics, and parental well-being involved in genetic technologies. However, few studies have explored how mass media are covering the newer test, ECS. Drawing on health-related framing studies that have shown in varying degrees the impact particular frames such as gain/loss and thematic/episodic can have on the public, this study examines the frame selection employed by online media in its coverage of ECS. This analysiscombined with an analysis of the sources and topics used in such coverage and how they relate to selected frameshelps to clarify how mass media are covering an increasingly important medical test and offers considerations of how such coverage may inform mass media scholarship as well as health-related practices.

AB  - This paper analyzes key psychological themes in language used by prominent conspiracy theorists and science advocates on Twitter, as well as those of a random sample of their follower base. We conducted a variety of psycholinguistic analyses over a corpus of 16,290 influencer tweets and 160,949 follower tweets in order to evaluate stable intergroup differences in language use among those who subscribe or are exposed to conspiratorial content and those who are focused on scientific content. Our results indicate significant differences in the use of negative emotion (e.g., anger) between the two groups, as well as a focus, especially among conspiracy theorists, on topics such as death, religion, and power. Surprisingly, we found less pronounced differences in cognitive processes (e.g., certainty) and outgroup language. Our results add to a growing literature on the psychological characteristics underlying a "conspiracist worldview."

AB  - How to understand the propagation properties of infectious diseases among the population is an important topic in the field of epidemic modelling. In this paper, we investigate the interaction between the disease transmission and disease-related awareness spread, and then propose a new coupled disease spreading model on a two-layered multiplex network, where one layer denotes the underlying topology for the epidemics and the other one represents the corresponding topology for the awareness spread. In the current model, once the information about the disease is acquired by some susceptible ones, it is assumed that they will take the preventive measures to reduce the probability of being infected (e.g., social distancing or taking the vaccine). In the epidemic layer, the transmission dynamics among nodes can be characterized with the classic SIR (susceptible-infective-recovered) model, and those individuals who obtain the disease information will cut down their rate of being infected with a multiplicative factor y during the course of disease transmission: while in the awareness layer, we will employ the UAU (unaware-aware-unaware) model to denote the diffusion of information. Meanwhile, we explore the impact of mass media on the spread of infectious diseases in the model. Based on the microscopic Markovian chain approach, we build the probability tree to describe the switching process among different states and then establish the different equations for the state transition in detail. Furthermore, we analytically derive the epidemic threshold regarding the disease propagation, which is correlated with the multiplex network topology and the coupling relationship between two classes of spreading dynamics, and extensive simulations also validate the theoretical predictions. Current results are beneficial for us to deeply understand the contagion characteristics of real epidemics within the population. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought this fast-moving world to a standstill. The impact of this pandemic is massive, and the only strategy to curb the rapid spread of the disease is to follow social distancing. The imposed lockdown, resulting in the closure of business activities, public places, fitness and activity centers, and overall social life, has hampered many aspects of the lives of people including routine fitness activities of fitness freaks, which has resulted in various psychological issues and serious fitness and health concerns. In the present paper, the authors aimed at understanding the unique experiences of fitness freaks during the period of lockdown due to COVID-19. The paper also intended to explore the ways in which alternate exercises and fitness activities at home helped them deal with psychological issues and physical health consequences. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with 22 adults who were regularly working out in the gym before the COVID-19 pandemic but stayed at home during the nationwide lockdown. The analysis revealed that during the initial phase of lockdown, the participants had a negative situational perception and a lack of motivation for fitness exercise. They also showed psychological health concerns and overdependence on social media in spending their free time. However, there was a gradual increase in positive self-perception and motivation to overcome their dependence on gym and fitness equipment and to continue fitness exercises at home. Participants also tended to play music as a tool while working out. The regular fitness workout at home during the lockdown greatly helped them to overcome psychological issues and fitness concerns.

AB  - BackgroundResults In Western Australia, the media has reported on an increase in the purchasing, repairs and use of bicycles during the COVID-19 period. The study aimed to investigate for a relationship in bicycle related injuries in the paediatric population during the time of COVID-19 restrictions.
   Methods A retrospective study of the incident of motorized and non-motorized bicycle related injuries and trauma presentations during the COVID-19 'shutdown' period from March to June 2020. Data were collected from the Emergency Department Information System, discharge summaries, operation and radiology reports. The data presented is from Perth Children's Hospital, the only tertiary paediatric hospital and the only referral centre for childhood trauma in the state of Western Australia. Participants were children aged 15 years and younger attending the emergency department (ED) at Perth Children's Hospital during the designated time period. The primary outcomes included total ED presentations, bicycle related presentations and bicycle related admissions during the COVID-19 period.
   Bicycle related presentations to the ED increased by 42.7% over the COVID-19 period from 1.4% to 3.0% of all children attending the ED. Children admitted to the hospital with bicycle related injuries or trauma increased by 48.7% from 76 to 113 children in comparison to the same period in 2019.
   Conclusion During the period of COVID-19 restrictions, paediatric ED presentations decreased dramatically, but bicycle related injuries and trauma increased substantially. Safety equipment including helmets and protective gear should be worn for all children riding bicycles, and social distancing should be maintained.

AB  - Stigma can hamper full inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities in society. For other minority groups, higher levels of familiarity with these groups have been shown to relate to lower levels of stigma, whereby emotions can play a mediating role. However, concerning people with intellectual disabilities, there is limited knowledge regarding the general public's levels of familiarity, its relationship with stigma, and the role of emotions in this relationship. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of the Dutch population (n = 892). The relationship between levels of familiarity and different measures of stigma representing cognitive, emotional, and behavioral aspects of stigma (i.e., attributions, emotions, discrimination) was examined. Emotions (fear, anger, and sympathy) were studied as a mediator in the relationship between familiarity and discrimination (i.e.. social distance, and intention to help). Participants who reported no familiarity in real life with people with intellectual disabilities (30.6% of the population sample) demonstrated higher levels of stigma (attributions, emotions, discrimination) than participants who reported any form of real-life familiarity (69.4% of the sample). Fear was found to be the most important mediator of the relationship between familiarity and discrimination. The findings stress the continuing importance to advocate for people with intellectual disabilities to be recognized and become known within society. This increased familiarity might reduce stigma and increase positive experiences of inclusion. Support workers may have a vital role in this process. The importance of fear in the relationship between familiarity and discrimination may inform future research and antistigma interventions.

AB  - This study aims to identify the potential association of mental health and social media forum during the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 brings a lot of challenges to government globally. Among the different strategies the most extensively adopted ones were lockdown, social distancing, and isolation among others. Most people with no mental illness history have been found with high risk of distress and psychological discomfort due to anxiety of being infected with the virus. Panic among people due to COVID-19 spread faster than the disease itself. The misinformation and excessive usage of social media in this pandemic era have adversely affected mental health across the world. Due to limited historical data, psychiatrists are finding it difficult to cure the mental illness of people resulting from the pandemic repercussion, fueled by social media forum. In this study the methodology used for data extraction is by considering the implications of social network platforms (such as Reddit) and levering the capabilities of a semi-supervised co-training technique-based use of Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. The experimental results shows the efficacy of the proposed methodology to identify the mental illness level (such as anxiety, bipolar disorder, depression, PTSD, schizophrenia, and OCD) of those who are in anxious of being infected with this virus. We observed 1 to 5% improvement in the classification decision through the proposed method as compared to state-of-the-art classifiers.

AB  - Allogeneic umbilical cord blood (UCB) donation is a pro-social behaviour directed to strangers that has a certain cost for the donor. Although the promotion of such behaviour is an important goal for many countries' health systems, little is known about the reasons that would lead to it. With this study, we explored how the impact of social closeness on altruism and trust could be related to UCB donation in a sample of new-mothers (N = 167). Participants played hypothetical Dictator and Trust games with socially close (e.g., parents) or distant (e.g., strangers) others. They donated more money to parents and siblings compared to cousins, friends and strangers and they trusted more parents, siblings and friends than cousins and strangers. Interestingly, the lower the impact of social closeness on altruism (i.e., generosity towards socially distant others), the higher the intention and the actual probability of UCB donation. A mediation analysis has shown that the relationship between social closeness on altruism and UCB donation was mediated by objective intention to donate (i.e., having followed all the procedures needed). These findings show that other-oriented motivations towards distant others might have important practical implications in identifying the targets of interventions for the promotion of UCB donation.

AB  - Background: Wikipedia is one of the most accessed sources of health information online. The current English-language Wikipedia contains more than 28,000 articles pertaining to health.
   Objective: The aim was to characterize individuals' motivations for contributing to health content on the English-language Wikipedia.
   Methods: A set of health-related articles were randomly selected and recent contributors invited to complete an online questionnaire and follow-up interview (by Skype, by email, or face-to-face). Interviews were transcribed and analyzed using thematic analysis and a realist grounded theory approach.
   Results: A total of 32 Wikipedians (31 men) completed the questionnaire and 17 were interviewed. Those completing the questionnaire had a mean age of 39 (range 12-59) years; 16 had a postgraduate qualification, 10 had or were currently studying for an undergraduate qualification, 3 had no more than secondary education, and 3 were still in secondary education. In all, 15 were currently working in a health-related field (primarily clinicians). The median period for which they have been an active editing Wikipedia was 3-5 years. Of this group, 12 were in the United States, 6 were in the United Kingdom, 4 were in Canada, and the remainder from another 8 countries. Two-thirds spoke more than 1 language and 90% (29/32) were also active contributors in domains other than health. Wikipedians in this study were identified as health professionals, professionals with specific health interests, students, and individuals with health problems. Based on the interviews, their motivations for editing health-related content were summarized in 5 strongly interrelated categories: education (learning about subjects by editing articles), help (wanting to improve and maintain Wikipedia), responsibility (responsibility, often a professional responsibility, to provide good quality health information to readers), fulfillment (editing Wikipedia as a fun, relaxing, engaging, and rewarding activity), and positive attitude to Wikipedia (belief in the value of Wikipedia). An additional factor, hostility (from other contributors), was identified that negatively affected Wikipedians' motivations.
   Conclusions: Contributions to Wikipedia's health-related content in this study were made by both health specialists and laypeople of varying editorial skills. Their motivations for contributing stem from an inherent drive based on values, standards, and beliefs. It became apparent that the community who most actively monitor and edit health-related articles is very small. Although some contributors correspond to a model of "knowledge philanthropists," others were focused on maintaining articles (improving spelling and grammar, organization, and handling vandalism). There is a need for more people to be involved in Wikipedia's health-related content.

AB  - Aims. Suicide rates are increased among unemployed individuals and mental illness stigma can contribute to both unemployment and suicidality. Persons with mental illness perceive negative attitudes among the general public and experience discrimination in their everyday life (=public stigma components) potentially leading to self-stigma and anticipated discrimination (=individual stigma components). Previous research found evidence for an association between aspects of mental illness stigma and suicidality, but has not yet clarified the underlying pathways explaining how different stigma components interact and contribute to suicidal ideation.
   Method. Public and individual stigma components and their association with suicidal ideation were examined among 227 unemployed persons with mental illness. A path model linking public stigma components (experienced discrimination, perceived stigma) with suicidal ideation, mediated by individual stigma components (anticipated discrimination, self-stigma), was examined using structural equation modelling within Mplus.
   Results. Our sample was equally split in terms of gender, on average 43 years old and about half reported no suicidal ideation during the past 30 days. In bivariate analyses all stigma components were significantly associated with suicidal ideation. In the path model and controlling for symptoms, the association between experienced discrimination and suicidal ideation was fully mediated by anticipated discrimination and self-stigma. Perceived stigma's contribution to suicidal ideation was fully mediated by anticipated discrimination, but not by self-stigma.
   Conclusions. In general, programmes addressing multiple stigma components seem to be most effective in improving suicide prevention. Besides interventions targeting negative attitudes and discriminating behaviours of the general public, programmes to support persons with mental illness in coping with perceived and experienced stigma could improve suicide prevention. Future studies should test the short- and long-term effects of such interventions on suicidality and further investigate the role of stigma coping (e.g. secrecy) and emotional consequences (e.g. hopelessness and loneliness) for the association between stigma components and suicidality.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the knowledge of basic principles of responsible conduct of research and attitude toward the violations of good scientific practice among graduate biomedical students.
   Methods: A total of 361 subjects entered the study. The study group consisted mainly of graduate students of Medicine (85%), and other biomedical sciences (15%). Most participants were on PhD training or on postdoctoral training. A specially designed anonymous voluntary multiple-choice questionnaire was distributed to them. The questionnaire consisted of 43 questions divided in 7 parts, each aimed to assess the participants 'previous knowledge and attitudes toward ethical principles of science and the main types of scientific fraud, falsification, fabrication of data, plagiarism, and false authorship.
   Results: Although they considered themselves as insufficiently educated on science ethics, almost all participants recognized all types of scientific fraud, qualified these issues as highly unethical, and expressed strong negative attitude toward them. Despite that, only about half of the participants thought that superiors-violators of high ethical standards of science deserve severe punishment, and even fewer declared that they would whistle blow. These percentages were much greater in cases when the students had personally been plagiarized.
   Conclusion: Our participants recognized all types of scientific fraud as violation of ethical standards of science, expressed strong negative attitude against fraud, and believed that they would never commit fraud, thus indicating their own high moral sense. However, the unwillingness to whistle blow and to punish adequately the Violators might be characterized as opportunistic behavior

AB  - Much debate has focused on the potential negative role of sexualized violent media on viewer attitudes toward women. One potential issue in previous literature is that depictions of sexuality and violence were confounded with subordinate depictions of female characters. The current study addressed this by randomly assigning young adults to watch either neutral media or sexually violent media with either subordinate or strong female characters. Women who watched sexually violent media were more anxious, and males who watched sexually violent media had more negative attitudes toward women, but only when female characters were subordinate. Sexual and violent content had no influence on viewer attitudes when strong female characters were present, suggesting these are not the crucial influence variables.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lockdown was imposed as a preventive measure for coronavirus disease pandemic. Social media was the most common tool available for the masses, including the 1st year medical students during the lockdown. The objectives of the present study were to determine the extent of use of social media and the effects on mind-body and social distancing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: It was mixed research conducted on 1st-year medical students using convenience sampling. The quantitative aspect of E-survey was administered through Google forms sent via E-mail, and structured telephonic interview was conducted as a qualitative aspect on randomly selected 10 students based on predecided interview questions. This study was reported as per the Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys. The analysis was performed using percentages and paired t-test with significance at P < 0.05, Chi-square test with Yate's correction. Qualitative responses were analyzed using coding and categorization. RESULTS: The response rate was 88%. Time spent on social media for >4 h increased from 1.1% to 47.72% during lockdown. Forty three (48.86%) of the students reported increased mood fluctuations. The relation between mood fluctuations and time spent on social media of >4 h was significant chi 2 = 6.41 with P < 0.05. Average hours of sleep after using social media before lockdown increased significantly from 6.68 h to 8.10 h during lockdown using paired t-test, where "t" was 6.84. There was a positive impact on communication with friends and family. CONCLUSION: Due to the increased extent of use of social media during lockdown, negative mind-body effects have surfaced but emerged as boon in terms of communication.

AB  - Introduction: The Covid pandemic and social distancing has adversely impacted the conventional apprenticeship method of postgraduate training in laparoscopic surgery. Social media may be a useful adjunct for laparoscopic training, but its utility in developing countries like India has not been studied carefully. This paper describes an observational, cross-sectional study on the educational utility of Facebook groups based in India and which focus on laparoscopic gynecologic surgery.
   Methods: The most popular Facebook groups involving Indians and focusing on laparoscopic gynecology were identified using appropriate search terms as well as inclusion and exclusion criteria. Demographic data related to the groups, the authors of posts as well as descriptive statistics of all the posts during the study period were collected and appropriate statistical analysis was performed.
   Results: All the groups in this study were large and growing steadily. Posts related to laparoscopy were more likely to be videos, dealing with operative techniques and having educational value for postgraduate residents (p value < 0.001) compared to posts unrelated to laparoscopic surgery. The majority of posts (88.2%) presented original content created by group members rather than material shared from other sources. Members preferred to share laparoscopic content using links to their personal YouTube channels rather than using institutional YouTube channels, dedicated websites for laparoscopic surgery or direct posts on Facebook. Group members liked educational content and laparoscopic surgery-related content significantly more than other content. Only 16.7% of the laparoscopic surgeons could be identified to be working in academic institutes.
   Conclusion: Social media for medical education has inherent advantages and disadvantages. This article provides objective data regarding its utilisation in a developing country in the midst of the Covid pandemic, and provides a guide for further research and development of innovative teaching methods.

AB  - Background: Nonattendance rates remain high for first therapy appointments, despite initiatives to increase access to psychological therapy. The reasons for nonattendance are poorly understood and studies of demographic and clinical predictors have produced conflicting findings. Aims: We aimed to pilot a method for investigating psychological factors associated with first appointment attendance in a primary care mental health service. Method: Questionnaires were completed by individuals at the point of referral to CBT with a low-intensity service in one general practice (n = 67), including a measure of beliefs, goals and attitudes towards therapy, as well as anxiety and depression scales. Subsequent attendance at the first appointment was used as an outcome. Results: Preliminary results showed that attendance was not associated with age or gender, severity of distress, or overall ratings for positive or negative attitudes towards therapy; although distress itself was associated with increased endorsement of negative attitudes. However, one specific psychological item, "Talking to a therapist will help me understand better how my mind works" had a significant association with subsequent attendance. Conclusions: The psychological factor that was associated with increased attendance may reflect the concept of psychological mindedness; however, this requires replication in a larger study. A full-scale study was deemed to be warranted based on this prospective design.

AB  - Background: Management of pediatric otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent otitis media typically includes observation up to 3 months. Bilateral myringotomy and tube (BMT) placement is performed due to persistent effusion with associated symptoms such as decreased hearing. With the COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory stay at home orders (MSHO), children were quarantined at home and many remained home after MSHO. We reviewed the prevalence of middle ear effusion (MEE) at the time of BMT during similar time periods in the year before, during and after MSHO in this pandemic year.
   Study design: Retrospective summary of BMT cases at a single tertiary children's hospital.
   Methods: All children <18 years who underwent BMT between March 1, 2020 and July 1, 2020 and between March 1, 2019 and July 1, 2019 were included. Statistical analysis included chi-squared and Mann-Whitney U tests.
   Results: A total of 778 cases were reviewed; 551 (71%) were performed pre-pandemic and 227 (29%) during onset of pandemic (N = 778). There were no significant differences in gender, age, and BMI between groups, but significantly fewer Caucasians (58% vs. 45%, p < 0.05) and more Hispanics (20% vs. 33%, p < 0.05) during-COVID. The prevalence of intraoperative effusion during-COVID was significantly lower compared to pre-COVID (65% vs. 83%, p < 0.001).
   Conclusion: Pandemic and COVID-19 MSHO were associated with significantly lower intraoperative OME prevalence. Further research may elucidate the impact of face covering, social distancing, and virtual schooling on the incidence of pediatric ROM, OME, and ENT symptoms.

AB  - BackgroundPeople with severe mental illnesses (SMIs) are likely to face disproportionate challenges during a pandemic. They may not receive or be able to respond to public health messages to prevent infection or to limit its spread. Additionally, they may be more severely affected, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. MethodsWe conducted a telephone survey (May-June 2020) in a sample of 1,299 people with SMI who had attended national mental health institutes in Bangladesh and Pakistan before the pandemic. We collected information on top worries, socioeconomic impact of the pandemic, knowledge of COVID-19 (symptoms, prevention), and prevention-related practices (social distancing, hygiene). We explored the predictive value of socio-demographic and health-related variables for relative levels of COVID-19 knowledge and practice using regularized logistic regression models. FindingsMass media were the major source of information about COVID-19. Finances, employment, and physical health were the most frequently mentioned concerns. Overall, participants reported good knowledge and following advice. In Bangladesh, being female and higher levels of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) predicted poor and better knowledge, respectively, while in Pakistan being female predicted better knowledge. Receiving information from television predicted better knowledge in both countries. In Bangladesh, being female, accessing information from multiple media sources, and better HRQoL predicted better practice. In Pakistan, poorer knowledge of COVID-19 prevention measures predicted poorer practice. ConclusionOur paper adds to the literature on people living with SMIs and their knowledge and practices relevant to COVID-19 prevention. Our results emphasize the importance of access to mass and social media for the dissemination of advice and that the likely gendered uptake of both knowledge and practice requires further attention.

AB  - Due to the existing extensive curricula of English for Dental Purposes (EDP) courses and absence of enough weekly hours to cover them in Iran, there is a limited insufficient exposure to English to improve students' English communication skills to the levels necessary for their future career. Therefore, there have been needs to appraise the present teaching approaches and reform the configuration and context of EDP classes to yield highest profit for their students. The study was designed to address issues central to the perception and expectations of students in regard the use and the impact of the social medium, WhatsApp. As part of this impression, a spectrum of procedures has been depicted to employ this cross-platform messaging application.
   This research was conducted among 70 2nd year dentistry students at Kashan University of Medical Sciences, in a course called English for Dental Purposes (EDP). The descriptive research project employing a qualitative and quasi-experimental study was chosen to collect data using a valid and reliable pretest-posttest design. Two groups 35 subjects were randomly selected via simple random sampling. The control group was taught by conventional method, while the experimental group was taught through the proposed whatsApp assisted language learning approach in a blended way. A paired t-test was utilized to compare the results of each group and an independent sample t-test was utilized to compare the results in control and experimental group. The f-ratio value is 7.88138; the t-value is 2.80738. The p-value is .006512 and the result is significant at p < .01.
   Therefore, there are good reasons to think WhatsApp-based method of teaching EDP as a more effective approach than the face to face method. The Likert scale questionnaire descriptively analyzed via SPSS 16.00 version revealed experimental group had generally positive attitudes towards Apps-based teaching of academic materials.
   This media helps students get to be more capacitated in EDP, advances the class learning of English for Dental Purposes, enhances students' knowledge more satisfactorily, motivates them to gain a positive impact and willingness in their class activities and had resulted in more continuity in study and self-confidence. So, it deserves considering the incorporation of the new application i.e. WhatsApp effectively in the curriculum of EDP pedagogies as an educational means.

AB  - Background: American adults have gained weight during the COVID-19 pandemic. Little is known about how patients who are medically managed for overweight and obesity, including patients who are prescribed antiobesity pharmacotherapy, have fared.
   Objective: To assess the COVID-19 pandemic's effect on weight, food choices, and health behaviors in patients receiving medical treatment for overweight or obesity.
   Methods: Adult patients treated at an urban academic weight management center between 1 May 2019 and 1 May 2020 were electronically surveyed between 23 February and 23 March 2021. The survey assessed changes in weight, eating, behaviors, and the use of antiobesity medications (AOMs) following issuance of social distancing/stay-at-home policies in March 2020.
   Results: In 970 respondents, median percent weight change for those taking AOMs was -0.459% [interquartile range -5.46%-(+3.73%)] compared to +2.33% [IQR -1.92%-(+6.52%)] for those not taking AOMs (p < 0.001). More participants achieved >= 5% weight loss if they were taking AOMs compared to those who were not (26.7% vs. 15.8%, p = 0.004), and weight gain >= 5% was also lower in those taking AOMs (19.8% vs. 30.3%, p = 0.004). Patients with pre-pandemic BMI >= 30 kg/m(2) taking AOMs experienced the greatest weight reduction, and there was greater weight loss associated with increased physical activity.
   Conclusions and Relevance: Medical weight management protected against weight gain during this period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Increased physical activity, decreased alcohol intake, and use of AOMs were factors that contributed to this protective effect.

AB  - Background: Kawasaki disease (KD) is an acute vasculitis of young children. A comparison of US hospitalization rates and epidemiologic features of KD in 2020 to those of precoronavirus disease years has yet to be reported.
   Methods: Using a large, inpatient database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study and analyzed data for patients with (1) diagnosis coding for KD, (2) IV immunoglobulin treatment administered during hospitalization and (3) discharge date between January 1, 2016, and December 30, 2020. Severe cases were defined as those requiring adjunctive therapy or IV immunoglobulin-resistant therapy.
   Results: The annual number of KD hospitalizations were stable from 2016 to 2019 (n = 1652, 1796, 1748, 1692, respectively) but decreased in 2020 (n = 1383). KD hospitalizations demonstrated seasonal variation with an annual peak between December and April. A second peak of KD admissions was observed in May 2020. The proportion of KD cases classified as severe increased to 40% in 2020 from 33% during the years 2016-2019 (P < 0.01). Median age in years increased from 2.9 in subjects hospitalized from 2016 to 2019 to 3.2 in 2020 (P = 0.002).
   Conclusions: Compared with the previous 4 years, the annual number of pediatric KD admissions decreased, and children discharged with diagnostic codes for KD in 2020 were generally older and more likely to have severe morbidity possibly reflective of misdiagnosed multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children. Clinicians should be wary of a possible rise in KD rates in the postcoronavirus disease 2019 era as social distancing policies are lifted and other viruses associated with KD return.

AB  - Objective To investigate community and health-care workers' perspectives on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and on early pandemic responses during the first 2 weeks of national lockdown in Zimbabwe.
   Methods Rapid qualitative research was carried out between March and April 2020 via phone interviews with one representative from each of four community-based organizations and 16 health-care workers involved in a trial of community-based services for young people. In addition, information on COVID-19 was collected from social media platforms, news outlets and government announcements. Data were analysed thematically.
   Findings Four themes emerged: (i) individuals were overloaded with information but lacked trusted sources, which resulted in widespread fear and unanswered questions; (ii) communities had limited ability to comply with prevention measures, such as social distancing, because access to long-term food supplies and water at home was limited and because income had to be earned daily; (iii) health-care workers perceived themselves to be vulnerable and undervalued because of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate pay; and (iv) other health conditions were sidelined because resources were redirected, with potentially wide-reaching implications.
   Conclusion It is important that prevention measures against COVID-19 are appropriate for the local context. In Zimbabwe, communities require support with basic needs and access to reliable information to enable them to follow prevention measures. In addition, health- care workers urgently need personal protective equipment and adequate salaries. Essential health-care services and medications for conditions other than COVID-19 must also continue to be provided to help reduce excess mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Background Entertainment-education (E-E) media can improve behavioral intent toward health-related practices. In the era of COVID-19, millions of people can be reached by E-E media without requiring any physical contact. We have designed a short, wordless, animated video about preventive COVID-19 behaviors that can be rapidly distributed through social media channels to a global audience. The E-E video's effectiveness, however, remains unclear. Methods/design This is a multi-site, parallel group, randomized controlled trial comparing the effectiveness of an E-E video on COVID-19 against (i) an attention placebo control (APC) video and (ii) no video. For our primary outcomes, we will measure knowledge about preventive COVID-19 behaviors. We will also use a list randomization approach to measure behavioral intent toward preventative COVID-19 behaviors. In each trial arm, participants will be randomized to a control list or a control list plus an item about social distancing, washing hands, cleaning household surfaces, sharing of eating utensils, and the stockpiling of essential goods. Using an online platform, we will recruit 17,010 participants (aged 18-59 years) from the USA, the UK, Germany, Spain, France, and Mexico. Discussion This trial will utilize several randomization procedures, list experimentation methods, and state-of-the-art online technology to demonstrate the effectiveness of an E-E video to improve knowledge of, and behavioral intent toward, the prevention of COVID-19. Our results will inform future E-E video campaigns for COVID-19 and similar public health intervention needs.

AB  - An understanding of human attitudes towards wildlife can be an essential element in the success or failure of a conservation initiative, policy or practice and represents one of the main conservation problems for wildlife species. Despite the ecosystem services bats provide, they often are a socially stigmatized group, misperceived and even hunted. This problem has been on the increase as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. We examined how aesthetic appeal and informational factors could influence human attitudes towards bats in a survey of 1966 participants from Spanish-speaking countries. Gender, educational level, religiousness and previous experiences with bats were relevant variables to understand attitudes towards them. The results indicate that both aesthetic and informational stimuli increase the positive responses, reducing the negatives on the participants' attitudes. Our results show the importance of public attitudes to achieve conservation goals, especially in the context of human-wildlife conflict. Bats are not charismatic animals and are still surrounded in mystery; however, our findings could benefit bat conservation plans, allowing the development of new communication strategies both locally and nationally and increasing public acceptance that will facilitate bat conservation.

AB  - Background: Covid-19 pandemic has boosted digitalization in healthcare, as mobility restrictions and social distancing rules have made healthcare providers to adopt digital tools to replace or complement face-to-face interactions.Purpose: We discuss the effects of Covid-19 pandemic on physicians' use of digital media. We examine whether Covid-19 conditions have changed how physicians use internet resources for information search, how they engage in social media, and their attitude towards online events.Basic procedures: The study was done as a longitudinal panel survey in four waves. The sample was a panel including active physicians in Finland. The panel was updated annually. Identical surveys were administered in 2018, 2019, 2020 and 2021. Spring 2020 was the time when Finland executed mobility restrictions and reorganization of healthcare because of pandemic. Comparing results of the survey before and after Covid-19 restrictions gives us a unique opportunity to do comparative analysis of Covid-19 effects.Main findings: Our results show that the use of digital media for information search stayed relatively stable without statistically significant change during the four-year period covered in the study. The use of social media rose steadily from 2018 to 2021 with no significant difference in the trend. However, there was a significant change in the attitude of Finnish physicians on online events. Year 2021, the attitude remained in this more positive level.Principal conclusions: As use of digital media including social media was already high prior Covid-19 in Finland, our results do not show significant change because of special circumstances introduced in 2020. However, our results show that the attitudes towards online events turned more positive during Covid-19 related restrictions. This could indicate that Covid-19 era has triggered a change that might continue also when pandemic related restrictions will be removed.

AB  - Objectives The public relies on various media sources and communication platforms for receipt of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) information. Therefore, identifying the primary sources of COVID-19 information among older adults can be valuable, as it can enable information on life-saving measures to be effectively disseminated to this population. Methods We analyzed the Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey COVID-19 Supplement that was administrated from June 2020 through July 2020 (n = 8,050). A survey-weighted logistic model was conducted to examine the association between the sources of COVID-19 information Medicare beneficiaries most relied on (i.e., traditional news sources, social media, comments/guidance from government officials, other webpages/internet, friends/family members, and health care providers) and engaging in all 3 recommended preventive behaviors (i.e., mask wearing, social distancing, and handwashing). Results Among study participants, 89.8% engaged in all 3 recommended preventive behaviors. Approximately 59.3% of beneficiaries reported that they most relied upon traditional news sources for COVID-19 information; 11.4% reported health care providers; 10.6% reported comments/guidance from government officials; 8.8% reported other webpages/internet; 8.6% reported friends/family members; and 1.3% reported they relied upon social media. Beneficiaries who relied on comments/guidance from government officials for COVID-19 information (vs. traditional news sources) were more likely to engage in preventive behaviors (odds ratio [OR] = 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.20-2.35). However, those who relied on COVID-19 information from friends/family members (vs. traditional news sources) were less likely to engage in preventive behaviors (OR = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.44-0.73). Discussion Our findings can inform decision making about the effective communication sources to reach Medicare beneficiaries for public health messaging regarding preventive measures, including COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the strict national policies regarding social distancing behavior in Europe, America and Australia, people became reliant on social media as a means for gathering information and as a tool for staying connected to family, friends and work. This is the first trans-national study exploring the qualitative experiences and challenges of using social media while in lockdown or shelter-in-place during the current pandemic. Methods: This study was part of a wider cross-sectional online survey conducted in Norway, the UK, USA and Australia during April/May 2020. The manuscript reports on the qualitative free-text component of the study asking about the challenges of social media users during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, USA and Australia. A total of 1991 responses were included in the analysis. Thematic analysis was conducted independently by two researchers. Results: Three overarching themes identified were: Emotional/Mental Health, Information and Being Connected. Participants experienced that using social media during the pandemic amplified anxiety, depression, fear, panic, anger, frustration and loneliness. They felt that there was information overload and social media was full of misleading or polarized opinions which were difficult to switch off. Nonetheless, participants also thought that there was an urge for connection and learning, which was positive and stressful at the same time. Conclusion: Using social media while in a shelter-in-place or lockdown could have a negative impact on the emotional and mental health of some of the population. To support policy and practice in strengthening mental health care in the community, social media could be used to deliver practical advice on coping and stress management. Communication with the public should be strengthened by unambiguous and clear messages and clear communication pathways. We should be looking at alternative ways of staying connected.

AB  - Purpose - Despite the end of conflict in 1995, Bosnia Herzegovina still suffers from unresolved ethnic anti social tensions, where fostering social cohesion, active citizenship and mitigating ethnonationalist tensions and politically motivated violence remains among the main goals to achieve transformative peace. This paper, based on quantitative analyses of 3,637 adult respondents, shows that the tendency of Bosnians to be active or violent citizens sometimes overlaps and are not very distinct patterns of behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to identify factors that differentiate pathways and help explain (un)civil Civic behaviours and inform the work of peace and development actors.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper is based on a quantitative household survey conducted with a representative sample of 3,637 adults in Bosnia and by using a wide range of statistical tools from scaling to correlation analysis. This data set measures factors and conceptual notions associated with passive, constructive and aggressive civic tendencies and social cohesion in a nuanced way by using different metrics and scales. The survey was designed and conducted by The Centre for Sustainable Peace and Democratic Development (SeeD) and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Resilience Initiative in 2020, in partnership with The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/The Office of Transition Initiatives (OTI) and The International Organization for Migration (IOM) for the SCORE Bosnia-Herzegovina study (SeeD, 2020).
   Findings - Overall, the factors that were discovered to be linked to the manifestation of constructive and aggressive civic tendencies are multidimensional, and range from intergroup relations (e.g. tension, tolerance) to political and civic attitudes (e.g. ethnonationalism, civic responsibility, gender equality), from individual traits (e.g. education, economic stress) to the media landscape (e.g. information consumption). While the empirical evidence shows that some of these factors can push citizens towards both active and violent civic behaviours simultaneously, this study identifies and distinguishes those that can reduce aggressive civic tendencies while increasing constructive civic tendencies.
   Practical implications - This paper proposes a replicable approach and evidence-based conclusions which can help validate the theories of change for the peace and development actors to ensure that scarce peacebuilding resources are invested where the impact is greatest, and the actors can protect the sanctity of their responsibility to do no harm.
   Social implications - This paper seeks to provide a robust empirical understanding for more effective policy-making and programming that can support Bosnia-Herzegovina's endogenous resilience against socio-political shocks and transformative peace trajectory. This paper seeks to demonstrate how peace and development actors can build and use an evidence-base for understanding civic behaviours and as a result formulate tailored efforts with greater likelihood of impact. This would help fulfil commitments towards sustainable development goals and the 2030 global agenda (UN General Assembly, 2015).
   Originality/value - This study contributes insights to the emerging literature at the nexus of peacebuilding, individual skills/attitudes and civic behaviour. While the conclusions are highly contextual, the methodology is informed by multidisciplinary literature and is replicable in other postconflict and non-conflict contexts, and thus can be used for cross-country comparisons and theory building around civic activism and constructive citizenship. The approach distinguishes between passive citizens, constructive activists, aggressive activists and purely violent citizens. This study discovers that the bifurcation is between passive citizens and active citizens, and although constructive and aggressive civic tendencies might be theorised to be contradictory, they overlap and tend to cooccur.

AB  - This study found that mortality salience in TV news activated more hostile attitude toward the perpetrators and negative judgment on the immigration issue. Social group difference influenced news viewers' immigration issue judgment, but did not affect their resultant hostility and perceived vulnerability. More negative attitudes emerged toward the immigration issue when immigrant perpetrators were portrayed negatively in the news. News viewers with exposure to mortality salience in TV news reported more negative toward immigrants. Exposure to mortality-related elements in TV news could lead to social conflicts that were viewed as a severe threat by U.S. government and policymakers.

AB  - Terror management research shows that death reminders (mortality salience) increase prejudice toward worldview violators. Two studies investigated whether death reminders exacerbated differences in heterosexual men's and women's reports of sexual prejudice (negative attitudes based on sexual orientation). Results showed that following death reminders, sex differences in anti-gay discrimination and affective prejudice toward gay men (but not toward lesbians) were larger, and that these increased sex differences were mediated by gender role beliefs. The current studies suggest that researchers may attenuate the effects of death reminders by lessening the perceived worldview violation in addition to alleviating the existential terror of death.

TI  - Leisure will not be locked down - insights on leisure and COVID-19 from the Netherlands
T2  - WORLD LEISURE JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - Leisure
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Netherlands
AB  - The COVID-19 virus and the measures taken to prevent its spread have had enormous impact on society, and specifically on people's leisure behaviour in the Netherlands. The Dutch government implemented a so-called "intelligent lockdown" mid-March 2020. This constituted a partial closing of the economy, particularly those locations and businesses where social distancing could not be practiced. By July of 2020, many restrictions had already been lifted, but the concept of the "1.5 meter society" was retained, thus still prohibiting large-scale gatherings such as festivals, and severely limiting the capacity of leisure venues. During the lockdown period, people spent more leisure time at home and with their family. This caused a spike in the popularity of social media-related leisure, gaming, television (especially streaming services), but also a revaluing of more "traditional" forms of leisure. Since many leisure facilities were closed, self-organized outdoor leisure activities such as hiking, running, and cycling became even more popular. The psychological impact included heightened stress, anxiety, and confusion. The economic impact is expected to be significant, but the leisure sector is showing its resilience by figuring out new ways of continuing operations.

AB  - Background Possible COVID-19 pneumonia patients (ppCOVID-19) generally overwhelmed emergency departments (EDs) during the first COVID-19 wave. Home-confinement and primary-care phone follow-up was the first-level regional policy for preventing EDs to collapse. But when X-rays were needed, the traditional outpatient workflow at the radiology department was inefficient and potential interpersonal infections were of concern. We aimed to assess the efficiency of a primary-care high-resolution radiology service (pcHRRS) for ppCOVID-19 in terms of time at hospital and decision's reliability. Methods We assessed 849 consecutive ppCOVID-19 patients, 418 through the pcHRRS (home-confined ppCOVID-19 with negative-group 1- and positive-group 2-X-rays) and 431 arriving with respiratory symptoms to the ED by themselves (group 3). The pcHRRS provided X-rays and oximetry in an only-one-patient agenda. Radiologists made next-step decisions (group 1: pneumonia negative, home-confinement follow-up; group 2: pneumonia positive, ED assessment) according to X-ray results. We used ANOVA and Bonferroni correction, Student T, Chi(2) tests to analyse changes in the ED workload, time-to-decision differences between groups, potential delays in patients acceding through the ED, and pcHRRS performance for deciding admission. Results The pcHRRS halved ED respiratory patients (49.2%), allowed faster decisions (group 1 vs. home-discharged group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41 +/- 1:05 h; 3:36 +/- 2:58 h; 3:50 +/- 3:16 h; group 1 vs. all group 2 and group 3 patients: 0:41 +/- 1:05 h; 5.25 +/- 3.08; 5:36 +/- 4:36 h; group 2 vs. group 3 admitted patients: 5:27 +/- 3:08 h vs. 7:42 +/- 5:02 h; all p < 0.001) and prompted admission (84/93, 90.3%) while maintaining time response for ED patients. Conclusions Our pcHRRS may be a more efficient entry-door for ppCOVID-19 by decreasing ED patients and making expedited decisions while guaranteeing social distance.

AB  - An experiment examined how episodic and thematic political message frames affect attitudes toward older adults and Social Security. When exposed to messages about abolishing Social Security, participants exposed to episodic frames were significantly more likely to endorse message-consistent attitudes than participants exposed to a thematic frame. In mediation analyses, an episodic frame featuring a counterstereotypical exemplar increased endorsement of individual responsibility for retirement planning, which then led to more negative attitudes toward Social Security. These effects did not occur with a stereotypical exemplar in an episodic frame. The same mediated pathway influenced attitudes toward older adults in a more complex manner. Results provide support for individual responsibility attributions as a mediating mechanism underlying the effects of certain episodic frames.

AB  - In language planning for minority languages, policy often aims to positively influence attitudes towards the language by increasing its salience in key areas of public life such as broadcasting and signage. This is true for Gaelic in Scotland, where recent national initiatives have included the establishing of a Gaelic language television channel in 2008, and the launch, in the same year, of a bilingual brand identity for ScotRail (Reile na h-Alba), resulting in Gaelic-English signage at railway stations across Scotland. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence on the effects of such an increase in national visibility of Gaelic on public attitudes towards the language. The present paper explores this using a national survey of public attitudes conducted in Scotland in 2012. Exposure to Gaelic broadcasting was found to be positively associated with attitudes towards the status of the Gaelic language (as a language spoken in Scotland, and as an important element of cultural heritage), and with attitudes towards the greater use of Gaelic (in public services and in the future). However, exposure to Gaelic signage was often negatively associated with such broader attitudes to the language and culture. The implications of the results for Gaelic language planning, and for future academic studies of language attitudes in Scotland, are explored.

TI  - Vindictive but vulnerable: Paradoxical representations of women as demonstrated in internet discourse surrounding an anti-rape technology
T2  - WOMENS STUDIES INTERNATIONAL FORUM
LA  - English
KW  - RESISTANCE
AB  - Much media interest surrounded a campaign to raise funds to distribute 30,000 Rape-aXe condoms to women during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The barbed device is worn inside the vagina and attaches to a penis upon penetration. This paper presents an analysis of popular attitudes towards women and rape as identified from comments made upon online news websites and popular blogs in response to this technology. Two over-arching representations emerged: first, that the Rape-aXe would be employed as a weapon for vengeance and deceit, and second, that it was a means of helping women negotiate risk. We argue that such paradoxical representations of women as simultaneously vindictive and vulnerable make problematic the utility of such an anti-rape device. We suggest that the cultural entrenchment of stereotypical and negative attitudes towards women needs to be recognized and counter-acted upon before rape intervention measures, like the Rape-aXe, can have any positive effect.

AB  - People from marginalized groups are often discriminated against in traditional recruitment processes. Yet as companies faced with skill shortages change their recruitment strategies, the question arises as to whether modern recruitment trends such as the use of professional social network sites, active sourcing, and recruitment assignment to external agencies are affected by implicit or explicit discrimination. In our mixed-method study, we first conducted expert interviews with different types of recruiters to explore the potential for discrimination in the modern recruitment process. We then analyzed panel data from the Institute for Employment Research (IAB) in Germany to see whether there is quantitative evidence of discrimination in modern recruitment. A content analysis of the interviews shows that active sourcing and assignment of recruitment to private agencies are potentially affected by explicit discrimination. We identified three sources of discrimination in personnel selection: recruiters' own attitudes, explicit instructions from managers, and the recruiters' assumptions regarding companies' preferred candidates. The results of mixed multilevel analyses with the company as a second level resonate with the qualitative findings: companies actively approach female employees, older employees, and employees who are born in Southern/Eastern Europe less often and offer women jobs less often. The effects for gender were still significant when we included far-right voting as a moderator variable on the employee level, but the interactions were not significant. Effects for gender and older people in active sourcing were also significant and robust when controlling for income, number of children, level of school completion, and educational background. Our findings suggest that current legislation may be insufficient to protect candidates who belong to marginalized groups from discrimination in modern recruitment.</p>

AB  - BackgroundHere we aimed to analyze changes in the outcomes of atrial fibrillation (AF) catheter ablation (AFCA) during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and examine the relationship between rhythm outcomes and the stringency of government social distancing measures. MethodsWe included 453 patients who underwent de novo AFCA between May 2018 and October 2019 (pre-COVID-19 era) and 601 between November 2019 and April 2021 (COVID-19 era). The primary outcome was late recurrence, defined as any episode of AF or atrial tachycardia documented after a 3-month blanking period. A multivariable Cox regression analysis was performed to estimate the relative hazards of AF recurrence in the two eras. ResultsIn the study population (24.3% women; median age, 60 years), 660 (62.6%) patients had paroxysmal AF. Among those with paroxysmal AF, the late recurrence rate was significantly lower in the COVID-19 era than in the pre-COVID-19 era [9.4% vs. 17.0%, respectively, log-rank P = 0.004; adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.35-0.90] during a median follow-up of 11 months. In patients with persistent AF, the late recurrence rate did not significantly differ between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 era groups (18.9% vs. 21.5%, respectively; log-rank P = 0.523; adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.47-1.53) during the median follow-up of 11 months. ConclusionA decrease in AF recurrence after catheter ablation was observed in patients with paroxysmal AF during the COVID-19 outbreak, whereas no change was observed in those with persistent AF.

TI  - The COVID-19 pandemic impacts all domains of quality of life in Egyptians with spinal cord injury: a retrospective longitudinal study
T2  - SPINAL CORD
LA  - English
AB  - Background and objective During the COVID-19 pandemic, several aspects of life have been affected. These aspects have been impacted especially in persons with spinal cord injury (SCI). The current study explored the overall effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life (QOL) domains in persons with SCI as well as evaluated their adherence to WHO-COVID 19-preventive measures. Design A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted after asking participants to complete an online validated Arabic version of the WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires including their demographics. The WHOQOL-BREF questionnaires were completed targeting two separate occasions to represent their scores prior to and during the pandemic. Participants were asked to rate their adherence to WHO-COVID-19 preventive measures on a 10-point scale. Setting and participants 115 participants with complete/ incomplete SCI were recruited via social media and contacted by phone to complete the questionnaires. Results Persons with SCI had lower QOL scores during the COVID-19 period compared to their QOL during the pre-COVID-19 period; all QOL domains (Physical Health, Psychological, Social Relationships, and Environment) showed a significant decrease (P < 0.001). Regarding COVID-19 preventative measures, participants were most likely to endorse self-isolation as well as staying home measures and least likely to adhere to hand washing and social distancing measures. Conclusion The robustly reduced QOL reported by individuals with SCI during the COVID-19 pandemic highlights the need for rehabilitation and mental health services, particularly administered via telehealth, to buffer the effects of the pandemic. Additionally, psychoeducation and support regarding COVID-19 preventative behaviors in this region would be critical.

AB  - Objectives: This study analyzed the perceptions and emotions of Korean and Japanese citizens regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). It examined the frequency of words used in Korean and Japanese tweets regarding COVID-19 and the corresponding changes in their interests. Methods: This cross-sectional study analyzed Twitter posts (Tweets) from February 1, 2020 to April 30, 2020 to determine public opinion of the COVID-19 pandemic in Korea and Japan. We collected data from Twitter (https://twitter.com/), a major social media platform in Korea and Japan. Python 3.7 Library was used for data collection. Data analysis included KR-WordRank and frequency analyses in Korea and Japan, respectively. Heat diagrams, word clouds, and rank flowcharts were also used. Results: Overall, 1,470,673 and 4,195,457 tweets were collected from Korea and Japan, respectively. The word trend in Korea and Japan was analyzed every 5 days. The word cloud analysis revealed "COVID-19", "Shinchonji", "Mask", "Daegu", and "Travel" as frequently used words in Korea. While in Japan, "COVID-19", "Mask", "Test", "Impact", and "China" were identified as high-frequency words. They were divided into four categories: social distancing, prevention, issue, and emotion for the rank flowcharts. Concerning emotion, "Overcome" and "Support" increased from February in Korea, while "Worry" and "Anxiety" decreased in Japan from April 1. Conclusions: As a result of the trend, people's interests in the economy were high in both countries, indicating their reservations on the economic downturn. Therefore, focusing policies toward economic stability is essential. Although the interest in prevention increased since April in both countries, the general public's relaxation regarding COVID-19 was also observed.

AB  - In a time of serious health crisis worldwide, this study is the extension of a case study already started (in February and March 2020) about the issue, reading behaviors, and preferences between the use of books and e-books. The COVID-19 pandemic came to impose social distancing in the world, closing universities, schools, and other services. The implementation of Internet services has presented itself as a valid response to the change that has so brutally arisen. Naturally, everyone had to adapt to it. In this context, the question about the preferences in using books or e-books is now even more relevant. This paper analyses the impact of COVID-19 in the behavioral trends in the use of scientific information from printed books and e-books in Portugal and Brazil. To this end, a survey was conducted on a user sample from various Portuguese and Brazilian higher education schools and public libraries. The first part focused on the characterization of the respondents, which includes data on gender and qualifications attended. In the second part, we obtained viewpoints about the advantages and disadvantages of each medium, frequency of use, choice of medium according to the purpose of reading, and devices used. The results let us examine the factors that influence and change the behaviors of users concerning their choice. Research such as this is beneficial to support the decision not only in selecting the information resources to be bought or pondering user preferences, but also to define strategies for advocating the use of various media that, rather than competitors, should be complimentary.

AB  - Objectives To examine associations between demographics, people's beliefs, and compliance with behaviours recommended by the UK government to prevent the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes COVID-19. Design A two-wave online survey conducted one week apart during the national lockdown (April, 2020). Measures A sample of 477 UK residents completed baseline measures from the reasoned action approach (experiential attitudes, instrumental attitudes, injunctive norms, descriptive norms, capacity, autonomy, and intention) and perceived susceptibility for each of the following recommended behaviours: limiting leaving home, keeping at least 2 m away from other people when outside and when inside shops, not visiting or meeting friends or other family members, and washing hands when returning home. Self-reported compliance with each of the recommended behaviours was assessed one week later. Results Rates of full compliance with the recommended behaviours ranged from 31% (keeping at least 2 m away from other people when inside shops) to 68% (not visiting or meeting friends or other family members). Capacity was a significant predictor of compliance with each of the five recommended behaviours. Increasing age and intentions were also predictive of compliance with three of the behaviours. Conclusions Interventions to increase compliance with the recommended behaviours to prevent the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, especially those relating to social distancing, need to bolster people's intentions and perceptions of capacity. This may be achieved through media-based information campaigns as well as environmental changes to make compliance with such measures easier. Such interventions should particularly target younger adults.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has dramatically changed our life. Despite the rapid growth of scientific publications about medical aspects of the pandemic, less has been explored about the effects of media communication regarding COVID-19 on healthy behaviors. Yet, the scientific literature has widely debated on how media can influence people's health-related evaluations, emotions, and behaviors. To fill this gap, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationships between media exposure, people's attitudes and emotions toward media contents, and healthy behaviors related to the use of public spaces, such as avoiding crowded places, wearing face masks, and maintaining social distance. A questionnaire referring to these variables was administered to an opportunistic sample of 174 participants in Italy during the off-peak period of the COVID-19 outbreak and before restrictions to mobility were extended to the whole country. Results showed that media exposure, the perception of social initiatives of prevention, and moderate levels of fear increase healthier behaviors in the use of public spaces. Perceiving alarming information did not significantly predict healthy behaviors in the use of public spaces. Results are discussed with reference to the previous literature. Suggestions to media communication to increase preventive behaviors during emergencies are also provided.

AB  - Purpose: Stigmatizing attitudes toward people with disabilities can jeopardize such individuals' well-being and recovery through denial of employment and community isolation. By shaping social norms that define group membership, the construct of individualism may partially explain differences in stigmatizing attitudes across cultures. Further, widespread globalization has brought intensely individualistic social practices to certain segments of non-Western cultures. This paper examines whether the construct of individualism can help to explain cross-cultural differences in stigmatizing attitudes observed between American and Chinese employers. Design: Employers (N = 879) from Beijing, Hong Kong, and Chicago provided information on their attitudes toward hiring people with disabilities, and path analyses were conducted to examine potential mediating relationships. Results: Path analyses indicated that vertical individualism, along with perceived responsibility for acquiring a condition, partially mediated the relationship between culture and employers' negative attitudes about job candidates with disabilities. Conclusion: These results suggested that greater espousal of competitive and individualist values may drive stigmatizing attitudes across cultures.

AB  - Introduction The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly affected UK endoscopy workload. The Joint Advisory Group on GI endoscopy and British Society of Gastroenterology issued guidelines on endoscopy service delivery changes and restoration. We surveyed UK endoscopy clinical leads to gain insights into service restoration.
   Methods A Google Forms-designed survey, assessing endoscopy provision, Covid minimisation and referral pathways was circulated to all UK endoscopy leads. The survey was open between 19 and 24 May 2020.
   Results 97 endoscopy leads completed the survey, with all UK nations and regions represented. Analysis showed 20% of endoscopy services were not providing endoscopy. Workload limitations were due to enforced interprocedural downtime (92%; with some services enforcing >1-hour downtime between procedures), social distancing (88%) and working in personal protective equipment (PPE) (87%). 91% of services reported a referral backlog (urgent median 2 months, routine median 6 months). 96% of services reported no current problems accessing PPE. Level 1/2 PPE use in colonoscopy was not uniform. 63% of services routinely swab patients for COVID-19 before endoscopy, 88% of services do not routinely swab asymptomatic staff. Comments addressed reducing endoscopy demand through vetting and changing referral criteria, the mostly commonly cited strategy being increased faecal immunochemical testing in symptomatic patients (70% of services).
   Conclusion This survey demonstrates the pandemic's profound impact on UK endoscopy. Challenges include standardising Covid-minimisation strategies and recovering staffing levels. To improve endoscopy services, there is a need to refine referral pathways, improve vetting and clarify guidance on downtime and PPE within endoscopy.

AB  - The coronavirus (Covid-19) has become a major cause of huma morbidity and mortality due to its transmitted mode in human beings. The public must follow precautionary practices to protect themselves from this world pandemic. Due to a lack of public practices, knowledge, and sensitivity, this transmitted disease suffers a large number of new cases around the world. This study examines the public's practices, knowledge, an sensitivity related to the Covid-19 in the Gilgit-Baltistan Pakistan area. We applied the exploratory methodology by reviewing the secondary data sources. We survey to collect the data and present the empirical evidence. We distributed five hundred questionnaires via the online and face-to-face approach and received 382 valid responses. The received data were analyzed by using descriptive statistics and a chi-square test. The empirical results indicate that majority of respondents are conscious and aware of the Covid-19 and moderately taking precautionary measures such as social distancing, washing hands, wearing the mask, avoid to handshaking/hug and avoidin: unnecessary traveling. It has been observed that participants are well aware of the sensitivity and the belief that the Covid-19 causes harm, changes expenditure life, exhausted, nervous, lonely, and fear for their individual life. Respondents have trust in social confidence and the roles of electronic media information regarding taking precautionary measures against the covid-19. Inversely, people have not to trust economic and safety measures taken b the government to control the Covid-19 pandemic. (C) 2021 INT TRANS J ENG MANAG SCI TECH.

AB  - Background: As a result of caring for a person with dementia, caregivers of persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be uniquely aware of public stigma for persons with AD.
   Objective: The purpose of this study was to compare self-identified caregivers and non-caregivers' expectations of public stigma experienced by persons living with dementia.
   Methods: Analysis of data from a survey of 910 adults (median age = 49 years) who read a vignette about a man with mild stage dementia. Multivariable ordered logistic regression was used to examine how AD caregiver status associated with responses on a modified Family Stigma in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (FS-ADS).
   Results: 9% (n = 82) of respondents self-identified as a current or former primary caregiver of a person with AD, about the same as the national estimate of informal caregivers (8.8%). Compared to non-caregivers, AD caregivers were more likely to report stronger reactions on all seven domains of the FS-ADS (all p < 0.05). As compared to AD caregivers with less factual knowledge about caregiving, AD caregivers with more knowledge expected the person with dementia to experience less social distance (p < 0.05). In addition, female AD caregivers reported fewer negative aesthetic attributions than male AD caregivers (p < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Compared to non-caregivers, respondents who self-identified as an AD caregiver gave responses that suggest they perceived more stigma of dementia among members of the public. Their reactions were attenuated by AD knowledge and being female. The findings have key implications for interventions to reduce AD stigma.

KW  - Spain
AB  - The pandemic caused by the spread of Covid-19 is giving rise to an exceptional social situation because of the great speed of propagation of the illness and the high level of mortality it has occasioned in a very short time. Moreover, the lockdown measures decreed in Spain prohibit the holding of wakes to avoid contagion, and limit funerals to three people plus the officiant. Thus, coronavirus is robbing people of the opportunity of a final farewell, stripping the dead of their dignity and worsening the grief of the living. This article investigates the situation and the social and cultural impact it has provoked. The method used takes the line of critical dialogue analysis (CDA) applied to information contained in the mass media, employing qualitative material from a related small-scale study. The results show that in countries like Spain where there is a strong Roman Catholic tradition the importance of these rituals is unquestionable. Although the country has become laicized over recent years, many traditions around death are still maintained. Hence, the impossibility of holding funerals is triggering a large number of social and personal conflicts. Furthermore, they indicate that lockdown, and the lack of rituals and of accompaniment constitute some of the most crucial stressors in the epidemic. Grief in solitude has become widespread and all the more fundamental in a society that values social support from close friends and family members. The conclusions show that the social distancing imposed by the epidemic is especially hard to bear when relatives are passing into death.

AB  - In this paper, we respond to a critique by Erik Thorstensen of the 'Deepening Ethical Engagement and Participation in Emerging Nanotechnologies' (DEEPEN) project concerning its 'realist' treatment of narrative, its restricted analytical framework and resources, its apparent confusion in focus and its unjustified contextualisation and overextension of its findings. We show that these criticisms are based on fairly serious misunderstandings of the DEEPEN project, its interdisciplinary approachand its conceptual context. Having responded to Thorstensen's criticisms, we take the opportunity to clarify and develop our approach to narrative. We articulate the need for novel, theoretically robust approaches to the formation of public attitudes which transcend the limitations of both survey-based approaches-which remain wedded to methodological individualism and which presume that individuals hold distinct and relatively stable attitudes and preferences-and interactionist approaches to public talk, which focus too strongly on individuals-in-interaction as reasoning agents and which ignore the constitutive role of culture and discourse in the formation of public opinion. We suggest that our use of narrative can help to better understand the process through which public attitudes to emerging technology develop out of interactive an engagement with wider cultural arguments and accounts of science and technology. We finish by pointing to parallel developments in social thought-from Charles Taylor's treatment of social imaginaries to recent developments in post-Bourdieuian cultural sociology-as related projects in understanding the cultural resources and grammars that provide the conceptual infrastructure for modern social life.

TI  - A Multicenter Cohort Study From India of 75 Kidney Transplants in Recipients Recovered After COVID-19
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION
LA  - English
KW  - SARS-COV-2 INFECTION
AB  - Background. There is limited current knowledge on feasibility and safety of kidney transplantation in coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) survivors. Methods. We present a retrospective cohort study of 75 kidney transplants in patients who recovered from polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed COVID-19 performed across 22 transplant centers in India from July 3, 2020, to January 31, 2021. We detail demographics, clinical manifestations, immunosuppression regimen, laboratory findings, treatment, and outcomes. Patients with a previous diagnosis of COVID-19 were accepted after documenting 2 negative severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 PCR tests, normal chest imaging with complete resolution of symptom for at least 28 d and significant social distancing for 14 d before surgery. Results. Clinical severity in patients ranged from asymptomatic (n = 17, 22.7%), mild (n = 36.48%), moderate (n = 15.20%), and severe (n = 7.9.3%) disease. Median duration between PCR positive to transplant was 60 d (overall) and increased significantly from asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe disease (49, 57, 83, 94 d, P 0.019), respectively. All recipients and donors were asymptomatic with normal creatinine after surgery at a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 81 (56-117) d without any complications relating to surgery or COVID-19. Patient and graft survival was 100%, and acute rejection was reported in 6.6%. Conclusions. Prospective kidney transplant recipients post-COVID-19 can be considered for transplantation after comprehensive donor and recipient screening before surgery using a combination of clinical, radiologic, and laboratory criteria, careful pretransplant evaluation, and individualized risk-benefit analysis. Further large-scale prospective studies with longer follow-up will better clarify our initial findings. To date, this remains the first and the largest study of kidney transplantation in COVID-19 survivors.

AB  - Immigration became a hot issue during the 2016 presidential election, in part due to Donald Trump's offensive campaign against immigrants and minorities in general. Drawing upon the belief gap hypothesis, we tested if support for Donald Trump increased false beliefs about immigrants. The belief gap hypothesis explains differences in beliefs about empirically verifiable and politically contested issues, relying on ideology and partisanship-instead of education-to predict people's beliefs. By using nationally representative panel data, this study explored how political ideology and education work together to predict belief gaps about immigrants. Findings suggest that conservative ideology and education interact to predict attitudes, showing that highly educated conservatives hold more negative beliefs about immigrants as compared to highly educated liberals or less educated conservatives. We also found that Trump's supporters exhibit negative attitudes and beliefs about immigration-yet results indicate that Donald Trump is not the cause of such attitudes but the catalyst that reveals them. Implications for theory and future research are discussed.

AB  - Background This survey was focused on the provision of neurointerventional services, the current practices of managing patients under COVID-19 conditions, and the expectations for the future. Methods Invitations for this survey were sent out as a collaborative effort of the European Society of Minimally Invasive Neurological Therapy (ESMINT), the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery (SNIS), the Sociedad Iberolatinoamericana de Neuroradiologia Diagnostica y Terapeutica (SILAN), the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology (SVIN), and the World Federation of Interventional and Therapeutic Neuroradiology (WFITN). Results Overall, 475 participants from 61 countries responded (six from Africa (1%), 81 from Asia (17%), 156 from Europe (33%), 53 from Latin America (11%), and 172 from North America (11%)). The majority of participants (96%) reported being able to provide emergency services, though 26% of these reported limited resources. A decrease in emergency procedures was reported by 69% of participants (52% in ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke, 11% ischemic, and 6% hemorrhagic stroke alone). Only 4% reported an increase in emergency cases. The emerging need for social distancing and the rapid adoption of remote communication was reflected in the interest in establishing case discussion forums (43%), general online forums (37%), and access to angio video streaming for live mentoring and support (33%). Conclusion Neurointerventional emergency services are available in almost all centers, while the number of emergency patients is markedly decreased. Half of the participants have abandoned neurointerventions in non-emergent situations. There are considerable variations in the management of neurointerventions and in the expectations for the future.

AB  - Background: Following an unintended pregnancy, not every woman would invariably choose to undergo an unsafe abortion. It suggests that in the decision making process, women face both 'push' factors that favour abortion and 'pull' factors that work against it. This study assessed the circumstances that surrounded a woman's decision to undergo an unsafe abortion, compared to a decision to continue, when faced with an unintended pregnancy in Sri Lanka.
   Methods: An unmatched case-control study was conducted among 171 women admitted to nine hospitals in eight districts following an unsafe abortion (Cases) and 600 women admitted to the same hospitals for delivery of an unintended term pregnancy (Controls). Interviewer-administered-questionnaires and in-depth interviews assessed women's characteristics, decision making process and underlying reasons for their decision. The risk of abortion related to their decision making was assessed using odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).
   Results: Compared to controls, the cases were significantly less-educated, employed, unmarried and primi-gravid (p < 0.05). All knew the 'illegal' status of abortion, mainly through media (65.5% cases versus 80% controls). When making a decision, the risk of undergoing an unsafe abortion was significant among those who sought assistance (44% versus 32%; OR = 1.7 (95% CI = 1.2-2.4)), with more reliance placed on non-medical sources such as spouse/ partner, friend, neighbour and family/relation. Speaking to women with past experience of induced abortions (31% versus 21.5%; OR = 1.6 (1.1-2.4) and failure in making the final decision with partners also imparted a significant risk for abortion (64% versus 34%; OR = 3.4; 2.4-4.8). A decision favouring unsafe abortion was predominantly based on their economic instability (29.5%) and poor support by partners (14%), whereas a decision against it was based on ethical considerations (44% religious beliefs: 12% social stigma) over its legal implications (4%). Most abortions were performed by unqualified persons (36.1% self proclaimed abortionists; 26.2% not revealed their qualifications) for a wide range of payment in non-sterile environments (45.9% unknown place) using septic procedures (38.5% trans-vaginal insertions; 24.6% unaware of the procedure).
   Conclusions: Women's risk of unsafe abortion was associated with unreliable sources of information during decision making that led to poor knowledge and positive attitudes on its safety; poor access to affordable abortion services; and their economic instability.

AB  - The persuasiveness of right-wing populist communication has become a widely discussed topic; it is often assumed that such messages might foster anti-immigrant attitudes among citizens. The present study explores the effects of the different components of right-wing populist communicationanti-immigrant messages, populist content, and populist styleon attitudes toward immigrants. By combining a media content analysis (N = 605 articles) with a panel survey (N = 1,968) in metropolitan areas of four Western European countries (France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom), this study analyzes how citizens' attitudes toward immigrants are influenced by the right-wing populist communication with which they are confronted in their individual media diet. The results show that anti-immigrant statements in the media lead to more negative cognitions toward immigrants, while populist content leads to more negative emotions. The study, thus, demonstrates that not only anti-immigrant rhetoric but also populism as a thin-centered ideology influence citizens' attitudes toward immigrants on top of pre-existing attitudes.

AB  - The massive use of virtual social networks and the dominance of the Internet have led to a new type of socialization (van Dijk, 2016). Interaction has gone from being predominantly face-to-face to being increasingly mediated by a technological device. In this context, it is worth asking if the interactions between individuals continue to present similar logic to face-to-face communication. In other words, how is today the nature of this interaction in the users of digital platforms, if in that system predominates the social distance, and even, "a null degree of the social" (Han, 2017:12)? The aim of the study is to describe how politeness and address forms work within Instagram accounts used by chilean university students for academic purposes. To achieve this, a qualitative methodology with a descriptive scope was chosen. In the case of politeness strategies, the approaches of Haverkate (1994, 2004), Calsamiglia and Tuson, (1999), Alcoba (2002) and Kerbrat-Orecchioni, (2004) were followed, and a combination of proposals by Rigatuso (2009), Rivadeneira (2009), and others, was used to analyze the address forms. After the analysis it was observed that the compliment widely predominates as politeness strategies, but it is a condescending courtesy (Han, 2017), followed by appreciation. The preferred address forms are the appellative hyperlink (Cautin-Epifani, 2015) and, then, the verbal forms of 2nd plural person, since both senders and receivers conceive that in this space of interaction there are collectives and not only individuals.

AB  - Aims: To assess awareness about COVID-19 and problems faced by young adults with T1DM amid nationwide lockdown in India.
   Methods: A cross-sectional telephone-based qualitative interview study was conducted in young adults (aged 18-30 years) with T1DM amid lockdown. Following verbal consent, participants were asked 8 openended questions, 5 on awareness about COVID-19 and 3 catering to problems being faced concerning diet, physical activity and treatment amid lockdown. On average, 3 interviews were conducted per day with each lasting for 15-20 min. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed by qualitative content analysis.
   Results: Thirty-two participants were interviewed; after exclusion of two poorly recorded interviews, 30 were finally analyzed. Mean age of participants was 22.4 4.0 years (M:F = 8:7). Only 30%, 40% and 53% of participants were aware of modes of transmission (respiratory droplets and fomites), cardinal symptoms (fever, cough and breathing difficulty) and means of prevention (staying indoors, social distancing and regular hand washing), respectively. Majority of participants were unaware of additional risks associated with COVID-19 in diabetes mellitus. Most participants could continue with their routine diet and prescribed treatment regime, however, 90% reported a reduction in physical activity and 72% experienced worsening of glycemic control post-lockdown.
   Conclusions: Young adults with T1DM lack adequate awareness about COVID-19. Increasing awareness and imparting diabetes self-management education via digital/print media is needed. (C) 2020 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - We developed the Informed Health Choices podcast to improve people's ability to assess claims about the effects of treatments. We evaluated the effects of the podcast in a randomised trial.
   Objectives We conducted this process evaluation to assess the fidelity of the intervention, identify factors that affected the implementation and impact of the intervention and could affect scaling up, and identify potential adverse and beneficial effects.
   Setting The study was conducted in central Uganda in rural, periurban and urban settings.
   Participants We collected data on parents who were in the intervention arm of the Informed Health Choices study that evaluated an intervention to improve parents' ability to assess treatment effects.
   Procedures We conducted 84 semistructured interviews during the intervention, 19 in-depth interviews shortly after, two focus group discussions with parents, one focus group discussion with research assistants and two in-depth interviews with the principal investigators. We used framework analysis to manage qualitative data, assessed the certainty of the findings using the GRADE-CERQual (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative Research) approach, and organised findings in a logic model.
   Outcomes Proportion of participants listening to all episodes; factors influencing the implementation of the podcast; ways to scale up and any adverse and beneficial effects.
   Results All participants who completed the study listened to the podcast as intended, perhaps because of the explanatory design and recruitment of parents with a positive attitude. This was also likely facilitated and providing the participants with MP3 players. The podcast was reportedly clear, understandable, credible and entertaining, which motivated them to listen and eased implementation. No additional adverse effects were reported.
   Conclusions Participants experienced the podcast positively and were motivated to engage with it. These findings help to explain the short-term effectiveness of the intervention, but not the decrease in effectiveness over the following year.

AB  - Understanding when, to what extent, and in which contexts high-profile police actions influence trust in and legitimacy of the police is important because police perceptions are associated with cooperation, compliance and, eventually, trust in the state itself. The current study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess changes in public attitudes toward the police after the violent police dispersal of a protest movement against a new railway station project in Stuttgart on 30 September 2010. We found little to no change in several dimensions of perceptions of police and legitimacy, specifically measures of trust in police, moral alignment, procedural fairness, and obligation to obey the police. However, respondents interviewed after the event saw the police as more unduly influenced by political pressure. The results suggest that the impact of high-profile incidents of police violence may depend on institutional context, media response, and post-incident reconciliation strategies.

AB  - The study explores a changing community at the periphery of Thailand as the country moves toward globalization with the focus on local identity. This project examines the characteristics of globalization as it manifests in a local community; the changing perception of ethnic identity under the emerging globalization context; and, the responses of the local government to the challenges of globalization. Data were gathered from interviews with three different family generations and key informants, and from focus group discussions. The clearer driving force of change may be attributed to the expansion of media and telecommunication and the floating idea of internationalization. The influence of transnational social and cultural movements is from the promotion of Chinese language and culture, and the vibrant Islamic revivalist movement. The study finds that religion remains a strong factor of identity in comparison to traditions and languages. The choice of languages has changed meaning from keeping the mother tongue to gaining a more competitive advantage. As people connecting to cultural and religious roots inside and outside the community, social distances within local ethnic groups become widening. Finally, the local government aims to be part of a greater international community to promote economic development by using the cultural capital of Betong. The local government has constructed the Betong identity which serves as a new social cohesion and, at the same time, a mechanism to stand tall in a globalizing world.

AB  - The eligibility of COVID-19 vaccines has been expanded to children aged 12 and above in several countries including Japan, and there is a plan to further lower the age. This study aimed to assess factors related to parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. A nationwide internet-based cross-sectional study was conducted between May 25 and June 3, 2021 in Japan. The target population was parents of children aged 3-14 years who resided in Japan, and agreed to answer the online questionnaire. Parental COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (their intention to vaccinate their child) and related factors were analyzed using logistic regression models. Interaction effects of gender of parents and their level of social relationship satisfaction related to parental vaccine hesitancy was tested using log likelihood ratio test (LRT). Social media as the most trusted information source increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to those who trusted official information (Adjusted Odds Ratio: aOR 2.80, 95% CI 1.53-5.12). Being a mother and low perceived risk of infection also increased parental vaccine hesitancy compared to father (aOR 2.43, 95% CI 1.57-3.74) and those with higher perceived risk of infection (aOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.04-2.32) respectively. People with lower satisfaction to social relationships tended to be more hesitant to vaccinate their child among mothers in contrast to fathers who showed constant intention to vaccinate their child regardless of the level of satisfaction to social relationship (LRT p = 0.021). Our findings suggest that dissemination of targeted information about COVID-19 vaccine by considering means of communication, gender and people who are isolated during measures of social distancing may help to increase parental vaccine acceptance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 emerged as a serious pandemic in 2019 and billions of people were infected. Various precautionary methods were taken to contain the spread of virus such as social distancing, public lockdown, sanitation, and closure of schools and colleges. Many colleges started online classes to resume their syllabus and to complete the course curriculum. These evening online sessions resulted in late night sleep, long term mobile/computer exposure, and disturbed sleep pattern.
   OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 online classes on morningness-eveningness personality and to compare it with different age groups, gender, and body mass index.
   METHODS: The cluster sampling method was used to collect the subjects from the total of 1153 adult college students, 897 subjects were selected based on the selection criteria and instructed to submit an online survey consists of the Morningness-eveningness Questionnaire and demographic and anthropometric data through mail, social media, or through a researcher by direct interview.
   RESULTS: The mean score for the 897 participants is 56.7, indicating intermediate morningness-eveningness personality type. On comparing the different groups, the youngest group (18-20 years) scored 4.23% (mean = 46.7), female subjects scored 6.13% (mean = 58.1), the underweight 2.67% (mean = 59.2) and overweight groups scored 2.89% (mean = 59.7) indicating definite eveningness. Among the 897 collected samples of the population 8.13% of the subjects experienced definite eveningness, 14.93% has moderate eveningness, 17.38% are under intermediate category, 22.4% have moderate morningness, and 37.11% have definite morningness.
   CONCLUSIONS: Subjects with eveningness personality have high risk of developing mental illness, thus it's important to determine the eveningness personality among student population to avoid serious complications in later age.

TI  - Framing COVID-19: How we conceptualize and discuss the pandemic on Twitter
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - METAPHORS
AB  - Doctors and nurses in these weeks and months are busy in the trenches, fighting against a new invisible enemy: Covid-19. Cities are locked down and civilians are besieged in their own homes, to prevent the spreading of the virus. War-related terminology is commonly used to frame the discourse around epidemics and diseases. The discourse around the current epidemic makes use of war-related metaphors too, not only in public discourse and in the media, but also in the tweets written by non-experts of mass communication. We hereby present an analysis of the discourse around #Covid-19, based on a large corpus tweets posted on Twitter during March and April 2020. Using topic modelling we first analyze the topics around which the discourse can be classified. Then, we show that the WAR framing is used to talk about specific topics, such as the virus treatment, but not others, such as the effects of social distancing on the population. We then measure and compare the popularity of the WAR frame to three alternative figurative frames (MONSTER, STORM and TSUNAMI) and a literal frame used as control (FAMILY). The results show that while the FAMILY frame covers a wider portion of the corpus, among the figurative frames WAR, a highly conventional one, is the frame used most frequently. Yet, this frame does not seem to be apt to elaborate the discourse around some aspects involved in the current situation. Therefore, we conclude, in line with previous suggestions, a plethora of framing options-or a metaphor menu-may facilitate the communication of various aspects involved in the Covid-19-related discourse on the social media, and thus support civilians in the expression of their feelings, opinions and beliefs during the current pandemic.

AB  - Background and Aim: In the wave of COVID-19 pandemic, the whole world has come to a standstill. This led to a major setback for cancer patients jeopardizing their treatment plans. This study analyzes the coping mechanisms of running outpatient and inpatient palliative care services in these COVID-19 times - the New Normal. Materials and Methods: An observational study was conducted in the pain and palliative care unit at a tertiary care hospital, India. The data were collected from March 23, 2020, to May 22, 2020, of all patients coming to the clinic and inpatient referrals. Using manual and electronic records, demographic data was collected along with clinical data. Additional data were compiled with special attention to the patient's pain and its management. Results: Despite complete lockdown and initial low patient load, we saw a progressive increase in the number of patients coming to the clinic. A total of 108 patients visited our clinic (65 male and 43 female), of which 78% of the patients were from Delhi. The median age was 43.94 years (range 6 years to 76 years). We had 33 new and 75 old registered cases coming. The main reason was new-onset pain because of noncompliance of drugs; the opioid stock finished with the patient. We saw a very high number of patients requiring strong and weak opioids. Proper personal protection and social distancing helped in preventing crossinfection. None of our staff or patients fell ill during this time. Communication skills were modified to convey feelings and empathize patients. Telemedicine using phone and video calls was used and found to be useful. Conclusion: We share our experience and challenges of providing palliative care in our clinic which can be modified as per the individual requirements in other setups.

AB  - Within its wide range, populations of the Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) have declined, mostly in Europe, and have only begun to re-establish after effective regulation of persistent organic pollutants in their habitat. In South Korea, otter populations have also recovered in response to improved environmental conditions and conservation programmes. Scientific research and public awareness have both facilitated conservation efforts to restore otter populations in South Korea, but how changing public attitudes to conservation have contributed to otter recovery is unknown. Because historic newspaper articles can reveal such changes, we categorised the 5168 newspaper articles about otters from 1962 to 2010 into five topics (occurrence, ecotourism, conflict, research, and restoration) and geo-tagged any otter locations mentioned to a 15 x 15 km grid to compare with the otter distribution established by five scientific surveys. Since 2000, the number of newspaper articles about conflicts between otters and urban development, and the roles of otters in encouraging eco-tourism have increased significantly. About 12% of grid squares with otters were reported only in newspaper articles, mostly in urban areas, which were under-represented in the scientific surveys that focused more on forested areas. The increase over time in the otter occurrence rate reported in urban areas suggests that high citizen interest in occurrence could be basis for understanding the ecological importance of human-carnivore coexistence. As for understanding importance of conservation, otters are a good example of a resource for establishing conservation strategies and citizen education for effective conservation.

AB  - Public Policy Relevance Statement This research shows that people turn to media to cope with significant stressors as much as, if not more than, strategies typically recommended by health professionals. Furthermore, across all coping strategies, only TV/movie viewing seemed to mitigate the negative effects of stress on both coping efficacy and proactive coping behavior. Combined, these findings highlight the critical role media can play in helping people cope meaningfully with stress.
   The COVID-19 pandemic presented a unique opportunity to answer the critical question: How does media use aid (or subvert) emotion- and problem-focused coping with significant life stressors? Based on a national survey (N = 564) conducted on March 20-25, 2020, the week after COVID-19 was declared a U.S. national emergency, evidence offered strong support for the use and value of media, entertainment media in particular, as key aids to coping processes. Looking across a range of coping techniques, only TV/movie and music consumption emerged as a significant mediator between stress and coping efficacy, which, in turn, was significantly associated with social distancing likelihood. These and other results provide evidence for the important role that media consumption can play in supporting coping processes in ways both unique from more basic emotional regulation and beyond techniques typically recommended by health professionals.

AB  - Background The 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) is responsible for thousands of deaths and hospitalizations. To curb the spread of this highly transmissible disease, governments enacted protective guidelines for its citizens, including social distancing and stay-at-home orders. These restrictions on social interactions can be especially problematic for individuals managing or recovering from addiction given that treatment often involves access to services and resources that became limited or even unavailable at this time. Social media sites like Twitter serve as a space for users to post questions and concerns about timely topics and allow for researchers to track common themes among the public. The goal of this study was to identify how the public was discussing addiction on Twitter during the COVID pandemic.Methods:We performed a text mining analysis to analyze tweets that contained "addiction" and "covid" to capture posts from the public that illustrated comments and concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. We report on 3,301 tweets captured between January 31 and April 23, 2020. The study was conducted in the United States, but contained tweets from multiple countries.Results:The most prevalent topics had to do with services offered by Acadia Healthcare and Serenity Healthcare Centers, attempts to manage time while home, difficulties of coping with alcoholism amidst rising sales of alcohol, and attention to ongoing health crises (e.g.,., opioids, vaping). Additional topics included affordable telehealth services, research from France on the relationship between nicotine and COVID-19, concerns about gambling addiction, and changing patterns in substance misuse as drug availability varies.Conclusions:Analyzing Twitter content enables health professionals to identify the public's concerns about addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings from text mining studies addressing timely health topics can serve as preliminary analyses for building more comprehensive models, which can then be used to generate recommendations for the larger public and inform policy.

AB  - Every year, the number of tourists in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is increasing. The most numerous visitors are journalists who come to perform their official duties. At the same time, researchers have not yet shown interest in such an interesting and important tourist phenomenon. The purpose of this article is to de- scribe a new phenomenon of media tourism in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone and its features. The study was conducted with a help of a qualitative case study analysis method. The websites of the state and private enterprises and mass media publications based on the results of trips to the territory for 2013-2017 were analyzed. As a result, the specific features of journalists who visit the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone were identified. Such journalists mainly have confidence in the absence of a threat to health (55%), developed empathy (45%) and imagination of thinking (45%). Consequently, the tragedy of history and the gloomy appearance of the territory, the suffering of local residents make it attractive to journalists. In addition, due to personal interest, the voluntary travel motive (61,5%) prevails over conditional forced travel (38,5%). At the same time, the attention of journalists to the territory is attracted due to the activities of tourists. The authors describe the so-called "compensation effect", when the reduction of tourists' attention to the territory is balanced by an increase in the attention of the mass media. The presence of risk explains the predominance of men among journalists in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone (54%). For example, women can better assess the risk due to greater vulnerability. The peculiarity of journalists' work in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone is the risk of radiation exposure and ethical controversy. The study shows that journalists' inherent positive world perception and profound sense of professional duty can successfully overcome these obstacles. The results of the study can be used by the following researchers to identify ways and strategies for promoting media tourism in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The benefit of this study is to draw attention to a new unexplored tourist phenomenon. Mass media have a great influence on the formation of a positive attitude towards the territory and attracting the attention of tourists. Taking into account the specific features of media tourism will help to attract more tourists and improve the quality of rendering service to journalists.

KW  - older adults
AB  - Background: The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March 2020, due to the number of newly reported confirmed cases and the rapid increase in deaths. Therefore, countries around the world limited their population to policies such as "social distancing " or "staying at home " to prevent the spread of the virus. The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in lifestyle pre and post the outbreak COVID-19 among older adults in South Korea and to identify the impact of lifestyle differences on depression and quality of life. Methods: An online single questionnaire covering sociodemographic data, lifestyle details, depression status, and quality of life level was distributed using mailing lists and social media. To assess lifestyles differences in older people pre and post the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic, the online single questionnaire was used post COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the participants' memories, they responded lifestyles at two time points (pre and post COVID-19 pandemic). Results: The results showed that there was a significant decrease in physical activity and activity participation during the pandemic. In terms of nutrition, there was no statistically significant change pre and post the outbreak COVID-19, except for the intake of protein, fat, and vitamins. Additionally, the results showed that the resulting lifestyle differences seem to have had a negative impact on depression and quality of life among older adults in South Korea. Conclusion: There was a significant difference the lifestyle patterns among the participants in South Korea between the current period and pre COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, it is observed that these differenced lifestyles were associated with depression and quality of life among the participants. Our findings may help to develop public health programs that support healthy lifestyles in pandemic conditions.

TI  - Knowledge and awareness-based survey of COVID-19 within the eye care profession in Nepal: Misinformation is hiding the truth
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background Nepal was under a severe lockdown for several months in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There were concerns regarding misinformation circulating on social media. This study aimed to analyse the knowledge and awareness of COVID-19 amongst eye care professionals in Nepal during the first wave of the pandemic. Methodology We invited 600 participants from 12 ophthalmic centres across Nepal to complete a qualitative, anonymous online survey. Altogether, 25 questions (both open and closed-ended) were used. An overall performance score was calculated from the average of the 12 "Knowledge" questions for all the participants. Results Of the 600 eye care professionals invited, 310 (51%) participated in the survey. The symptoms of COVID-19 were known to 94%, whilst only 49% of the participants were aware how the disease was transmitted, with 54% aware that anyone can be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Almost 98% of participants recognized the World Health Organization's (WHO) awareness message, but surprisingly, 41% of participants felt that consumption of hot drinks helps to destroy the virus, in contradiction to WHO information. Importantly, 95% of the participants were aware of personal protective equipment (PPE) and what the acronym stands for. Social distancing was felt to be key to limiting the disease spread; whilst 41% disagreed that PPE should be mandatory for eye care practitioners. The mean overall "Knowledge" performance score was 69.65% (SD +/- 22.81). Conclusion There is still considerable scope to improve the knowledge of COVID-19 amongst ophthalmic professionals in Nepal. Opinion is also split on measures to prevent transmission, with misinformation potentially fuelling confusion. It is recommended to follow WHO and national guidelines, whilst seeking published scientific evidence behind any unofficial statements, to accurately inform one's clinical practice.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is an infectious disease that has killed more than 555,000 people in the US. During a time of social distancing measures and increasing social isolation, green spaces may be a crucial factor to maintain a physically and socially active lifestyle while not increasing risk of infection. Objectives: We evaluated whether greenness was related to COVID-19 incidence and mortality in the US.
   Methods: We downloaded data on COVID-19 cases and deaths for each US county up through June 7, 2020, from Johns Hopkins University, Center for Systems Science and Engineering Coronavirus Resource Center. We used April-May 2020 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data, to represent the greenness exposure during the initial COVID-19 outbreak in the US. We fitted negative binomial mixed models to evaluate associations of NDVI with COVID-19 incidence and mortality, adjusting for potential confounders such as county-level demographics, epidemic stage, and other environmental factors. We evaluated whether the associations were modified by population density, proportion of Black residents, median home value, and issuance of stay-at-home orders.
   Results: An increase of 0.1 in NDVI was associated with a 6% (95% Confidence Interval: 3%, 10%) decrease in COVID-19 incidence rate after adjustment for potential confounders. Associations with COVID-19 incidence were stronger in counties with high population density and in counties with stay-at-home orders. Greenness was not associated with COVID-19 mortality in all counties; however, it was protective in counties with higher population density. Discussion: Exposures to NDVI were associated with reduced county-level incidence of COVID-19 in the US as well as reduced county-level COVID-19 mortality rates in densely populated counties.

KW  - primary care
AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, there is concern that social distancing, fear of contagion, quarantining of providers, cancellation of elective procedures, media coverage about the pandemic, and other factors drastically reduced physician visits, putting severe financial strain on outpatient providers, and having unknown ramifications for health outcomes. Objectives: We estimate the effect of the pandemic on utilization of outpatient services. Research Design: Using 2010-2020 data from a national dataset, the Outpatient Influenza-like Illness Surveillance Network, we estimate the difference in outpatient care utilization during the time period of the COVID-19 pandemic versus the same weeks in prior years. Results: Our findings indicate that the pandemic started to reduce visits during the week of March 15-21. The effect on visits grew until reaching a peak during the week of April 5-11, 2020, when the pandemic reduced the total number of outpatient visits per provider by 70% relative to the same week in prior years. We find negative effects of the pandemic on visits for non-flu symptoms as well as on visits for flu symptoms, but the magnitudes of these latter effects tended to be larger in magnitude. The pandemic's impact declined over time, and by the week of June 28 to July 4, 2020, there was no longer any difference in total visits per provider relative to the same week in prior years. Despite the resurgence of COVID-19 in June and July, we still find no effects on total visits when our data end in July 26 to August 1, 2020. Conclusions: Our findings show that one by-product of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States is a large decline in the use of outpatient care which peaked around the week of April 5-11. Total outpatient visits rebounded completely and remain stable as of July 26 to August 1, 2020.

KW  - VIRUS-INFECTION
AB  - Objectives: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become pandemic and turn in a challenge for Latin America. Understanding the dynamics of the epidemic is essential for decision making, and to reduce the health, economic, and social impacts of the pandemic. The present study aimed to estimate the effective reproductive number (R-t) of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-Cov2) infection during the first 10 days of the outbreak in seven Latin American countries with the highest incidence of cases as of March 23, 2020. Furthermore, we chose to compare the seven countries with Spain and Italy given their history with the virus.
   Methods: Incidence data retrieved from the COVID-19 data repository by Johns Hopkins University were analyzed. The Rt was calculated for the first 10 days of the epidemic in Brazil, Ecuador, Chile, Colombia, Panama, Mexico, and Peru. Rt estimations were compared with Spain and Italy values for the same interval.
   Results: The median Rt for the first 10 days of the COVID-19 epidemic were 2.90 (2.67-3.14) for Spain and 2.83 (2.7-2.96) for Italy. Latin American Rt estimations were higher in Ecuador (3.95(3.7-4.21)), Panama (3.95(3.7-4.21)), and Brazil (3.95(3.7-4.21)). The smallest one was observed in Peru (2.36(2.11-2.63)). All Latin American countries had Rt greater than 2.
   Conclusions: The initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic in Latin America suggested a high Rt. Interventions such as domestic and international travel restrictions, educational institutions closure, social distancing, and intensified case surveillance should be adopted to prevent the collapse of the health systems.

AB  - Background/Objective: The outbreak of COVID-19 and the lack of vaccine made extraordinary actions such as social distancing necessary. While some individuals experience the restrictions on daily life as a heavy burden, others adapt to the situation and try to make the best of it. The present longitudinal study investigated the extent and predictors of the burden induced by the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany.
   Method: Data were assessed in October 2019 using the DASS-21 and the PMH-Scale, and in March 2020 adding a six-item measure of burden and a 2-item rating of sense of control.
   Results: In a sample of 436 participants, about 28% stayed in self-quarantine, 22 persons had relevant symptoms and one person was positively tested for COVID-19. Most participants experienced medium to high levels of burden but tried to make the best of it. Stress symptoms in 2019 predicted a higher level of burden and PMH predicted a lower level of burden in March 2020. Remarkably, depression and anxiety symptoms did not significantly predict burden.

AB  - Objectives Perceptions of people regarding COVID-19 influences their health behaviour in terms of seeking public health services. This helps the government in planning appropriate public health strategies. Therefore, this study intends to explore the perceptions of people towards COVID-19 and their experiences during the pandemic in Nepal. Design, setting and participants This qualitative study was conducted among the public in Kathmandu, Kanchanpur, Bajura and Jhapa districts of Nepal. Eight focus group discussions and 40 in-depth interviews were conducted by using a maximum variation sampling method. Results The findings were organised into the following themes: General understanding of COVID-19, Disease prevention, Source of information and misconceptions, Expectation and challenges; and Personal and societal consequences of COVID-19, social distancing and lockdown. There was a good general understanding among respondents about COVID-19, personal preventive measures and population-level strategies. They responded that the use of masks, sanitisers, handwashing and proper lockdown would help to prevent the disease. The respondents acknowledged the vital role of media in increasing awareness. Participants also expressed concerns over the misleading news spread by some media. The lack of social interaction, isolation and loss of income were raised as pertinent issues by the participants as potentially leading to psychological consequences. Health workers and public both raised concerns over inadequate Personal Protective Equipment, under-prepared health system, unorganised public quarantine centres, and public violation of lockdown Conclusions This study reports participants' views on disease prevention measures such as maintaining personal hygiene, adhering to physical distancing, and using personal protective equipments. Additionally, it illuminates the confusion among public due to conflicting public health messages from different sources of information which was deemed as misleading by the participants. This research sheds light on people's perspectives and experiences that can inform population-targeted policies in the future.

AB  - In two studies, we examined nonsmokers' perceptions of smokers and consequences of the perceptions. In Study 1, smokers answered questions about their sense of self, dependence on smoking, and motivation to quit. Nonsmokers answered questions about their perceptions of these characteristics. Differences between smokers' self-descriptions and nonsmokers' perceptions were observed. Study 2 asked nonsmokers to judge two types of smokers for which the descriptions were based on Study 1 findings. Results showed that nonsmokers held a more negative attitude about and were less willing to engage in different close relationships with the smoker who was described in terms of nonsmokers' perceptions rather than smokers' reports. Attitude mediated the relationship between type of smoker and willingness to date a smoker.

AB  - Purpose Telecommuting from home is back up on the agenda as a result of the unforeseen challenges brought by COVID-19. Working from home permits to avoid disruption in the ordinary functioning of educational institutions triggered by social distancing. However, home-based telecommuting may have some side effects on employees, especially in terms of work-life balance. Soft Total Quality Management (TQM) initiatives are needed to address these side effects. The article intends to shed light on these issues, providing some food for thought to scholars and practitioners. Design/methodology/approach Secondary data about the working conditions of 2,046 people employed in the education sector across Europe were investigated. A serial mediation analysis was designed to examine the direct and indirect implications of working from home on work-life balance. Findings The study suggests that home-based telecommuting may trigger work-to-life and life-to-work conflicts, due to the blurring of boundaries between work and everyday life. Soft tools, such as organizational meaningfulness (OM) and work-related well-being (WB), mediate the relationship between working from home (HW) and work-life conflicts (WLC), lessening the negative implications of working from home on work-life balance. Practical implications The design and the implementation of home-based telecommuting arrangements should include a special concern for soft TQM practices. Among others, OM and WB are likely to minimize the disruption of remote employees' jobs and interpersonal relationships. Failure to do so impairs the ability of home-based employees to make sense out of their working arrangements and to achieve a sustainable work-life balance. Originality/value This is one of the first attempts to illuminate the side effects of home-based telecommuting and to investigate the role of soft TQM in addressing these side effects.

AB  - Drawing on social norms theories, we suggest that religiosity substantially increases subjective well-being if it is considered normative in a certain national context. In Study 1, we test this hypothesis using an indicator of a country's social norm of religiosity that includes both the national level of religiosity and the social desirability of religion. The results of a multilevel regression analysis suggest that religious individuals are on average happier and more satisfied with life than non-religious individuals. This effect is stronger in religious countries with dominant negative attitudes towards non-believers. In Study 2, we further examine whether the differences in social recognition of religious and non-religious individuals in countries where religiosity is normative account for this finding. The results of a moderated mediation analysis indicate that in religious countries, religious people report being treated with more respect, which partially explains their higher levels of happiness and life satisfaction.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected many sectors, especially the health and economic aspects. On the bright side, the potential for social solidarity in the community has been increased. New media technology becomes an oasis in the midst of anxiety when people are forced to distance themselves or carrying out social distancing. Net citizens are using new media technology to raise solidarity and appeal to prevent the spread of COVID-19 from various campaigns on social media. This research aimed to study social movements to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and employed a qualitative approach using content analysis. The results showed that the pandemic triggered the public to take advantage of various social media platforms by creating content about public education and campaigning to raise funds or crowdfunding. It is as if a blessing in disguise when this disaster resulted in the value of collaborative work or gotong royong that comes from Pancasila, which characterizes the nation's values so that people are motivated to remind each other to maintain health and also help others to ease the burden of those affected. The solidarity movement to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic is dominated by public figures.

T2  - CLINICAL INFECTIOUS DISEASES
LA  - English
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - risk communication
KW  - social media
AB  - A number of important principles in effective risk communication established in the late 20th century can provide important scientific insight into patient response to the risks posed by coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Early risk communication scholars found acceptability of risk was shaped by 2 key components: hazard and outrage. The number of people who are exposed, infected, and fall ill can be considered the hazard. How the public and patients and respond to messages regarding risk mitigation relates to outrage. Social and cultural factors, immediacy, uncertainty, familiarity, personal control, scientific uncertainty, and trust in institutions and media all shape perception and response to risk mesaging. Outrage factors influence the ever-changing public understanding of COVID-19 risk. In concert, hazard and outrage along with cultural and economic context shape adherence to, and overall acceptance of, personal mitigation strategies including wearing facemasks and social distancing among the general public. The spread of misinformation on social media also provides both challenges and opportunities for clinicians. Social media offers an opportunity for experts to quickly convey true information about hazards, but offers others the opportunity to counter this with the spread of misinformation and exacerbate outrage. We propose strategies for infectious diseases clinicians to apply risk communication principles and frameworks to improve patient care and public message development in response to COVID-19.

AB  - Purpose To discover how UK academic libraries sought to support student mental health and well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The data was from a 24-question survey of UK universities distributed in May 2021 which received 56 responses from 47 different Higher Education Institution libraries. Descriptive statistics are combined with thematic analysis of open text comments. Findings Libraries were undertaking a wide range of activities, targeted chiefly at students and broadcast via Twitter, other social media and library web sites. The problem being addressed was the stresses of studying in the context of the pivot online and isolation caused by social distancing. Digital well-being seemed also to be an increased concern. COVID-19 had proved the value of digital support but created a number of challenges such as loss of physical space, communication barriers and lack of extra resource. The role had a somewhat informal place in the organisation. Overall library activities were aligned but not strongly integrated into institutional efforts. Research limitations/implications This was a study in one specific national context with a relatively limited number of total responses. There could be a non-response bias where respondents were doing more than was typical in the sector. Originality/value The paper is one of the first papers to gather sector wide data and move beyond case studies of what individual libraries due to support to mental health and well-being. It also offers a case study of the impacts of COVID-19 on management pointing to its catalysing the digital shift, creating constraints on resources and communication and prompting the emergence of staff well-being as a consideration in management decision making.

KW  - Patient care
AB  - Background > The management of older cancer patients has been highly challenging for clinicians in a health-care system operating at maximum capacity during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Patients and methods > We analyzed data from 9 different institutions. The primary endpoint was to assess the prevalence of adapted patient care during the pandemic for elderly cancer patients. The secondary endpoint was to assess the incidence of hospitalization and mortality due to COVID-19. All patients were older than 65 years of age.
   Results > We analyzed data from 332 outpatients' case files between 9th of March and 30th of April 2020. The median age was 75 years (range: 65-101) and 53% were male. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of the outpatients received modified patient care, defined as postponement or cancellation of surgery, irradiation scheme adapted, systemic treatment or the use of telemedicine. Among patients with localized cancer, 60% had a change in management strategy due to the pandemic. Changes in management strategy were made for 53% of patients at the metastatic stage. The use of GCSF was remarkable, at 83% of patients, and increased considerably in the context of the pandemic. Sixty-nine percent of physicians used telemedicine. In the final analysis, only one patient was hospitalized for COVID-19 infection. No deaths due to COVID-19 were reported.
   Conclusion > Our study is the first to assess modification of patient care in elderly cancer outpatients during an epidemic. With this unprecedented crisis, our objective is to protect our patients from infection via protective barrier measures and social distancing, but also to guarantee the continuity of cancer care without overexposing this fragile population. Physicians were able to adapt their practice and used new forms of management, like telemedicine.

TI  - Attitude of Iranian Female University Students to Sport and Exercise
T2  - IRANIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Women's sport has always been a challenging subject in Muslim countries and Muslim women have had to face various constraints regarding their participation in sport and exercise, which also influence their attitudes to sport. This study aims to explore the attitude of Iranian female university students toward sport by survey method (N = 1,120) and qualitative interviews (N = 50). The results indicate that the majority of the participants have negative attitudes to sport, and accordingly they do not practice it. Various macro-, meso- and micro-level factors were found as perceived barriers. From the results it can be concluded that the media as a tool for raising awareness to providing role models and shaping the social values of mainstream society does not take a positive role in order to develop the culture of women's sport, and to change the attitude of female students and their social environments to sport in Iranian society.

AB  - The purpose of this paper was to explore the benefits and barriers influencing participation for athletes with disabilities from a developing country (Malaysia). Two independent studies were undertaken: Study 1 included a sample of 123 athletes (95 males, 28 females) who participated in the 2006 Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled (FESPIC Games); Study 2 involved focus group discussions with 14 elite athletes. The athletes ranged in age from 15 to 59years. Data were collected through a questionnaire (Study 1) and focus group discussions (Study 2). The primary reasons for participation in sport were achievement/challenge (58%) and competency/skill development (41%). The main barriers faced by the athletes were structural (facilities, equipment, funding) and the negative attitude from the government, public and media. However, despite these difficulties the majority of athletes were keen to continue to compete. Further work is required to ensure athletes with disabilities are provided with similar opportunities to athletes without disabilities.

AB  - BackgroundIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated adoption of scarce resource allocation (SRA) policies, we sought to rapidly deploy a novel survey to ascertain community values and preferences for SRA and to test the utility of a brief intervention to improve knowledge of and values alignment with a new SRA policy. Given social distancing and precipitous evolution of the pandemic, Internet-enabled recruitment was deemed the best method to engage a community-based sample. We quantify the efficiency and acceptability of this Internet-based recruitment for engaging a trial cohort and describe the approach used for implementing a health-related trial entirely online using off-the-shelf tools.MethodsWe recruited 1971 adult participants (>= 18years) via engagement with community partners and organizations and outreach through direct and social media messaging. We quantified response rate and participant characteristics of our sample, examine sample representativeness, and evaluate potential non-response bias.ResultsRecruitment was similarly derived from direct referral from partner organizations and broader social media based outreach, with extremely low study entry from organic (non-invited) search activity. Of social media platforms, Facebook was the highest yield recruitment source. Bot activity was present but minimal and identifiable through meta-data and engagement behavior. Recruited participants differed from broader populations in terms of sex, ethnicity, and education, but had similar prevalence of chronic conditions. Retention was satisfactory, with entrance into the first follow-up survey for 61% of those invited.ConclusionsWe demonstrate that rapid recruitment into a longitudinal intervention trial via social media is feasible, efficient, and acceptable. Recruitment in conjunction with community partners representing target populations, and with outreach across multiple platforms, is recommended to optimize sample size and diversity. Trial implementation, engagement tracking, and retention are feasible with off-the-shelf tools using preexisting platforms.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT04373135. Registered on May 4, 2020

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to the closure of universities and colleges throughout the world, with the hope that public health officials' suggestion of social distancing would help flatten the sickness curve and reduce overall mortality from the outbreak. However, the Learning Management System (LMS) is the perfect approach for fostering the dedication of students to content in education like sustainability. Previous studies have seldom investigated an integrated approach in the context of LMS in industrialized nations. In addition, this paper aims to include a literature analysis of recent research conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic in the area of LMS usage, as well as to investigate variables predicting the usage of LMS by higher education students during the COVID-19 pandemic for students' engagement. On the basis of LMS usage data obtained from an online survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) and route analysis were utilized to verify the research model, a survey consisting of student LMS users King Saud University. The findings showed that the desire of students to use LMS had beneficial effects during the COVID-19 pandemic on learning as sustainability engagement. Also, student-perceived closeness, peer references and subjective well-being are favorably associated with the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, this, in turn, influences students' intentions to utilize, which, in turn, effects the usage of LMS for student engagement during COVID-19.

AB  - Although research has shown that school context has consequences for intergroup attitudes, few studies have examined the role of teacher qualities, such as teacher support. In addition, previous research has paid limited attention to the mechanisms that could help to explain teacher effects. This 5-wave study (2010-2015) examined the effects of perceived teacher support on the anti-immigrant attitudes of Swedish majority youth (N=671, M-age=13.41, 50.2% girls, 34 classrooms). It also tested whether social trust would mediate these effects. The results of multilevel analyses showed that perceived teacher support was associated with less prejudice at all levels of analysis. At the within-person level, fluctuations in teacher support were related to fluctuations in youth prejudice: in years when, on average, adolescents perceived their teachers as more supportive, they reported lower prejudice. At the between-person level, adolescents who perceived their teachers as more supportive compared to their peers reported lower prejudice. Similarly, classrooms where students shared an experience of teacher support were lower in prejudice than classrooms with weaker teacher support. The results also showed that social trust explained teacher effects: adolescents who experienced their teachers as more supportive displayed higher levels of trust and, in turn, lower levels of prejudice than youth with less supportive teachers. These findings suggest that teachers can counteract the development of prejudice and facilitate social trust in adolescents by being supportive of them.

AB  - The SARS-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infectious disease, COVID-19, has spread rapidly, resulting in a global pandemic with significant mortality. The combination of early diagnosis via rapid screening, contact tracing, social distancing and quarantine has helped to control the pandemic. The absence of real time response and diagnosis is a crucial technology shortfall and is a key reason why current contact tracing methods are inadequate to control spread. In contrast, current information technology combined with a new generation of near-real time tests offers consumer-engaged smartphone-based "lab-in-a-phone" internet-of-things (IoT) connected devices that provide increased pandemic monitoring. This review brings together key aspects required to create an entire global diagnostic ecosystem. Cross-disciplinary understanding and integration of both mechanisms and technologies for effective detection, incidence mapping and disease containment in near real-time is summarized. Available measures to monitor and/or sterilize surfaces, next-generation laboratory and smartphone-based diagnostic approaches can be brought together and networked for instant global monitoring that informs Public Health policy. Cloud-based analysis enabling real-time mapping will enable future pandemic control, drive the suppression and elimination of disease spread, saving millions of lives globally. A new paradigm is introduced - scaled and multiple diagnostics for mapping and spreading of a pandemic rather than traditional accumulation of individual measurements. This can do away with the need for ultra-precise and ultra-accurate analysis by taking mass measurements that can relax tolerances and build resilience through networked analytics and informatics, the basis for novel swarm diagnostics. These include addressing ethical standards, local, national and international collaborative engagement, multidisciplinary and analytical measurements and standards, and data handling and storage protocols.

AB  - The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic forced the home confinement of the majority of population around the world, including a significant number of children and adolescents, for several weeks in 2020. Negative psychological effects have been identified in adults, but research about the impact of this type of social distancing measure on children and adolescents is scarce. The present study aimed to describe and compare the immediate psychological and behavioral symptoms associated with COVID-19 quarantine in children and adolescents from three southern European countries with different levels of restrictions (Italy, Spain, and Portugal). Parents of 1,480 children and adolescents (52.8% boys) between 3 and 18 years old (M = 9.15, SD = 4.27) participated in the study. An online survey using snowball sampling techniques was conducted during 15 days between March and April 2020, representing the early phase of the quarantine associated with COVID-19 outbreak. Parents answered questionnaires about sociodemographic data, housing conditions, immediate psychological responses during quarantine (e.g., anxiety, mood, sleep, and behavioral alterations), patterns of use of screens, daily physical activity, and sleep hours before and during the quarantine. The results revealed an increase in children's psychological and behavioral symptoms, increased screen-time, reduced physical activity, and more sleep hours/night. Italian children presented less psychological and behavioral symptoms compared with Portuguese and Spanish children. In general, hierarchical multiple regressions revealed that having an outdoor exit in the house (e.g., garden, terrace) contributed to lower levels of psychological and behavioral symptomatology. Future studies are needed to identify family and individual variables that can better predict children and adolescents' well-being during and after quarantine. Recommendations for families and implications for practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose. The goal of this study was to understand the impact of COVID-19 pandemic and associated lockdown measures on the volume, rate, and type of trauma presenting to the emergency department (ED) by using trauma-initiated CT studies to capture patient data. Materials and Methods. We performed a retrospective observational study comparing patients undergoing CT scans for trauma during the 1(st) and 2(nd) lockdown periods compared to corresponding prepandemic months. During two lockdown periods, public places such as restaurants, libraries, parks, and shops across the province were shut down. Government-led messaging advised that people should stay at home and practice social distancing. The rate of trauma-initiated CT scans and the proportion of different types of traumas were compared between time periods. Results. There was no significant difference in overall trauma-initiated CT scans between the prepandemic and pandemic levels. Motor vehicle collision (MVC) cases decreased from 18.2% to 15.6% during the first lockdown period (p = 0.049) and also reduced from 29.1% to 25.2% during the second lockdown period (p = 0.013). Trauma from falls increased from 19.1% to 27.5% (p = 0.036) during the first lockdown, despite no significant change during the 2(nd) lockdown. Furthermore, the percentage of stab injuries increased from 25.0% to 38.9% while blunt trauma decreased from 68.5% to 54.3% during two lockdowns (p = 0.015). Conclusion. The total number of trauma-initiated CT scans did not significantly decrease during the lockdown periods. Stabbings and falls increased during lockdown periods while MVCs and blunt trauma decreased.

AB  - Social contact is one of the best methods for reducing stigma, and the effect may be associated with emotional response and social cognition. The amygdala is a key region of these functions and can be divided into three subregions, each of which has a different function and connectivity. We investigated whether the amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity is associated with the effect of anti-stigma interventions on reducing mental health-related stigma in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) over 12 months. Healthy young adults [n= 77, age, mean (SD) = 21.23 (0.94) years; male,n= 48], who were subsampled from an RCT (n= 259) investigating the effect of anti-stigma interventions, using filmed social contacts (FSC) or internet self-learning (INS), on reducing stigma, underwent 10 min resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging between the trial registration and 12 months follow-up. The extent of stigma was assessed at the baseline, post-intervention and 12 month follow-up surveys, using the Japanese-language version of the Social Distance Scale (SDSJ), to assess negative emotional attitude toward people with schizophrenia. We compared associations between amygdala subregion-related functional connectivity and changes in the SDSJ scores for 12 months across the control, INS, and FSC groups. Associations between the change in stigma for 12 months and the superficial (SF) subregion of the amygdala-related connectivity in the intracalcarine cortex [(x, y, z) = (-8, -66, 12), z = 4.21,PFWE-corrected= 0.0003, cluster size = 192] differed across groups. Thepost hocanalysis showed that the SF-intracalcarine cortex connectivity was negatively correlated with the change in stigma only in the FSC group. The current results indicate that greater SF-intracalcarine cortex connectivity is associated with a better response to the FSC interventions, suggesting that biological variability could underlie the long-term effect of anti-stigma interventions on stigma in the real world.

KW  - INFECTION
AB  - Background Key infection prevention and control measures to limit transmission of COVID-19 include social distancing, hand hygiene, use of facemasks and personal protective equipment. However, these have limited or no impact if not applied correctly through lack of knowledge, inappropriate attitude or incorrect practice. In order to maximise the impact of infection prevention and control measures on COVID-19 spread, we undertook a study to assess and improve knowledge, attitudes and practice among 119 healthcare workers and 100 general public in Thailand. The study setting was two inpatient hospitals providing COVID-19 testing and treatment. Detailed information on knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. Results Knowledge of the main transmission routes, commonest symptoms and recommended prevention methods was mostly very high (> 80%) in both groups. There was lower awareness of aerosols, food and drink and pets as sources of transmission; of the correct duration for handwashing; recommended distance for social/physical distancing; and about recommended types of face coverings. Information sources most used and most trusted were the workplace, work colleagues, health workers and television. The results were used to produce a set of targeted educational videos which addressed many of these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting in a number of areas. This included improvements in handwashing practice with an increase in the number of areas correctly washed in 65.5% of the public, and 57.9% of healthcare workers. The videos were then further optimized with feedback from participants followed by another round of retesting. Conclusions Detailed information on gaps in knowledge, attitudes and practice among the general public and healthcare workers regarding COVID-19 transmission and its prevention were obtained from a combination of questionnaires and observations. This was used to produce targeted educational videos which addressed these gaps with subsequent improvements on retesting. The resulting videos were then disseminated as a resource to aid in efforts to fight COVID-19 in Thailand and worldwide.

AB  - There is no satisfactory account of the psychological processes that mediate a news framing effect. Based on an experimental study (N = 1,537), this article presents a mediation analysis of a news framing effect on opinion, testing for two important mediation processes: belief importance and belief content change. Results show that framing is mediated by both belief importance and belief content, with belief content being the more prominent variable. The extent to which each process takes effect depends on a person's level of political knowledge. Knowledgeable individuals are affected to a greater extent via both belief content and belief importance change.

AB  - Some research suggests a racial-ethnic hierarchy exists as to perceptions of police, with African-Americans exhibiting the most negative attitudes, Whites the most positive, and Hispanics holding more intermediate attitudes. Other findings regarding Hispanics are less consistent and little study has been made of Asians. This study further tests the premise for such a hierarchy by examining the views of both Hispanics and Asians alongside those of African-Americans and Whites as they relate to police misconduct. Partial support for a hierarchy of attitudes was found, with Hispanics exhibiting the hypothesised intermediate attitudes. While race remained an important factor for explaining African-Americans' attitudes, other factors ultimately better explained Hispanics' attitudes. The attitudes of Asians were indistinguishable from those of Whites. These findings suggest the experiences of racial-ethnic groups widely vary and the premise of a racial-ethnic continuum may be too simplistic for understanding the attitudes of Asians and Hispanics.

AB  - Social identity exploration is a process whereby individuals actively seek information about their group membership and show efforts to understand its meaning. Developmental theory argues that exploration-based ingroup commitment is the basis for outgroup positivity. We tested this notion in relation to national identity and attitudes towards immigrants. The results of five experimental studies among German adolescents and early adults (N = 1,146; 16-25 years) and one internal meta-analysis suggest that the positive identification-prejudice link is weaker when participants are instructed to explore the meaning of their identity (Study 1). This is not mediated via self-uncertainty (Study 2), but via a reduction in intergroup threat (Study 3) and an increase in deprovincialization (Study 4). In addition, identity exploration enabled strong identifiers to oppose descriptive ingroup norms (Study 5). We conclude that identity exploration can contribute to a further understanding of the identification-prejudice link.

AB  - Recent work has found that an individual's beliefs and personal characteristics can impact perceptions of and responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Certain individuals-such as those who are politically conservative or who endorse conspiracy theories-are less likely to engage in preventative behaviors like social distancing. The current research aims to address whether these individual differences not only affect people's reactions to the pandemic, but also their actual likelihood of contracting COVID-19. In the early months of the pandemic, U.S. participants responded to a variety of individual difference measures as well as questions specific to the pandemic itself. Four months later, 2120 of these participants responded with whether they had contracted COVID-19. Nearly all of our included individual difference measures significantly predicted whether a person reported testing positive for the virus in this four-month period. Additional analyses revealed that all of these relationships were primarily mediated by whether participants held accurate knowledge about COVID-19. These findings offer useful insights for developing more effective interventions aimed at slowing the spread of both COVID-19 and future diseases. Moreover, some findings offer critical tests of the validity of such theoretical frameworks as those concerning conspiratorial ideation and disgust sensitivity within a real-world context.

AB  - China is now one of the biggest online game markets, and the games are seen as both an economic opportunity and a social threat, especially to the young. I investigated the nature of, reasons for, and influences of online game quitting in China with 176 participants selected using deviant case sampling. I examined the relationships between the attitudes of those who were quitting playing toward online games, their perception of media portrayal of online games, family pressure, peer influence, functional alternatives, self-esteem, loneliness, online game quitting, and satisfaction with life after quitting. Results showed that the more negatively the participants felt about online games, the more likely they were to quit, and perception of peers ' negative attitude toward online gaming, perception of alternatives, and lower income were significant predictors of online game quitting. These findings could help policy makers rethink healthy gaming and antiaddiction strategies.

TI  - Anxiety as a mediator of relationships between perceptions of the threat of COVID-19 and coping behaviors during the onset of the pandemic in Poland

KW  - FEAR APPEALS
AB  - At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (10-14 March, 2020) we conducted a survey (n = 1028) of a nationally representative sample (age, sex, and locale) in Poland. Respondents indicated how strong they thought the threat was to themselves, to Poland, and the world. They also described their emotional reactions to the pandemic, which we used to calculate three scores: Anxiety, Hopelessness, and Panic. Respondents also indicated how often they engaged in various coping behaviors and how much they supported different types of economic sacrifice. We used these responses to calculate measures that we labelled as Spread Prevention (e.g., social distancing), Self-preservation (food stockpiling), and Economic Sacrifice (e.g., fighting COVID-19 regardless of the cost). Multiple regression analyses found that perceived threat to self was the most reliable predictor (positive) of emotional reactions and of coping behaviors, and that Anxiety was the most reliable predictor (positive) of Spread prevention and Economic sacrifice. Panic predicted (positively) Self-preservation. A series of mediation analyses found that Anxiety mediated relationships between threat and coping behaviors, and that Panic mediated the relationship between perceived threats and Self-preservation. In addition, we found that scores on all measures, except Panic, increased following the announcement of the first COVID-19 related fatality in Poland, which occurred on the third (middle) day of the study. The mediational relationships we found did not vary as a function of whether the data were collected before or after this announcement. The present results suggest that emotional reactions to perceived threats can serve an instrumental function by providing the motivation to engage in coping behaviors. Such a mechanism complements much research on stress that has focused on how coping mediates threat-emotion relationships.

AB  - Background. One of the greatest inventions of the 21st century is the development of vaccines against the life-threatening pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Whenever a new medication or treatment modality is introduced globally, it is accompanied by anxiety in the general public and among health care professionals.
   Objectives. The aim of the study was to explore factors that may influence the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination among dental health care professionals, as they are the first subgroup in the population to receive the vaccine.
   Material and methods. A survey-based cross-sectional study was conducted on 164 health care professionals (general dentists, dental specialists with 2 years of experience after graduation and dental assistants). Data was collected by sending a URL link to the hard-and soft-copy questionnaire on Google Forms through all social media platforms. The questionnaire had 2 sections - the 1st part concerned the demographic details and the 2nd part was designed to assess the acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among dental health care professionals and the related factors. The normality of the data was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. The Cox regression algorithm was applied to evaluate the factors associated with the acceptance of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.
   Results. Out of 164 participants, 85.37% showed a positive attitude toward vaccination and only 7.32% of dental health care professionals were not willing to get vaccinated; out of them, 5 were males and 7 were females. Those who refused to get vaccinated included 3.6% of general dentists, 21.1% of dental specialists and 11.7% of dental assistants. The complications of major concern were fever, myalgia and the lethargic condition immediately after vaccination. Conclusions. A small percentage of health care professionals declined to get vaccinated against COVID-19 and the main reason was uncertainty about the associated side effects. The respondents were mostly concerned about such side effects as fever, myalgia and the lethargic condition immediately after vaccination.

AB  - Introduction: Genetic testing is playing a greater part in contemporary medical practice. The ability of high throughput and parallel detection of variants that could predict the possibility of developing genetic diseases and to deliver personalized health care for individuals is slowly but most certainly gaining traction. This study was conceived to investigate the knowledge level and degree of awareness among youth in the United Arab Emirates, on the role of genetic testing in society, and the delivery of health care. Methods: Data from individuals were collected, and statistical analyses were performed to assess whether or not there were differences in people's attitude toward genetic testing, depending on variables such as age, gender, and prior knowledge of genetic testing. Volunteers were recruited at the main campus of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi via walk-ins to the recruitment desk or via an email which was circulated to both the staff and student population of the university. The survey that was circulated through email was also shared with friends and family, and through social media, to try to capture a larger and more diverse demographic population. Results: Results found that most of the participants were aware of genetic testing and showed a positive attitude toward the technology. However, there was an apparent lack of knowledge and understanding of regarding certain genetic concepts, such as the alternate sources of obtaining genetic information other than blood samples. The mean knowledge score was 6.3 +/- 1.9 out of 9, and mean attitude score was 3.6 +/- 1.3 out of 6. The main factors that affected knowledge and attitude were gender and prior knowledge of genetic testing. Conclusion: This study used surveys as an effective tool to evaluate the general knowledge of genetic testing of the general public. It is recommended to embed genetic topics in schools and universities to further increase people's awareness regarding genetic testing.

AB  - During the COVID-19 lockdown, with social distancing measures in place and a decrease in social activities, emotional states are more likely to be transferred between family members via increased interactions and communication. However, longitudinal evidence, particularly for early adolescents, is lacking. This study investigated family pre-pandemic influences on parental stress and adolescent psychosocial wellbeing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected from 233 adolescents and their parents before and during the initial phase of the pandemic. Parents reported their own stress level and perception of adolescent adjustment problems, whereas adolescents reported their own psychological distress level. In addition, adolescents also reported their satisfaction with family life in the pre-pandemic survey. Cross-lagged path models indicated reciprocal associations between parental stress and perception of adolescent adjustment problems. Compared to adolescents low in pre-pandemic family life satisfaction, those adolescents with higher levels of family life satisfaction before the pandemic reported lower levels of anxiety and stress only when parental stress showed no increase during the pandemic. Findings provide support for the mutual influences between parental stress and perceived adolescent adjustment problems during the pandemic. Special attention should be paid to those adolescents who undergo significant family life changes during the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach A survey research design was employed for the study. The population of the study was all the 584 approved academic institutions in Nigeria. A structured questionnaire administered online was designed to collect data with Google Form from heads of library (who are the chief principal officer) in all the academic institutions. The link to the survey was sent to the Nigeria Library Association (NLA) Online Forum, the platform on which Nigerian librarians fete and discuss issues relating to the profession. Social media tools such as WhatsApp and Telegram belonging to groups of academic librarians in Nigeria were also employed. The heads of the library from 108 academic libraries responded to the survey. The data generated were analyzed using a statistical tool and presented in tables. Findings The finding reveals that nearly all the students are not on campus since they have been directed to vacate their campus as a result of the lockdown. The study reveals some safety measures that were put in place by the libraries in Nigeria to include total closure of the library (59.3%), provision of hand sanitizer (55.6%) and the use of face mask and nose covers by library users (31.9%). The finding further indicates social distancing measures also put in place to include communication done via social media (59.3%), attendance to patrons (51.9%), class/lecture (51.9%), training/conferences (37%) and paper presentations (37%) that are all canceled, respectively. On access to library materials, a majority (87.96%) of the academic libraries in Nigeria provide only online materials to their users, while 9.26% of the academic libraries provide access to both prints and online materials. Research limitations/implications The paper will contribute to the body of literature on academic libraries' response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria and beyond. Practical implications While the disease is still very much with the world, libraries have to continue providing information resources in support of the research studies and sensitize the world on the measures to take to curtail the pandemic. Originality/value The results can help other libraries find ways and means to adjust services, so that they can still meet the needs of users in this pandemic.

AB  - This paper draws on analysis by social historians ranging from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance in France to recent administrative history in Poland to illustrate basic contradictions in Western thought about sexuality. These have resulted over time in policies which range from prohibition of sex work to tolerance of the need to meet physical needs accompanied by an appreciation of the financial profits to be obtained by the state as well as the individual, combined with abhorrence of female adultery. The paper closes with original data on current public attitudes towards the impact on reputation of a range of behaviours in Poland, including sexual activities, and finds a high level of agreement about the damaging impact on reputation of not sexwork itself but of living off the proceeds of sexwork.

AB  - Topical corticosteroids (TCs) misuse has become a common issue for healthcare professionals and patients, particularly in Pakistan, as no stringent laws or rules are prohibiting the selling of over-the-counter medicines. The present study was designed to examine pharmacists' insights and behaviors regarding TCs and their potential role in preventing the misuse of TCs in Pakistan. The study was a cross-sectional mixed-methods research design (phase 1, quantitative; and phase 2, qualitative) conducted from January to June 2021. The pharmacists working in various settings in Karachi were approached through different social media platforms. Data were collected through a web link of an online questionnaire with 30 closed-ended questions. Different statistical methods were employed for tabulating the quantitative data, while inductive thematic analysis was directed to classify themes from the qualitative data and to conclude findings. The mean cumulative knowledge score was 10.59 +/- 1.63. The community pharmacists knew more about the available over-the-counter TCs (p = 0.041). The experienced pharmacists were more conversant than fresh pharmacists, regarding the mode of action (p = 0.008), choice of TC potency (p = 0.001), and most common local and systemic adverse effects of TCs (p = 0.001). Overall, respondents had a favorable attitude, with more than 80% agreeing that pharmacists could ensure that important safety issues are communicated with patients, and assist considerably in avoiding TC misuse. Analysis of data has produced 7 themes, 10 sub-themes, and 30 categories. Major themes included: use and misuse of TCs, adverse drug events due to TCs, cosmeto-vigilance, patient education, referral to a physician, and future perspectives for preventing TC misuse. The respondents were well versed with the dilemma of TCs misuse, and they considered patient characteristics, free availability of TCs, and lack of physician-pharmacist coordination as the major reasons. The major barriers for patient education stated by nearly all the respondents were a lack of time and lack of material/information for counseling. They emphasized the need for stringent legal strategies and the enforcement of current drug-control regulations, so that TCs are not supplied without appropriate prescriptions. The present findings indicate that pharmacists had appropriate knowledge and a positive attitude towards their potential role in preventing the misuse of TCs. Further education and sensitization in areas of deprived knowledge will undoubtedly aid in the prevention of TCs misuse by the community.

AB  - Improving the sexual and reproductive health (SRH) of adolescent girls is one of the primary aims of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Adequate and accurate knowledge, a favorable attitude, safe behavior, and regular practice contribute to adolescent girls' SRH, maternal health, and child health. Considering this, this study aims to explore the level of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of SRH among college-going older adolescent girls in Chittagong district, Bangladesh. An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted in four colleges among the older adolescent girl age group of 16-17 years old (N = 792) attending a higher secondary grade in Chittagong district. Data were collected using a structured and self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were used to summarize the SRH-related KAP and identify the associated factors, respectively. The level of knowledge about puberty, family planning, maternal health, and HIV/AIDS was not satisfactory among the older adolescent girls. Different myths are common in the rural area with regards to menstruation, which impose several restrictions on adolescent girls and adult women. Standardized coefficients of beta (beta) and p value < 0.05 in linear regression analyses demonstrated that being a student of the science group (beta = 0.29, p < 0.001) and reading about or watching SRH issues on media (beta = 0.21, p < 0.001) were significantly associated with older adolescent girls' high level of knowledge in this regard. Furthermore, being a student of the science group (beta = 0.17, p < 0.001), urban residence (beta = 0.20, p < 0.001), regular SRH communication (at least once a month) with a mother/sister/friend (beta = 0.10, p = 0.003), and reading or watching any SRH content on media (beta = 0.22, p < 0.001) appeared as predictors of adolescent girls' positive attitude towards SRH issues. Moreover, being a student of the science group (beta = 0.07, p = 0.048), urban residence (beta = 0.22, p < 0.001), regular SRH discussions with a mother/sister/friend (beta = 0.09, p = 0.005), pre-knowledge on periods before menarche (beta = 0.12, p < 0.001), and reading or watching any SRH content on media (beta = 0.18, p < 0.001) are the most important factors influencing a regular hygienic practice of SRH. This study suggests strengthening SRH-related comprehensive education programs incorporated into the curriculum, the effective use of mass media, and supplying behavioral change communication materials.

AB  - 'Scepticism' in public attitudes towards climate change is seen as a significant barrier to public engagement. In an experimental study, we measured participants' scepticism about climate change before and after reading two newspaper editorials that made opposing claims about the reality and seriousness of climate change (designed to generate uncertainty). A well-established social psychological finding is that people with opposing attitudes often assimilate evidence in a way that is biased towards their existing attitudinal position, which may lead to attitude polarisation. We found that people who were less sceptical about climate change evaluated the convincingness and reliability of the editorials in a markedly different way to people who were more sceptical about climate change, demonstrating biased assimilation of the information. In both groups, attitudes towards climate change became significantly more sceptical after reading the editorials, but we observed no evidence of attitude polarisation-that is, the attitudes of these two groups did not diverge. The results are the first application of the well-established assimilation and polarisation paradigm to attitudes about climate change, with important implications for anticipating how uncertainty-in the form of conflicting information-may impact on public engagement with climate change.

AB  - Objective: Transport-related cycling can contribute to employee's increased physical activities in their daily lives, with potential health and environmental benefits. Still, a theoretical understanding of the links between the perceptions of physical environment and transport-related cycling through social cognitive theories is unclear. In addition, there is a lack of understanding on the moderating effects of the perceived physical environment on social cognitive pathways when predicting transport-related cycling. The purpose of this study was to apply the theory of planned behavior (TPB) framework to determine (a) whether TPB mediates the effects between the perceived physical environment and transport-related cycling and (b) whether the perceived physical environment moderates TPB-cycling relations.
   Methods: Using a prospective design, Chinese employees (N = 193) self-reported their perceived physical environment of their workplace neighborhood (i.e., residential density, land-use diversity, land-use accessibility, street connectivity, infrastructures, aesthetics, traffic-related safety, and crime-related safety), attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavior control (PBC), intention, and duration and frequency of transport-related cycling in the last week. One month later, self-reported cycling for transport was again collected from a subset sample of employees (N = 98). Mediation and moderation structural equation models linking perceived physical environment, TPB constructs, and transport-related cycling were tested.
   Results: The effects from residential density to attitudes and subjective norm, from land-use diversity and street connectivity to subjective norm and PBC, and from aesthetics and crime-related safety to attitudes, were found significant and positive. Attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC predicted intention, in which intention further predicted employee's future transport-related cycling one month later. Importantly, attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC mediated the relations from land-use diversity and street connectivity to intention, while intention mediated the effect from PBC to employee's future transportrelated cycling. Past behavior showed significant effects on attitudes, subjective norm, PBC, intention, and employee's future transport-related cycling. The effect from past behavior to intention was mediated by the social cognitive variables of attitudes, subjective norm, and PBC. However, no moderating effects of perceived physical environments on the TPB-cycling relations were found, except the moderating effect of crime-related safety on the path from PBC to cycling.
   Conclusion: Current results indicate that Chinese employee's transport-related cycling are a function of environmental (i.e., perceived physical environmental attributes) and social cognitive (i.e., attitudes, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and intention) factors. Findings of the current study can inform the development of multi-component behavioral change interventions targeting the improvement of transport-related cycling for employees.

AB  - The current study investigated how media exposure to a distant outgroup - asylum seekers in the European Union (EUAS) - may be associated with the transference of geographically distant foreign threats via Israeli media to Israeli local minorities. The study was based on an online survey of 1039 Israeli Jews. We found positive associations between frequency of exposure to negative EUAS media content and physical and symbolic threats domesticated from foreign outgroups to the local ground. Frequent exposure to negative EUAS media content was associated with worse attitudes toward asylum seekers in Israel. Thus, the media framing of remote groups and events can have important, long-lasting local consequences, including, most obviously, social and political implications.

AB  - The aim of this study was to design and evaluate a new digital game 'Farm Animal Welfare' to teach children about farm animal welfare. The game focuses on chickens and cows, and children played the game on touchscreen netbooks. To evaluate the game, we measured children's knowledge, attitudes, compassion, and beliefs about whether farm animals have emotions and feelings, both before and after the game, using a child-friendly questionnaire. We found that the new game led to increases in children's knowledge about animal welfare, knowledge about welfare in different farming systems (such as caged hens vs. free range), and children were more likely to believe that farm animals can feel emotions. The game did not seem to impact children's attitudes about cruelty or compassion towards farm animals. The new game shows promise, and to improve children's understanding of animal welfare, we recommend further research on digital animal welfare education interventions for children. Many children growing up in urban areas of Western countries have limited contact with and knowledge of farm animals and food production systems. Education can play an important role in children's understanding of farm animal welfare issues, however, most education provided focuses on pets. There is a need to develop new farm animal welfare interventions for young children. This study examines the process of designing, developing, and evaluating the effectiveness of a new theoretically-driven digital game to teach children, aged 6-13 years, about farm animal welfare. 'Farm Animal Welfare' aimed to promote children's knowledge about animal welfare, promote beliefs about animal sentience, and promote positive attitudes and compassion. A quasi-experimental design was carried out, using self-report questionnaires that children (n = 133, test = 69, control = 64) completed in the classroom. Test and control groups were from different schools and the control group did not engage in the intervention. Findings indicate a positive impact on beliefs about animal minds, knowledge about animal welfare needs, and knowledge about welfare in different farming systems, but there was no change in compassion or attitudes about cruelty. This study presents the first evaluation of a digital animal welfare education intervention for children, demonstrating the benefits of incorporating 'serious games' into farm animal welfare education. The findings will inform future practice around farm animal welfare education interventions for primary school children.

AB  - Background There is research evidence regarding the presence of stigmatising attitudes in psychiatrists towards people with mental illness, but a lack of studies and interventions focused on this issue in low and middle-income countries. Aims To assess the feasibility of implementing an anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees, and its potential effects. Methods This study comprised a pre-post design with outcome measures compared between baseline and 3-month follow-up. Quantitative outcome measures were used to evaluate the potential effects of the intervention, whilst the process evaluation required the collection and analysis of both quantitative and qualitative data. Results Twenty-nine trainees (25% of those invited) participated in the intervention, of whom 18 also participated in the follow-up assessment. Outcome measures showed the intervention had moderately large effects on reducing stereotypes and the influence of other co-workers on trainees' own attitudes. The main mechanisms of impact identified were recognition of negative attitudes in oneself and colleagues, self-reflection about the impact of stigma, one's own negative attitudes and recognition of one's ability to make change. Participants accepted and were satisfied with the intervention, which many considered should be part of their routine training. However, trainees' work overload and lack of support from the host organisation were identified as barriers to implement the intervention. Conclusions A brief anti-stigma intervention for Mexican psychiatric trainees is feasible, potentially effective, well accepted and was considered necessary by participants. This study also suggests mechanisms of impact and mediators should be considered for developing further interventions, contributing to reducing the damaging effects that mental health-related stigma has on people's lives.

AB  - Background: Both the health care workers (HCWs) and children are target groups for pandemic influenza vaccination. The coverage of the target populations is an important determinant for impact of mass vaccination. The objective of this study is to determine the attitudes of HCWs as parents, toward vaccinating their children with pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine.
   Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted with health care workers (HCWs) in a public hospital during December 2009 in Istanbul. All persons employed in the hospital with or without a health-care occupation are accepted as HCW. The HCWs who are parents of children 6 months to 18 years of age were included in the study. Pearson's chi-square test and logistic regression analysis was applied for the statistical analyses.
   Results: A total of 389 HCWs who were parents of children aged 6 months-18 years participated study. Among all participants 27.0% (n = 105) reported that themselves had been vaccinated against pandemic influenza A/H1N1. Two third (66.1%) of the parents answered that they will not vaccinate their children, 21.1% already vaccinated and 12.9% were still undecided. Concern about side effect was most reported reason among who had been not vaccinated their children and among undecided parents. The second reason for refusing the pandemic vaccine was concerns efficacy of the vaccine. Media was the only source of information about pandemic influenza in nearly one third of HCWs. Agreement with vaccine safety, self receipt of pandemic influenza A/H1N1 vaccine, and trust in Ministry of Health were found to be associated with the positive attitude toward vaccinating their children against pandemic influenza A/H1N1.
   Conclusions: Persuading parents to accept a new vaccine seems not be easy even if they are HCWs. In order to overcome the barriers among HCWs related to pandemic vaccines, determination of their misinformation, attitudes and behaviors regarding the pandemic influenza vaccination is necessary. Efforts for orienting the HCWs to use evidence based scientific sources, rather than the media for information should be considered by the authorities.

AB  - The effectiveness of modified-directly observed therapy (m-DOT), an adherence support intervention adapted from TB DOTS programmes, has been documented. Describing the implementation process and acceptability of this intervention is important for scaling up, replication in other settings and future research.
   In a randomised trial in Mombasa, Kenya, patients were assigned to m-DOT or standard of care for 24 weeks. m-DOT entailed twice weekly visits to a health centre for medication collection, ongoing adherence counselling and nurse-observed pill ingestion. Community health workers (CHWs) traced non-attendees, observing pill taking at participant's home. Using process indicators and a semi-structured questionnaire, implementation of m-DOT was evaluated among 94 participants who completed 24 weeks m-DOT (81%; 94/116).
   Two-thirds of m-DOT recipients were female (64%; 74/116) and a mean 37 years (SD = 7.8). Selection of the m-DOT observation site was determined by proximity to home for 73% (69/94), with the remainder choosing sites near their workplace, or due to perceived high-quality services. A median 42 of 48 scheduled m-DOT visits (IQR = 28-45) were attended. Most found m-DOT is very useful (87%; 82/94) and had positive attitudes to the services. A high proportion received CHWs home visits (96%; 90/94) and looked forward to these. Use of CHWs and several satellite observation sites facilitated provision of services closer to patient's homes. A substantial number, however, thought 24 weeks of m-DOT was too long (43%; 42/94).
   Our experience suggests that m-DOT services could be implemented widely and are acceptable if delivered with adequate attention to coordination, provision of a broad set of interventions, shifting tasks to less-specialised workers and integration within the health system. m-DOT programmes should utilise existing resources while simultaneously expanding capacity within communities and the public sector. These findings could be used to inform replication of such services and to improve the design of m-DOT in future studies.

AB  - The Singapore government implemented multiple restrictive measures as the novel coronavirus infection (COVID-19) spread through the community, thereby affecting the support service of cancer-related social service agencies (cancer-SSAs). We are interested to understand how Singapore's cancer-SSAs utilized the social media platform Facebook to overcome the restrictions which were introduced due to COVID-19. Facebook posts from two prominent cancer-SSAs 365 Cancer Prevention Society (365CPS) and Singapore Cancer Society (SCS) between comparable periods in 2019 and 2020 were extracted. These posts were categorized using a classification scheme which was specifically developed by two coders with adequate intercoder reliability. Statistical analyses were performed to determine if there was a significant difference in the frequency of posts between 2019 and 2020, and across three specific periods in 2020. Results indicate that 365CPS appears to have adapted to the pandemic by increasing their posting frequency on Facebook in 2020, but the same was not evident for SCS. However, both SSAs tweaked their social media outreach strategy in line with social distancing measures, publishing posts detailing activities that beneficiaries can participate from home such as healthy recipes and virtual events. SSAs can scale up their efforts to achieve a higher level of health promotion and support for their beneficiaries. Further qualitative studies are required to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 from the perspective of beneficiaries and validate the classification scheme which was developed in this study. The classification scheme could be used in ascertaining the quality of social media communication between public/private support groups and patients.

AB  - Results of an online experiment using advergames associated with television series suggest playing advergames results in behavioral change toward the parent brand only for consumers who lack prior brand experience. In essence, advergames appear to be more effective as a promotional tool used to encourage new product trial behavior. In addition, advergames with highly integrated brand elements produce more negative attitudes toward the advergame than advergames with fewer brand elements. Thus, advergame designers must delicately balance the use of brand elements to encourage product trial without being perceived as unnecessary advertising clutter that distracts from the enjoyment of game play.

AB  - The demand for using library apps to search for information has been increasing after the COVID-19 outbreak. To look into how the pandemic affects the users' perception of the loyalty of using library apps, we designed this research by amalgamating the updated IS success model and S-O-R model to evaluate the service quality of a public library app under the Hong Kong Government mobile applications initiative. A third-order model is established to demonstrate the multi-faceted aspects of service quality and mediating effects of perceived brand image, satisfaction, and e-word of mouth. Using structural equation modeling, data collected from Hong Kong, a metropolis where mobile services empower its citizens, showed the interrelationships among service quality and possible outcomes (i.e., perceived brand image, user satisfaction, e-word of mouth, and user loyalty). Findings also indicate that the influence of perceived service quality on user loyalty could only be achieved through perceived brand image and user satisfaction. This is a timely study during the COVID-19 pandemic, as the lockdown and social distancing arrangements created challenges for citizens to search for information in public libraries in person. Our findings and suggestions reiterate the importance of considering the usability concepts when analyzing the service quality of each unique app. They also provide insights for practitioners in developing the next generation of apps for smart public information services and call for further investigation into the proposed hierarchical model and other potential factors related to service quality.

AB  - Traditional teaching methods in radiology education have not kept pace with advances in technology that foster successful transition into independent practice. This deficit has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as the need for social distancing and the introduction of hybrid staffing models have decreased the critical educational interactions at the reading room workstations between staff and trainees. By leveraging interactive, case-based learning, educators have the opportunity to bridge the substantial gap between basic pattern recognition and successfully making a diagnosis in independent practice. For the educator, this signals a shift away from perfect case selection and presenter authority, and toward the role of a guide facilitating an active case-based learning experience. This form of learning is best accompanied by guided interpretation and iterative feedback with the goal of developing similar levels of mastery and autonomy among graduating trainees. In this article, we present the tools and methods for incorporating interactive cases into existing and novel teaching materials to meet the unique challenges educators are facing today.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic led to social distancing and lockdown practices, which increased social interactions and information exchange on social media for timely decision making. This study explores how social practices and social influence generated through social media created panic buying behavior among customers. A social constructionist epistemological position was taken in order to understand the social practice of information sharing and to ask why different meanings were ascribed to Covid-19 pandemic. Qualitative data collection and analysis methods were used to understand these subjective realities. A total of 40 UK customers participated in semi-structured interviews in which they were asked about their usage of social media during the pandemic. Results revealed that social media increased the sharing of viral video evidence, such as empty shelves and quarreling in grocery stores, which increased fear and uncertainty; as a result, people shared recommendations to stay at home and buy extra for survival. Analysis revealed that social media increased awareness of stock unavailability in other parts of world, such as the USA, China, and Germany; therefore, people took proactive actions, such as stockpiling or panic buying, to avoid risks and uncertainties. The major theoretical contribution of this study is that the researcher merged social practice theory and social influence theory, and constructed a research framework which provides understanding of the social factors generated through social media platforms that increased socially influenced panic buying practices among UK customers. This study suggests that there is a need to control socially shared information and panic buying behavior and how socially shared information can influence different people in different contexts.

AB  - The importance of biotechnology for the global economy is growing, including developments in the field of genetically modified organisms (GMO), which have revolutionized the cultivation of several major food crops. Despite the many benefits from introducing genetic modifications to crops, the Polish society shows a strong distrust towards GMO-based food. The negative attitude of the society towards genetically modified (GM) food could be considered irrational. It is not supported by adequate knowledge and is based on fears, despite the fact that there is no scientific evidence of threats of GM products towards the environment, health, or human life. Details of these perceptions were revealed within Polish society from surveys of three groups of respondents: consumers, students, farmers. Data from the surveys have been compared with the answers to the same questions by five biotechnology experts from Polish academic institutions. A general observation from the analysis of the survey results and past studies quoted in the literature review is that the level of understanding and acceptance of GMO technologies is still low in Polish society, and, to a large extent, is based on stereotypes rather than on scientific knowledge. They show broad support for the general benefits of GMOs, which does not vary between the three groups of respondents surveyed, but noticeably differs with the experts' views. GMOs have allies, but also opponents who have their own beliefs shaped largely by unreliable information disseminated through the Internet and social media. Providing more reliable targeted information on GMOs based on scientific evidence can have an important role in changing polarized attitudes towards GM food.

AB  - In December 2019, a novel virus named COVID-19 emerged in the city of Wuhan, China. In early 2020, the COVID-19 virus spread in all continents of the world except Antarctica, causing widespread infections and deaths due to its contagious characteristics and no medically proven treatment. The COVID-19 pandemic has been termed as the most consequential global crisis since the World Wars. The first line of defense against the COVID-19 spread are the non-pharmaceutical measures like social distancing and personal hygiene. The great pandemic affecting billions of lives economically and socially has motivated the scientific community to come up with solutions based on computer-aided digital technologies for diagnosis, prevention, and estimation of COVID-19. Some of these efforts focus on statistical and Artificial Intelligence-based analysis of the available data concerning COVID-19. All of these scientific efforts necessitate that the data brought to service for the analysis should be open source to promote the extension, validation, and collaboration of the work in the fight against the global pandemic. Our survey is motivated by the open source efforts that can be mainly categorized as(a)COVID-19 diagnosis from CT scans, X-ray images, and cough sounds,(b)COVID-19 case reporting, transmission estimation, and prognosis from epidemiological, demographic, and mobility data,(c)COVID-19 emotional and sentiment analysis from social media, and(d)knowledge-based discovery and semantic analysis from the collection of scholarly articles covering COVID-19. We survey and compare research works in these directions that are accompanied by open source data and code. Future research directions for data-driven COVID-19 research are also debated. We hope that the article will provide the scientific community with an initiative to start open source extensible and transparent research in the collective fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The period between "liberalization," or the 1991 opening of India's economy to foreign direct investment, and the 2008 onset of the Great Recession was one of unprecedented change in the forms of Indian art and the infrastructures that supported its understanding, presentation, and circulation. This period of efflorescence-of multiplying growth in and transformation of a set of interlocking artistic and social forms-poses methodological challenges similar to those identified by George E. Marcus and Fred R. Myers in their 1995 volume, The Traffic in Culture: Refiguring Art and Anthropology. Marcus and Myers' call to focus on appropriation, boundary-making, and circulation, though meant to submit the Western art world to critique, coincides quite clearly with three particularly salient changes seen in Indian contemporary art in the period: the turn to unconventional material as artistic media (appropriation); the deliberate integration of artistic work with the materialities of everyday life (boundary); and the development of entirely new curatorial infrastructures and frameworks (circulation). The present essay examines these changes through Mumbai-based artist Navjot Altaf's post-1996, ongoing collaborative work with adivasi (indigenous) artists in the Central Indian region of Bastar. Eventually registered as the NGO Dialogue Interactive Artists Association (DIAA), the collective's activities have ranged from parallel exhibitions of "art" and "craft" to site-specific, cross-disciplinary engagements with play structures (Pilla Gudi) and water taps (Nalpar) built upon collective practices meant to bridge the considerable social distance between urban upper-class and adivasi artists. DIAA's work with water, like other artistic engagements with infrastructure, highlights the social, aesthetic, material, and political aspects of the built networks that sustain everyday life. Their critique leveraged Marcus and Myers' ABCs, incorporating critical acts of appropriation, the active violation of social and geographical boundaries, and, above all, demonstration of a concern with circulation.

AB  - Objective: To understand and compare the perceived impact and ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthodontic clinical services in the UK.
   Design: Descriptive cross-sectional survey.
   Setting: Online electronic questionnaire.
   Participants: Members of the British Orthodontic Society (BOS).
   Methods: Electronic questionnaires were circulated between March and June 2021. The UK survey was distributed via emails from the BOS, Orthodontic Managed Clinical Networks and WhatsApp groups.
   Results: A total of 560 unique responses were received. There were more respondents who were aged over 50 years (52%) then respondents who were aged below 50 years (48%) with the median age range being 50-54 years (20%). The main causes of disruption to clinical practice were felt to be national restrictions (85%), increased cross-infection measures (84%), social distancing (80%) and professional guidance (80%). Respondents felt more negatively in their opinions regarding dentistry's preparedness for the pandemic (5%) and how dentistry coped in the crisis (35%), when compared to orthodontic services specifically (8% and 58%, respectively). The respondents were not confident about the potential beneficial effects of a vaccination programme on orthodontic clinical service provision (21%). Telephone consultations (84%) and video consultations (61%) were the main adaptations used by the respondents during the pandemic.
   Conclusions: Respondents felt that COVID-19 will have long-term societal, clinical and professional implications. The majority of our respondents supported the vaccination and weekly testing of the orthodontic team. Respondents felt that during the pandemic there had been a deterioration in care provision and were not optimistic about a vaccination programme restoring services to pre-pandemic levels of activity. During the pandemic, patients in active orthodontic treatment have been prioritised but at the expense of new and review patients, and as services recover respondents were concerned about the difficulty of arranging dental extractions.

AB  - Competition enhances learning under certain circumstances. However, little is known about how the neural mechanisms involved in a competition during the episodic encoding are modulated by the social distance of personal relationships with opponents. To investigate this issue, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we scanned healthy young adults during a competition with their familiar friends and unfamiliar others in the episodic encoding. Three major findings emerged from this study. First, activations in the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) were significantly greater in the competition with familiar friends than with unfamiliar others, and the activations in this region were significantly correlated with the subjective ratings of motivation. Second, striatum and amygdala activations increased by the competition with familiar friends were significantly correlated with the increased ratings of pleasantness, which reflected emotionally positive feelings in victory for the competition with familiar opponents. Third, the functional connectivity between the rTPJ and reward-related regions, including the striatum and substantia nigra, was higher in the competition with familiar friends than with unfamiliar others. Taken together with our behavioral findings, in which memories encoded by competing with familiar friends were remembered more accurately than those with unfamiliar others, the interacting mechanisms between the rTPJ that is involved in social motivation and the reward-related regions that are involved in social reward could contribute to the enhancement of memories encoded in the competition with familiar others.

AB  - The sudden COVID-19-induced transition from a physical university life to a virtual one was a painful one for many students. Social distancing measures mean more than a simple change from face-to-face to online education. This study investigates how different social aspects, such as the students' psychological sense of community, social capital, and use of social media, facilitated the perceived social support during the transition to the COVID-19 lockdown. Our results not only underline social media's role, but also indicate that the perceived social support, as well as the bonding and bridging social capital, were particularly relevant during the transition process. Our findings are aimed at organizational management by recommending actionable ways in which they could improve social support by organizing computer-supported social networks, social support predictors, and specialized interventions for students with less perceived social support. As such, the study provides unique insights into the COVID-19-induced lockdown situation among students, while offering a transition model that also generalizes to other settings.

AB  - Objective: To determine the early impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on breast imaging centers in California and Texas and compare regional differences.
   Methods: An 11-item survey was emailed to American College of Radiology accredited breast imaging facilities in California and Texas in August 2020. A question subset addressed March-April government restrictions on elective services ("during the shutdown" and "after reopening"). Comparisons were made between states with chi-square and Fisher's tests, and timeframes with McNemar's and paired t-tests.
   Results: There were 54 respondents (54/240, 23%, 26 California, 28 Texas). Imaging volumes fell during the shutdown and remained below pre-pandemic levels after reopening, with reduction in screening greatest (ultrasound 12% of baseline, mammography 13%, MRI 23%), followed by diagnostic MRI (43%), procedures (44%), and diagnostics (45%). California reported higher volumes during the shutdown (procedures, MRI) and after reopening (diagnostics, procedures, MRI) versus Texas (P=0.001-0.02). Most screened patients (52/54, 96% symptoms and 42/54, 78% temperatures), and 100% (53/53) modified check-in and check-out. Reading rooms or physician work were altered for social distancing (31/54, 57%). Physician mask (45/48, 94%), gown (15/48, 31%), eyewear (22/48, 46%), and face shield (22/48, 46%) use during procedures increased after reopening versus pre-pandemic (P<0.001-0.03). Physician (47/54, 87%) and staff (45/53, 85%) financial impacts were common, but none reported terminations.
   Conclusion: Breast imaging volumes during the early pandemic fell more severely in Texas than in California. Safety measures and financial impacts on physicians and staff were similar in both states.

AB  - The Dutch general election of March 2021 can be referred to as the 'Corona' election, as the world-wide pandemic influenced all aspects of this election. The government made special provisions to make participation safer for voters. Restrictions on crowd size and social distancing restricted the possibilities for traditional means of election campaigning. Thus the campaign was carried out primarily in the mass and social media. The Corona virus and health care were prominent issues during the campaign. However, Corona had little influence on turnout as the percentage was only slightly lower than for the previous election. Corona seems to have produced 'rally around the leader' or 'don't change horses' effects among Dutch voters. The Liberal Party (VVD) gained one seat, D66 five, and the CU held onto its seats. Although the CDA lost four seats, this was the first election since 1981 that a coalition had not lost seats at a subsequent election. The total number of parties represented rose to a record 17 (for 150 seats in the Second Chamber or Dutch lower house). Corona also impacted the coalition formation process when an infected 'explorer' was photographed with notes from the negotiations when she hurriedly left the building. The ensuing debate created distrust among potential partners that took several months to resolve. In the end, after the longest formation process in Dutch history, the coalition consisted of the same parties as in the previous Cabinet and was led by the same Prime Minister, Mark Rutte.

KW  - Lung cancer
KW  - Thoracic surgery
AB  - Objective: After sustained community spread of Coronavirus Disease - 19 (COVID-19), guidelines regarding safe practice are still evolving. In this article, we evaluated our clinic's oncologic thoracic surgery practice in COVID-19 pandemic via an observational retrospective study.
   Methods: All cases (including local anesthesia only), were recorded in the hospital electronic medical record system. Patients undergoing procedures for cancer related causes (resection, diagnosis, palliation, treatment facilitation) were retrospectively identified. Patient demographic data, type of operation/procedure, 30 day SARS-COV-2 PCR test data, hospital readmission due to COVID-19, 30 and 90 day mortality were gathered. Group 1 and 2 were operated between 1 June 2019 - 11 March 2020 and 12 March 2020 - 31 December 2020, respectively.
   Results: 344 (Group 1= 178, Group 2= 166) patients underwent thoracic surgery due to cancer related causes during the study period. Surgical or COVID-19 related mortality were not encountered in either group. After initiation of mandatory testing, 3 asymptomatic patients were found to be PCR positive and had surgery rescheduled (2 lung resections, 1 mediastinoscopy). Number of lung resection cases increased postCOVID-19 (25 vs 45, p<0.001). None of the postoperative patients experienced PCR conversion.
   Conclusion: Safe elective thoracic surgery practice is possible via following basic safety precautions and following evolving national guidelines. Even though routine preoperative SARS-COV-2 PCR testing catches asymptomatic cases that can cause mortality/morbidity for patients and staff, social distancing and other infection control measures have to be in place to prevent in hospital and post-operative SARS-COV-2 PCR conversion.

AB  - Introduction: Journal clubs have evolved over recent years within healthcare to encourage continuing professional development. More recently, there has been a move from face-to-face group meetings to virtual groups utilising social media platforms. This article aims to explore the discussions and narrative following the inaugural BMUS journal club, highlighting the key discussions and themes from the participants and to provide a narrative for the future of ultrasound continuing professional development.
   Methods: The August 2020 journal club chat was focussed on the article featured in Ultrasound: "Sonographers' level of autonomy in communication in Australian obstetric settings: Does it affect their professional identity?" by Thomas et al. Data consisting of Twitter correspondence were extracted and analysed from the advanced search function on Twitter using #BMUS_JC thread. An initial review ensured related content was included. A second review and semantic thematic analysis was then conducted on the 123 tweets.
   Results: In total, seven overall themes were identified between the three sub-threads within the journal club discussions. Those participating in the Twitter discussion recognised the limitations and barriers for communicating results to patients, acknowledging that training, support and regulatory involvement is required for sonographers to change practice locally and internationally.
   Conclusion: The group discussions on Twitter highlight the ongoing issues for sonographers' professional identity worldwide. Furthermore, our analysis echo other contemporary studies which indicate that Twitter journal clubs act as a fruitful and dynamic source of continuing professional development, particularly in an era where social distancing is encouraged. The outcomes of the first BMUS journal club support the wider evidence that online journal clubs can provide a successful platform for professional discussion and debate.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the impact of COVID-19 on patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), despite being considered a high-risk group. This study explored the early impact of COVID-19 on the emotional well-being of patients and self-reported changes in their home therapy since the start of the pandemic.
   Methods: Adult patients with CF, lung-transplanted (LTX) CF patients and parents of children with CF completed an online questionnaire, securely linked to their medical files. The questionnaire covered the emotional impact of the pandemic, changes in CF and LTX treatment, changes in health-protecting behaviours and CF-related concerns, and their perception of their COVID-19 status.
   Results: The response rate was 63% (80 CF, 66 LTX and 73 parents). A wide range of illness severity was included. None of the respondents had contracted COVID-19 and all strictly followed the social distancing rules. There was evident psychological impact, with many reporting increased stress, fear and worry about CF and the future. Changes in treatment were positive, including more physiotherapy for adults and better-quality nebulizing. Changes in routine were reported, such as different treatment timing. Adult patients and parents had cancelled their CF appointments more often since the start of the pandemic.
   Conclusions: The initial psychological impact of COVID-19 was evident. The impact on home treatment was reassuringly small. Psychological care is needed for patients suffering prolonged psychological impact, and CF teams need to contextualize the information that patients and parents receive from the media and support them to balance the perceived risk with true risk.

AB  - Introduction: The world is facing a formidable challenge to prevent the COVID-19 global outbreak, and health care systems are under pressure globally. The governments alone cannot prevent the spread of this pandemic without creating a sensitive public opinion and cooperation. Therefore, this study analyzed the knowledge, behavior, and precautionary measures taken by the general public to protect themselves from COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methodology: For this purpose, snowball sampling technique was used to collect data from 401 respondents through an online survey in the Punjab province of Pakistan. A Multivariate Probit Model was used to determine the factors affecting the choice of precautionary measures to avoid COVID-19 infection.
   Results: Majority of the respondents (58.1%) belonged to urban areas in this study. The urban respondents had higher knowledge about Coronavirus disease as compared to rural respondents. Similarly, the hygienic behavior of urban respondents was better than rural respondents. But unavailability of hygienic material (mask and hand sanitizer) was the main problem faced by the general public. Public transportation was considered the most risk-prone place to COVID-19 by the respondents. Majority of the respondents perceived medium to highest risk from COVID-19, and it was found one of the most influential factors affecting the adoption of precautionary measures along with knowledge of this pandemic.
   Conclusions: Government needs to start a comprehensive awareness campaign on social media along with the mainstream media create awareness about the importance of social distancing, washing hands and wearing masks among the general public to enhance knowledge and improve the behavior of the general public about COVID-19.

AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens' democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision tonotprosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician's party, but also on other groups in society.

AB  - Introduction: Orthopedic instrumentation is generally made as one-size-fits-all. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of hand size and sex on ease of use and injury rates from orthopedic tools and surgical instruments.
   Methods: An anonymous 21-item online survey was distributed to orthopedic trainees and attendings. Questions regarding demographics, physical symptoms and treatment, perceptions, and instrument-specific concerns were included. The analysis included statistics comparing responses based on sex, height, and glove size, with significance as p<0.05.
   Results: There were 204 respondents: 119 female and 84 male. Male and female respondents differed significantly in height (mean difference 5.4 in, p<0.001) and glove size (median size 6.5 size for females, size 8 for males, p<0.001). While 69.8% of respondents reported physical discomfort or symptoms they attributed to their operating instruments, female surgeons were significantly more likely to endorse symptoms (87.3% female vs. 45.2% male, p<0.001). Of those reporting symptoms, 47.7% had undergone treatment, with no significant difference by surgeon sex (p=0.073). Female surgeons were significantly more likely than their male counterparts to have negative attitudes toward orthopedic surgical instruments and to report specific surgical instruments as difficult or uncomfortable to use.
   Conclusion: Female orthopedic surgeons are more likely than their male counterparts to report physical symptoms attributed to orthopedic surgical instruments, to have negative attitudes toward instruments, and to identify a larger number of common instruments as difficult or uncomfortable to use. Further emphasis on ergonomic instrument design is needed to allow all orthopedic surgeons to operate as safely and effectively as possible.

AB  - In this study, 580 participants viewed one of the 30 full-length entertainment television episodes. Fifteen of these episodes centered on an organ donation storyline (ODS) where facts about the process were portrayed inaccurately; the remaining 15 were matched by program, but did not feature organ donation, and served as controls. Results indicated nondonors were significantly impacted by negative organ-donation-related content. ODSs produced more negative attitudes, less accurate knowledge, and perceptions of social and descriptive norms less supportive of organ donation among nondonors. However, participants who had already declared a willingness to donate organs after death were not significantly impacted by entertainment television's depiction of myths about donation.

AB  - The present paper examines Melanchthon's affirmative concept of mundane life which was distinct from a negative attitude to the world prevailing in the ancient and mediaeval Christian thought. Since Christianity emerged from Judaism, which adopted a positive outlook on mundane life reminiscent of the Reformation perspective, the Jewish affirmation of the world was discussed briefly in the present essay as well. The 16th-century Reformation vindicated the positive status of the world primarily through the idea of vocation and through the concept of education as the instrument for unfolding human nature and for equipping human beings for life in the community which was viewed by the Reformers as founded upon social bonds eventuating from a sense of the extended filial piety. In addition, the Reformation concept of mundane life was situated against the Asian tradition which in the present article was represented by Confucianism.

AB  - Background. Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a highly communicable virus that continues to interrupt livelihoods, predominantly those of low-income segments of society. For the prevention of respiratory infections like the current COVID-19 outbreak, face masks are considered an effective approach. Objective. This study intended to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of public transport drivers towards face mask use amid the COVID-19 pandemic in Gondar, Ethiopia. Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 412 public transport drivers in Gondar town from July to September 2021. The study subjects were recruited using a simple random sampling technique after proportionally allocating the sample size from the total number of public transport drivers, and finally, study subjects were selected using the convenience sampling method to select the participant drivers working in Gondar Town. The data were collected by face-to-face interview administered questioners and an on-the-spot observational checklist. Results. A total of 412 public transport drivers have participated in the study. The mean age of the respondents was 32.75 years (+/- 8.75 years). The majority of the participants were Bajaj drivers 193 (46.84%). Among the responders, 114 (27.67%) of them use radio to gather information about the pandemic and 50 (12.14%) of them had reported being caught by COVID-19. Meanwhile, only 32 (7.77%) were vaccinated against COVID-19. Drivers that had a diploma level of education were found to be 87.7% less knowledgeable than degree holders (AOR .123, 95% CI = .026, .573). Respondents that had good knowledge about COVID-19 and face masks were found to have 1.7 times more positive attitudes than those that had poor knowledge (AOR = 1.728, 95% CI = 1.150, 2.596). drivers whose family members have ever been caught by COVID-19 were found 2 times more likely to use face masks whenever they are working/driving (AOR = 2.173, 95% CI = 1.015, 4.652) than their counterparts. Conclusion. This study revealed a very low Knowledge, attitude, and practice of face mask use among public transport drivers in Gondar town. Periodic reinforcement and training programs are needed for all public transport drivers in each level for proper understanding and adherence to COVID-19 prevention protocols and the use of face masks.

AB  - The unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic is showing dramatic impact across the world. Public health authorities attempt to fight against the virus while maintaining economic activity. In the face of the uncertainty derived from the virus, all the countries have adopted non-pharmaceutical interventions for limiting the mobility and maintaining social distancing. In order to support these interventions, some health authorities and governments have opted for sharing very fine-grained data related with the impact of the virus in their territories. Geographical science is playing a major role in terms of understanding how the virus spreads across regions. Location of cases allows identifying the spatial patterns traced by the virus. Understanding these patterns makes controlling the virus spread feasible, minimizes its impact in vulnerable regions, anticipates potential outbreaks, or elaborates predictive risk maps. The application of geospatial analysis to fine-grained data must be urgently adopted for optimal decision making in real and near-real time. However, some aspects related to process and map sensitive health data in emergency cases have not yet been sufficiently explored. Among them include concerns about how these datasets with sensitive information must be shown depending on aspects related to data aggregation, scaling, privacy issues, or the need to know in advance the particularities of the study area. In this paper, we introduce our experience in mapping fine-grained data related to the incidence of the COVID-19 during the first wave in the region of Galicia (NW Spain), and after that we discuss the mentioned aspects.

AB  - Stigma, comprising negative stereotypes, prejudice (negative affective reactions) and discrimination towards a member of a particular group, is of increasing interest in the context of mental illness. However, studies examining clinical anxiety stigma are lacking, particularly with regard to generalised anxiety disorder (GAD). There is also a lack of research into adolescent anxiety stigma, despite adolescence being a key period for early intervention for anxiety disorders, and research showing that stigma has been implicated in low rates of help-seeking and problematic peer relationships among adolescents with mental illness. Stigma has also been negatively associated with help-giving responses toward those with mental illness. Initial studies suggest that the 'weak-not-sick' (WNS) stereotype may be central to anxiety stigma. The present study aims to examine the endorsement of the WNS stereotype in the context of GAD, and its relationship to prejudice, discrimination, and help-giving responses among adolescents. A vignette-based survey measure was completed by 242 adolescents (74 male, 165 female, and three participants who recorded their gender as "other") in Ireland aged between 15 and 19 years. The results of the study found that endorsement of the WNS stereotype was significantly associated with higher prejudice and discrimination, as well as lower levels of help-giving intentions. A multiple mediator model is presented showing both a direct relationship between endorsement of WNS and help-giving, and an indirect relationship between WNS and help-giving mediated by the prejudicial components of anger, fear and pity, and discrimination as assessed by desired social distance. This study adds to the limited knowledge base on stigma towards GAD in adolescents and provides a model for how anxiety stigma may relate to help-giving. This has implications for interventions to reduce stigmatising and increase help-giving responses.

AB  - The emergence of COVID-19, caused by novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, became a pandemic in just 10 weeks. Without effective medications or vaccines available, authorities turned toward mitigation measures such as use of face masks, school's closings, shelter-in-place, telework and social distancing. People found refuge on the internet and social media apps; however, there was a proliferation of instant messaging containing hoaxed, deliberate misleading information: fake news messaging (FNM). The aim of this study was to assess FNM through content analysis and to discriminate them in a proposed taxonomy structure. A sample of convenience of messages, memes, tweets or cartoons in several languages was selected from the most popular social media outlets, i.e. Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter etc. More than 300 FNM were identified. Descriptive statistics were used for highlighting potential relationships between variables. Content analysis determined that FNM could be divided into Health- and non-health-related types. There are several sub-types considering, but not limited to, religious beliefs, politics, economy, nutrition, behaviors, prevention of the infection, the origin of the disease and conspiracy theories. The parallel FNM pandemic affected the response from an already debilitated public health system through the confusion created in the community and the erosion in the credibility of genuine media. Public health practitioners had to face people's unpredictable behaviors, panic, tensions with the communities and, in some cases, a hostile climate toward frontline workers. Public health practitioners must adjust ongoing and future health promotion and education interventions including plans to neutralize fake news messages.

AB  - Background: The social isolation imposed by COVID-19 pandemic can have a major impact on the mental health of dementia patients and their caregivers.
   Objective: We aim to evaluate the neurological decline of patients with dementia and the caregivers' burden during the pandemic.
   Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study. Caregivers of dementia patients following in the outpatient clinic were included. A structured telephone interview composed of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Beck Depression (BDI) and Anxiety (BAI) Inventories to address cognitive, behavioral, and functional changes associated with social distancing during the Sars-Cov-2 outbreak. Patients were divided in two groups according to caregivers' report: with perceived Altered Cognition (AC) and Stable Cognition (SC).
   Results: A total of 58 patients (median age: 57 years [21-87], 58.6% females) and caregivers (median age: 76.5 years [55-89], 79.3% females) were included. Cognitive decline was shown by most patients (53.4%), as well as behavioral symptoms (48.3%), especially apathy/depression (24.1%), and functional decline (34.5%). The AC group (n = 31) presented increased behavioral (67.7% versus 25.9%, p = 0.002) and functional (61.3% versus 3.7%, p < 0.001) changes when compared to the SC group. In the AC group, ZBI, BDI, NPI-Q caregiver distress, and NPI-Q patient's severity of symptoms scores were worse than the SC group (p < 0.005 for all).
   Conclusion: Patients' neuropsychiatric worsening and caregiver burden were frequent during the pandemic. Worsening of cognition was associated with increased caregivers' psychological distress.

TI  - Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on orthopedic trauma workload in a London level 1 trauma center: the "golden month" The COVid Emergency Related Trauma and orthopaedics (COVERT) Collaborative
T2  - ACTA ORTHOPAEDICA
LA  - English
AB  - Background and purpose - The COVID-19 pandemic has been recognized as an unprecedented global health crisis. This is the first observational study to evaluate its impact on the orthopedic workload in a London level 1 trauma center (i.e., a major trauma center [MTC]) before (2019) and during (2020) the "golden month" post-COVID-19 lockdown. Patients and methods - We performed a longitudinal observational prevalence study of both acute orthopedic trauma referrals, operative and anesthetic casemix for the first "golden" month from March 17, 2020. We compared the data with the same period in 2019. Statistical analyses included median (median absolute deviation), risk and odds ratios, as well as Fisher's exact test to calculate the statistical significance, set at p <= 0.05. Results - Acute trauma referrals in the post-COVID period were almost halved compared with 2019, with similar distribution between pediatric and adult patients, requiring a significant 19% more admissions (RR 1.3, OR 2.6, p = 0.003). Hip fractures and polytrauma cases accounted for an additional 11% of the modal number of injuries in 2020, but with 19% reduction in isolated limb injuries that were modal in 2019. Total operative cases fell by a third during the COVID-19 outbreak. There was a decrease of 14% (RR 0.85, OR 0.20, p = 0.006) in aerosol-generating anesthetic techniques used. Interpretation - The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a decline in the number of acute trauma referrals, admissions (but increased risk and odds ratio), operations, and aerosolizing anesthetic procedures since implementing social distancing and lockdown measures during the "golden month."

AB  - Objectives:
   Euthanasia and assisted suicide (EAS) of individuals with mental disorders is a growing practice in several countries, including the Netherlands. Here, we aimed to identify the most frequent dimensions of and associated factors to psychological pain, which has been associated with suicidality, in individuals undergoing psychiatric EAS.
   Methods:
   An exploratory retrospective content analysis of the English translation of 66 digital case records of individuals who died by EAS in the Netherlands between 2011 and 2014 was performed. Nine standard psychological pain dimensions (irreversibility, loss of control, emptiness, emotional flooding, freezing, social distancing, narcissistic wounds, confusion, and self-estrangement), illness, and sociodemographic variables were evaluated by 2 independent raters using a premade data abstraction form (Kohen kappa > 0.8 in all cases).
   Results:
   The mean number of dimensions was 4.64 +/- 1.20 (median = 5), out of 9. The most frequent dimensions were irreversibility, loss of control, emptiness, and emotional flooding, in decreasing order. Past treatment refusal and the mention of social connections in case descriptions were related to the higher number of psychological pain dimensions (4.89 +/- 1.24 vs. 4.31 +/- 1.07, P = 0.03 and 5.05 +/- 1.17 vs. 4.43 +/- 1.17, P = 0.03, respectively). Emotional flooding was the only dimension specifically associated with specific psychiatric conditions, namely posttraumatic phenomena and personality disorders.
   Conclusions:
   Numerous psychological pain dimensions were detected in case descriptions of individuals who underwent EAS before the procedure. Subjective nature of the study precludes definite conclusions but suggest that future studies should explore psychological pain and the role of interventions targeting it in patients requesting EAS.

AB  - Depression has become a big problem in our society today. It is also a major reason for suicide, especially among teenagers. In the current outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the affected countries have recommended social distancing and lockdown measures. Resulting in interpersonal isolation, these measures have raised serious concerns for mental health and depression. Generally, clinical psychologists diagnose depressed people via face-to-face interviews following the clinical depression criteria. However, often patients tend to not consult doctors in their early stages of depression. Nowadays, people are increasingly using social media to express their moods. In this article, we aim to predict depressed users as well as estimate their depression intensity via leveraging social media (Twitter) data, in order to aid in raising an alarm. We model this problem as a supervised learning task. We start with weakly labeling the Twitter data in a self-supervised manner. A rich set of features, including emotional, topical, behavioral, user level, and depression-related $n$ -gram features, are extracted to represent each user. Using these features, we train a small long short-term memory (LSTM) network using Swish as an activation function, to predict the depression intensities. We perform extensive experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of our method. We outperform the baseline models for depression intensity estimation by achieving the lowest mean squared error of 1.42 and also outperform the existing state-of-the-art binary classification method by more than 2% of accuracy. We found that the depressed users frequently use negative words such as stress and sad, mostly post during late nights, highly use personal pronouns and sometimes also share personal events.

AB  - This article offers a discourse analysis of media representations of para-athletes before, during and post the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in print and online sources, drawing on the lens of critical disability theory. We consider the importance of the media-sport cultural complex in influencing public attitudes towards disability. We conclude that whilst the importance of discursive change cannot be underestimated at the level of the media agenda, change at the level of lived experience will only flow from carefully designed and executed political and policy initiatives rather than directly from changes in the media presentation or visibility of individual athletes.

AB  - COVID-19 has impacted all lives. To maintain social distancing and avoiding exposure, works and lives have gradually moved online. Under this trend, social media usage to obtain COVID-19 news has increased. Also, misinformation on COVID-19 is frequently spread on social media. In this work, we develop CHECKED, the first Chinese dataset on COVID-19 misinformation. CHECKED provides a total 2,104 verified microblogs related to COVID-19 from December 2019 to August 2020, identified by using a specific list of keywords. Correspondingly, CHECKED includes 1,868,175 reposts, 1,185,702 comments, and 56,852,736 likes that reveal how these verified microblogs are spread and reacted on Weibo. The dataset contains a rich set of multimedia information for each microblog including ground-truth label, textual, visual, temporal, and network information. Extensive experiments have been conducted to analyze CHECKED data and to provide benchmark results for well-established methods when predicting fake news using CHECKED. We hope that CHECKED can facilitate studies that target misinformation on coronavirus. The dataset is available at .

AB  - The coronavirus disease outbreak of 2019 has been causing significant loss of life and unprecedented economic loss throughout the world. Social distancing and face masks are widely recommended around the globe to protect others and prevent the spread of the virus through breathing, coughing, and sneezing. To expand the scientific underpinnings of such recommendations, we carry out high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations of unprecedented resolution and realism to elucidate the underlying physics of saliva particulate transport during human cough with and without facial masks. Our simulations (a) are carried out under both a stagnant ambient flow (indoor) and a mild unidirectional breeze (outdoor), (b) incorporate the effect of human anatomy on the flow, (c) account for both medical and non-medical grade masks, and (d) consider a wide spectrum of particulate sizes, ranging from 10 mu m to 300 mu m. We show that during indoor coughing some saliva particulates could travel up to 0.48 m, 0.73 m, and 2.62 m for the cases with medical grade, non-medical grade, and without facial masks, respectively. Thus, in indoor environments, either medical or non-medical grade facial masks can successfully limit the spreading of saliva particulates to others. Under outdoor conditions with a unidirectional mild breeze, however, leakage flow through the mask can cause saliva particulates to be entrained into the energetic shear layers around the body and transported very fast at large distances by the turbulent flow, thus limiting the effectiveness of facial masks.

AB  - When mainstream parties accommodate radical-right parties, do citizens grow more concerned about immigration? Based on a rich literature, we argue that challenger parties' ability to affect mainstream party positions, particularly on immigration, is associated with greater public salience of immigration and voter positivity towards challengers exists. We use Comparative Manifesto Project and Comparative Study of Electoral Systems data in order to show that challenger issue entrepreneurship, and mainstream accommodation are associated with greater public concern for challenger issues. These factors do not result in greater public positivity towards challengers. Our findings thus support the argument that a mainstream party accommodative strategy might not be as beneficial for them as often expected by pundit and political scientists alike. This has implications for understanding the effect of indirect party strategies on public attitudes, since mainstream accommodation changes public concern regarding issues, which may bolster challengers' positions, including radical-right parties.

AB  - Background: Social distancing restrictions imposed due to the Novel Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic resulted in a rapid shift in the delivery of psychological interventions from in-person to telehealth. Much of the research on this transition has been conducted with English-speaking mental health providers, leaving a gap in understanding related to how this shift has impacted Spanish-speaking treatment providers. Methods: Fifty non-U.S. Spanish-speaking therapists completed a survey related to their use of telecommunication modalities; client population characteristics; professional, ethical, and legal/regulatory issues; and telehealth training and practice. Participants completed the survey at one time point and retrospectively described their use of telehealth both pre-pandemic and during the pandemic. Results: Most of the 50 Spanish-speaking therapists surveyed reported using telepsychology 58% before COVID-19 versus 84% during the COVID-19 pandemic (chi(2) = 5.76, p < 0.05). Compared with pre-pandemic, the number of hours therapists spent using telepsychology per week increased significantly for early adopter therapists (those who began using telehealth before the pandemic began) (Z = -3.18, p = 0.001) and also for late adopter therapists who only began using telehealth during the pandemic (Z = -3.74, p < 0.001). Many therapists reported equity issues. Most participants also reported ethical and regulatory concerns regarding security/confidentiality or Health Insurance Porability and Accountability Act. Conclusions: The rapid adoption of technology to deliver therapy during COVID-19 has spurred growing pains for Spanish-speaking therapists and their underserved clients, and more research is needed to better understand and improve the therapists' adoption of these technologies with diverse patient populations.

KW  - SCIENCES
AB  - Background Anatomy education in US medical schools has seen numerous changes since the call for medical education reform in 2010. The purpose of this study was to survey US medical schools to assess recent trends in anatomy education, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on anatomy teaching, and future directions of medical school anatomy curricula. Methods We sent a 29-item survey to anatomy course directors of 145 AAMC-associated allopathic medical schools inquiring about their schools' anatomy curricula. The survey contained objective discrete questions concerning the curricula changes preceding COVID-19 and those directly related to COVID-19. We also asked subjective and open-ended questions about the impact of COVID-19 and future directions of anatomy education. Results A total of 117/143 course directors (82%) completed the survey. Most schools (60%) reported a major change to their anatomy course within the past five years, including a decrease in total course time (20%), integration of anatomy into other courses (19%), and implementation of a "flipped classroom" (15%) teaching style. Due to COVID-19, there was a decrease in the fraction of course time dedicated to "hands-on" learning (p < 0.01) and teaching of clinical correlates (p = 0.02) and radiology (p < 0.01). Most course directors (79%) reported that COVID-19 had a negative impact on quality of learning due to decreased interactive or in-person (62%) learning and lack of dissection (44%). Incorporation of virtual-reality applications or 3D anatomy software (23%) and a decrease in cadaver dissection (13%) were the most common future anticipated changes. Conclusion The constraints conferred by COVID-19 highlight the importance of maximizing interactive learning in the discipline of anatomy. In an era of social distancing and decreased emphasis on conventional anatomy dissection, adaptations of new technologies and teaching modalities may allow for traditional educational rigor to be sustained.

AB  - Background The current situation caused by the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic is associated with serious losses for everyone and has been affecting social life, politics, the economy and the media worldwide. Preventive isolation and social distancing strategies have confronted families with a large number of different challenges. The current epidemic and quarantine restrictions have a verifiable influence on the emotional and social development of children and adolescents. During this ongoing situation children of parents, who already were mentally stressed, seem particularly at risk. Objective We aimed to assess the role of maternal daily perceived stress on children's mental health during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. Methods An online "SARS-CoV-2-pandemic survey" was developed to assess children's mental health since the beginning of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. To describe maternal perceived everyday stress, data from a longitudinal survey was utilized. Our survey includes elements and versions of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and the Perceived Stress Scale. We furthermore collected socio-demographic data. Due to our limited dependent variables we applied Tobit models for estimation. Results We found a positive and significant effect of the maternal perceived everyday stress on children's emotional problems during the pandemic. Furthermore, results provide empirical evidence for an increase of the children's hyperactivity level dependent on the mother's perceived stress before the SARS-COV-2 crisis. We could not find significant effects for the relationship between mother's perceived everyday stress and the children's behavioral problems. Conclusions Analyses illustrate the effects on children's mental distress during everyday life in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Future research needs to identify influencing factors with regard to political, economic and social restrictions, in order to prevent children's mental health problems.

AB  - Objective There is emerging evidence that COVID-19 disproportionately affects people from racial/ethnic minority and low socioeconomic status (SES) groups. Many physicians across the globe are changing practice patterns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We sought to examine the practice changes among rheumatologists and what they perceive the impact to be on their most vulnerable patients. Methods We administered an online survey to a convenience sample of rheumatologists worldwide during the initial height of the pandemic (between 8 April and 4 May 2020) via social media and group emails. We surveyed rheumatologists about their opinions regarding patients from low SES and racial/ethnic minority groups in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Mainly, what their specific concerns were, including the challenges of medication access; and about specific social factors (health literacy, poverty, food insecurity, access to telehealth video) that may be complicating the management of rheumatologic conditions during this time. Results 548 rheumatologists responded from 64 countries and shared concerns of food insecurity, low health literacy, poverty and factors that preclude social distancing such as working and dense housing conditions among their patients. Although 82% of rheumatologists had switched to telehealth video, 17% of respondents estimated that about a quarter of their patients did not have access to telehealth video, especially those from below the poverty line. The majority of respondents believed these vulnerable patients, from racial/ethnic minorities and from low SES groups, would do worse, in terms of morbidity and mortality, during the pandemic. Conclusion In this sample of rheumatologists from 64 countries, there is a clear shift in practice to telehealth video consultations and widespread concern for socially and economically vulnerable patients with rheumatic disease.

TI  - THE CONSISTENCY OF CONSERVATIVE TAX POLICY
T2  - NORTHWESTERN UNIVERSITY LAW REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - Conservative tax arguments have been remarkably consistent in substance, style, and method for almost a century. Substantively, their tax policy consists of three claims: (1) an economic one that low taxes encourage economic growth and prosperity for all, (2) a legal-constitutional one that excessive federal spending and heavy taxes unbalance our federal form of government at best, and at worst unconstitutionally violate state rights, and (3) a patriotic claim that high tax-and-spend policies are un-American. This third, patriotic, claim is a major factor in conservatives' remarkable success in selling their policy to the public and in the current political stalemate about taxation. The emotional aspect of patriotism inhibits rational discussion and limits the range of politically feasible solutions. This Article suggests that if conservatives would focus on their two substantive points, they would help create an atmosphere more conducive to the thoughtful tax discussion the country requires.
   The Article illustrates conservatives' consistency with an examination of the linked battles concerning income tax reduction and a veterans' bonus that occurred between 1924 and 1936. This period had much in common with the present, including (1) the growth of government, (2) increased knowledge about human behavior, (3) the development of new mass media, (4) the use of the new media by organizations to disseminate their viewpoints to the public, (5) increased lobbying (at least partially due to the other factors), and (6) mounting concern that the lobbying was distorting the political process. Commentators, then and now, have noted that some organizations purporting to be broad-based civic groups providing neutral information are really vehicles through which small-sometimes wealthy-groups try to shape public opinion and thereby pressure Congress to adopt their self-interested viewpoint. This Article focuses on two groups-the National Economy League, a group active in the 1930s, and, to a lesser degree, the Citizens' National Committee in the 1920s.

AB  - Objectives This research aims to investigate the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports for lesbian and gay athletes and to examine the internalization of sexual prejudice as a potential mediator of this relationship.
   Methods For this purpose, disclosure of sexual orientation to family, coming out in sports and internalized sexual prejudice in sports-related contexts, age, gender, socioeconomic status, education level, political orientation, type of sport (individual vs. team sport), years of sports participation were assessed on an Italian sample of 113 lesbian athletes and 63 gay athletes between 18 and 35 years of age.
   Results Findings indicated that coming out to family was significantly associated with coming out in sports. In addition, the internalization of negative attitudes toward the visibility of lesbian and gay athletes in sport settings partially mediated the relationship between coming out to family and coming out in sports.
   Conclusions These findings suggest that prior experiences of coming out in family contexts may provide additional resources to prevent the internalization of sexual prejudice, and this may promote the coming out in other life contexts. Moreover, we recommend that more efforts should be made to support sexual minority athletes who are not able to disclose their identity in sports environments. Research implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - People often receive information about scientific developments and new technologies from peers and via social media instead of from the original source. During this process, information may get lost or distorted, resulting in an inaccurate perception of the technologies' risks and benefits. It has been hypothesized that people's trust in the information source and their initial attitude toward the technology are drivers of this distortion. In two experiments, participants received information about a new technology that elicited either a positive or a negative attitude and that was provided by a trusted source or a less trusted source. They were asked to write down what they would tell a friend about it. Both the initial attitude and the source trustworthiness influenced what and how participants communicated about the new technology.

AB  - Research in social psychology shows that looking into the nuances in stereotyping is of vital importance due to unique emotional and behavioural reactions the different clusters of stereotypical representations may evoke. Media analysts, however, rarely apply a framework that would allow a systematic deconstruction of stereotypes conveyed in the media productions. In the current study, the Dutch news media representation of native and non-native youth is analyzed and compared. The results show considerable differences in news media portrayal of the two groups not only in the amount of (negative) attention they attract but, especially, in the content of their descriptions. While native youth is more frequently evaluated with reference to competence, non-native youth is more readily evaluated with respect to benevolence. The results of the study and the social consequences of Dutch news media representations of younger citizens are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of othering'.

AB  - Background: Participation in research during undergraduate studies may increase students' interest in research and inculcate research essentials in them. Aims: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the mentored student project (MSP) program. Settings and Design: In the MSP program, students in groups (n = 3 to 5) undertook a research project, wrote a scholarly report, and presented the work as a poster presentation with the help of a faculty mentor. To begin with, the logic model of the program was developed to identify short-term outcomes of the program on students, mentors, and the institution. A quasi-experimental design was used to measure the outcomes. Materials and Methods: A mixed method evaluation was done using a newly-developed questionnaire to assess the impact of the MSP on students' attitude, a multiple-choice question (MCQs) test to find out the impact on students' knowledge and grading of students' project reports and posters along with a survey to check the impact on skills. Students' satisfaction regarding the program and mentors' perceptions were collected using questionnaires. Evidence for validity was collected for all the instruments used for the evaluation. Statistical Analysis: Non-parametric tests were used to analyze data. Based on the scores, project reports and posters were graded into A (> 70% marks), B (60-69% marks), and C (< 59% marks) categories. The number of MSPs that resulted in publications, conference presentation and departmental collaborations were taken as impact on the institution. Results: Students' response rate was 91.5%. The students' attitudes regarding research changed positively (P = 0.036) and score in the MCQ test improved (P < 0.001) after undertaking MSP. Majority of project reports and posters were of grade A category. The majority of the items related to skills gained and satisfaction had a median score of 4. The MSPs resulted in inter-departmental and inter-institutional collaborations, 14 publications and 15 conference presentations. An area for improvement noted was to have the MSP implemented in the curriculum without increasing students' overall workload and stress. Conclusion: The study identified strengths and weaknesses of the MSP program. Our model of undergraduate research project may be incorporated in undergraduate medical programs to foster positive attitude and knowledge base about scientific research and to instil research skills among students.

AB  - This study examined people's willingness to falsely take the blame for a friend's offense. We sought to identify whether friendship closeness and individual differences would predict false blame-taking. Participants were randomly assigned to think of either a close or casual friend engaging in driver negligence and indicated their willingness to falsely take responsibility. Although self-construal was unrelated to willingness, oneness mediated the relationship between friendship closeness and blame-taking willingness. Negative attitudes about reporting wrongdoing predicted a greater willingness, and men were more willing to take the blame than women. Results may help those in the legal system to better identify false confessions.

AB  - This article examines how on-air conversations between journalists indicate how US television coverage of a race-related crisis can reflect racial ideology. Using critical discourse analysis, we examined interjournalistic discourse about African Americans in national network and cable news programs that aired after Hurricane Katrina reached New Orleans. While we expected conversational semantic items from conservative Fox News to reflect racial ideology, we also found such discursive elements from politically moderate and progressive news organizations such as CBS, CNN, and MSNBC. These findings are consistent with Anxiety Uncertainty Management theory, which predicts that exposure to stressors in unfamiliar settings causes individuals to think in ethnocentric, dichotomous, stereotypical ways. Our research underscores the impact of white privilege on language, communication, and news production, and the need for cultural competence training to enhance journalists' ability to discuss racial matters with ease.

AB  - It has been a widely held notion that firms can benefit from using preferential treatment in their customer relationship management strategies. For example, many firms provide select customers (i.e., recipients) with exclusive promotional offers that they purposefully do not extend to other customers (i.e., non-recipients). However, today's empowered consumers are more socially aware than ever of such divisive practices (via social media, deal websites, etc.), and firms must now better account for the negative backlash from non-recipients that may ensue. In this research, we conceptually define exclusive promotions and outline how they differ from other more heavily-studied customer prioritization tools. We then take a divergent approach from the majority of the extant literature by focusing primarily on how and why non-recipients (rather than recipients) respond to exclusive promotions. Study 1a findings reveal that non-recipients have negative attitudes toward exclusive promotions, as well as negative attitudes and lower patronage intentions toward the firm using them. Perceived social exclusion was shown to underlie these unfavorable responses. In Study 1b, we rule out an alternative equity-based explanation of our findings by assessing loyalty to the firm as a potential moderator. We then extend our investigation to a field setting in Studies 2 and 3. There we replicate our Study 1a results, and assess consumers' actual purchasing behavior in response to a real exclusive offer for enhanced generalizability. Lastly, in Studies 4 and 5 we empirically test two strategies that firms can potentially use to mitigate the negative effects of exclusive promotions documented here.

AB  - Far from being apolitical, self-indulgent or ineffective, as was suggested by some in the activist community, the NAMES Project Quilt became a symbol of the decimation of AIDS and a beacon for those in the AIDS-affected community, and challenged and transformed public attitudes towards people with AIDS. The NAMES Project Quilt risked sanitizing and homogenizing the particularities of the deceased, but I shall argue that the spectacle of the quilt changed public opinion through its mechanisms of publicity and meaning-making. Building on Michael Warner's notion of the 'Mass Subject', the quilt, I will suggest, transformed the mainstream, effectively forcing the formerly abject AIDS-affected community into public consciousness through the mechanisms of mass media.

AB  - Background Health risk communication plays a key role in promoting self-protective measures, which are critical in suppressing COVID-19 contagion. Relatively little is known about the communication channels used by rural poor populations to learn novel measures and their effectiveness in promoting self-protective behaviors. Behavioral change can be shaped by people's trust in government institutions which may be differentiated by social identity, including indigeneity. Methods During an early phase of the pandemic, we conducted two telephone surveys with over 460 communities - both Indigenous and mestizo - without road access and limited communication access in the Peruvian Amazon. This is the first report on the association of information sources about self-protective measures against COVID-19 with the adoption of self-protective behaviors in remote rural areas in developing countries. Results People mainly relied on mass media (radio, television, newspapers) and interpersonal sources (local authorities, health workers, neighbors/relatives) for information and adopted handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, and social restrictions to varying degrees. Overall, self-protective behaviors were largely positively and negatively associated with mass media and interpersonal sources, respectively, depending on the source-measure combination. Mistrust of the government seems to have shaped how Indigenous and mestizo peoples distinctively responded to interpersonal information sources and relied on mass media. Conclusions Our findings call for improved media access to better manage pandemics in rural areas, especially among remote Indigenous communities.

AB  - Population's preventive practices and self-isolation is determinantal in the prevention and mitigation. This study explored the adult population's knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 in UAE between the 4th and 14th of April 2020. The study was a community-based, cross-sectional study using a self-administered electronic questionnaire covering five different aspects: demographics, knowledge, practice, attitude, source, and trust of information, and a patient health questionnaire (PHQ-2) for depression screening. Results were analyzed using frequencies, cross-tabulation, and regression analysis. A total of 1,867 people responded to the survey. The mean age of participants was 36.0 years S.D. 10.8. Males were 19.3% and female (80.7%). Knowledge was significantly better in people with higher educational levels (B 0.17, P-value < 0.001), good preventive practice (B 0.12, P-value < 0.001), and higher perceived risk scores (B 0.053, P-value = 0.025). The best practice scores were shown by participants with older age (B 0.097, P-value < 0.05), with good knowledge (B 0.086, P-value < 0.05), were of non-UAE nationalities (B -0.08, P-value < 0.05), with jobs that cannot be practiced from home, military and health care employees (B -0.104, P-value < 0.05), had a personal history of contact with COVID-19 patients (B 0.053, P-value < 0.05), higher educational levels (B 0.052, P-value < 0.05), and a positive attitude toward taking a vaccine (B 0.088, P-value < 0.05). Depression risk was significantly higher in men, non-UAE nationals, in those with lower knowledge scores, and younger ages. The most followed practices were staying home, handwashing, avoiding social gatherings, limiting three people per vehicle, and avoiding public transportation. The least practiced measures were covering the face while sneezing or coughing and wearing masks. Although staying home was reported by 92.5% of participants, 22.6% mentioned that they were visited by more than two people and visited others in 18.4% during the last week. Social media was the source of information for 82.1% of the participants and most trusted doctors and healthcare providers. Depression risk was present in 18.9% of the participants, and most respondents (89%) agreed that SARS-COV-2 infection would be finally be successfully controlled. An encouraging finding is the willingness of two-third of the participants (64.5%) to take the COVID-19 vaccine and if it was developed, although it was very early in the pandemic. Only 14.6% said they would not take the vaccine, and 20.9% were not sure. The obtained results on knowledge and practices, although satisfactory, could be insufficient to prevent this pandemic from being contained. Therefore, we recommend the intensification of awareness programs and good practices. In addition, mental health is an area worth further studies.

TI  - Assessing Impacting Factors of Dog Owners' Adoption of Dog Vaccination Against Rabies: A Cross-sectional Survey in Rural Areas - Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China, 2021
T2  - CHINA CDC WEEKLY
LA  - English
AB  - What is already known about this topic?
   Rabies is fatal while preventable. More than 99% of human rabies cases were caused by dog bites worldwide. Mass dog vaccination could interrupt dog-mediated rabies if achieving and maintaining a minimum coverage rate of 70%.
   What does this report contribute?
   The results of this study show that roughly 23.7% of households owned dogs in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China but only about 19.1% of these households reported having their dogs vaccinated. Possible positive factors were injury history of dog bites, awareness of the necessity, and policy help for the costs of dog vaccination, but negative factors were negative attitude and inaccessibility.
   What are the implications for public health practices?
   Much more effort should be made to improve dog vaccination coverage in rural areas in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Well-designed free mass vaccination campaigns with more accessibility and awareness campaign are important to improve coverage.

AB  - This experiment revealed that emotional news frames (anger-inducing vs. sadness-inducing) affect people's emotional response to a corporate crisis such as a cell phone battery explosion accident. The distinct emotions induced by different news frames influenced individuals' information processing (i.e., heuristic vs. systematic processing) and the evaluation of the company differently. Participants exposed to anger-inducing crisis news read the news less closely and had more negative attitudes toward the company than those exposed to sadness-inducing news. Also, emotional frames affected how individuals perceived the different types of corporate responses (relief-focused message vs. punishment-focused message; emotional appeal vs. no emotional appeal). The advantage of emotional appeals was found contingent on how the crisis was previously framed by the media. Findings demonstrate a potential for developing effective corporate response strategies in a given crisis situation, considering the type of crisis, how it has been framed by the media, the publics' emotional responses, and the use of emotional appeals.

AB  - Precautionary measures (e.g., social distancing, mask wearing, washing hands regularly) to limit the transmission of the Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) have been put in place worldwide. However, a limited understanding of precautionary measures and low compliance with them has been observed in older adults with neurocognitive disorders, persons with intellectual disability, or mental illness. The objective of this study is to create and evaluate a robot-mediated activity to deliver information on COVID-19 precautionary measures in an accessible and engaging way using the humanoid robot Nao. An interactive scenario explaining and demonstrating COVID-19 precautionary measures is created using the verbal and non-verbal behaviours of the robot. The scenario (approximate to 5 min) is presented to 124 users of a geriatric hospital, including the following: older patients (n = 45), accompanying persons (n = 39), and health professionals (n = 40). The data regarding perceived usefulness, acceptability, and accessibility are collected using a questionnaire. A video analysis of the participants' behaviour during the interaction with the robot is performed to examine the quality of engagement in the activity. The results show a good acceptance, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the robot-mediated activity. These findings suggest that robot-mediated interventions using humanoid robots can be an effective tool for the delivery of health promotion information.

AB  - Contemporary news often spreads via social media. This study investigated whether the processing and evaluation of online news content can be influenced by Likes and peer-user comments. An online experiment was designed, using a custom-built website that resembled Facebook, to explore how Likes, positive comments, negative comments, or a combination of positive and negative comments would affect the reader's processing of news content. The results showed that especially negative comments affected the readers' personal opinions about the news content, even in combination with other positive comments: They (1) induced more negative attitudes, (2) lowered intent to share it, (3) reduced agreement with conveyed ideas, (4) lowered perceived attitude of the general public, and (5) decreased the credibility of the content. Against expectations, the presence of Likes did not affect the readers, irrespective of the news content. An important consideration is that, while the negative comments were persuasive, they comprised subjective, emotive, and fallacious rhetoric. Finally, negativity bias, the perception of expert authority, and cognitive heuristics are discussed as potential explanations for the persuasive effect of negative comments.

AB  - This paper attempts to find out the difference in the impact of comparative and non-comparative advertisements. A conceptual model was developed to find the impact of various measures on purchase intention. By conducting a detailed analysis on a sample size of 109 respondents, we found that comparative advertisements are significantly different from non-comparative advertisements. We found that comparative advertisements are more involving in nature. However, the believability of such advertisements is usually lower and may lead to a negative attitude towards the advertisement. Despite the negativity associated with it, respondents had a higher purchase intention. The attitude towards the sponsored brand is also higher in such cases. The research allows managers to gain insights into the advertising scenario and the impacts it can have on the sales of the company.

AB  - Background: Attrition, or nonuse of the intervention, is a significant problem in e-health. However, the reasons for this phenomenon are poorly understood. Building on Eysenbach's "Law of Attrition", this study aimed to explore the usage behavior of users of e-health services. We used two theoretical models, Andersen's Behavioral Model of Health Service Utilization and Venkatesh's Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, to explore the factors associated with uptake and use of an internet-mediated intervention for caregivers taking care of a family member with dementia.
   Methods: A multiphase, longitudinal design was used to follow a convenience sample of 46 family caregivers who received an e-health intervention. Applying the two theories, usage behavior was conceptualized to form four stages: consideration, initiation, utilization (attrition or continuation), and outcome. The variables and measurement scales were selected based on these theories to measure the sociodemographic context, technology aptitudes, and clinical needs of the caregivers.
   Results: In the Consideration Stage, caregivers who felt that the information communication technology (ICT)-mediated service was easy to use were more likely to consider participating in the study (p = 0.04). In the Initiation Stage, caregivers who showed greater technology acceptance were more likely to initiate service earlier (p = 0.02). In the Utilization Stage, the frequent users were those who had a more positive attitude toward technology (p = 0.04) and a lower perceived caregiver competence (p = 0.04) compared with nonusers. In the Outcome Stage, frequent users experienced a decline in perceived burden compared with an escalation of perceived burden by nonusers (p = 0.02).
   Conclusions: We illustrate a methodological framework describing how to develop and expand a theory on attrition. The proposed framework highlighted the importance of conceptualizing e-health "use" and "adoption" as dynamic, continuous, longitudinal processes occurring in different stages, influenced by different factors to predict advancement to the next stage. Although usage behavior was influenced mainly by technological factors in the initial stages, both clinical and technological factors were equally important in the later stages. Frequency of use was associated with positive clinical outcomes. A plausible explanation was that intervention benefits motivated the caregivers to continue the service and regular use led to more positive clinical outcome.

AB  - The pandemic placed extraordinary demands on agricultural producers and created unexpected challenges for southern Missouri farmers, and pushed the University of Missouri Extension (MUE) to implement new and innovative approaches to help farmers persevere through the crisis. In surveys and reports, farmers have indicated several changes caused by the pandemic that impact their businesses, such as increase in local food demand, reduction in on-farm labor, and limitations on hosting on-farm visits with customers. The MUE StrikeForce project team, a U.S. Department of Agriculture strategic initiative, continued to serve farmers by developing alternative educational opportunities that incorporated social distancing and other preventative actions, and were of immediate use to farmers in a crisis. Several of the educational approaches, including video conferencing, online teaching, digital recordings, video repositories, social media communications, pick up and drop off locations, and the use of multiple online viewing platforms such as Zoom recordings have proven to be effective in helping farmers sustain their businesses and have substantially increased access to programming across the state. The convenience of accessing education and learning opportunities online also appealed to more participants. Overall, online educational delivery was positively received by producers, demonstrating the efficacy of digital learning when paired with offline resources and support from the StrikeForce project team. After the pandemic ends, MUE will continue to implement these approaches. Nevertheless, the traditional Extension approach of one-on-one consulting and farm visits cannot be completely replaced by online educational programming. The pandemic has highlighted inequities faced by many rural Missouri farmers that lack dependable internet or cell phone network access, and had no access to StrikeForce programming when face-to-face visits were paused.

AB  - It has recently been proposed that compulsive sexual behavior disorder should be included in the 11th version of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. Concerns have been repeatedly expressed regarding the overpathologizing of sexual behaviors and the potential for false-positive results in clinical practice. Empirical evidence indicates that stereotypes related to gender and sexual orientation might influence therapists' assessments of clients. Those stereotypes are likely to be associated with different levels of pathologization and stigmatization of high levels of sexual interest and behavior. The aim of this study was to explore the possible connections between clients' gender and sexual orientation and mental health professionals' (MHP) pathologization of compulsive sexual behavior. A sample of MHPs (N = 546) were presented with a case vignette describing a client with compulsive sexual behavior. The information on the client varied by gender (male or female), sexual orientation (homosexual or heterosexual). and clinical condition (ambiguous diagnostic criteria and fulfilled compulsive sexual behavior disorder diagnostic criteria). After reading the vignette, the MHPs rated the client's mental health status and gave an opinion about causation (psychological vs. biological etiology) and stigmatization indicators (blaming the affected individual for their problems, desire for social distance, perception of dangerousness). The MHPs showed significantly fewer tendencies to pathologize when the client was a homosexual woman or man independent of their clinical condition. Mediation analyses revealed that the biological etiological model partly mediated the effects of reduced pathologization in homosexual clients. These results indicate that clinical decisions relating to compulsive sexual behavior are influenced by nosologically irrelevant beliefs about the biological causation of sexual behavior.

AB  - Staying home and avoiding unnecessary contact is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States enacted policies to encourage distancing and some mandated staying home. Understanding how these policies interact with individuals? voluntary responses to the COVID-19 epidemic is a critical initial step in understanding the role of these nonpharmaceutical interventions in transmission dynamics and assessing policy impacts. We use variation in policy responses along with smart device data that measures the amount of time Americans stayed home to disentangle the extent that observed shifts in staying home behavior are induced by policy. We find evidence that stay-at-home orders and voluntary response to locally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths led to behavioral change. For the median county, which implemented a stay-at-home order with about two cases, we find that the response to stay-at-home orders increased time at home as if the county had experienced 29 additional local cases. However, the relative effect of stay-at-home orders was much greater in select counties. On the one hand, the mandate can be viewed as displacing a voluntary response to this rise in cases. On the other hand, policy accelerated the response, which likely helped reduce spread in the early phase of the pandemic. It is important to be able to attribute the relative role of selfinterested behavior or policy mandates to understand the limits and opportunities for relying on voluntary behavior as opposed to imposing stay-at-home orders.

AB  - Opinions shared by peer travelers help tourists decrease the risks of making a poor decision. However, the increasing number of reviews per experience makes it difficult to read all reviews for an informed decision. Therefore, reviewers who make a personal and explicit recommendation of the services by using expressions such as "I highly recommend" or "don't recommend" may help consumers in their decision-making process. Such reviews suggest that the reviewer was satisfied to a point that (s)he would advise others to try or was unsatisfied and will for sure avoid coming back. The current research note explores what may drive reviewers to make direct endorsements in text. A text mining method was applied to online reviews to identify drivers of explicit recommendations. Lack of competences from the provider and negative attitudes are triggers of negative direct recommendations, whereas positive feelings predict a positive recommendation in the body of the review.

AB  - Background: Within the medical community there is persistent debate as to whether the information available through social media is trustworthy and valid, and whether physicians are ready to adopt these technologies and ultimately embrace them as a format for professional development and lifelong learning.
   Objective: To identify how physicians are using social media to share and exchange medical information with other physicians, and to identify the factors that influence physicians' use of social media as a component of their lifelong learning and continuing professional development.
   Methods: We developed a survey instrument based on the Technology Acceptance Model, hypothesizing that technology usage is best predicted by a physician's attitudes toward the technology, perceptions about the technology's usefulness and ease of use, and individual factors such as personal innovativeness. The survey was distributed via email to a random sample of 1695 practicing oncologists and primary care physicians in the United States in March 2011. Responses from 485 physicians were analyzed (response rate 28.61%).
   Results: Overall, 117 of 485 (24.1%) of respondents used social media daily or many times daily to scan or explore medical information, whereas 69 of 485 (14.2%) contributed new information via social media on a daily basis. On a weekly basis or more, 296 of 485 (61.0%) scanned and 223 of 485 (46.0%) contributed. In terms of attitudes toward the use of social media, 279 of 485 respondents (57.5%) perceived social media to be beneficial, engaging, and a good way to get current, high-quality information. In terms of usefulness, 281 of 485 (57.9%) of respondents stated that social media enabled them to care for patients more effectively, and 291 of 485 (60.0%) stated it improved the quality of patient care they delivered. The main factors influencing a physician's usage of social media to share medical knowledge with other physicians were perceived ease of use and usefulness. Respondents who had positive attitudes toward the use of social media were more likely to use social media and to share medical information with other physicians through social media. Neither age nor gender had a significant impact on adoption or usage of social media.
   Conclusions: Based on the results of this study, the use of social media applications may be seen as an efficient and effective method for physicians to keep up-to-date and to share newly acquired medical knowledge with other physicians within the medical community and to improve the quality of patient care. Future studies are needed to examine the impact of the meaningful use of social media on physicians' knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors in practice.

AB  - After Kremlin policymakers decided to incorporate the territory of Crimea into Russia, updates on public attitudes in Russian-speaking communities elsewhere in Ukraine would have been in high demand. Because social media users produce content in order to communicate ideas to their social networks, online political discourse can provide important clues about the political dispositions of communities. We map the evolution of Russian-speakers' attitudes, expressed on social media, across the course of the conflict as Russian analysts might have observed them at the time. Results suggest that the Russian-Ukrainian interstate border only moved as far as their military could have advanced while incurring no occupation costs - Crimea, and no further.

AB  - Impacts of Internet use on political information seeking and subsequent processes have been subject to much debate. A 2-session online field study presented online search results on political topics to examine selective exposure and its attitudinal impacts. Session 1 captured attitudes, including their accessibility. Session 2 tracked what online search results participants selected and how long they read them; participants then reported attitudes again. The study represented a 4x8x2x2 within-subjects design: 4 topics, 8 browsing intervals each, with articles presenting opposing stances, with low versus high source credibility. Attitude-consistent messages and messages from high-credibility sources were preferred. Exposure to attitude-consistent search results increased attitude accessibility and reinforced attitudes, whereas exposure to attitude-discrepant content had opposite effects, regardless of messages' source credibility.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Without personal experience or specific background knowledge of an issue, individuals exposed to news media are limited in their ability to gauge the accuracy of media content. The perception of people with mental illness as dangerous or incompetent allows for discrimination to occur, often resulting from inaccurate portrayals in the media.
   METHOD: A small, qualitative study was undertaken to explore key informant perspectives on the representation of mental health issues in the current Aotearoa New Zealand media context. Eight semi-structured interviews were carried out with key informants; each participant provided at least one of the following perspectives: mental health professional, mental health advocate, mental health consumer and/or media personnel.
   FINDINGS: The participants in this research found that news media strongly influence how the public views mental health, but believe media representation has improved in recent years. However, participants described an absence of stories illustrating successful interventions and felt that the portrayal of mental illnesses are still misrepresented and stigmatised by the media. Mental health services and mental health professionals were seen as poorly represented by the news media, which was thought to deter help-seeking and hinder trust.
   CONCLUSION: Public attitudes towards mental health have a significant impact on the lives of those experiencing mental distress. The news media have the ability to change public perceptions; however, this influence can be either harmful or helpful. Mental health stories need to be consistently contextualised and use inclusive language in order to a make a positive largescale change in public attitudes.

AB  - People started posting textual tweets on Twitter as soon as the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged. Analyzing these tweets can assist institutions in better decision-making and prioritizing their tasks. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze 43 million tweets collected between March 22 and March 30, 2020 and describe the trend of public attention given to the topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic using evolutionary clustering analysis. The results indicated that unigram terms were trended more frequently than bigram and trigram terms. A large number of tweets about the COVID-19 were disseminated and received widespread public attention during the epidemic. The high-frequency words such as "death", "test", "spread", and "lockdown" suggest that people fear of being infected, and those who got infection are afraid of death. The results also showed that people agreed to stay at home due to the fear of the spread, and they were calling for social distancing since they become aware of the COVID-19. It can be suggested that social media posts may affect human psychology and behavior. These results may help governments and health organizations to better understand the psychology of the public, and thereby, better communicate with them to prevent and manage the panic.

AB  - The present research examines the joint effects of density and power on consumers' attitudes and revisit intentions in a restaurant context. A 2 (Density: high vs. low) x 2 (Power: high vs. low) quasi-experimental design was employed. The restaurant's built density was manipulated by keeping (high density condition) or removing (low density condition) the extra tables in the restaurant. In addition, individuals' sense of power was measured and served as a moderator. A total of 327 general restaurant consumers were participants in this study. Results indicated that powerless people responded to a restaurant with high built density more positively (vs. low built density), whereas powerful people exhibited a similar level of attitudes and revisit intentions across the density conditions. Additionally, perceived territoriality was identified as the mediator of the effect of density and power on consumer responses.

AB  - We study whether investor voice affects firm policy. Using a novel dataset of the transcripts of online earnings communication conferences (OECC) of Chinese listed firms during 2006 and 2015, we show that firms do respond to investor complaints about dividend policy with increased future dividends. We find that the number of dividend-related questions raised by investors, the number of complaints (questions with negative attitudes), firm executive responsiveness, and CEO attendance in the OECC are positively associated with future dividend payouts. Moreover, positive responses are concentrated in firms facing greater pressure from peers, the market, and the regulator. Our additional analysis shows that the increase in payouts in response to investors' voice is not at the expense of cutting value-increasing investment. Overall, our results suggest that the online interactive platform empowers shareholders' voice and helps them to conduct a successful dialogue with firm managers in a cost-effective way.

AB  - Does geographic proximity to nuclear power plants influence public attitudes toward nuclear energy? Utilizing a statewide survey of North Carolina residents, this research considers whether proximity to a nuclear facility - measured by residence in a 10 or 50 mile Emergency Planning Zone - influences citizen awareness, support, and perceptions of safety concerning nuclear energy. The results suggest that while geographic proximity to generating sites does lead to increased levels of awareness, it does not appear to impact overall attitudes toward the use and perceived safety of nuclear energy.

AB  - Due to social distancing measures implemented to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals are spending more time isolated at home with limited physical social interactions. The current study investigated whether marriage and/or cohabitation is associated with satisfaction with life and depression among 732 adult same-sex twin pairs (monozygotic and dizygotic) in the US using online survey data. Twin analysis showed that married and/or cohabiting individuals were more satisfied with life and less depressed than those not married and/or cohabiting. The association between marriage and/or cohabiting and satisfaction with life was not confounded by between-family factors, whereas that between depression was mediated by familial factors. These findings suggest that being in a close relationship may mitigate some of the adverse consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. Close relationships may be an essential source of support as individuals rely on their intimate partners when faced with the uncertainty and stress of the pandemic.

Since the start of the pandemic, a plethora of experts and self-proclaimed experts have been keenly delivering webinars on COVID. This begs the question "Do webinars on COVID-19 really help in the improvement of knowledge base or management skills?". The questionnaire was designed to assess information regarding COVID-webinars and their usefulness from the end-user standpoint. The response to the questions was measured using a 4- or 5-point Likert scale. The survey was open for a 4-week period with the extension of 1 week.
   Results: The response rate was 54% as 270 out of 500 participants responded to the questionnaire. The majority of the respondents were anesthesiologists in-training, post-graduates, fellows, and seniors belonging to tertiary care settings with fewer percentages belonging to physicians and others. Most of the doctors had attended an average of 2 webinars per week. The tests of model effects showed a significant negative correlation of webinar quality ratings for district hospital healthcare setting of the attendees (of p value of 0.013) and for the number of COVID-related webinars attended per week (p value of 0.009).
   Conclusions: Most respondents had favorable perceptions of webinars happening during the pandemic. However, there is a need for improvisation in the volume of webinars, target-audience-based delivery, and participant interaction to add value to this new dimension of teaching-learning.

AB  - Novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19) originating from China has rapidly crossed borders, infecting people throughout the whole world. This phenomenon has led to a massive public reaction; the media has been reporting continuously across borders to keep all informed about the pandemic situation. All these things are creating a lot of concern for people leading to heightened levels of anxiety. Pandemics can lead to heightened levels of stress; Anxiety is a common response to any stressful situation. This study attempted to assess the knowledge, attitude, anxiety experience, and perceived mental healthcare need among adult Indian population during the COVID-19 pandemic. An online survey was conducted using a semi-structured questionnaire using a non-probability snowball sampling technique. A total of 662 responses were received.
   The responders had a moderate level of knowledge about the COVID-19 infection and adequate knowledge about its preventive aspects. The attitude towards COVID-19 showed peoples' willingness to follow government guidelines on quarantine and social distancing. The anxiety levels identified in the study were high. More than 80 % of the people were preoccupied with the thoughts of COVID-19 and 72 % reported the need to use gloves, and sanitizers. In this study, sleep difficulties, paranoia about acquiring COVID-19 infection and distress related social media were reported in 12.5 %, 37.8 %, and 36.4 % participants respectively. The perceived mental healthcare need was seen in more than 80 % of participants. There is a need to intensify the awareness and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Northern Ireland is characterised by extensive segregation between its predominantly Catholic and Protestant communities. With the aim of overcoming this segregation, the current study experimentally evaluated the effectiveness of electronic or E-contact as a novel indirect contact and prejudice-reduction strategy. Here, Catholic and Protestant participants were not required to meet physically but were involved in a collaborative and goal-orientated online interaction with a member of the other community. As predicted, E-contact improved both Catholics' and Protestants' outgroup attitudes via improved contact expectancies and reduced intergroup anxiety. These findings provide support for the contemporary role of online interactions in actively overcoming the physical and psychological barriers that often prevent prejudice reduction in segregated communities.

AB  - Aims: To examine psychological insulin resistance (PIR), the unwillingness to accept insulin therapy, within a unique U.S. population of patients with diabetes.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey of PIR among low-income, U.S. Latino and African-American (AA) patients with type 2 diabetes recruited from a diabetes specialty clinic.
   Results: Data from 136 insulin-naive respondents (57% female, 69 A. Latino, mean age 51.1 +/- 10.3 years; $200-$1000 median monthly household income; grade 8-12 median education) revealed a 48% prevalence of complete unwillingness to begin insulin. In comparing Latinos to AA, Latino respondents were younger, lived fewer years in the U.S., had less education, were more likely unwilling to use insulin (53% vs. 30%, p = 0.03), and reported a more negative attitude to 8 of 9 PIR domains (p <= 0.01 for each). Fewer years in the U.S. predicted greater unwillingness and a more negative attitude on 8 of 9 PIR domains (p <= 0.03 for each); and less education predicted greater feelings of unfairness (p = 0.01).
   Conclusions: PIR is highly prevalent among low income, U.S. Latino patients with type 2 diabetes. Our data may help to better guide culturally appropriate counseling regarding insulin use. (C) 2012 Primary Care Diabetes Europe. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social media is Internet-based by design, allowing people to share content quickly via electronic means. People can openly express their thoughts on social media sites such as Twitter, which can then be shared with other people. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models. Deep belief neural network (DBN) with pseudo labelling is used to classify the tweets. Top layers of the base classifiers are boosted in the pseudo labelling strategy, whereas lower levels of the base classifiers share weights for feature extraction. By introducing the pseudo boost mechanism, our suggested technique preserves the same time complexity as a DBN while achieving fast convergence to optimality. The pseudo labelling improves the performance of the classification. It extracts the keywords from the tweets with high precision. The results reveal that using the DBN classifier in conjunction with the bigram in the N-gram model outperformed other models by 90.3 percent. The proposed approach can also aid medical professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action for each location based on their views regarding the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prolonged stays and multiple operations in burn management increase the risk of transmission. We would like to discuss our experience in hospitalized burn patients with Coronavirus disease (covid-19) infection. METHODS: In-patient burns with confirmed COVID-19 infection were studied. Age, gender, burned total body surface area (TBSA), number and sort of operations and dressing changes, intensive care unit stay, ward stay, total length of stay, and morbidity and mortality were analyzed. Medical staff observed for infection. RESULTS: The mean age of the 11 positive patients was 51 (+/- 19.37) years and burned TBSA was 34.36% (+/- 21.97%). Six (54.5%) patients presented with negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests; however, symptoms and findings revealed the illness. Patients underwent 85 operations including hydrosurgery. Totally, 475 dressing changes were done. Respiratory failure caused three mortalities without sepsis. Age, TBSA, and deep dermal burn percent of the mortalities showed no difference. None of the staff and hospitalized other patients had hospital acquired COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Healthcare must continue during pandemics. Awareness, proper usage of personal protective equipment, keeping social distance, and strengthened access control to the clinic are important priorities to avoid viral transmission. The difficulty in PCR negative patients was the confusing effect of burns as most of the laboratory and radiologic findings overlaps with the major burns' consequences. Findings, cannot be explained by the clinical course of burn, should indicate COVID infection. Regarding our results, burn patient treatment routines can be applied safely by competence to focused and re-adopted precautions as there were no hospital acquired COVID-19. Patients must trained for cross-contamination. Healthcare's must prioritize their own health under all situations including pandemics. Updating, the preventive cautions and rigid compliance are a must.

AB  - Introduction: First spotted in Wuhan, China, World Health Organisation declared the deadly outbreak caused by novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) as global pandemic on March 11, 2020. With over 72 million cases globally till December 2020, countries need to gear up to detect, isolate and treat Corona Virus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) cases. Laboratories play a crucial role in diagnosis thereby instituting early contact tracing and quarantine measures. The laboratory based COVID-19 diagnostic testing data may help in formulating strategies to contain the spread of infection.
   Aim: To describe key patient variables of the respiratory samples processed for SARS-CoV-2 by Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) at a diagnostic laboratory.
   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive, single centre study carried out at ICMR approved COVID-19 diagnostic laboratory, nasopharyngeal swabs received in Viral Transport Medium (VTM) were tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection by RTPCR. Key patient variables, like age, gender, symptoms and sample positivity rate were tabulated. The demographic and clinical data of samples tested were summarised by medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for continuous variables and by proportions for categorical variables.
   Results: A total of 12,187 samples were received between 21st March to 8th July 2020. The data from 11,196 individuals were complete and were included in the analysis. Overall, 2,053 samples were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 indicating positivity rate of 18.33%. Sample positivity was highest (63.91%) among high-risk contacts of a laboratory confirmed case. The maximum number of samples tested belonged to age group of 21-40 years and male predominance was observed.
   Conclusion: Although social distancing, mask usage, hand hygiene and respiratory etiquettes are important measures for containment of COVID-19, strengthening and capacity building of laboratory network is crucial for mitigating the pandemic.

AB  - There is an increasing need for better understanding of the impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) on patients with neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). A few pilot studies have investigated COVID-19 infections in NMOSD, but few studies have addressed disease activity and immune status of these patients during the pandemic. We carried out a cross-sectional study to examine immune status, relapses, and COVID-19 infections in a cohort of NMOSD patients using an electronic patient registry (MSNMOBase) for multiple sclerosis and related disorders. An online questionnaire was administered to all NMOSD patients in the registry from January 1, 2011, to June 1, 2020. Clinical demographic characteristics, immune status, relapses, treatments, COVID-19 infections, and preventive measures were evaluated. Of the 752 registered patients, 535 (71.1%) with qualified data were included. A total of 486 used preventive therapies during the pandemic, including mycophenolate mofetil (71.2%), azathioprine (13.3%), and other immunosuppressants (6.4%). Neither median immune cell counts nor immunoglobulin levels (p > 0.05) were significantly different between patients with or without immunosuppression. During the pandemic, no patients were diagnosed with COVID-19, and the majority (>95%) took one or more effective protective measures (e.g., wearing a mask and social distancing). However, a significantly higher annualized relapse rate (ARR) was observed in the 33 patients with treatment interruptions due to the pandemic compared to before it (p < 0.05), whereas ARR changes were not found in patients with continuous treatments or those without treatments (p > 0.05). Interruption frequency was significantly higher in patients with relapses compared to those without (34.9 vs. 15.7%, p < 0.01). For stable NMOSD patients during the pandemic, the risk of relapse due to treatment interruption may be higher than the risk of COVID-19 infection when protective measures are used, and continuous relapse-prevention treatments may be necessary.

AB  - Introduction Little is known about how sheltering in place to contain the spread of COVID-19 over extended periods affects individuals' psychological well-being. This study's objective was to analyze the factors associated with MSM's (men who have sex with men) low psychological well-being in the COVID-19 pandemic context. Method This cross-sectional study was conducted online across Brazil (26 states and federal district) in April and May 2020. The participants were recruited using snowball sampling and Facebook posts. Data were collected using social media and MSM dating apps. We estimated the prevalence, crude prevalence ratio (PR), and the respective confidence intervals (CI95%). Results The prevalence of low psychological well-being found in the sample was 7.9%. Associated factors were belonging to the youngest group (PR 2.76; CI95% 1.90-4.01), having polyamorous relationships (PR 2.78; CI95% 1.51-5.11), not complying with social isolation measures (PR 6.27; CI95% 4.42-8.87), not using the social media to find partners (PR 1.63; CI95% 1.06-2.53), having multiple sexual partners (PR 1.80; CI95% 1.04-3.11), having reduced the number of partners (PR 2.67; CI95% 1.44-4.95), and group sex (PR 1.82; CI95% 1.23-2.69) Conclusion The well-being of MSM living in Brazil was negatively affected during the social distancing measures intended to control the spread of COVID-19. The variables that contributed the most to this outcome include social isolation, relationships established with partners, and sexual behavior. Policy Implications Planning and implementing public policies and actions to promote psychological well-being are needed to improve MSM's resilience by adopting safe strategies and behavior.

AB  - Current facemask research focuses on material characterization and efficiency; however, facemasks are often not tested such that aerosol distributions are evaluated from the gaps in the sides, bottom, and nose areas. Poor evaluation methods could lead to misinformation on optimal facemasks use; a high-throughput, reproducible method which illuminates the issue of fit influencing aerosol transmission is needed. To this end, we have created an in vitro model to quantify particle transmission by mimicking exhalation aerosols in a 3D printed face-nose-mouth replica via a nebulizer and quantifying particle counts using a hand-held particle counter. A sewn, sewn with pipe cleaner nose piece, and sewn with a coffee filter facemask were used to evaluate current common homemade sewn facemask designs, benchmarked against industry standard surgical, N95 respirator tightly fit, and N95 respirator loosely fit facemasks. All facemasks have significantly reduced particle counts in front of the facemask, but the side and top of the facemask showed increases in particle counts over the no facemask condition at that same position, suggesting that some proportion of aerosols are being redirected to these gaps. An altered size distribution of aerosols that escape at the vulnerable positions was observed; escaped particles have larger count median diameters, with a decreased ratio of smaller to larger particles, possibly due to hygroscopic growth or aggregation. Of the homemade sewn facemasks, the facemask with a coffee filter insert performed the best at reducing escaped aerosols, with increased efficiency also observed for sewn masks with a pipe cleaner nose piece. Importantly, there were minimal differences between facemasks at increasing distances, which supports that social distance is a critical element in reducing aerosol transmission. This work brings to light the importance of quantifying particle count in positions other than directly in front of the facemask and identifies areas of research to be explored.

AB  - Social distancing and home confinement during the first wave of Covid-19 have been essential to helping governments to flatten the infection curve but raised concerns on possible negative consequences such as prolonged isolation or sedentary lifestyles. In this scenario, gardening activities have been identified as a plausible tool to buffer the mental health consequences of forced home confinement. In this paper, we investigate the relation between gardening and psychopathological distress during the lockdown of the first wave of Covid-19 in Italy. It is hypothesized that engagement in gardening activities promotes psychological health, through a reduction of Covid-related stress. An online survey was administered through sharing using social media to N = 303 participants during the March-May 2020 lockdown in Italy, measuring Covid-19 related distress, psychopathological distress, engagement in gardening activities plus a series of socio-demographic and residential covariates. As expected, a mediation model tested using a bootstrapping procedure showed that gardening is related to lower psychopathological distress through decreased Covid-19 related distress. Interestingly, results also showed that psychopathological distress was higher for women and unmarried respondents, and negatively associated with age and square meters per person at home. The theoretical and practical implications for social policies contrasting the Covid-19 pandemic are discussed.

AB  - Common wisdom holds that graphic media violence leads to antisocial outcomes. This common wisdom is reflected in the Society for Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics. However, theory and research regarding moral emotions' ability to increase moral sensitivity suggests that this type of negative content may be capable of yielding prosocial responses. This article describes this logic and tests its predictions in two experimental studies utilizing news footage of a mass execution conducted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Results corroborate claims that graphic media violence can serve as a moral motivator. Higher levels of graphic violence led to stronger anger and disgust responses, which in turn predicted higher levels of (a) moral sensitivity, (b) desires for anti-ISIS interventions (including military and humanitarian efforts), and (c) eudaimonic motivations (i.e., seeking meaning in life). Important to note, no increases in negative attitudes toward Arab Muslims were observed. Theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 has had a huge worldwide influence. Vaccinations are a crucial component of illness prevention. Thailand's vaccination program for children above the age of five is in its initial stages. Many Thai parents are still unwilling to vaccinate their children with the COVID-19 vaccine. The purpose of this study was to analyze the rate of parental hesitancy and influential variables among Thai parents and guardians living in Thailand. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey in Thailand during October and November of 2021. Through online social media networks, an online survey (REDcap) was distributed. Thai parents and guardians with at least one child under the age of 18 were invited to participate. Results: A total of 1064 responses for analysis. One thousand and sixty-four were available for analysis with 74.4% of those who participated being female. The results found that the parental COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy rate was higher among parents with children under the age of 12 than among parents with children over the age of 12. (56.9% vs 17.1%, p-value < 0.001). Parents were more concerned about vaccination side effects (82.5%), safety (60.0%), and vaccine efficacy (37.2%). Low vaccine reluctance among parent with children age less than 12 years old was associated with higher education (aOR = 0.35, 95 %CI = 0.13-0.93, p-value = 0.036) and a favorable attitude regarding covid-19 immunizations (aOR 0.16, 95% CI 0.04-0.67, p-value 0.012) Conclusion: The majority of Thai parents with children under the age of 12 were hesitant to vaccinate against COVID-19. To minimize Thai parent vaccination hesitancy and increase vaccine uptake among children, the government and health care providers should target this population with evidence-based information, promote positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccinations, and encourage educated parents to vaccinate their children at first.

AB  - Background People with weakened immune systems may not develop adequate protection after taking two doses of the mRNA-combined COVID-19 vaccine. The additional dose may improve the level of protection against Covid-19. Objectives Current study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude and determents of third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose acceptance among population in the UAE. Methods and materials This is online descriptive cross-sectional community-based study conducted among the students and faculty of Ajman University from 25 August to 20 October 2021. The questionnaire, which was in the English language, encompassed two sections containing 22 items. Section one gathered the demographic details of the respondents, while Section two used 13 questions to evaluate the respondents' knowledge of and attitude to the third COVID-19 vaccine booster dose. Results 614 respondents participated in this study. The average knowledge score was 44.6% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [41%, 49%]. Better knowledge scores were observed in postgraduates (OR 4.29; 95% CI 2.28-8.11), employees in the healthcare sector (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.05-2.51), participants who had relatives infected with the Covid-19 (OR 1.46; 95% CI 1.05-2.02), participants who had infected with Covid-19 (OR 2.21; 95% CI 1.43-3.43) and participants who had received first two doses of the COVID-19 vaccine (OR 2.08; 95% CI 1.40-3.11). The average attitude score was 70.2% with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [69.2%, 71.2%]. Conclusion Necessary steps should be taken by the government and public health authorities, in line with the local culture, to increase vaccination acceptance and foster positive attitudes towards the vaccine. A suitable approach to this would be to develop an educational framework that could demonstrate the risks of vaccine avoidance or delay to the general population. Moreover, health authorities should pay more attention to the false information being disseminated across the internet, especially social media. Also, healthcare workers should be trained in vaccinology and virology to make sure that they are able to understand important developments in these fields and convey the findings to their patients.

AB  - Introduction
   Many countries including Pakistan are currently using face masks in their pandemic control plans. Being highly prevalent, the correct use of these masks is particularly important, as an incorrect use and disposal may actually increase the rate of transmission. The purpose of this study was to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of healthcare workers (HCWs) in wearing a surgical face mask to limit the spread of the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19).
   Materials and Methods
   This survey was conducted by interviewing HCWs using a questionnaire consisting of the basic demographic characteristics, and the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding the use of surgical face mask to limit the new COVID-19 exposure. Each correct answer was scored 1 and each incorrect answer scored 0. The total number of questions was 16, and the final score was calculated and then labeled according to the percentage (out of 16) of correct responses as good (>80%), moderate (60-80%), and poor (<60%).
   Results
   A total of 392 participants with a mean age of 42.37 +/- 13.34 years (341 males and 51 females) were included in the study. The overall final results were good in 138 (35.2%), moderate in 178 (45.4%), and poor in 76 (19.3%). Around 43.6% of participants knew about the correct method of wearing the masks, 68.9% knew that there are three layers, 53% stated that the middle layer act as a filter media barrier, and 75.5% knew the recommended maximum duration of wearing it. The majority (88.2%) of participants knew that a cloth face mask is not much effective, around 79.8% knew that used face mask cannot he re-used, and 44.8% knew about the yellow-coded bag for disposal.
   Conclusions
   Knowledge, attitude, and practice of HCWs regarding the use of face masks were found to be inadequate. Studied HCWs had a positive attitude but moderate-to-poor level of knowledge and practice regarding the use of face mask. HCWs and general public awareness campaigns regarding the proper use of face mask by utilizing all social media available resources would be helpful during this pandemic.

AB  - Starting from 2015, the Russian-speaking residents in Germany have expressed their anti-refugee position in the form of rallies and rising voting support for the right-wing populist party, Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD). Due to the absence of social cues, unlimited space, immediate responses, and minimal censorship online, platforms for communication have reflected the offline mobilization and became the major platforms for the spreadability of discriminatory discourse. This article sets out to investigate why Russian-speaking internet users residing in Germany justify anti-refugee discourse and how they construct the notion of "others." Based on the netnographic analysis of the chosen online discussions and conducted interviews with its members, this article argues that, with the appearance of new "others," Russian-speaking migrants have redefined their symbolic boundaries in order to draw the line between the incoming migrants and themselves people with a migrant background. In many ways, participants of the analyzed discussions employed the politicized civilizational rhetoric that allowed them to redefine existing categorizations. This research explores, for the first time, the reasons lying behind the online populist activity of the Russian-speaking residents in Germany.

AB  - The outbreak of the second severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) known as COVID-19 has caused global concern. No effective vaccine or treatment to control the virus has been approved yet. Social distancing and precautionary protocols are still the only way to prevent person-to-person transmission. We hope to identify anti-COVID-19 activity of the existing drugs to overcome this pandemic as soon as possible. The present study used HEX and AutoDock Vina softwares to predict the affinity of about 100 medicinal structures toward the active site of 3-chymotrypsin-like protease (3Clpro) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), separately. Afterwards, MOE software and the pharmacophore-derived query methodology were employed to determine the pharmacophore model of their inhibitors. Tegobuvir (19) and compound 45 showed the best binding affinity toward RdRp and 3Clpro of SARS-CoV-2 in silico, respectively. Tegobuvir -previously applied for hepatitis C virus- formed highly stable complex with uncommon binding pocket of RdRp (E total: -707.91 Kcal/mol) in silico. In addition to compound 45, tipranavir (28) and atazanavir (26) as FDA-approved HIV protease inhibitors were tightly interacted with the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease as well. Based on pharmacophore modelling, a good structural pattern for potent candidates against SARS-CoV-2 main enzymes is suggested. Re-tasking or taking inspiration from the structures of tegobuvir and tipranavir can be a proper approach toward coping with the COVID-19 in the shortest possible time and at the lowest cost.

AB  - Despite the evidence suggesting a high rate of cerebrovascular complications in patients with SARS-CoV-2, reports have indicated decreasing rates of new ischemic stroke diagnoses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The observed decrease in emergency department (ED) visits is unsurprising during this major crisis, as patients are likely to prioritize avoiding exposure to SARS-CoV-2 over addressing what they may perceive as mild symptoms of headache, lethargy, difficulty speaking, and numbness. In the central and south Texas regions where we practice, we suspect that patient admission, treatment, and discharge volumes for acute stroke treatment have decreased significantly since COVID-19-related shelter-at-home orders were issued. Symptoms of stroke are frequently noticed by a family member, friend, or community member before they are recognized by the patients themselves, and these symptoms may be going unnoticed due to limited face-to-face encounters. This possibility emphasizes the importance of patient education regarding stroke warning signs and symptoms during the current period of isolation and social-distancing. The south Texas population, already saddled with above-average rates of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, has a higher stroke mortality rate compared to Texas and U.S. averages; however, the number of patients presenting to EDs with acute ischemic stroke diagnoses is lower than average. In our viewpoint, we aim to present the relative literature to date and outline our ongoing analyses of the highly affected and diverse stroke populations in San Antonio and Austin, Texas, to answer a simple question: where did all our stroke patients go?

AB  - Background: Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreous tamponade of gas or air has been widely used for a series of vitreoretinal diseases. It is estimated that 100,000 patients per year undergo PPV globally, and half of them were subsequently tamponaded with gas or air. According to Boyle's law (P1V1= P2V2), patients with an intravitreous remnant of gas or air will be under high risk of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation and subsequent vision loss owing to the expanded intravitreous gas or air when traveling post operation to a place with a significantly higher altitude. We always explain to patients why postoperative travel is potentially risky. Emergency cases of elevated IOP caused by postoperative traveling would sometimes come to surgeons. However, there have been few disease education or reference tools for both the surgeons and patients to have better communication.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to introduce and evaluate a mobile phone app developed by surgeons (the authors) for preliminary risk estimation of volume expansion and IOP elevation in patients with intravitreous gas or air when traveling to a place of higher altitude.
   Methods: The app was developed on the iOS and Android operating systems. Boyle's law (P1V1= P2V2) was the theoretical basis of the app. Intravitreous gas or air volume and altitude values were independent factors to deduce the risk report. Consecutive patients underwent vitrectomy, and those with an intravitreous remnant of gas or air were recruited. The surgeons judged the vertical height of the fluid/gas interface through the dilated pupil; the patients were instructed to judge it according to their visual field when looking straight ahead and line it out on a chart included in the app. Finally, all the patients were required to fill a Likert scale-based questionnaire with 2 main items to evaluate the participants' user experience and attitudes toward the app.
   Results: A total of 50 patients were included (30 males and 20 females). All patients could independently operate the app to complete the test. The median heights of the fluid/gas interface independently judged by the surgeon and patients were 40% (range: 10%-75%) and 41% (range: 9%-78%), respectively (P=. 63). The median altitude of the participants' destinations was 150.0 m (range: 0-3490 m). The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a good agreement between the surgeons' and patients' judgments (bias of -0.3%), with 95% limits of agreement of -5.8% to 5.3%. Overall, the Likert scale revealed a positive attitude from the patients toward the app.
   Conclusions: The app is reliable for patients to have preliminary risk estimation of intravitreous gas or air volume expansion and IOP elevation if travel to a place of higher altitude is planned. The surgeons could also use it as a platform for better disease communication.

AB  - Weight stigma, a negative attitude toward persons who are overweight, can lead to emotional detriment (increased vulnerability to depression and anxiety, decreased self-esteem) and discriminatory practices (denial of employment, lower wages, refusal of job promotion or college admission, healthcare deprivation), which have increased dramatically in the United States over the past decade. We report two experiments that implicate nostalgia as a resource or strategy for weight stigma reduction. We hypothesized and found that nostalgia about an encounter with a person who is overweight improves attitudes toward the group "overweight." Undergraduates who recalled a nostalgic (vs. ordinary) interaction with an overweight person subsequently showed more positive outgroup attitudes. The effect of nostalgia on outgroup attitudes was mediated by greater inclusion of the outgroup in the self and increased outgroup trust (Experiments 1 and 2), as well as reduced intergroup anxiety and greater perceptions of a common ingroup identity (Experiment 2). The findings have interventional potential. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemics is a major threat to human populations. The disease has rapidly spread, causing mass hospitalization and the loss of millions of people mainly in urban areas which are hubs for contagion. At the same time, the social distancing practices required for containing the outbreak have caused an eruption of mental illnesses that include symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress. The severity of such mental distress is modulated by the context of media coverage and the information and guidelines from local health authorities. Different urban green infrastructures, such as gardens, parks, and green views can be important for mitigating mental distress during the pandemics. However, it is unclear whether some urban green infrastructures are more efficient than others in reducing mental distress or whether their effectiveness changes with the context. Here we assess the relative importance of different urban green infrastructures on the mental distress of residents of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We show that although urban parks and green views are important, home gardens are the most efficient in mitigating mental distress. This is likely related to the practice of selfisolation seen for the residents of Rio de Janeiro. Information on the efficiency of different urban green infrastructures in mitigating mental distress can be important to help guide programs to inform the public about the best practices for maintaining mental health during the current outbreak. This can also help planning cities that are more resilient to future pandemics.

AB  - Shared decision making (SDM) is a management paradigm that empowers patients as partners in their own care in a bidirectional exchange of information and values, and optimize the decision-making process. During the current coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, there is a greater need to encourage participation in the SDM process. The pandemic has created both challenges and opportunities for delivering care, as system adaptations influence the physician-patient relationship. Although social distancing and health service reallocation can interfere with preference for an in-person visit, these measures also provide an avenue to study and implement virtual SDM processes. Communicating risk at a time of heightened uncertainty may pose a barrier to SDM engagement but provides the opportunity to foster a patient-centered approach within a more personalized context. Social media influence during coronavirus disease 2019 has resulted in an "infodemic" but highlights the importance of patient engagement. The pandemic has changed how we deliver care but allows us to re-evaluate common practices and enhance effectiveness of our management strategies. Navigating the uncertainty of subsequent pandemic waves creates confusion about how to safely reinitiate clinical service. This will require ongoing SDM with our patients and among colleagues through current-and future-challenges. Coronavirus disease 2019 has created many difficulties but has forced us to reexamine how to provide more patient-centered and high-quality care.

AB  - Background In response to successive COVID-19 restrictions in Wales, the Welsh ACE Support Hub launched the #TimeToBeKind campaign in March 2021. The campaign used a short film broadcast on national television and promoted on social media to encourage behaviour change for kindness. We evaluated the #TimeToBeKind campaign film to identify whether watching the film would result in increased intention to act in ways that promote kindness to others and if intentions were associated with being emotionally affected by the film. Methods A mixed methods evaluation was employed, using a short online survey and interaction with the film on the Twitter social media platform. The online survey measured public (n = 390) attitudes towards the film including feelings invoked, and behavioural intentions for acts of kindness as a result of viewing the film. Tweets which interacted with the film (n = 59; likes, re-tweets or comments), and tweet sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) towards the film were also explored. Results The majority of participants reported positive attitudes to the film and agreed that they understood the campaign message (91.8%). 67.9% reported that the film made them feel upset or sad and for 22.6% the film resonated with their lockdown experience. As a result of seeing the film, 63.6% reported intentions to be kinder to others, 65.6% intended to try and help other members of their community, and 70.5% were more likely to check in on friends, family and neighbours. A higher proportion of individuals who were emotionally affected by the film (e.g. upset or sad, hopeful or encouraged, gained something positive) and those for whom the film resonated with their lockdown experience reported increased kindness behavioural intentions as a result of seeing the film. Conclusions Film can be an effective tool to promote behaviour change for kindness. Films that provoke strong emotional reactions can still be perceived positively and lead to behaviour change. With the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating a move online for many, the findings of the present evaluation are relevant to how public health messaging can adapt and utilise this space to target individuals and promote behaviour change.

AB  - Background: Health information has a profound impact on developing awareness and ultimately preventing the burden of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, but study in Bangladesh is lacking.
   Aims: Therefore, this study was conducted to investigate the impact of information from social media and television in developing health awareness among people amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Data was collected during December 10, 2020 to February 10, 2021 from 1808 people. Data was collected by using questionnaire about information source and their impact on COVID-19 related health measures. Pearson's correlation analyses was conducted.
   Results: Female (52%, 937 of 1808) was the most prevalent sex and the mean age was 24 +/- 3.9 years. Most of the social media users were students (63%, 1131 of 1808). Social media (53%, 959 of 1808) and television (44%, 800 of 1808) were the most popular sources and Facebook (66.5%, 1203 of 1808) was the most common source of getting health information. About 87% people received health information on social media and television. Users of social media had about 3 times more likelihood to follow the health rules. About 80% participants who used social media followed the health measures after 0-28 days of getting the information. The strongest correlation was found between social distancing and the infor-mation on television (r = 0.943).
   Conclusion: Strong correlation of health information was present among the participants in building awareness about taking preventive measures. This is the first study to describe the positive influence of information amid COVID-19 in Bangladesh. (C) 2021 Diabetes India. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: To study the satisfaction of end-users of a computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system concerning ease of use and the effect on users' workflow, efficiency, and medication safety and to seek users' opinions regarding required improvements of the system. Usability evaluation had shown that this system, which was in use for almost a decade, contained a number of severe usability problems. So another objective of the study was to determine whether there was a direct relation between user satisfaction and the results of a usability evaluation of the system.
   Methods: Two survey questionnaires were distributed to CPOE system users (physicians and nurses) working in inpatient departments of a university hospital. Questionnaires included items that were rated using a five point Likert scale. Multiple choice questions with space for free text additions also were used to collect qualitative data concerning the use of the CPOE system and the users' opinion concerning system requirements for improvement. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and by the use of Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis tests.
   Results: Two hundred seventeen physicians and 587 nurses were eligible to participate in this study (response rate 49% and 56% respectively). Physicians were satisfied with the CPOE ease of use (median 3.8, interquartile range [IQR] 3.3-4), and the effect on workflow (median 3.7, IQR 3.3-4), medication safety (median 3.75, IQR 3-4), and efficiency (median 4, IQR 3-4). Nurses also had a positive attitude towards CPOE ease of use (median 3.6, IQR 3-4), and its effect on workflow (median 3, IQR 3-3.6), medication safety (median 3, IQR 2.5-3.5), and efficiency (median 3.5, IQR 3-4). Users mainly indicated that the system needs: supplementary functionalities (e. g. alerts for allergies), improvement of current functionalities, integration with other hospital information systems and improvement of information presentation (e. g. a clear medication overview). Users did not use some current functionalities because of lack of awareness of the functionalities or having difficulty in using them.
   Conclusions: Users of this CPOE system, which was used for almost a decade, were satisfied with the system's ease of use and its effect on efficiency, workflow and medication safety although the system showed many usability problems and lacked some functionalities. In this case study, therefore, there seems no direct relation between the results of the earlier performed usability evaluation and user satisfaction as determined in the current study.

However, the present research finds guilty pleasure messages have strikingly different effects in men vs. women, for both physical and service products. Such messages result in more negative attitudes and lowered likelihood of purchase in men, yet higher attitudes and purchase likelihood in women. Using a mediated moderation model, this research shows these differential gender effects are driven by imagery generation via the experience of low agency emotions.

AB  - This study examined four forms of sexist beliefs as predictors of attitudes toward women in the military and in combat. Survey data revealed that military-affiliated college students (n = 62) held more negative attitudes than civilian students (n = 254) toward women in combat, but the groups did not differ on attitudes toward women in the military. All forms of sexism contributed uniquely to the prediction of attitudes toward women in the military, and 3 forms were associated with approval of women in combat. Sexist beliefs mediated the relationship between military-affiliation status and approval of women in combat.

AB  - Background: Disruption to everyday routine during the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in considerable implications for global mental health. The inter- and intra-personal mechanisms by which disrupted routine can contribute to elevated depressive symptoms has not been well-explored. The present study aimed to examine how feelings of social (dis)connectedness and rumination, as a maladaptive coping strategy, could explain the association between disrupted well-being activities and depressive symptoms.
   Methods: Participants (N = 496) ranging in age from 18 to 73 years (M = 28.73, SD = 10.93) completed an online survey within the first 3 months of the COVID-19 pandemic, which included measures of disruption to usual psychological and physical well-being activities, social connectedness, rumination, and depressive symptoms. Social connectedness and rumination were investigated as serial mediators of the association between disrupted well-being activities and depression using Hayes' PROCESS macro.
   Results: 39.5% of the sample reported clinically significant levels of depression. Disruption to well-being activities predicted higher depressive symptoms, and this was partially explained by feelings of social disconnectedness and subsequent rumination. Rumination, alone, was not a significant mediator between disrupted routine and depressive symptoms.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional survey design does not preclude the possibility of bidirectional effects.
   Conclusion: The social distancing public health measures to combat COVID-19 have contributed to widespread disrupted routine, and in turn, elevated symptoms of depression. Social disconnectedness plays a particularly important role in this association. Intervention strategies should consider social factors as a 'social cure' for mass, positive mental health promotion during COVID-19.

AB  - Social media has become a valuable tool in providing an opportunity to stay in touch with one's social networks, providing reassurance and practical advice to individuals to pre-empt panic and rumors in COVID-19. However, the implications of social media use on the everyday emotion (anxiety and depression) of users especially, international students, are not well understood. Thus, this study sought to examine the impact of social media use on the everyday emotion of international students in China during COVID-19. Using a structured online questionnaire based on modified questions from the generalized anxiety disorder 7 (GAD-7) and the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) and social media use instruments, data were collected from 480 participants. Of the total responses received, 474 were further analyzed employing the Partial Least Squares Path Modelling (PLS-PM). This study showed a significant positive relationship between social media use and everyday emotion (B = 0.34, 95% CI (0.26, 0.44)). Additionally, self-rated anxiety and depression associated with social media use among international students were generally mild (n = 249, 52.50% and n = 350, 73.80%, respectively). Moderating effects revealed that age and sex do not significantly moderate the relationship between social media use and everyday emotion in COVID-19. Given the nature of social media among international students, who are also prone to suffering from anxiety and depression associated with social media use, the positive effect of social media use and everyday emotion, especially in COVID-19, has important implications for international students' education stakeholders. Thus, gaining a deeper understanding of this relationship could enable them to harness social media and use it as a valuable tool to overcome the social distancing constraints in COVID-19.

AB  - There is inadequate understanding of how social media can shape fear and consumer responses in the manner of consumer panic buying while Covid-19 is spreading across the world. Through taking a social constructionism position this research focused on what people think and feel at an individual and collective level on the role of social media to create panic behaviour. Data have been collected from thirty-four consumers who have minimum one active social media account. These participants are contacted through telephonic interview due to maintaining the social distancing. Findings reveal that uncertainties and insecurities proof, buying as persuasion, product unavailability proof, authorities' communication, global logic, and expert opinion are some of the causes on social media platforms that developed the situation of consumer panic buying during Covid-19 crises. Furthermore, the unprecedented level of real-time information on Covid-19 at users' fingertips can give them the tools they need to make smart decisions, but also make them more anxious about what is to come; experts say that may lead to panic buying or stockpiling of products. The study has tried to develop understanding about how social media generates social proof and offers a window into people's collective response to the coronavirus outbreak and shapes panic buying reaction. The study has provided a consumer panic buying theory based on the results of this study and on existing theories, such as global capitalism/information society risk society, social influence, and social proof. These theories help to understand how global logic is built due to the use of social media and how different social proofs are generated which developed the behaviour of consumer panic buying due to Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 was first recognized in late 2019 in China, at which time school closures forced most students to isolate at home or maintain social distance, both of which increased smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and post traumatic disorder (PTSD) risks. However, to date, no research has fully explored these behavioral risks or the consequences. Methods: Two thousand and ninety home-confined students from two Chinese high schools participated in an online-based questionnaire battery that assessed their sociodemographic characteristics, COVID-19 related exposures, daytime sleepiness, problematic smartphone use, and PTSD. The subsequent data were subjected to mediation analysis, and structural equation models (SEM) were employed to explore the variable relationships. Results: The problematic smartphone use, daytime sleepiness and PTSD prevalence were respectively 16.4%, 20.2% and 6.9%. The number of COVID-19 related exposure was directly associated with problematic smartphone use and PTSD symptoms. Problematic smartphone use was found to be a mediator between COVID-19 related exposure and PTSD symptoms, and daytime sleepiness was found to partially mediate the associations between problematic smartphone use and PTSD . Conclusions: The more exposure associated with the pandemic, the more psychological and behavioral problems the adolescents had. The relatively high rate of problematic smartphone use in home isolated adolescents possibly increased the risk of daytime sleepiness and psychological problems. Therefore, targeted improvements are needed to reduce the risk of psychological problems and daytime sleepiness in adolescents.

AB  - While studies on media representations of agricultural biotechnology mostly analyse media texts, this work is intended to fill a research gap with an analysis of journalistic interpretations of media representations. The purpose of this project was to determine how news media represent agricultural biotechnology and how journalists interpret their own representations. A content and critical discourse analysis of news texts published in the Slovenian media over two years and in-depth interviews with their authors were conducted. News texts results suggest that most of the news posts were "othering" biotechnology and biotechnologists: biotechnology as a science and individual scientists are represented as "they," who are socially irresponsible, ignorant, arrogant, and "our" enemies who produce unnatural processes and work for biotechnology companies, whose greed is destroying people, animals, and the environment. Most journalists consider these representations to be objective because they have published the biotechnologists' opinions, despite their own negative attitudes towards biotechnology.

AB  - Drug calculation is not immune to the undesirable impact of math anxiety and negative attitudes on test outcomes in nursing studies, and several studies indicate that math anxiety is present in the student population at such a degree that it is likely to interfere with these students' mathematical ability.
   Examining the educational system through the lens of history and adding a dash of cultural theory, a contributing cause to the math anxiety may be found in the Sputnik Crisis of the late 1950s, the ghostly remnants of which are still present in the stereotypes of mathematics promoted by mass media.
   In an effort to reshape the culturally conditioned attitudes which may be responsible for math anxiety, we suggest using elements from popular culture to diversify the perception and image of mathematics in drug calculation.

AB  - The present study explores the relative absence of expressive cues and the effect of contextual cues on the perception of emotions and its effect on attitudes. The visibility of expressive cues was manipulated by showing films displaying female targets whose faces were either fully visible, covered by a niqab, or partially visible (control condition). Targets expressed anger, shame, and happiness in the three different face conditions. Results show that perception of emotions is mainly affected by an absence of expressive cues: Covering the lower part of the face results in the perception of less happiness in happy videos and of more intense negative emotions in both happy and shame videos. This bias toward the perception of more negative emotions in covered faces mediates a negative attitude toward niqabs.

AB  - Social distancing practices and staying at home have increased the time people spend on social media with the purpose of exchanging and consuming information about completing their routine practices safely. The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted in-person banking operations and increased the physical threat for both retail bankers and customers. Consequently, the world has moved toward internet banking with the purpose to continue routine transactions for paying bills, purchasing groceries, and shopping of brands. The present study aims to explore how the fearful environment of Covid-19 pandemic increased the social practices of internet banking and what challenges are faced by different customers during their use of internet banking. By understanding these experiences, system developers and marketers can improve their internet banking apps to address the needs and expectations of different customers. The study has opted for a relativist ontological position and social constructionist epistemological position to understand different realities in the same context and how customers experience internet banking in a fearful environment. The study used multiple qualitative research methods: Gibbs reflection cycle, semi-structured interviews with internet banking users, and focus group interviews with executives of public and private sector banks. Social actors through social media played a role with respect to understanding the nature of uncertainty during Covid-19 pandemic that changed customers? behavior from traditional banking to internet banking. Information was shared through social media to avoid ATMs, debit and credit card exchange with cashiers, and cash exchange as these are no longer safe options for both bankers and customers. The major theoretical contribution of this study is to merge social practice theory and affordance of technology theory in the context of internet banking adoption. This study has discussed practical implications for marketers and system developers of retail banks.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions for visitors and caregivers in healthcare settings and long-term care (LTC) facilities were enacted in the larger context of public health policies that included physical distancing and shelter-in-place orders. Older persons residing in LTC facilities constituted over half of the mortality statistics across Canada during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using the poststructuralist work of Agamben, Foucault and Mbembe we conducted a thematic analysis on news reports. The extracts of media stories presented in our paper suggest that the scholarship on (bio)power and necropolitics is central for understanding the ways the COVID-19 crisis reveals the pragmatic priorities-and the 'health' and political values-that undergird the moral imagination of the public, including the educated classes of advanced Western democracies. Our critical analysis shows that by isolating individuals who were sick, fragile, and biologically and socially vulnerable, undifferentiated population management policies like social distancing, when piled on the structural weakness of health systems, reproduced inequities and risk for those in need of medical care, advocacy, and social companionship in acute moments of illness, death and grief. Considering the unprecedented deployment of governmental power via public health interventions based on social regulation to protect the population during the crisis-how can we understand so much death and suffering among the most vulnerable?

AB  - While scholars have long studied the relationship between nationalist beliefs and anti-immigrant attitudes, such work has proceeded largely independently from research on collective memory, which explores how nationalist narratives are created, maintained, and contested. In this paper, we bring these literatures together by asking how, at the individual level, receptivity to salient narratives about the nation's past is associated with dispositions toward immigrants and immigration policy. Specifically, we focus on two narratives common in a number of contemporary democracies that frame the nation as having been perpetually victimised over its history (i.e. the victimhood narrative) and as having been chosen to carry out a special mission in the world (i.e. the exceptionalism narrative). Using original data from Israel, we demonstrate that stronger agreement with these narratives, and particularly with exceptionalism, is associated with greater propensity to hold anti-immigrant views. Our analyses reveal that this relationship is mediated by ethnic conceptions of the nation's symbolic boundaries and, to a lesser degree, by perceived symbolic and material threats to the nation-state. Building on recent comparative work, we argue that in nations with a history of precarious sovereignty, victimhood and exceptionalism narratives can provide a fertile basis for the exclusionary appeals of radical-right political actors.

AB  - We examined the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), psychological entitlement, and narcissistic entitlement in the prediction of White men's negative attitudes and behaviors toward lesbian women and gay men. The present study (a) simultaneously examines four predictors (i.e., psychological and narcissistic entitlement, RWA, and SDO) of attitudes toward lesbian women and gay men (ATLG) and rejecting behaviors, (b) examines psychological and narcissistic entitlement as distinct predictors of ATLG and rejecting behaviors, and (c) tests the potential mediating role of ATLG. A path model was tested using the survey data from 153 White, heterosexual, male college students. Findings indicate that only RWA and narcissistic entitlement were significant predictors of ATLG, which is a strong predictor of rejecting behaviors. Furthermore, ATLG mediates the relationship between RWA and rejecting behaviors (d = .35). In other words, higher RWA is associated with higher ATLG, which is associated with more self-reported rejecting behaviors. Narcissistic entitlement also influences rejecting behaviors through ATLG and both psychological and narcissistic entitlement were found to directly predict gay and lesbian rejecting behaviors.

AB  - Purpose This paper aimed to examine the sources of information and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the COVID-19 pandemic in the province of Punjab, Pakistan. The COVID-19 pandemic affected at a large level of all social institutions including the healthcare system of the countries. Design/methodology/approach The study was conducted in Pakistan by using an online survey technique. The rationale to opt for this method was based on the country's lockdown situations, social distancing and the care of the respondents. A total of 847 individuals from different parts of the Punjab province participated in the study. An attitudinal scale was administered, which consisted of statements to measure (dis)agreement among the individuals on current situations of the COVID-19 pandemic. The ethical considerations and confidentiality of the respondents were opted by describing the purpose of research on the first page of the questionnaire. Findings The study findings revealed that peer group, signs and symptoms of COVID-19 pandemic and causes and consequences of COVID-19 pandemic had favourable positive effects on the use of PPE by individuals through the mediation of fear of infection during COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, the study findings were interpreted as per the effects of current situations of COVID-19 on the sources of information and the use of PPE by individuals. Originality/value This study focused on an important gap in the research on COVID-19 pandemic in the country in terms of mass media, health practitioners, peer group, fear of infection and use of PPE.

AB  - This paper presents the results of two experiments designed to test a susceptibility threshold in the shark cage diving context, positing that persons who are high relative to low sensation-seekers are more likely to approach risks that are portrayed as scary and moderately probable. The results of study one provide evidence for the susceptibility threshold showing high sensation-seekers having greater behavioral intent to engage in risk behaviors when a message portrays a scary but only moderately probable risk. The second experiment finds high susceptibility messages result in more negative attitudes and behavioral intentions. Implications for risk message design and theory are addressed.

AB  - The development and scope of using various food preservation methods depends on the level of consumers' acceptance. Despite their advantages, in the case of negative attitudes, producers may limit their use if it determines the level of sales. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of seven different food processing methods and to identify influencing factors, such as education as well as living area and, at the same time, to consider whether consumers verify this type of information on the labels. Additionally, the study included the possibility of influencing consumer attitudes by using alternative names for preservation methods, on the example of microwave treatment. The results showed that conventional heat treatments were the most preferred preservation methods, whereas preservatives, irradiation, radio waves and microwaves were the least favored, suggesting that consumers dislike methods connected with "waves" to a similar extent as their dislike for preservatives. The control factors proved to significantly modify the evaluation of the methods. The analysis of alternative names for microwave treatment showed that "dielectric heating" was significantly better perceived. These research findings are important as the basis for understanding consumer attitudes. Implications for business and directions of future research are also indicated.

AB  - The potential to genetically modify human germlines has reached a critical tipping point with recent applications of CRISPR-Cas9. Even as researchers, clinicians, and ethicists weigh the scientific and ethical repercussions of these advances, we know virtually nothing about public attitudes on the topic. Understanding such attitudes will be critical to determining the degree of broad support there might be for any public policy or regulation developed for genetic modification research. To fill this gap, we gave an online survey to a large (2,493 subjects) and diverse sample of Americans. Respondents supported genetic modification research, although demographic variables influenced these attitudes conservatives, women, African-Americans, and older respondents, while supportive, were more cautious than liberals, men, other ethnicities, and younger respondents. Support was also was slightly muted when the risks (unanticipated mutations and possibility of eugenics) were made explicit. The information about genetic modification was also presented as contrasting vignettes, using one of five frames: genetic editing, engineering, hacking, modification, or surgery. Despite the fact that the media and academic use of frames describing the technology varies, these frames did not influence people's attitudes. These data contribute a current snapshot of public attitudes to inform policy with regard to human genetic modification.

AB  - This article investigates perceptions of technology-mediated translations of literary texts by two groups: translation students and professional literary translators. The participants post-edited an excerpt from a classic Dickens novel into Turkish using a machine translation (MT) system of their choice. The analysis of the post-edited texts, participants' answers to survey questions, and interviews with professional translators suggest that MT is currently a long way from being an essential part of any literary translation practice for the English-Turkish language pair. Translators' interactions with MT and negative attitudes toward it may change in a positive direction as MT improves and translation practice evolves.

AB  - Purpose - The Diagnosis of Sustainable Collaboration (DISC) model (Leurs et al., 2008) specifies five factors (i.e. project management, change management, context, external factors, and stakeholders' support) which predict whether collaboration becomes strong and stable. The purpose of this paper is to study the dynamics of these factors in a study of multiple partnerships in comprehensive school health promotion (CSHP).
   Design/methodology/approach - A Dutch two-year DISC-based intervention to support coordinators of five CSHP partnerships in the systematic development of intersectoral collaboration was studied in a pretest-posttest design. To uncover the determinants of sustainable collaboration and implementation of CSHP and to find possible mediators, the authors carried out multi-level path analyses of data on the DISC factors obtained from 90 respondents (response of approached respondents: 57 percent) at pretest and 69 respondents (52 percent) at posttest. Mediation mechanisms were assessed using joint significance tests.
   Findings - The five DISC factors were important predictors of implementation of CSHP (explained variance: 26 percent) and sustainable collaboration (explained variance: 21 percent). For both outcomes, stakeholders' support proved to be the most important factor. Regarding sustainable collaboration, mediation analysis showed that stakeholders' support fully mediated the effects of change management, project management, external factors and context. This indicates that the extent of stakeholders' support (e.g. appreciation of goals and high levels of commitment) determines whether collaboration becomes sustainable. The authors also found that the extent of stakeholders' support in turn depends upon a well-functioning project management structure, the employment of change management principles (e.g. creation of a common vision and employment of appropriate change strategies), a favorable organizational context (e.g. positive experience with previous collaboration) and external context (e.g. positive attitudes of financing bodies and supporting health and educational policies). For the actual implementation of CSHP, partial mediation by the support factor was found. There was a direct positive effect of change management indicating that organizational knowledge is also necessary to implement CSHP, and a direct negative effect of project management, probably pointing to the negative effects of too much negotiation in the collaboration.
   Research limitations/implications - A design lacking a control group, a small sample and a relatively early assessment after implementation support stopped limit the generalizability of the results.
   Practical implications - Strategies targeting the DISC factors can enhance stakeholders' support and thereby promote sustainable intersectoral collaboration and the implementation of CSHP.
   Originality/value - The DISC model provides a fruitful conceptual framework for the study of predictors and processes in public health partnerships. The importance of stakeholders' support and other factors in the model are demonstrated.

AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals' responses. This study examines whether individuals' perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science.

TI  - HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP): Knowledge, attitudes and counseling practices among physicians in Germany - A cross-sectional survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - MEN
AB  - Background German statutory health insurance began covering the costs associated with HIV PrEP in September 2019; however, to bill for PrEP services, physicians in Germany must either be certified as HIV-specialists according to a nationwide quality assurance agreement, or, if they are non-HIV-specialists, have completed substantial further training in HIV/PrEP care. Given the insufficient implementation of PrEP, the aim of our study was to explore the potential to increase the number of non-HIV-specialists providing PrEP-related services.
   Methods We conducted an anonymous survey among a random sample of internists, general practitioners, dermatologists and urologists throughout Germany using a self-developed questionnaire. We calculated a knowledge score and an attitudes score from individual items in these two domains. Both scores ranged from 0-20, with high values representing good knowledge or positive attitudes. We also asked participants about the proportion of PrEP advice they provided proactively to men who have sex with men (MSM) and trans-persons who met the criteria to be offered PrEP.
   Results 154 physicians completed the questionnaire. Self-assessed knowledge among HIV-specialists was greater than among non-HIV-specialists [Median knowledge score: 20.0 (IQR = 0.0) vs. 4.0 (IQR = 11.0), p<0.001]. Likewise, attitudes towards PrEP were more positive among HIV-specialists than non-HIV-specialists [Median attitudes score: 18.0 (IQR = 3.0) vs. 13.0 (IQR = 5.25), p<0.001]. The proportion of proactive advice on PrEP provided to at-risk MSM and trans-persons by HIV-specialists [Median: 30.0% (IQR = 63.5%)] was higher than that provided by non-HIV-specialists [Median: 0.0% (IQR = 11.3%), p<0.001]. However, the results of our multiple regression suggest the only independent predictor of proactive PrEP advice was the knowledge score, and not whether physicians were HIV-specialists or non-HIV-specialists.
   Conclusions These findings point to opportunities to improve PrEP implementation in individuals at risk of acquiring HIV. Targeted training, particularly for non-HIV-specialists, and the provision of patient-centered information material could help improve care, especially in rural areas.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Giving birth at the health facility is a solitary way of decreasing maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity, especially in developing countries. Despite a prodigious public health effort, many women are still giving birth at home in Ethiopia either by traditional birth attendants or relatives. The Covid-19 pandemic exerted tragic consequences worldwide almost in all aspects of human life. As a result, the pandemic could affect the use of health facilities for childbirth. The effect of Covid-19 on childbirth is not spoken to the study area yet.
   MATERIALS: Community-based mixed quantitative and qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted among mothers with the experience of childbirth during Covid-19. The data were collected using a structured pre-tested questionnaire with systematic random sampling through face-to-face interviews and focused group discussion from September 1-30, 2020. The edited and coded data were entered into EpiData version 3.1 and transformed into SPSS version 21 for further analysis. Descriptive analyses like frequency and percentages were used to describe the study result. Tables were used to present the data, and the qualitative study narration was applied to interpret the output.
   RESULTS: From the total of 232 study participants who experienced childbirth during Covid-19, 69.4% of them gave birth at a health institution, 204 (87.9%) of them had a positive attitude, 210 (90.5%) had awareness, and 186 (80%) have good practice of giving birth at a health facility. Fear of Covid-19 (50.7%), cultural ceremonies, low level of the economy, distance to the health facility, challenging roads for transportation, and fear of episiotomy were factors stated for nonutilization of health facility for childbirth.
   CONCLUSION: From mothers who gave birth at home, more than half of the mothers desist from using a health facility for childbirth care due to the frustration of Covid-19. As a result, awareness creation regarding Covid-19 shall be considered. Besides, the socio-cultural features shall be taken into contemplation, and mediations must be endorsed in health institution setups to make them feel at home.

AB  - Parents, teachers, health care providers, and other caring adults worry about the harmful influence of media messages and images on children and teens and wonder how to recognize and encourage positive and healthy use of media. For decades, experts have commented on the power of media. Media depictions can lead to negative attitudes and behavior in some young viewers. This article discusses whether prosocial, tolerant, and cooperative attitudes and behavior can be learned and imitated by children and adolescents and whether media can nurture or stimulate creativity or actively promote health and well-being in young consumers.

AB  - Introduction The recent introduction of red tabards aimed at avoiding interruptions during medication rounds has generated scientific and media debate, which is still ongoing. The principal aim of this study was to evaluate patients' perceptions of 3 different red tabards; the secondary aim was to explore individual factors associated with the negative perceptions that emerged. Methods Eligible patients had to be admitted to the selected general surgical department and give written informed consent. A total of 104 patients were interviewed. Three real-sized red tabards, made with laminated paper and displaying different messages, were shown over 3 days to each patient involved. Results Despite displaying different messages, from asking everyone not to disturb to allowing only patients to interrupt, patients perceived the tabards as directed at themselves. A different risk of preventing patients from communicating urgent needs emerged. The first tabard I am administering medication-Please do not interrupt me was most at risk to inhibit the patient. A negative impact was reported by 44 patients (42.3%) for the first tabard, 50 (48.0%) for the second tabard, and 40 (38.4%) for the third. In the logistic regression, only 2 independent factors were significantly associated with the negative perception of the message reported on the tabards: a positive attitude to interrupting nurses and receiving medication during their time in hospital. However, the variance explained by these factors ranges from 9.4% to 18.3%. Conclusions On the basis of the findings that emerged, the adoption of the tabards should be evaluated considering the benefits already documented, and the potential negative effects that emerged on patients, which may be influenced by cultural and linguistic aspects. Wearing the tabard with the message reported on the back, directed to the staff and not the patients, may have less negative effects on patients; in addition, using a different color not to alarm the patients may be useful. In addition, comparing the red tabard effects with other strategies introduced to deal with avoidable interruptions (e.g., "no interruption zone") to gain a comprehensive picture regarding benefits/harm is also important.

AB  - Introduction: Data on perception, knowledge and the use of herbal medicine by an educated population will be helpful for on-going discussions on forming policies to support integrative medicine within the formal healthcare delivery system in Africa. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the knowledge, perception, and use of herbal medicine by students (n = 1075) and academic staff (n = 177) at the university of Nigeria, Nsukka, Nigeria.
   Methods: A validated, self-complete 26-item questionnaire was administered anonymously to university staff and students.
   Results: Over 50% of the respondents believed that herbal medicines were effective and should be integrated into the modern health care system. Approximately 70% of the students surveyed had used at least one form of herbal therapy for a number of indications, especially malaria (54.2%) and typhoid fever (36.6%). Recommendations for the use of herbal medicines were made by family and friends (54.4%). There was a relationship between the respondent's academic field of study and their perceptions. Whereas majority of respondents in Arts, Humanities, and the Social Sciences faculties viewed herbal medicines as natural and completely safe, the majority of their colleagues in Biological Sciences, Veterinary Medicines, Paramedical Sciences, Medicine, and Pharmacy did not agree that herbal medicines are completely safe. The general opinion and perception of herbal medicines by respondents was positive, with a mean perception index of 2.73 on a 4-Likert scale. The majority of study participants had either used or were using one form of herbal medicine or another. Sources of information on herbal medicine were mainly from the electronic and print mass media, friend, peers, and family. Health professionals like doctors, nurses and pharmacist were not popular sources of information on herbal medicine; however, majority of respondents preferred that prescriptions of herbal medicines were issued by doctors and would like to see their use in hospitals.
   Conclusion: The results of this study indicated that most of the participants that have used herbal medicines were sufficiently aware of herbal medicine and had a general positive attitude toward their usage. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present study focused on the psychological impact that the lockdown due to coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) had on families in Italy. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Italian government imposed a strict lockdown for all citizens. People were forced to stay at home, and the length of the lockdown was uncertain. Previous studies analyzed the impact of social distance measures on individuals' mental health, whereas few studies have examined the interplay between the adults' functioning, as parents, during this period and the association with the child's adjustment. The present study tested if maternal distress/coping predicts children's behaviors during the COVID-19 lockdown, hypothesizing a mediation effect via children's emotional experience. Participants were 144 mothers (M-age = 39.3, 25-52, SD = 5.6) with children aged 5-10 years (M-age = 7.54, SD = 1.6, 82 boys); mothers answered to an online survey. Results indicated that mothers with higher exposure to COVID-19 showed higher levels of distress and higher display of coping attitudes, even if in the structural equation modeling model, the COVID-19 exposure was not a predictor of mothers' distress. Compared with mothers with good coping skills, mothers with higher stress levels were more likely to attribute negative emotions to their children at the expense of their positive emotions. Moreover, children's emotions acted as mediators between maternal distress/coping and children's adaptive/maladaptive behaviors. In conclusion, it is important to support parents during pandemic emergence, by providing them with adequate information to manage the relationship with their children, to reduce their level of distress and to enhance their coping abilities.

AB  - Efforts are being made in the field of medicine to promote the possibility of indefinite life extension (ILE). Past research on attitudes toward ILE technologies showed that women and more religious individuals usually have more negative attitudes toward ILE. The purpose of this research was to investigate whether gender differences in attitude toward indefinite life extension technologies could be explained by religiosity, afterlife beliefs, and general attitudes toward science. In four studies (N = 5,000), undergraduate participants completed self-report questionnaires measuring their support for life extension as well as religiosity, afterlife beliefs, and attitude toward science (in Study 3). In all studies, men supported ILE more than women, whereas women reported greater belief in an afterlife. The relationship between gender and attitude toward ILE was only partially mediated by religiosity (Studies 2-4) and by attitudes toward science (Study 3).

AB  - This research investigated whether ingroup norm moderates the effect of positive or prosocial interactions on the understanding of intergroup prosocial behaviors. Among four experiments in three different cultural samples (U.S. Americans, Kosovan Serbs, and Kosovan Albanians; N = 808), results showed that participants attributed fewer prosocial motives and reported less willingness to accept help when the helper was an outgroup than an ingroup member. However, these effects were weaker or nonsignificant in the tolerant norm condition, as compared to the intolerant norm or control conditions. In addition, participants were more willing to interact with the outgroup (vs. ingroup) helper in the tolerant norm condition, as compared to the intolerant norm or control conditions. Finally, normative expectations, the attribution of prosocial motives to the helper, and the anticipated quality of the interaction with the helper sequentially explained the observed effects. The theoretical and practical implications of these results for intergroup help and intergroup contact literature are discussed.

AB  - The Internet's relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online.

AB  - Drawing from the literature on sexual stigma, the principal aim of this study was to investigate predictors of heterosexual's internalization of negative attitudes regarding lesbian and gay parenting and the mediating role of beliefs in the controllability of homosexuality. A Portuguese sample of 1,430 heterosexual women and 502 heterosexual men responded to an online questionnaire about attitudes toward lesbian and gay parenting. Structural equation modeling was used to explore attitudinal predictors and mediation analysis. Mediation analyses revealed that sexual prejudice toward same-gender-parented families was predicted by gender, age, education, and religiosity, in that heterosexual men, those who were older, had less education, and were more religious held significantly more negative beliefs about lesbian and gay parenting, as well as lower perception of benefits associated with lesbian and gay parenting. Further, etiological beliefs mediated the effects of gender, age, and religiosity on sexual attitudes, highlighting the importance of the perception of controllability of homosexuality in justifying sexual prejudice.

AB  - This paper examines how young people are constructed as media pirates in three Canadian newspapers during two publication periods, 1998-2000 and 2010-2012. These periods bookend copyright law modernization in the United States and Canada, represented by the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed in 1998, and the Canadian Copyright Modernization Act, passed in 2012. Drawing on a corpus of articles from The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, and the Calgary Herald as primary texts, I use critical discourse analysis and media frame analysis to argue that the discursive construction in print media of the young person as pirate reveals public attitudes toward copyright law.

AB  - We report on a study of the longitudinal effects of the 2014 World Cup on the host Brazil's overall image and for tourism intentions in three other countries (total sample = 207). Brazil's image declined significantly 2013-2014 on some but not all measures and improved amongst a significant minority. The mixed outcomes are explained by the moderating effects of respondent personality, their involvement in the event (rather than in the sport being hosted) and their perception of the news they had been exposed to. Those who held a relatively negative attitude towards Brazil before the event tended to be positively influenced by positive media, watching the closing ceremony and by searching for news about Brazil. Those relatively high in Openness to Experience were less likely to report a reduction in attitude. The net effect was an improvement in tourism intentions, mainly among those less likely to visit pre-event and a decline among most others.

AB  - Objective: Polyculturalism, a relatively new intergroup ideology conceptualises culture as dynamic by emphasising intergroup connections. Previous research has linked polyculturalism to less negative attitudes towards different racial and ethnic groups. However, the underpinnings of this relationship is not well understood. It was predicted that openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative and control) would be associated with lower racial and ethnic prejudice and that polyculturalism would mediate these relationships. Method: The sample consisted of 391 undergraduate students and community members who completed a polyculturalism measure, openness to experience and agreeableness scales of the Big Five Aspect Scale, the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, and the Australian Racism, Acceptance, and Culture-Ethnocentrism Scale. Results: Path analysis indicated openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative) were each associated with less generalised racial and ethnic prejudice, and that polyculturalism mediated the relationship between openness to experience and prejudice and cognitive flexibility- alternative and prejudice. Conclusion: Polyculturalism may be an important avenue for understanding and reducing racial and ethnic prejudice in a racially and ethnically diverse Australia. What is already known about this topic: The traits of openness to experience and agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility are associated with less negative racial and ethnic attitudes. Polyculturalism is a lay diversity ideology where culture is viewed as a dynamic and evolving system that does not provide the basis for differentiating between groups. Instead of focusing on differences between cultural groups, connections between groups through interactions are emphasised. Polyculturalism is associated with less negative attitudes towards different racial and ethnic groups among other pro-diversity attitudes. What this topic adds: This study adds to the limited research into the role of lay diversity ideologies in explaining the relationship between personality and intergroup attitudes. Openness to experience, agreeableness, and cognitive flexibility (alternative) were each associated with less generalised racial and ethnic prejudice. Polyculturalism mediated the relationship between openness to experience and racial and ethnic prejudice, and the relationship between cognitive flexibility (alternative) and racial and ethnic prejudice. The Racism Acceptance and Cultural-Ethnocentrism Scale (RACES) is a psychometrically sound measure developed for the Australian context. It is a suitable tool for measuring the effectiveness of interventions for promoting more positive intergroup attitudes.

AB  - Many people argue that support for populist radical-right political agents is motivated by people feeling "left behind" in globalized Western democracies. Empirical research supports this notion by showing that people who feel personally or collectively deprived are more likely to hold populist beliefs and anti-immigration attitudes. Our aim was to further investigate the psychological link between individuals' justice concerns and their preferences for populist radical-right political agents. We focused on stable individual differences in self-oriented and other-oriented justice concerns and argue that these should have opposing correlations with preferences for populist radical-right parties. We tested our hypotheses in two national samples, one from the United States (N = 1500) and one from Germany (N = 848). Sensitivity to injustice towards oneself enhanced the likelihood of preferring Trump (United States) and Alternative fur Deutschland (AfD) (Germany) via increased anti-immigration attitudes and increased populist attitudes. Sensitivity to injustice towards others reduced the likelihood of preferring Trump and AfD via decreased anti-immigration attitudes. We discuss our findings in regard to how stable individual differences in the evaluation of fairness can motivate intra- and interpersonal political conflicts in modern western societies and how politics and mass media can fuel these conflicts.

AB  - Here we describe the development of an evidence-based education program for adults about childhood sexual abuse (CSA), called Prevent It! Uniquely, the primary goal of this program was to change the behavior of participants, as well as to increase knowledge about CSA and positive attitudes toward it. A comprehensive review shows no previous similar approach. The program includes a detailed manual to allow standardized administration by trained facilitators, as well as multiple video segments from CSA survivors and professionals. A total of 23 program workshops were run, with 366 adults participating. Of these, 312 (85%) agreed to take part in the study. All completed baseline ratings prior to the program and 195 (63% of study sample) completed follow-up assessments at 3-months. There were no significant differences between the demographic make-up of the baseline group and the follow-up group. Assessments included demographic data, knowledge, attitudes, and several measures of behavior (our primary outcome variable). Behavioral questions asked individuals to select behaviors used in the previous 3-months from a list of options. Questions also included asking "how many times in the previous 3-months" have you "talked about healthy sexual development or Child sexual abuse (CSA) with a child you know"; "suspected a child was sexually abused"; "taken steps to protect a child"; or "reported suspected sexual abuse to police or child welfare"? The majority of attendees were women, with the commonest age group being between 30 and 39 years old. Approximately 33% had experienced CSA themselves. At 3-month follow-up there were highly statistically significant improvements in several aspects of behavior and knowledge, and attitudes regarding CSA. For example, the number of subjects actively looking for evidence of CSA increased from 46% at baseline to 81% at follow-up, while the number of subjects who actively took steps to protect children increased from 25% at baseline to 48% at follow-up. For general public adults, this is the first program designed using the current evidence base for effective training in CSA examining longer-term outcomes and the first to focus on actual behavioral outcomes. The results suggest it is highly effective and support its widespread use.

AB  - Social distancing and quarantines have major negative psychological implications. Our aim was to study the rate of pediatric hospitalizations due to anorexia nervosa (AN) during the first year of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic as compared to previous years, with regard to clinical and laboratory parameters. This is a retrospective study in a tertiary pediatric hospital in Israel. Data regarding inpatient hospitalizations due to AN were retrieved, then epidemiological, clinical, and laboratory parameters compared. During the entire study period, 275 hospitalizations were due to AN: 94 patients were admitted during the 12 months of the pandemic as compared to a yearly mean of 45.25 during 2015-2019, resulting in a 2.4-fold increase (p < 0.001). The mean admission age and female predominance were similar in the two study groups. The weight of the patients at admission was higher during the COVID-19 period (44.5 kg vs. 41.2 kg, p = 0.004), and fewer patients had clinical signs typical of AN upon physical examination (p = 0.022). There was a 35% reduction in median hospitalization duration (9 days [IQR 8.21] in 2020-2021 and 14 [IQR 6, 16.75] days in 2015-2019, p = 0.01). No other differences were found.
   Conclusions: During the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant increase in the number of adolescents hospitalized with AN. Nevertheless, disease characteristics were not more severe as compared to the preceding 5 years.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) rapidly escalated to a global pandemic. To control the rate of transmission, governments advocated that the public practice social distancing, which included staying at home. However, compliance with stay-at-home orders has varied between countries such as China and the United States, and little is known about the mechanisms underlying the national differences. Based on the health belief model, the theory of reasoned action, and the technology acceptance model, health beliefs and behavioral intention are suggested as possible explanations. A total of 498 Chinese and 292 American college students were recruited to complete an online survey. The structural equation modeling results showed that health beliefs (i.e., perceived susceptibility, severity, and barriers) and behavioral intention played multiple mediating roles in the association between nationality and actual stay-at-home behaviors. Notably, the effect via perceived barriers -> behavioral intention was stronger than the effects via perceived susceptibility and severity -> behavioral intention. That is, American participants perceived high levels of susceptibility whereas Chinese participants perceived high levels of severity, especially few barriers, which further led to increased behavioral intention and more frequent stay-at-home behaviors. These findings not only facilitate a comprehensive understanding of cross-country differences in compliance with stay-at-home orders during peaks in the COVID-19 pandemic but also lend support for mitigation of the current global crisis and future disease prevention and health promotion efforts.

AB  - Social movements often use protests and other collective actions to draw public attention to their cause, yet the psychological reactions to such actions from their targeted audience is not well understood. This research investigates uninvolved bystanders' immediate responses to collective action using a quasi-experimental field study designed around a racial justice protest that took place at a large public university in the United States. We surveyed two student samples exactly one week apart at the same time and location, first in the absence of protest and then again at the time of a racial justice protest (Total N = 240). We found that participants who believed that racism was not a problem on campus had more negative attitudes toward racial justice protests and protesters, as well as lower support for anti-racist efforts on campus on the day of the protest, compared to the day without a protest. These findings provide initial evidence that a protest encounter may trigger a backlash effect amongst those who have the most resistant attitudes toward social change.

AB  - Research on media influence on attitudes and perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent predictor of IPV, is limited. Using a convenience sample of 2057 Chinese undergraduate students, this survey explored influences of media exposure on attitudes and perceptions of IPV the first time in literature. Significant differences (p<.05) of perceptions of IPV were found between respondents who reported developing cognitions of IPV from books, magazines, or newspapers and those who didn't, with the former having better perceptions than the latter. Positive associations were also found between print-based media access and perceptions and negative attitudes concerning IPV.

AB  - This article considers the hypothesis that media-driven political interest shapes party identification, the timing of vote decisions, and electoral participation. To estimate the effect of media-driven political interest, we make a key distinction between political interest as a lifetime political orientation and political interest that rises and falls with the occurrence of noteworthy political events. We then exploit the shared media markets in Switzerland and its neighboring countries to overcome the otherwise crippling endogeneity problem and identify exogenous increases in Swiss citizens' self-reported political interest caused by the coverage of national elections in France, Germany, and Italy. We find that media-driven political interest increases the length of time individuals use to make their vote decisions, decreases partisanship, and increases self-reported and actual turnout.

AB  - Introduction: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitudes and behavior of people towards COVID-19 and to evaluate compliance with practices such as social isolation, curfews, mask use and hand hygiene. Methodology: A month after the COVID-19 infection was observed in Turkey, a standard questionnaire link was sent to participants via the online questionnaire platform to determine the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of the public. The survey results of 503 people were evaluated. Results: During the COVID-19 pandemic 81.2% of the participants stayed at home, 79.1% of the participants wore a mask, 74% of the participants expressed to be following social distancing rules, 54.1% confirmed the use of hand sanitizers and 43.9% confirmed the use of gloves (43.9%), which are considered to be personal protective measures. The knowledge of terms such as 'quarantine' and 'isolation' was 94% and 97.4% respectively and 37.2% of the participants were of the opinion that the COVID-19 virus was produced in a laboratory environment. Within the research group, a rate of 65.6% of the participants found their own knowledge of COVID-19 to be sufficient. The participants found the announcements of official institutions more reliable than the announcements on television programs, the internet and social media. Conclusions: The public information on COVID-19 was found to be sufficient. In order to prevent the spreading of the pandemic, participants were partially compliant to rules such as staying at home, using masks, maintaining hand hygiene and social isolation. Compared to men, women's use of protective equipment was higher.

AB  - Aim: Coronavirus infection has caused disease at the pandemic level with several deaths worldwide and affected all aspects of human life. One way to minimize virus transmission and its effects is to perform mass vaccination within the general population so that herd immunity is developed against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, low health literacy and vaccine hesitancy are potential threats in achieving this. The present study is designed to measure the Knowledge, Attitude, and Perception levels towards COVID-19 and assess public perception and acceptance levels of the vaccine among the general population in the Hail province of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A bilingual, community-based questionnaire, consisting of the respondents' socio-demographic profile, COVID-19 knowledge, and attitude & perception towards COVID-19 vaccination, was circulated using different social media platforms. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS software.
   Results: Appropriate knowledge level was found in 74.8% of the respondents, whereas inappropriate knowledge levels were observed in females and participants with non-health-related occupations and were inversely related to willingness to the vaccine. More than 60% of the respondents had a negative attitude towards the COVID-19 vaccine, as only 51% were willing to get vaccinated. A negative attitude was significantly associated with female respondents.
   Conclusion: Our study reports a high knowledge level among the respondents in the Hail province. However, there is also a decreased willingness to be vaccinated, suggesting that more vaccine and health literacy seminars should be conducted to generate awareness among the general population in the Hail province, KSA.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures have limited outdoor activities for many people, including university students who live inside the campus and far from their families. We investigated if and how the fear of COVID-19 had impacted visiting green areas and consequently the quality of life.
   Methods: The assessments were taken through a questionnaire-based survey of the university students living inside the campus in two universities (Konkuk and Sejong universities) in Seoul, South Korea in 2021 (n=255). Measuring three variables, the participants were asked to self-estimate their fear of COVID-19 and quality of life during the pandemic, and the time and frequency of the park visit. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were conducted to explore the potential relationship between the three main observed variables.
   Results: In the case of the campus students, visiting the green area cannot play a mediating impact on the effect of the COVID-19 fear and quality of life. Likewise, the data did not support the effect of COVID-19 fear on the quality of life for this group of students, however, significant correlations were found between the COVID-19 fear and visiting green spaces (P<0.05) (positive effect on visiting, and negative effect on the time of visit).
   Conclusion: Students perceived not a considerable improvement in their quality of life after visiting green areas. It might be due to the fear of staying outdoor for a long time (frequency) during the pandemic, and students' lifestyles. However, the quality of life for the students is likely to be influenced by other factors, rather than the fear of COVID-19.

AB  - The recent spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SAR-CoV-2) and the accompanied coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued ceaselessly despite the implementations of popular measures, which include social distancing and outdoor face masking as recommended by the World Health Organization. Due to the unstable nature of the virus, leading to the emergence of new variants that are claimed to be more and rapidly transmissible, there is a need for further consideration of the alternative potential pathways of the virus transmissions to provide the needed and effective control measures. This review aims to address this important issue by examining the transmission pathways of SARS-CoV-2 via indirect contacts such as fomites and aerosols, extending to water, food, and other environmental compartments. This is essentially required to shed more light regarding the speculation of the virus spread through these media as the available information regarding this is fragmented in the literature. The existing state of the information on the presence and persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in water-food-environmental compartments is essential for cause-and-effect relationships of human interactions and environmental samples to safeguard the possible transmission and associated risks through these media. Furthermore, the integration of effective remedial measures previously used to tackle the viral outbreaks and pandemics, and the development of new sustainable measures targeting at monitoring and curbing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 were emphasized. This study concluded that alternative transmission pathways via human interactions with environmental samples should not be ignored due to the evolving of more infectious and transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how a crisis affects public attitudes toward stigmatized service workers (SSWs) who are blamed by the media for the event.
   Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses grounded in two theories, crisis communication and empathic concern, are tested using two experimental design studies of 180 and 107 adult respondents.
   Findings - The effects of both empathy (positive) and anger (negative) on attitudes toward the SSWs involved in crisis are mediated by controllability of attribution of crisis. Empathic concern mitigates negative public attitudes toward stigmatized workers and appears to remove the effect of anger but only when the crisis severity is not too high. In a severe crisis both empathy and anger are important predictors of public response.
   Research limitations/implications - Boundary conditions in terms of severity, nature and victim of crisis and media framing need to be investigated.
   Practical implications - Proactive crisis management practice is required by professional associations of SSW. Eliciting empathy and paying attention to prior crisis history and professional reputation offers scope to quell public anger and desire for punishment.
   Social implications - The attrition rates of socially stigmatized workers following crisis events have profound social and financial costs to society. This study sets a foundation for substantive managerial change in crisis response, and how the perception of socially stigmatized workers, is managed.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to examine the voracity of two theories which provide informed but different insights to public response to service workers in crisis.

AB  - Lesbian, gay, bisexual, and queer (LGBQ) youth continue to be disproportionately at risk for depression.
   COVID-19 social distancing, LGBQ youth who live with family may be more consistently exposed to potentially discriminatory family situations, and may receive reduced community and mental health support. However, the Internet offers opportunities to interact with lesbian. gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities by watching videos of. and developing one-way relationships-or parasocial relationships-with. LGBTQ media personalities on platforms such as YouTube. The current study explored how parasocial relationships with LGBTQ YouTubers may moderate the links between family support, loneliness, and depression symptoms among LGBQ emerging adults living with their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 183 LGBQ emerging adults (age 18-23) was recruited from the United States in mid-July 2020. Results of a moderated mediation regression indicated that parasocial relationship strength moderated the links between family support and loneliness, and loneliness and depression symptoms. The associations between family support and loneliness, and between loneliness and depression symptoms, were weakened by high parasocial relationship strength. These findings contribute to understanding parasocial relationships' connections to well-being among marginalized groups during a crisis and highlight the potential of online solutions to emerging mental health disparities being experienced by LGBQ youth disproportionally affected by the COVID- 19 pandemic.
   Public Significance Statement
   Parasocial relationships are one-way relationships with media personalities that may have associations with well-being for socially marginalized groups. In our study, high parasocial relationship strength weakened the associations between family support and loneliness, and between loneliness and depression, among LGBQ emerging adults living with their parents during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Aims
   To determine the prevalence, level of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) risk perception attitude and preventive behavior implemented by the Latino population in the United States of America (USA).
   Methods
   This cross-sectional study was conducted between July 25 and August 25, 2020, and included asymptomatic Latino participants (n=410) with no current/previous COVID-19 within a religious community in Maryland. Participants answered a questionnaire consisting of three components: patient demographics/socioeconomic status, COVID-19 risk perception, and precautionary behavior. Additionally, a focused history taking and physical examination were performed, and nasal swabs for COVID-19 testing were obtained.
   Results
   Around 80% of our study population was 35 years and older, considerably healthy, with only about a third reporting history of chronic disease (similar to 80%); most were females (similar to 66%). Of our participants, 90% lived under poverty; only similar to 6% had made it to college. When asked about the likelihood of acquiring COVID-19, 97.3% stated they have a low risk of getting infected. However, as we asked about the risk of individuals living in their neighborhood, state, and country, the rates changed to moderate to high (78.4%, 86.3%, and 86.6%, respectively). When asked about preventive behavior, 71.2% stated they never wear masks and 85.4% mentioned they never keep social distance. Additionally, 76 (18.5%) tested positive for COVID-19, whereas 64 (84.2%) developed symptoms at follow-up, 57 (75%) were hospitalized, and 4 (5.2%) died.
   Conclusions
   Our study identified inadequate COVID-19 threat perception and lack of engagement in preventive behavior among a group of Latinos living in the USA. We believe that Latino communities across the USA are at markedly high risk of acquiring, spreading, and dying of COVID-19.

AB  - Objectives There is preliminary evidence of racial and social economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States. Methods We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts). Results The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing. Conclusion Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.

AB  - This article utilizes data from the Latino National Survey (2006) to analyze temporal and spatial variation in the effects of the immigrant rights marches in 2006 on Latino attitudes towards trust in government and self-efficacy. Using a unique protest dataset, we examine the effects of proximity and scale by mapping respondents' specific geographic location against the location of the marches as well as size of the protests using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We find that local proximity to small marches had a positive impact on feelings of efficacy, whereas large-scale protests led to lower feelings of efficacy. The results shed light on the role localized political events can play in shaping feelings towards government, the importance of conceptions of space and time to the study of social movements, and the positive outcomes that can result from contentious politics.

AB  - The present research investigated whether an intervention designed to increase the consumption of fruits and vegetables (FVs) would elicit reactance and explored the consequences of reactance. Eighty-four students were randomized to one of two intervention groups or a control group. During the 1-week intervention, which was accompanied by a food diary, the 5aday-group had to eat 5 portions of FVs per day, the just1more group had to eat 1 more portion of FVs than usual, and the control group had to eat as usual. Both intervention groups reported higher reactance than the control group immediately after the intervention (T2) and still 1 week later (T3) with high effect sizes. Trait-reactance had no effect on any of the study variables. Intervention-elicited reactance was associated with a lower FV intake at follow-up (T4), and this association was mediated by a more negative attitude toward eating 5aday assessed 1 week after the intervention (T3).

AB  - Survey studies have consistently shown strong public support for biodiversity conservation, even though conservation regulations often face strong local resistance when they are implemented. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon is due to the fact that previous polls have sought opinion only in the abstract, yet many conservation measures are implemented at the expense of local economic development, and policymakers often face a 'Conservation-Development Tradeoff' -a policy dilemma that remains understudied by social scientists. To fill this gap, this study conducts one of the first comparative surveys on public support for biodiversity conservation in China and the United States. I measure public support for conservation using two separate question versions online. The 'regular version' asks directly about individual support for biodiversity conservation, and the "tradeoff version" asks the same question but in the context of the policy tradeoff. The results show that both American and Chinese citizens are highly supportive of conservation in the abstract. But after they learn about the tradeoff effect, the aggregate support falls sharply, and the Chinese citizens show significantly less support compared to their American counterparts. The survey findings expanded on existing academic research on public attitudes toward conservation policies and can encourage future conservation policymakers to understand the significance of the tradeoff issue, as conventional wisdom may have overestimated public support for biodiversity conservation. Moreover, as China has become a crucial player in global conservation governance, understanding the Chinese public sentiment on the real-world policy dilemma can have important implications for conservation policymaking in the world.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted all aspects of modern-day oncology, including how stakeholders communicate through social media. We surveyed oncology stakeholders in order to assess their attitudes pertaining to social media and how it has been affected during the pandemic.
   Materials and methods: A 40-item survey was distributed to stakeholders from 8 July to 22 July 2020 and was promoted through the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and the OncoAlert Network.
   Results: One thousand and seventy-six physicians and stakeholders took part in the survey. In total, 57.3% of respondents were medical oncologists, 50.6% aged <40 years, 50.8% of female gender and mostly practicing in Europe (51.5%). More than 90% of respondents considered social media a useful tool for distributing scientific information and for education. Most used social media to stay up to date on cancer care in general (62.5%) and cancer care during COVID-19 (61%) given the constant flow of information. Respondents also used social media to interact with other oncologists (78.8%) and with patients (34.4%). Overall, 61.1% of respondents were satisfied with the role that social media was playing during the COVID-19 pandemic. On the other hand, 41.1% of respondents reported trouble in discriminating between credible and less credible information and 30% stated social networks were a source of stress. For this reason, one-third of respondents reduced its use during the COVID-19 pandemic. Regarding meeting attendance, a total of 59.1% of responding physicians preferred in-person meetings to virtual ones, and 51.8% agreed that virtual meetings and social distancing could hamper effective collaboration.
   Conclusion: Social media has a useful role in supporting cancer care and professional engagement in oncology. Although one-third of respondents reported reduced use of social media due to stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, the majority found social media useful to keep up to date and were satisfied with the role social media was playing during the pandemic.

AB  - Objective. The COVID-19 pandemic emergency forced the health system in Italy to imple-ment an immediate reorganisation to support the care of tens of thousands of patients and to maintain the quality of care for patients with other pathologies, such as oncologic diseases. The main goal of this study was to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 restrictions on the hospitalisation and post-operative rehabilitation of head and neck oncologic patients and to determine whether the introduction of new technologies such as video-communication may be useful to mitigate social distancing by close family members. Methods. Fifty-one consecutive patients underwent surgery for head and neck cancer dur -ing the period of lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The data collected (post-operative pain, post-operative complications, duration of hospitalisation) were compared with those of 51 consecutive patients treated for head and neck cancer in the period im-mediately preceding lockdown. Results. The average duration of hospitalisation was longer in patients operated on in the COVID-19 period, and, in particular, among patients who underwent a more demanding rehabilitation protocol. Despite this, our study did not show a significant difference in psy-chological aspects during hospitalisation. Conclusions. The greatest difficulties that occurred in the COVID-19 period were met by a greater commitment from medical staff, allowing the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients during post-operative rehabilitation to be maintained at a similar level to that before the pandemic. In the future, there will be a need for technological solutions to bring the patient closer to family members.

AB  - Aims One of the ways to manage the current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is to monitor the public knowledge, risk perceptions, adherence to preventive measures, and level of preparedness behaviors. This is important in resource-limited countries. This study determined the knowledge and perception regarding COVID-19; adherence to COVID-19 preventive measures; as well as predictors of self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 among Nigerian adults.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among Nigerian adults >= 18 years using an online survey. A convenience sampling method was utilized to recruit a total of 1022 study participants. The participants were recruited using the authors' social media networks. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics at a 5% level of statistical significance.
   Results Generally, a high proportion of respondents had correct knowledge about COVID-19. However, only approximately half (49.8% and 49.9%) had correct knowledge that obesity was a risk factor for COVID-19 and that antibiotics cannot be used to treat COVID-19. Most (84.1%) did not have a self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19. Most (81.0%) have been avoiding crowded places and 61.3% washed their hands frequently. Predictors of self-perceived risk of COVID-19 were age 40-59 years (OR 2.05, CI 1.217-3.435), >= 60 years (OR 4.68, CI 1.888-11.583), and visiting crowded places (OR 2.27, CI 1.499-3.448).
   Conclusion Our study recommends more rigorous public health education aimed at improving COVID-19 outbreak response in Nigeria. In addition, physical and social distancing should be emphasized across all age groups with additional focus on the older population.

AB  - This article tries to explain the differences in COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) in 22 European countries by their type of organization and performance level of their healthcare systems. The CFR is taken here as the most important indicator since it measures the ratio between COVID deaths and COVID cases. In our view, this indicator reflects the true performance of the healthcare system, as this indicator is freed form public health interventions, like testing, lockdowns or social distancing.
   Our research is also unique, because it sees the healthcare system in a holistic way and tries to explain the CFR not by individual risk factors, socioeconomic indicators, or partial system parameters, but by using a complex healthcare system classification method adopted from Isabelle Joumard and an overall healthcare system performance index adopted from European Health Consumer Index (EHCI).
   The main results are twofold. First, higher EHCI score is related to lower CFR. So, the countries are cumulated basically in two quadrants: High EHCI performers (score 790 and higher) with low CFR (below 1.93%) and low EHCI performers with high COVID CFR. Second, apart from Czech Republic, the V4 countries are not doing very well in fighting COVID. Hungary is the worst, not only from the V4 group, but the worst from the whole list of 22 European countries included in this research. Poland is doing better, but still is high above the median CFR. Slovakia was the second worst from the V4 group. Czech Republic is the best V4 performer and the only country with EHCI score lower than median and CFR also lower than the median.

AB  - Purpose To establish a transborder virtual tumor board (VTB) fostering state-of-the-art management of cancer patients by exchanging knowledge and expertise among oncologists in Central and Southeastern Europe (CEE). Methods We established and implemented a VTB based on the WebEx platform. This allowed for password-protected and secure upload of patient cases to be presented and discussed among colleagues from various oncology centers scattered throughout CEE in order to arrive at a recommendation for further diagnoses and/or treatment. Results A total of 73 cases from 16 oncology centers located in 11 CEE countries were uploaded by 22 physicians; 71 were discussed over the course of 17 virtual meetings between June 2018 and May 2019 and 12 different kinds of malignant diseases were discussed with lung cancer (46.6%), melanoma (19.2%) and bladder cancer (13.6%) being the most commonly presented tumor entities. Of the discussed patients, 93.3% had stage IV disease at the time of presentation, 62.6% received chemotherapy or targeted treatment and 67.1% were treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPIs). The most common causes for presentation and discussion of patient cases were related to the use of ICPIs (80%). Conclusion When the need for expertise exceeds locally available resources, web-based VTBs provide a feasible way to discuss patient cases and arrive at conclusions regarding diagnoses and/or treatment across large geographic distances. Moreover, VTBs provide an innovative way for proper, state-of-the-art management of patients with malignant diseases in times of social distancing and the resulting need for restricted interaction during the current SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2) pandemic.

AB  - In the last 10 years, emotional intelligence (EI) has become a current issue of research in psychology, and there are indicators to consider that EI should be analyzed to help the coach to behave effectively during competitions. According to Boardley's (2018) revised model of coaching efficacy, coaches' EI is predictive of their efficacy beliefs, which, in turn, is predictive of coaching behavior. However, little is known about the mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationships between coach's EI and reactive behaviors in competitive settings. Thus, the purpose of this study is to examine mediating effects of coaching efficacy dimensions on the relationship between EI and coaches' reactive behaviors during a game using a multimethod approach. Participants were 258 coaches of youth football players aged 9 to 17 years old. Observations in situ using Coaching Behavior Assessment System (CBAS) were carried on 258 football games during two seasons. At the end of each game, coaches completed the Wong and Law Emotional Intelligence Scale (WLEIS) and the Coaching Efficacy Scale (CES). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analyses revealed that motivation efficacy and character building mediated the relationship between regulation of emotion and positive and negative coaches' reactions during game. Specifically, motivation efficacy mediated the association between regulation of emotion and positive coaches' reactions, and the relationship between regulation of emotion and negative coaches' reactions were mediated by motivation efficacy and character building. In addition, coaching level moderated the relationships between EI, self-efficacy and coaches' reactive behaviors. Findings of the present study showed that coaching efficacy dimensions (i.e., motivation efficacy and character building) that have the capacity to influence their confidence in ability to affect the psychological mood and positive attitude of athletes, transfer the effects of EI (i.e., regulation of emotion) on coaches' verbal reactions during a youth soccer game. Specifically, a coach who feels competent to regulate their own emotions would perceive high beliefs of efficacy to motivate and to build character of their athletes, and this insight has an impact on their positive verbal reactions in response to athletes' performances.

AB  - In this article, we share our experiences in designing and developing a suite of deep neural network-(DNN) based COVID-19 case detection and recognition framework. Existing pathological tests such as RT-PCR-based pathogen RNA detection from nasal swabbing seem to display low detection rates during the early stages of virus contraction. Moreover, the reliance on a few overburdened laboratories based around an epicenter capable of supplying large numbers of RT-PCR tests makes this testing method non-scalable when the rate of infections is high. Similarly, finding an effective drug or vaccine with which to combat COVID-19 requires a long time and many clinical trials. The development of pathological COVID-19 tests is hindered by shortages in the supply chain of chemical reagents necessary for testing on a large scale. This diminishes the speed of diagnosis and the ability to filter out COVID-19 positive patients from uninfected patients on a national level. Existing research has shown that DNN has been successful in identifying COVID-19 from radiological media such as CT scans and X-ray images, audio media such as cough sounds, optical coherence tomography to identify conjunctivitis and pink eye symptoms on the ocular surface, body temperature measurement using smartphone fingerprint sensors or thermal cameras, the use of live facial detection to identify safe social distancing practices from camera images, and face mask detection from camera images. We also investigate the utility of federated learning in diagnosis cases where private data can be trained via edge learning. These point-of-care modalities can be integrated with DNN-based RT-PCR laboratory test results to assimilate multiple modalities of COVID-19 detection and thereby provide more dimensions of diagnosis. Finally, we will present our initial test results, which are encouraging.

AB  - As governments take measures against COVID-19, the epidemic situation is expected to improve, but public sentiment is likely to fluctuate during this process, potentially influencing the best course of action. Social media has become a prevalent way for the public to express emotions and opinions in recent times. So that, the sentiment analysis on top of it may detect and provide valuable evidence of public attitude and help governments subsequent formulation of measures and policies. We present Senti-COVID19, an interactive visual analytic system for reflecting and analyzing public sentiment and detecting sentiment fluctuation triggers on social media. Senti-COVID19 adopts lexicon-based sentiment analysis to divulge the public opinion to COVID-19 events, employing libraries to extract keywords and statistics for providing detailed information. In addition, it offers visualizations for presenting the analysis, allowing users to quickly discover relevant information. Our results show that Senti-COVID19 can be used effectively to analyze sentiment from social media text, allowing users to explore derived data and identify insights from the collected tweets.

AB  - It is hardly an exaggeration to claim that one of the most turbulent political areas in recent years has been asylum policy, which has disclosed a rapidly increasing inflow of asylum seekers, and, in many countries, has been followed by fierce media discussion and political controversies. In Sweden, this development has been heated as the Swedish self-image is one of providing generous policies, which is also reflected in terms of strong refugee policy. The article uses this example to explore assumptions about public responsiveness in previous policy feedback literature and to examine the link between citizens' attitudes towards immigration and changes in asylum policy output, measured as asylums granted, over time in the period 1990-2015. It focuses especially on the link through which citizens become aware of policy output, operationalized as media visualization, and find that including media reveals a suppressed relationship between policy output and public attitudes. The relationship is negative and thus confirms the assumptions of the thermostatic models. Second, the article shows that feedback is mediated by political orientation: People defining themselves politically as right-oriented respond with negative feedback when the number of granted asylums increases, while left-oriented people do not change their attitudes. Based on these findings it is concluded, first, that analyses of democratic responsiveness need to incorporate a clear measure of the link by which exogenous factors become visible. Second, the importance needs to be stressed of considering important cleavages in the population in order to display responsiveness processes fairly.

AB  - The media represents one of the main sources of public information about sexual offending. However, the media sensationalises sexual crimes through its focus on exceptional cases, contributing to an inaccurate representation of the population of individuals convicted of sexual offences. The resulting negative community attitudes towards released sex offenders may create barriers to community re-entry and promote ill-informed legislation. The aim of the current study was to explore whether informative reporting of sexual offending might result in less negative public attitudes towards released sex offenders. Eighty-seven participants were presented either with an informative media portrayal of a recently released sex offender, a fear-inducing, typical portrayal or no media portrayal (control condition). We measured three components of participants' attitudes (affect, cognitive beliefs and behavioural intensions) towards sex offenders, in addition to participants' non-conscious, implicit, attitudes. The results showed that the informative media portrayal significantly influenced the cognitive and behavioural components of attitudes; however, the affective component and implicit attitudes remained consistently negative. Our findings suggest that the media may play an influential role in influencing public opinion about sex offenders. The potential, and the challenges, for using media to influence public attitudes towards sex offenders are discussed.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) represents a massive global health crisis leading to different reactions in people. Those reactions may be adaptive or not depending on situational or psychological processes. Disordered eating attitudes and behaviors are likely to be exacerbated by the pandemic through multiple pathways as suggested by Rodgers et al. (2020). Among the psychological variables that may have increased dysfunctional eating attitudes and behaviors as a consequence of the social distancing and isolation, we looked at perfectionism. Perfectionism is a well-recognized risk and maintaining factor of eating-related symptoms and interact with stress increasing the probability of dysfunctional reactions (e.g., Wang and Li, 2017). The present study investigated the relationship between multidimensional perfectionism and eating behaviors by considering the mediating role of psychological distress. Data were collected from two countries (Italy and Spain) by means of an online survey. The samples included 465 (63.4% female) participants from Italy and 352 (68.5% female) from Spain. Participants completed the short form of the Hewitt and Flett Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale (Lombardo et al., 2021) to assess self-oriented, other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism, as well as the short form of Three Factors Eating Questionnaire (Karlsson et al., 2000) and the Italian version of Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (Bottesi et al., 2015), respectively used to assess restrictive, emotional and uncontrolled eating on one hand, and depression, anxiety and stress on the other. Multigroup analysis was performed to test the hypothesized model. Results showed that other-oriented and socially prescribed perfectionism were indirectly related to most of the dysfunctional eating aspects through the mediation of psychological distress, and the pattern obtained was consistent in both countries. These findings evidence that the psychological distress potentially related to the COVID-19 disease mediates the negative impact of interpersonal perfectionism and the tendency to eat in response to negative emotions.

AB  - We exploit a natural experiment related to the German re-unification to address whether disutility from income comparisons affects attitudes towards foreigners. Our empirical approach rests upon East German individuals with West German relatives and friends. We use the exogenous variation of wealth of West Germans shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall as an instrument to identify the effect of disutility from income comparisons on East Germans' attitudes. We find robust evidence that East Germans express more negative attitudes towards foreigners, particularly from low-wage countries, if they worry about their economic status compared to better-off West Germans.

AB  - Purpose Scientific knowledge has been a topic of interest for scholars for a long time; however, its impact on scientific decision- making and determining trust is severely underresearched. This study is aimed at determining the relationship between cultural and social attitudes and scientific knowledge and the impact of knowledge on trust in scientists in general. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a face-to-face survey, drawing from a nationally representative sample of the adult Serbian population (N = 1,451). The authors tested the following parameters: a. the levels of scientific knowledge within the Serbian population; b. social and cultural values as predictors of scientific knowledge and c. the effects of scientific knowledge on trust in scientists. Findings The analysis shows a moderate level of scientific knowledge, predominantly positive public attitudes towards scientists. The authors found that scientific knowledge indeed predicts trust in scientists on various issues, and so do cultural and social worldviews, both directly and even more significantly through the mediation of scientific knowledge. Originality/value This is the first attempt to assess the level of scientific knowledge among the Serbian public and evaluate its, as well as other factors', influence on public attitudes toward scientists in a time when trusting experts is of great relevance.

AB  - Background: the need for social distancing midst the COVID-19 pandemic has forced ophthalmologists to innovate with telemedicine. The novel process of triaging emergency ophthalmology patients via videoconsultations should reduce hospital attendances. However, the safety profile of such services were unknown.
   Methods: in this retrospective cohort study, we reviewed case notes of 404 adults who used our videoconsultation service from 20/04/2020 to 03/05/2020. We compared these to 451 patient who attended eye casualty in person at the same time who were deemed not to require same day ophthalmic examination.
   Findings: patients seen by videoconsultations tended to be younger (Median = 43 years, Inter-quartile range = 27 vs Median= 49 years, Inter-quartile range = 28)'. More males used the face- to-face triage (55%) while more females used videoconsultation (54%)%. Fewer patients seen by videoconsultations required specialist review compared to face- face triage [X-2 (1, N = 854) = 128.02, p<0.001)]. 35.5% of the patients initially seen by videoconsultation had unplanned reattendance within 1 month, compared to 15.7% in the group initially seen in person. X-2 (1, N = 234) = 7.31, p = 0.007). The rate of actual harm was no different (at 0% for each method), with perfect inter-grader correlation when graded independently by two senior ophthalmologists. 97% of patients seen on the video platform surveyed were satisfied with their care.
   Interpretation: we demonstrate comparable patient safety of videoconsultations at one-month follow-up to in person review. The service is acceptable to patients and reduces the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We propose that videoconsultations are effective and desirable as a tool for triage in ophthalmology.

AB  - This article examines Chinese perspectives of, and support for propaganda, relying on television public service advertisements as a means of tapping into citizens' beliefs. Through the analysis of data from focus groups conducted in Beijing and public opinion survey data from 30 cities, this study argues that Chinese people are generally supportive of state efforts to guide public attitudes through television advertisements, although levels of support vary by age, education and gender. The study suggests that considerable popular support for state propaganda contributes to the regime's capacity to guide public opinion and helps to explain the persistence of popular support for authoritarian rule.

AB  - A cursory look at Indian prime-time news tells us much about the tone and tenor of the people associated with it. Exaggerations, hyperbole, and tempers run wild, and news anchors flail in theatrical rage. News channels and news editors display their ideological affiliations subliminally. These affiliationsa factor of personal political stances, funding bodies, and investorslead to partisan bias in the framing of news and, in some cases, can easily translate into racial prejudice. In this paper, I examine news coverage related to Muslims in India. I study the coverage of two issues specificallylove jihad and triple talaqin prime-time English news of two channels: Times Now and Republic TV. Love jihad is a term used to describe alleged campaigns carried out by Muslim men targeting non-Muslim women for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Triple talaq is a form of divorce that has been interpreted to allow Muslim men to legally divorce their wives by stating the word talaq three times. My analysis of the content, tone, and tenor of their coverage shows that these channels propagate associations between Islam and backwardness, ignorance, and violence through consistent employment of the following tropes: Muslim women need to be saved from Muslim men; Hindu women need to be saved from Muslim men; and, Muslims are not fully Indianthey are anti-national. I place this study of news media within the current political climate in India and briefly touch on the conversations it guides and provokes. This is a first step in detailing a problem. It is also a call for further analysis on this subject to examine and evaluate if and how discourse manipulates public conversations and policy decisions.

AB  - The current study investigated the quality of media coverage on issues regarding people with disabilities in Jordan from the perspectives of journalists and special education teachers. Although Jordan has adopted legislation to support and protect people with disabilities, people with disabilities are three times more likely to be illiterate & half as likely to be employed. Although physical accessibility creates some barriers, negative attitudes and stigma are major barriers. Since media can play a significant role in attitudes towards people with disabilities, this study surveyed journalists' and special education teachers' perceptions of the quality of media coverage in Jordan. Using convenience sampling, 160 journalists and 208 special education teachers from Amman and Irbid cities participated in the study by completing self-administered paper-and-pencil questionnaires. Results indicate that, overall, journalists and special education teachers felt the quality of media coverage for issues related to people with disabilities in Jordan was acceptable (but not good or excellent), although journalists were statistically significantly more likely to rate the quality of coverage was better than the rating provided by special education teachers.

AB  - During COVID-19, misinformation on social media has affected people's adoption of appropriate prevention behaviors. Although an array of approaches have been proposed to suppress misinformation, few have investigated the role of disseminating factual information during crises. None has examined its effect on suppressing misinformation quantitatively using longitudinal social media data. Therefore, this study investigates the temporal correlations between factual information and misinformation, and intends to answer whether previously predominant factual information can suppress misinformation. It focuses on two prevention measures, that is, wearing masks and social distancing, using tweets collected from April 3 to June 30, 2020, in the United States. We trained support vector machine classifiers to retrieve relevant tweets and classify tweets containing factual information and misinformation for each topic concerning the prevention measures' effects. Based on cross-correlation analyses of factual and misinformation time series for both topics, we find that the previously predominant factual information leads the decrease of misinformation (i.e., suppression) with a time lag. The research findings provide empirical understandings of dynamic relations between misinformation and factual information in complex online environments and suggest practical strategies for future misinformation management during crises and emergencies.

AB  - In his 2004 presidential campaign, John Kerry, a Catholic, was threatened with being denied Holy Communion because of his pro-choice voting record. This article investigates the extent to which communion denial impacted Catholic elected officials and analyzes public attitudes regarding communion denial for Kerry. The results of our analysis suggest that, despite heavy media coverage, few bishops endorsed the communion denial and few pro-choice Catholic officials were threatened. While the data also indicate there are meaningful political implications for public attitudes on communion denial, the tactic does not command support from many Catholics.

AB  - Despite being rated as some of the world's most gender equal countries, Sweden and neighboring Nordic nations show high rates of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). As the news media contribute to the shaping of public attitudes, this article pursues a two-step discourse analysis of how IPVAW was represented in seven Swedish newspapers during 2018. Although an individualistic discourse on IPVAW was found to be most prevalent, articles where perpetrators were presented as non-Swedish more frequently contained a structural framing of IPVAW. This confirms previously noted tendencies toward individualization and othering of IPVAW in Sweden.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic led to stay-at-home mandates and lockdowns around the globe. During this time of occupational disruption and social distancing measures, many engaged through online environments. Social media are ever-increasing hosts of occupation and participation, rich with research opportunities. In this study, we explored COVID-19 experiences by analyzing parody videos posted on YouTube by various content creators. We analyzed the lyrics of 27 viral videos (accrued 1 million or more views) by 20 content creators. Using a transactional framework, we identified five themes related to occupational disruption in the lyrics and explored the polarity of the concepts within each theme: old norms vs. new normal, time expanded vs. time condensed, control seeking vs. lack of control, social isolation vs. excess socialization, and cynicism vs. hope. Our findings demonstrated the complex transactions between previous habits and routines, changing spaces of occupation, and meaning of daily occupations within evolving social, economic, and physical contexts. While this study showcased YouTube videos as one untapped source of contextualized knowledge for occupational science, there is a need for further exploration of methodological and ethical challenges of studying digital content.

AB  - As in many other countries worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic prompted the implementation of an "intelligent lockdown" in the spring of 2020 in the Netherlands, including the closure of nightlife venues and cancellation of festivals. Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16-24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to "pre-corona," but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering "post-corona" consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field.

AB  - The pandemic caused by the COVID 19 Virus creates an unprecedented situation of global confinement altering the development of competition and sports training at all levels of participation and in all sports, including rhythmic gymnastics (RG). To avoid possible effects of physical, technical and psychological detraining, coaches looked for home training alternatives. The objectives of the study were to know how rhythmic gymnastics training developed during the lockdown period (the conditions, type of training, performance monitoring means, and determinants of gymnasts' participation) and to provide recommendations for a possible future lockdown. Three hundred and two RG coaches from twenty-six different countries throughout the five continents and four professional levels took part in the study: national team (28), international (26), national (172) and regional (75). The data collection tool was a questionnaire consisting of 39 closed questions structured in three dimensions: identification data of the coaches, training data during confinement and gymnast participation data. The independent variable was the gymnasts' performance levels and the dependent variables organized in four categories: the technical media used to conduct and monitor the training sessions, the type of training done, the mechanisms for monitoring training performance and the aspects that determined participation. Most coaches kept their gymnasts training during confinement, although 76.5% confirm abandonment of any of their gymnasts. The main means used were real-time video conferencing, although at the lower practice levels the media stand out in deferred time. The contents of the training were mainly body technique, physical preparation and body difficulties. For performance monitoring, challenges, physical, and technical tests were predominant. The determinants for the development of training in the confinement vary depending on the level of the gymnasts, connectivity and electronic resources at the highest level, and the availability of spaces and social distancing at lower levels. For future lockdowns, it is necessary to review the content of the trainings, as well as the performance evaluation and the means necessary for it.

AB  - Medical IoT devices are rapidly becoming part of management ecosystems for pandemics such as COVID-19. Existing research shows that deep learning (DL) algorithms have been successfully used by researchers to identify COVID-19 phenomena from raw data obtained from medical IoT devices. Some examples of IoT technology are radiological media, such as CT scanning and X-ray images, body temperature measurement using thermal cameras, safe social distancing identification using live face detection, and face mask detection from camera images. However, researchers have identified several security vulnerabilities in DL algorithms to adversarial perturbations. In this article, we have tested a number of COVID-19 diagnostic methods that rely on DL algorithms with relevant adversarial examples (AEs). Our test results show that DL models that do not consider defensive models against adversarial perturbations remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks. Finally, we present in detail the AE generation process, implementation of the attack model, and the perturbations of the existing DL-based COVID-19 diagnostic applications. We hope that this work will raise awareness of adversarial attacks and encourages others to safeguard DL models from attacks on healthcare systems.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research investigating the resuscitation and management of unstable trauma patients is necessary to improve care and save lives. Because informed consent for research is impossible in emergencies, the Federal Drug Administration has established an Exception from Informed Consent (EFIC) Policy that mandates "community consultation'' as a means of protecting patient autonomy. We hypothesized that the traumacommunity represents a heterogeneous population whose attitudes regarding EFIC and willingness to participate in emergency research are influenced by status as a patient, family, or geographic community member.
   METHODS: In the context of an upcoming trial, trauma patients as well as family and community members were asked to rank statements regarding EFIC and willingness to participate in emergency research using a 5-point Likert-type scale. Higher total scores reflected a more positive attitude regarding EFIC (range, 4-20; neutral = 12) and willingness (range, 21-105, neutral = 63). The influence of demographics, education, and interpersonal violence were evaluated by Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U-tests (p < 0.05).
   RESULTS: Overall, the 309 participants (trauma patients, n = 172; family, n = 73; community, n = 64) were positive about EFIC (median, 16; interquartile range, [IQR], 14-18) and demonstrated high willingness scores (median, 82; IQR, 76-88.5). EFIC and willingness were not influenced by age, sex, race, or education. Victims of interpersonal violence and their family members had lower EFIC scores than those with other mechanisms (median [IQR], 16 [14-18] vs. 16 [13-16]; p = 0.04) but similar willingness. Although EFIC scores were similar between groups, trauma patients had significantly lower willingness than family (median [IQR], 74 [68-77] vs. 77 [70-85]; p = 0.03) or community members (median [IQR], 76 [70-84]; p = 0.01).
   CONCLUSION: Trauma patients, families, and the geographic community expressed a high degree of support for EFIC and willingness to participate in emergency research, although support was influenced by injury mechanism and group status. Consultation efforts for emergency research should extend beyond the geographic community to include trauma victims and their families. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2013;74: 157-166.

AB  - This study assesses the relationship between political partisanship and attitudes and behavior with respect to the H1N1 virus (swine flu) crisis of 2009 in general, and the U. S. mass vaccination program in particular. I argue that even seemingly nonpartisan political issues like public health are increasingly characterized by partisan polarization in public attitudes and that such polarization is attributable, at least partly, to the breakdown of the information commons that characterized the U. S. mass media from roughly the 1950s until the early 1990s. In its place has arisen an increasingly fragmented and niche-oriented media marketplace in which individuals are better able to limit their information exposure to attitudes and opinions that reinforce, rather than challenge, their preexisting beliefs. I test my argument against a variety of data sources, including opinion surveys and state-level swine flu vaccination rate data.

AB  - Background: The sexual health of young men in prisons is often among the poorest in any given country. They may have developed sexual behaviors that, from a public health perspective, are considered problematic and burdensome. These include poorer use of condoms and engaging in more frequent casual sex, resulting in higher rates of sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and viral hepatitis. Thus, young incarcerated men are a highly marginalized and socially excluded high-risk group, in greater need of sexual health education and services.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to create an innovative sexual health promotion intervention, made for and with young men in prisons, to encourage them to avail of regular sexual health checkups. This included developing a Web-based animated-style sexual health promotion intervention (1.42 min) coupled with upskilling the prison nurses to offer a partnership approach to prison health care. This paper focuses on the development of the intervention and the importance of the underpinning rights-based (RB) participatory intervention design.
   Methods: We employed an RB participatory approach and recruited 14 participants who attended 3 coproduction workshops held within a prison site in Northern Ireland, United Kingdom. A bespoke 3-day training for nurses beforehand, ensured they gained a deeper understanding of the determinants of poor sexual health. The coproduction team comprised young men, prison nurses, nurse sexual health consultant, media company representatives, and facilitator. Workshops focused on content, design, tone and medium of communication for a Web-based intervention that would be appealing and engaging for young incarcerated men.
   Results: A 1.42-min animation Dick loves Doot was created to promote a positive attitude toward sexual health checkups. The RB approach enabled the young men to participate, have their voices heard and see their stories reflected through the animation The nurses' capacities to protect, fulfill, and respect the young men's rights to appropriate sexual health services and education was also enhanced. Evaluations confirmed that we successfully provided accurate sexual health information in a way that was engaging and accessible and that encouraged the young men to avail of the new prison sexual health services that were set up in the prison and now provided by nurses.
   Conclusions: The RB participatory approach to health advanced in this study provided a means to (1) gain invaluable insider knowledge to understand the impact of structural determinants on health and health inequalities and strategies by which to target young incarcerated men (2) create inclusive opportunities for developing bespoke targeted interventions, and (3) galvanize collaborative partnerships to disrupt the structures and processes that lead to and encourage health inequities. To reduce future risk, effective treatment, coupled with coproduced interventions that transmit relevant health messages in a relevant and meaningful way, is key to success.

AB  - Poor air quality is recognized as a major risk factor for human health globally. Critical to addressing this important public-health issue is the effective dissemination of air quality data, information about adverse health effects, and the necessary mitigation measures. However, recent studies have shown that even when public get data on air quality and understand its importance, people do not necessarily take actions to protect their health or exhibit pro-environmental behaviors to address the problem. Most existing studies on public attitude and response to air quality are based on offline studies, with a limited number of survey participants and over a limited number of geographical locations. For a larger survey size and a wider set of locations, we collected Twitter data for a period of nearly 2 years and analyzed these data for three major cities: Paris, London, and New Delhi. We identify the three hashtags in each city that best correlate the frequency of tweets with local air quality. Using tweets with these hashtags, we determined that people's response to air quality across all three cities was nearly identical when considering relative changes in air pollution. Using machine-learning algorithms, we determined that health concerns dominated public response when air quality degraded, with the strongest increase in concern being in New Delhi, where pollution levels are the highest among the three cities studied. The public call for political solutions when air quality worsens is consistent with similar findings with offline surveys in other cities. We also conducted an unsupervised learning analysis to extract topics from tweets in Delhi and studied their evolution over time and with changing air quality. Our analysis helped extract relevant words or features associated with different air quality-related topics such as air pollution policy and health. Also, the topic modeling analysis revealed niche topics associated with sporadic air quality events, such as fireworks during festivals and the air quality impact on an outdoor sport event. Our approach shows that a tweet-based analysis can enable social scientists to probe and survey public response to events such as air quality in a timely fashion and help policy makers respond appropriately.

AB  - The current health crisis caused by COVID-19 is a challenge for oncology treatment, especially when it comes to radiotherapy. Cancer patients are already known to be very fragile and COVID-19 brings about the risk of severe respiratory complications. In order to treat patients safely while protecting medical teams, the entire health care system must optimize the way it approaches prevention and treatment at a time when social distancing is key to stemming this pandemic. All indications and treatment modalities must be re-discussed. This is particularly the case for radiotherapy of bone metastases for which it is possible to reduce the number of sessions, the frequency of transport and the complexity of treatments. These changes will have to be discussed according to the organization of each radiotherapy department and the health situation, while medical teams must remain vigilant about the risks of complications of bone metastases, particularly spinal metastases. In this short piece, the members of the GEMO (the European Study Group of Bone Metastases) offer a number of recommendations to achieve the above objectives, both in general and in relation to five of the most common situations on radiation therapy for bone metastases.

AB  - Coronavirus is the first global crisis of a digital age and the divergence in policy responses reflects the challenge of navigating an unprecedented global situation under conditions of enormous uncertainty. We ask what lessons can be learned from this experience and identify two, both of which push against mainstream interpretations of recent events. First, and contrary to the view that the crisis exposed social media and Big Tech as a source of dangerous misinformation that needs to be regulated more strictly, the paper argues that the less mediated spaces of the Internet-social media and Twitter, in particular-played an essential role in triggering a more effective policy response based around social distancing, lockdown, and containment. Second, and contrary to the view that things will go back to normal once the worst of the crisis has passed, the paper argues that, as a direct result of lockdown, the status quo has been shifted across multiple sectors of the economy. Three examples of this shift are introduced, notably the forced experimentation with digital technologies in education and health, the increased use of remote work in many companies, and a reduction in environmentally harmful behavior and decrease in pollution levels. The long-term effects of this 'reset' are impossible to predict, but a quick return to the 'old normal' seems unlikely. The paper concludes with the suggestion that this reset has created a unique historical opportunity for the reappraisal of regulatory approaches across multiple domains and exposed the need for regulatory models better aligned to a less mediated, more decentralized world. COVID-19 is a global tragedy, but-given that it has happened-it should be used as a learning experience to re-imagine a better, more socially, and environmentally responsible future.

AB  - The interests of the researcher towards the use of technology in learning surged during the Covid-19 pandemic as more users were expected to use online resources due to the limited face-to-face activities and the new norm that encouraged social distancing. This study aimed to investigate the factors that affected a student's acceptance of YouTube as learning resources. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), this study investigated the role of subscription status as a moderator variable. The data were collected during the Movement Control Order (MCO) that was placed on Malaysians, involving 340 students of a distance education program. The findings of this study supported TAM, in which the student's acceptance towards YouTube as learning resources was related to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and social influence. This study also reported that the subscription status did not moderate the relationship between the factors and the student's acceptance. Therefore, this study implies that students accept YouTube as learning resources either as a subscriber of the YouTube channel or otherwise. This study significantly contributes to the literature by investigating the acceptance of YouTube a learning resource during the Covid-19 pandemic.

AB  - This article reports on the first comparative surveys in two separate locations to measure public attitudes toward sharks following shark bite incidents. This study focuses directly on the communities affected by the shark bites, both in Australiathe town of Ballina in the State of New South Wales (N = 500) and the city of Perth in Western Australia (N = 600)and reports on their attitudes and policy preferences relating to sharks immediately after serious shark bite incidents in 2015 and 2016. In both communities we find that a large majority of respondents prefer nonlethal policies; most respondents believe shark bite incidents to be accidental rather than intentional; while fear of sharks correlates with support for lethal policies, this association is powerfully mediated by perceptions of intentionality. These findings have implications for international wildlife management, particularly regarding predator species in need of conservation. Conservation is based on the public acceptability of a species and if intentionality can mediate fear effects and promote policies that protect the species this is a step forward for conservation management globally.

AB  - Purpose The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to significant disruptions in the healthcare system including surges of infected patients exceeding local capacity, closures of primary care offices, and delays of non-emergent medical care. Government-initiated measures to decrease healthcare utilization (i.e., "flattening the curve") have included shelter-in-place mandates and social distancing, which have taken effect across most of the USA. We evaluate the immediate impact of the Public Health Messaging and shelter-in-place mandates on Emergency Department (ED) demand for radiology services. Methods We analyzed ED radiology volumes from the five University of California health systems during a 2-week time period following the shelter-in-place mandate and compared those volumes with March 2019 and early April 2019 volumes. Results ED radiology volumes declined from the 2019 baseline by 32 to 40% (p < 0.001) across the five health systems with a total decrease in volumes across all 5 systems by 35% (p < 0.001). Stratifying by subspecialty, the smallest declines were seen in non-trauma thoracic imaging, which decreased 18% (p value < 0.001), while all other non-trauma studies decreased by 48% (p < 0.001). Conclusion Total ED radiology demand may be a marker for public adherence to shelter-in-place mandates, though ED chest radiology demand may increase with an increase in COVID-19 cases.

AB  - Following the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) responsible for COVID-19 in December 2019 in Wuhan (China) and its spread to the rest of the world, the World Health Organization declared a global pandemic in March 2020. Without effective treatment in the initial pandemic phase, social distancing and mandatory quarantines were introduced as the only available preventative measure. In contrast to the detrimental societal impacts, air quality improved in all countries in which strict lockdowns were applied, due to lower pollutant emissions. Here we investigate the effects of the COVID-19 lockdowns in Europe on ambient black carbon (BC), which affects climate and damages health, using in situ observations from 17 European stations in a Bayesian inversion framework. BC emissions declined by 23 kt in Europe (20% in Italy, 40% in Germany, 34% in Spain, 22% in France) during lockdowns compared to the same period in the previous 5 years, which is partially attributed to COVID-19 measures. BC temporal variation in the countries enduring the most drastic restrictions showed the most distinct lockdown impacts. Increased particle light absorption in the beginning of the lockdown, confirmed by assimilated satellite and remote sensing data, suggests residential combustion was the dominant BC source. Accordingly, in central and Eastern Europe, which experienced lower than average temperatures, BC was elevated compared to the previous 5 years. Nevertheless, an average decrease of 11% was seen for the whole of Europe compared to the start of the lockdown period, with the highest peaks in France (42 %), Germany (21 %), UK (13 %), Spain (11 %) and Italy (8 %). Such a decrease was not seen in the previous years, which also confirms the impact of COVID-19 on the European emissions of BC.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has had obvious, well-documented devastating effects on people's physical health. In this research, we investigate its potential effects on people's mental health. Many people have experienced social isolation, as countries attempt to stem the spread of the disease through confinement and other forms of social distancing. Intuitively, such social isolation may increase feelings of loneliness, and people may take logical steps to reduce their feelings of social isolation and loneliness. One route is through the use of social networking apps (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and messaging and VoIP apps (e.g., WhatsApp, iMessage). In this research, we investigate the effects of pandemic-induced social isolation on social networking and messaging apps, and potential related effects on loneliness. We surveyed young adults (N = 334) who are part of the Centennial cohort (born after 1995) from three different countries (Italy, Argentina, UK) and obtained their screen time usage data over a 4-week period starting from mid-March 2020. This sampling procedure allowed us to obtain data from respondents who were experiencing different degrees of mandated social isolation (lockdowns), which enabled us to determine whether social network and messaging app usage increased as a function of social isolation, and to test potential effects on levels of loneliness. Results showed that only social network usage increased in the initial stage of confinement as a function of lockdown initiation. Additionally, social network app usage was associated with increased feelings of loneliness, and this relation was mediated by fear of missing out (FOMO). In contrast, messaging app usage was associated with decreased feelings of loneliness, and was unrelated to FOMO. These results suggest that technology may be useful for mitigating the impact of loneliness during social isolation but that it is necessary to promote usage of messaging and VoIP apps, rather than social networking apps, because they are directly associated with decreases in loneliness without increasing FOMO.

AB  - Background Prospective cohort studies are challenging to deliver, with one of the main difficulties lying in retention of participants. The need to socially distance during the COVID-19 pandemic has added to this challenge. The pre-COVID-19 adaptation of the European Quality (EQUAL) study in the UK to a remote form of follow-up for efficiency provides lessons for those who are considering changing their study design. Methods The EQUAL study is an international prospective cohort study of patients >= 65 years of age with advanced chronic kidney disease. Initially, patients were invited to complete a questionnaire (SF-36, Dialysis Symptom Index and Renal Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire) at research clinics every 3-6 months, known as "traditional follow-up" (TFU). In 2018, all living patients were invited to switch to "efficient follow-up" (EFU), which used an abbreviated questionnaire consisting of SF-12 and Dialysis Symptom Index. These were administered centrally by post. Response rates were calculated using returned questionnaires as a proportion of surviving invitees, and error rates presented as the average percentage of unanswered questions or unclear answers, of total questions in returned questionnaires. Response and error rates were calculated 6-monthly in TFU to allow comparisons with EFU. Results Of the 504 patients initially recruited, 236 were still alive at the time of conversion to EFU; 111 of these (47%) consented to the change in follow-up. In those who consented, median TFU was 34 months, ranging from 0 to 42 months. Their response rates fell steadily from 88% (98/111) at month 0 of TFU, to 20% (3/15) at month 42. The response rate for the first EFU questionnaire was 60% (59/99) of those alive from TFU. With this improvement in response rates, the first EFU also lowered errors to baseline levels seen in early follow-up, after having almost trebled throughout traditional follow-up. Conclusions Overall, this study demonstrates that administration of shorter follow-up questionnaires by post rather than in person does not negatively impact patient response or error rates. These results may be reassuring for researchers who are trying to limit face-to-face contact with patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: The new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 led to the COVID-19 pandemic starting in January 2020. The Swiss Federal Council prescribed a lockdown of nonessential businesses. Students and employees of higher education institutions had to install home offices and participate in online lectures.
   Objective: The aim of this survey study was to evaluate lifestyle habits, such as physical activity (PA), sitting time, nutritional habits (expressed as median modified Mediterranean Diet Score [mMDS]), alcohol consumption habits, and sleeping behavior during a 2-month period of confinement and social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Survey participants were students and employees of a Swiss university of applied sciences.
   Methods: All students and employees from Bern University of Applied Sciences, Department of Health Professions (ie, nursing, nutrition and dietetics, midwifery, and physiotherapy divisions) were invited to complete an anonymous online survey during the COVID-19 confinement period. Information on the lifestyle dimensions of PA, sitting time, nutritional and alcohol consumption habits, and sleep behavior was gathered using adaptations of validated questionnaires. Frequency analyses and nonparametric statistical methods were used for data analysis. Significance was set at 5% alpha level of error.
   Results: Prevalence of non-health-enhancing PA was 37.1%, with participants of the division of physiotherapy showing the lowest prevalence. Prevalence of long sitting time (>8 hours/day) was 36.1%. The median mMDS was 9, where the maximal score was 15, with participants of the division of nutrition and dietetics being more adherent to a Mediterranean diet as compared to the other groups. Prevalence of nonadherence to the Swiss alcohol consumption recommendations was 8.3%. Prevalence of low sleeping quality was 44.7%, while the median sleeping duration was 8 hours, which is considered healthy for adult populations.
   Conclusions: In the group analysis, differences in PA, sitting time, and mMDS were observed between different divisions of health professions as well as between Bachelor of Science students, Master of Science students, and employees. Therefore, public health messages regarding healthy lifestyle habits during home confinement should be more group specific. The results of this study may provide support for the implementation of group-specific health promotion interventions at universities in pandemic conditions.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has presented major challenges to society, exposing preexisting ethical weaknesses in the modern social fabric's ability to respond. Distrust in government and a lessened authority of science to determine facts have both been exacerbated by the polarization and disinformation enhanced by social media. These have impaired society's willingness to comply with and persevere with social distancing, which has been the most powerful initial response to mitigate the pandemic. These preexisting weaknesses also threaten the future acceptance of vaccination and contact tracing, two other tools needed to combat epidemics. Medical ethicists might best help in this situation by promoting truth-telling, encouraging the rational adjudication of facts, providing transparent decision-making and advocating the virtue of cooperation to maximize the common good. Those interventions should be aimed at the social level. The same elements of emphasizing cooperation and beneficence also apply to the design of triage protocols for when resources are overwhelmed. A life-stages approach increases beneficence and reduces harms. Triage should be kept as simple and straightforward as reasonably possible to avoid unwieldly application during a pandemic.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the mediating role of work atmosphere which have a positive influence on job satisfaction. Specifically, it focuses on how supervisor's cooperation and career growth affect job satisfactionmediating through work atmosphere in a private corporate entity.
   Design/methodology/approach - To attain this objective, a research framework with a mediating variable of work atmosphere was formulated. Using measurement scales created to assess different aspects of job satisfaction, career growth, supervisor's cooperation and work atmosphere, a survey instrument was developed to test the various relationships implied by the framework. Data ( n = 325) were collected from the employees of a local chemical company in Bangladesh following convenience sampling procedure. The analysis has been done by bootstrapping procedure following structural equation modeling ( SEM).
   Findings - The result shows that work atmosphere has a significant mediating role in linking supervisor cooperation and job satisfaction of the employees in the organization. Research limitations/implications - As with any study, there are limitations to the study described here. One possible drawback is the use of a single company's employees as respondents. Second, the sample size is not very large, because respondents were observed to be negligent in filling the questionnaire provided to them. If the sample size could be increased a bit more, then the authors might have better outcomes as postulated in the paper. Nevertheless, the usual cautions about over- generalizing findings from this sample, to populations for which it is not strictly representative, apply. The sample was not randomly drawn to represent a population to which findings could be generalized. Instead, it was a convenience sample, and as such, the ability to generalize the findings very far beyond the sample is limited.
   Practical implications - From a practical perspective, as a cumulative body of work on job satisfaction with mediating variable of work atmosphere emerges, the authors will be better able to advise employers on the elements they need to address to increase their employee retention rate. In this study, the one area of findings that may help business and commercial organizations the most concerns work environment in the workplace. The authors found that supervisor cooperation and work atmosphere were associated with positive path value toward job satisfaction. Similarly, career growth and work atmosphere also exhibit positive path value towards job satisfaction. The implication is that employers can focus on supervisor cooperation in rightly and duly promoting the deserving employees, and in doing so, they can generate positive attitudes toward these activities.
   Originality/value - This paper will add immense importance of work atmosphere to the organizational learning and behavior.

AB  - Empirical evidence has demonstrated that an individual's cultural values can influence his or her mental health. This study extends previous research by proposing and testing a model that examines mediating processes underlying the relationship between individuals' cultural values and their mental health. This 2-stage study used data collected from 208 (at time 1) and 159 (at time 2) full-time staff employed by private enterprises in Taiwan. The author tested hypotheses through the use of hierarchical multiple regression. The results showed that under horizontal individualism and vertical collectivism, the predictors of negative mental health (ie, somatic symptoms, anxiety and insomnia, social dysfunction and/or severe depression) were partially and almost completely achieved through the mediating effect of the negative attitudes toward emotional expression.

AB  - Human trafficking is believed to oppress millions of people worldwide. Despite increased media attention and public awareness campaigns in recent years, no empirical research has examined public attitudes about human trafficking. The present study examined gender, sexual trauma history, and attitudes about human trafficking as they related to belief of a sex-trafficking scenario and willingness to blame the victim for the situation. Undergraduate students (N = 409) at a large private university in the Northeastern United States completed measures in which they responded to a vignette portraying sex trafficking in the United States. Participants also reported their personal trauma history and completed a Human Trafficking Myths Scale. Results indicated that gender and human trafficking myth acceptance, but not sexual trauma history, were significantly related to participants' belief of the sex-trafficking scenario and their perception of the victim's responsibility. Potential implications and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) prompted people to face a distressing and unexpected situation. Uncertainty and social distancing changed people's behaviors, impacting on their feelings, daily habits, and social relationships, which are core elements in human well-being. In particular, restrictions due to the quarantine increased feelings of loneliness and anxiety. Within this context, the use of digital technologies has been recommended to relieve stress and anxiety and to decrease loneliness, even though the overall effects of social media consumption during pandemics still need to be carefully addressed. In this regard, social media use evidence risk and opportunities. In fact, according to a compensatory model of Internet-related activities, the online environment may be used to alleviate negative feelings caused by distressing life circumstances, despite potentially leading to negative outcomes. The present study examined whether individuals who were experiencing high levels of loneliness during the forced isolation for COVID-19 pandemic were more prone to feel anxious, and whether their sense of loneliness prompted excessive social media use. Moreover, the potentially mediating effect of excessive social media use in the relationship between perceived loneliness and anxiety was tested. A sample of 715 adults (71.5% women) aged between 18 and 72 years old took part in an online survey during the period of lockdown in Italy. The survey included self-report measures to assess perceived sense of loneliness, excessive use of social media, and anxiety. Participants reported that they spent more hours/day on social media during the pandemic than before the pandemic. We found evidence that perceived feelings of loneliness predicted both excessive social media use and anxiety, with excessive social media use also increasing anxiety levels. These findings suggest that isolation probably reinforced the individuals' sense of loneliness, strengthening the need to be part of virtual communities. However, the facilitated and prolonged access to social media during the COVID-19 pandemic risked to further increase anxiety, generating a vicious cycle that in some cases may require clinical attention.

AB  - Background Humoral responses to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines in hemodialysis (HD) patients can direct vaccination policy. Methods We compared 409 COVID-19-naive HD patients from 13 HD units in Israel to 148 non-dialysis-dependent COVID-19-naive controls. Twenty-four previously infected (antinucleocapsid positive) HD patients were analysed separately. Blood samples were obtained >= 14 days post-vaccination (BNT162b2, Pfizer/BioNTech) to assess seroconversion rates and titers of anti-spike (anti-S) and neutralizing antibodies. Results The median time from vaccination to blood sample collection was 82 days [interquartile range (IAR) 64-87] and 89 days (IQR 68-96) for HD patients and controls, respectively. Seroconversion rates were lower in HD patients compared with controls for both anti-S and neutralizing antibodies (89% and 77% versus 99.3%, respectively; P < 0.0001). Antibody titers were also significantly lower in HD patients compared with controls {median 69.6 [IQR 33.2-120] versus 196.5 [IQR 118.5-246], P < 0.0001; geometric mean titer [GMT] 23.3 [95% confidence interval (CI) 18.7-29.1] versus 222.7 [95% CI 174-284], P < 0.0001, for anti-S and neutralizing antibodies, respectively}. Multivariate analysis demonstrated dialysis dependence to be strongly associated with lower antibody responses and antibody titers waning with time. Age, low serum albumin and low lymphocyte count were also associated with lower seroconversion rates and antibody titers. HD patients previously infected with sudden acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) had no difference in their seroconversion rates or antibody titers compared with COVID-19-naive patients. Conclusion This study demonstrates diminished and waning humoral responses following COVID-19 vaccination in a large and diverse cohort of HD patients, including those previously infected with SARS-CoV-2. Considering these results and reduced vaccine effectiveness against variants of concern, in addition to continued social distancing precautions, a third booster dose should be considered in this population.

AB  - Background: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus -2 (SARS-CoV-2) has infected millions of people all over the world and Sri Lanka is not an exception for the impact of Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19). As there are no effective therapeutic agents at present and newly developed vaccines are not freely available for many countries, preventive measures such as handwashing, social distancing, and respiratory etiquette are key to control of spread. The effective implementation of these measures depends on public knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 and adherence to key practices. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted among 500 non-COVID-19 patients who attended the Outpatient Department (OPD) of the Teaching Hospital Jaffna, Sri Lanka. Knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) was assessed through a self-administered questionnaire and analysis was performed by using SPSS 26. Results: The majority were females (67.8%) and the mean age of the participants was 36.9 (range: 15-85). Most of the participants were homemakers. Two hundred and twenty-two patients (44.4%: 40.1-48.8) showed a suboptimal knowledge score regarding COVID-19. The males, age above 65, were significantly associated with low knowledge score (P< 0.05). Similarly, a significant proportion (36.4%: 32.3-40.7) showed a suboptimal attitude score but the majority of the participants have adopted positive behaviours such as frequently washing hands (88.4%) and wearing masks in appropriate places (91.6%). The major sources for information regarding COVID-19 among the participants were the news media (54.0%) followed by social media (23.2%). Conclusion: As a significant proportion of the participants showed a poor knowledge score and gaps in specific aspects related to COVID-19, the primary care physicians have a significant role to play to improve community knowledge by educating specific groups such as the males and elderly by using appropriate news media and social media platforms.

AB  - The Italian government adopted measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) infection from March 9, 2020, to May 4, 2020 and imposed a phase of social distancing and self-isolation to all adult citizens. Although justified and necessary, psychologists question the impact of this process of COVID-19 isolation on the mental health of the population. Hence, this paper investigated the relationship between neuroticism, boredom, fantasy engagement, perceived control over time, and the fear of COVID-19. Specifically, we performed a cross-sectional study aimed at testing an integrative moderated mediation model. Our model assigned the boredom to the mediation role and both the fantasy engagement and perceived control of time to the role of moderators in the relationship between neuroticism and the fear of COVID-19. A sample of 301 subjects, mainly women (68.8%), aged between 18 and 57 years (M-age = 22.12 years; SD = 6.29), participated in a survey conducted in the 1st-week lockdown phase 2 in Italy from May 7 to 18, 2020. Results suggested that neuroticism is crucial in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic, in line with literature showing high neurotic people having greater emotional reactivity and scarce resources to manage stress. We also found that people with high neuroticism tend to feel bored, and the relationship between neuroticism and boredom seems enhanced if one is involved in negative fantasies. Therefore, this result could also explain the positive effect between boredom and fear of COVID-19 we found in the current study. However, our data show that perceived control over time moderates the association between boredom and fear toward COVID-19. Having a high perceived control over time allows people to reduce boredom's effect on fear of COVID-19. In conclusion, we retain that psychological treatment programs could improve the individuals' perceived control over time to modulate anxiety toward the fear of COVID-19 and promote psychological well-being.

AB  - The media's role in shaping the priorities of politicians, known as political agenda setting, is usually examined at the institutional level. However, individual politicians' goals and attitudes are also expected to shape their level of responsiveness to the media. This study is the first to explore how individual politicians' goals and motivations moderate their real-life level of responsiveness to the media. We examine this by using a unique sample of 197 incumbent politicians in three countries (Belgium, Canada, and Israel) and an automated content analysis of parliamentary speeches (N = 45,574) and news articles (N = 412,112). We find that politicians who view themselves as a conduit of the public (delegates) are more responsive to the media than those acting on their own judgment (trustees). Politicians involved in many issues (generalists) are also more responsive than specialists. Finally, no association is found between politicians' negativity bias and their media responsiveness.
