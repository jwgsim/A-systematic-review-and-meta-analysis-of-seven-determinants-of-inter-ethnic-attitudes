AB  - This paper examines discourses of liberal Islamophobia in Austria, analysing interviews with journalists from national newspapers, magazines and TV station. Using a theoretical framework that combines a Gramscian analysis with methods of discourse analysis, it identifies "temporalization" as an effective discursive mechanism in the construction of the Muslim "Other" as a "folk devil". It argues that liberal Islamophobia works as a historicist racism, which allows differently positioned subjects to invest into, and reproduce, a mythical space of representation where the Muslim "Other" figures as a "devil from our past", embodying everything Austrian society has supposedly done away with in the years of political reform after 1968.

AB  - Background Internet discussion forums provide new, albeit less used data sources for exploring personal experiences of illness and treatment strategies.
   Objective To gain an understanding of how discussion forum participants value nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in smoking cessation (SC).
   Setting Finnish national Internet-based discussion forum, STUMPPI, supporting SC and consisting of ten free discussion areas, each with a different focus. The analysis was based on STUMPPI forum participants' postings (n = 24 481) in five discussion areas during January 2007-January 2012.
   Design Inductive content analysis of the postings concerning NRT use or comparing NRT to other SC methods.
   Results Three major themes related to NRT in SC emerged from the discussions. These were as follows: (I) distrust and negative attitude towards NRT; (II) neutral acceptance of NRT as a useful SC method; and (III) trust on the crucial role of NRT and other SC medicines. The negative attitude was related to following perceptions: NRT use maintains tobacco dependence, fear of NRT dependence or experience of not gaining help from NRT use. NRT was perceived to be useful particularly in the initiation of SC attempts and in dealing with physiological dependence. The most highlighted factors of successful quitting were quitters' own psychological empowerment and peer support from the discussion community.
   Conclusions The majority of STUMPPI forum participants had low or balanced expectations towards the role of NRT in SC. More research from the smokers' and quitters' perspective is needed to assess the real value of NRT compared to other methods in SC.

AB  - Recently, states have enacted teacher-carry laws. While controversial, little scholarship has tapped public attitudes toward such reforms. Because public opinion shapes policy, the public is an important stakeholder in this debate. Thus, we investigated three questions. First, how supportive is the public of arming teachers? Second, what demographic and social divides exist, if any, for reform approval? Finally, do crime-related perceptions, concerning views about public safety, and criminogenic influences shape policy preferences? We test these questions using a 2018 poll of Virginia residents (N = 521). Overall, approval for teacher-carry is split. Crime-related perceptions mediate some of the initial social and demographic divides in opinion but other correlates, such as parental status, remain salient predictors of views. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Background Pain is a major obstacle and one of the main reasons people seek medical attention and is a frequent stressor for many clients in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, clients should not be left complaining, especially when solutions are available; each patient has the right to assess and manage their pain in the best way possible. Therefore, the objective of this study was to analyze nurses' knowledge, attitudes, and practice (KAPs) regarding pain management in Palestinian ICU settings and to determine the possible obstacles that may hinder effective and competent pain management for critically ill clients. Methods This cross-sectional research was conducted online through social media. An approved questionnaire was used to assess KAPs and obstacles in pain treatment approaches for critically ill patients. Bloom's cutoff points for adequate practice, appropriate knowledge, and a positive attitude were applied. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 21.0 was used for analyses. Results One hundred ninety-one nurses were approached, the majority of the participants in this investigation were males (n = 127, 66.5%), and the mean age of the study participant was 29 +/- 7 (year). The overall knowledge score was 15, measured for median knowledge = 7 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 4-8, and higher scores indicate more knowledge about the management and control of pain. The total attitude score = 11, the median = 6, with an IQR of 5-7. The reluctance to prescribe opioids was 79.6%, the lack of proficiency in pain management knowledge was 78.5%, and rigorous controls over opioid use were 77.5%, which was the lion's share of commonly recognized hurdles. The overall practice score was 10, with a median of 5.0 with an IQR of 3.0 to 6.0, and nurses revealed that they would evaluate all the steps involved in pain management in each round they have. Conclusions This research reveals a knowledge, attitude, and practice gap among the working nurses. Therefore, adequate and efficient plans must be aimed at ICU nurses to foster the level of knowledge and direct attitudes toward pain control through applicable interventional programs.

AB  - Background: Developing appropriate concussion prevention and management paradigms in middle school (MS) settings requires understanding parents' general levels of concussion-related knowledge and attitudes. This study examined factors associated with concussion-symptom knowledge and care-seeking attitudes among parents of MS children (aged 10-15 years).
   Methods: A panel of 1224 randomly selected U.S. residents, aged >= 18 years and identifying as parents of MS children, completed an online questionnaire capturing parental and child characteristics. The parents' concussion-symptom knowledge was measured using 25 questions, with possible answers being "yes", "maybe", and "no". Correct answers earned 2 points, "maybe" answers earned 1 point, and incorrect answers earned 0 point (range: 0-50; higher scores = better knowledge). Concussion care-seeking attitudes were also collected using five 7-point scale items (range: 5-35; higher scores = more positive attitudes). Multivariable ordinal logistic regression models identified predictors of higher scores. Models met proportional odds assumptions. Adjusted odds ratios (aORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs) (excluding 1.00) were deemed statistically significant.
   Results: Median scores were 39 (interquartile range: 32-44) for symptom knowledge and 32 (interquartile range: 28-35) for care-seeking attitude. In multivariable models, odds of better symptom knowledge were higher in women vs. men (aOR = 2.28; 95%CI: 1.71-3.05), white/non-Hispanics vs. other racial or ethnic groups (aOR = 1.88; 95%CI: 1.42-2.49), higher parental age (10-year-increase aOR = 1.47; 95%CI: 1.26-1.71), and greater competitiveness (10%-scale-increase aOR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.13-1.36). Odds of more positive care-seeking attitudes were higher in white/non-Hispanics vs. other racial or ethnic groups (aOR = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.06-1.99) and in older parental age (10-year-increase aOR = 1.24; 95%CI: 1.05-1.47).
   Conclusion: Characteristics of middle school children's parents (e.g., sex, race or ethnicity, age) are associated with their concussion-symptom knowledge and care-seeking attitudes. Parents' variations in concussion knowledge and attitudes warrant tailored concussion education and prevention.

AB  - Aim: This study evaluated the knowledge and attitudes of nursing students toward epilepsy.
   Method: The descriptive and cross-sectional study was conducted with the voluntary participation of 161 nursing students in their 2nd, 3rd, and 4th years of study who were registered at the summer school of Tralcya University, Faculty of Health Sciences in the 2017-2018 academic year. The data were collected through a research questionnaire form and the Epilepsy Knowledge and Attitude Scales. The normal distribution of the data was tested using the one-sample Kolmogorov-Smimov test. Nonparametric tests were used since the data were not normally distributed. Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, range, numbers, and percentages), the Mann-Whitney U test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and Spearman's correlation test were used in the data analysis.
   Findings: Half of the nursing students (55.9%) were females with a mean age of 22.14 +/- 1.81 years, and 43.5% of the students were third-year students. Of the students, 90.7% were informed about epilepsy from sources including their school/course/instructor (64%), the television/internet (10.6%), and healthcare professionals (6.8%). The mean scores obtained on the Epilepsy Knowledge Scale (EKS) and the mean score on the Epilepsy Attitude Scale (EAS) were 10.23 +/- 4.24 and 57.66 +/- 8.83, respectively. A significant positive correlation was found between the knowledge and attitude scores of the students regarding epilepsy (p < .001). As the students' knowledge increased, their attitudes also increased positively toward epilepsy. The female students had a more positive attitude toward epilepsy than did the male students. Further, the students who had knowledge about epilepsy and who provided care for patients with epilepsy had higher scores and displayed more positive altitudes toward epilepsy (p < .05).
   Conclusion: This study determined that the participating nursing students had a moderate level of knowledge regarding epilepsy. In addition to theoretical knowledge of epilepsy, the experience of caring fora patient with epilepsy had a positive effect on the students attitudes. The nursing education curriculum should place greater focus on epilepsy and interventions for epilepsy seizures. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

KW  - pandemic
AB  - Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of society worldwide. To combat the pandemic, measures such as face mask-wearing, hand-washing and -sanitizing, movement restrictions, and social distancing have been introduced. These measures have significantly disrupted education, particularly health professions education, which depends on student-patient contact for the development of clinical competence. The wide-ranging consequences of the pandemic are immense, and health professions education institutions in sub-Saharan Africa have not been spared.
   Objective: This paper describes a protocol for assessing the preparedness of selected health professions education institutions in sub-Saharan Africa for remote teaching and learning during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A mixed-methods design with a case study approach will be used. The awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement model of change was selected as the conceptual framework to guide the study. Eight higher education institutions in 6 sub-Saharan countries have participated in this study. Data will be collected through electronic surveys from among whole populations of academic staff, students, and administrators in undergraduate medicine and nursing programs. Qualitative and quantitative data from each institution will be analyzed as a case study, which will yield an inventory of similar cases grouped for comparison. Quantitative data will be analyzed for each institution and then compared to determine associations among variables and differences among programs, institutions, or countries.
   Results: Our findings will provide information to higher education institutions, particularly those offering health professions education programs, in Africa regarding the preparedness for remote teaching and learning to influence efforts related to web-based teaching and learning, which is envisaged to become the new normal in the future.
   Conclusions: This study has not received any funding, and any costs involved were borne by individual consortium members at the various institutions. Ethics approval from the institutional review board was obtained at various times across the participating sites, which were free to commence data collection as soon as approval was obtained. Data collection was scheduled to begin on October 1, 2020, and end on February 28, 2021. As of this submission, data collection has been completed, and a total of 1099 participants have been enrolled. Data analysis has not yet commenced.

AB  - Purpose: To identify postpartum depression risk and describe experiences of women in the first 6 weeks after giving birth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Study Design and Methods: Using a convergent mixed-methods approach, we recruited a convenience sample of women living in the United States who gave birth March 1, 2020 or later from social media Web sites. Participants completed the Postpartum Depression Screening Scale-Short Form and provided written answers to open-ended questions regarding their experiences at home with their new infant. Results: Our 262 participants were on average 32.6 years of age, the majority were White (82%), married or partnered (91.9%), and college educated (87.4%). Mean postpartum depression score was 17.7 (SD = 5.9) with 75% scoring >= 14, indicating significant postpartum depressive symptoms. Qualitative content analysis revealed five themes: Isolation and seclusion continue; Fear, anxiety, and stress filled the days; Grieving the loss of normal: It's just so sad; Complicated by postpartum depression: A dark time; and There is a silver lining. Quantitative and qualitative findings provided a holistic view of women's depressive symptoms and experiences at home with their infants during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical Implications: Although policies that reduce risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection for patients and the health care team must continue to be implemented, the adverse effects of depressive symptoms on maternal-infant wellbeing within the context of increased isolation due to the pandemic need to be kept at the forefront. Nurses need to be aware of the consequences of women sheltering in place and social distancing on maternal-infant outcomes, particularly on depression and likelihood of breastfeeding.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the readability and presence of translated online information readily available to the British public during COVID-19. Design A cross-sectional study was performed. The terms "Coronavirus", "COVID-19", "Lockdown", "Social Distancing", "Handwashing", "Furlough Scheme" and "Sick pay" were inputted into the popular search engine, Google. Websites were categorised by their source (i.e. Government, Non-Governmental Organisation, NHS and Commercial) and theme (i.e. general COVID-19 information, population practise and employment rulings). Reliable calculators for assessing readability (Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, Gunning Fog Index, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level, Coleman-Liau Index and Automated Readability Index) were used. Main Outcome Measures The median scores with the interquartile range from each calculator of the pooled data were observed. The presence of accompanying translated material and graphic information was also counted and presented as counts and percentages. The number of readable websites (i.e. a score <= 8) for each source and theme category were also recorded. Setting UK Internet servers. Results The median scores of the pooled data (n = 148) had shown that the majority of websites were unreadable to the average British reader according to each calculator used (SMOG 1.3%; GF 6.8%; FK 35.8%; CL 2.6%; ARI 40%). Only 3.4% and 6.8% of the pooled websites had readily available translated material and accompanying graphic material, respectively. Conclusion Readability of COVID-19 information is below national standards and that there is a lack of accompanying translated and graphics-based material online. This may lead to an amplified level of misunderstanding in BAME populations about the COVID-19 pandemic and the rulings put in place.

AB  - Background The ongoing Covid-19 pandemic not only threatens physical health, but also affects the mental health of people. Yet, health consequences of the pandemic do not affect all members of society equally. We therefore assessed the mental health burden of individuals who are at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals who are at low risk of severe illness during the first lockdown (March, 2020) in Germany. Furthermore, we investigated variables mediating the effect of being an individual at increased risk of serve illness on depression. Methods Adult German residents (n = 2.369) provided responses to a cross-sectional online survey about risk factors for of severe illness from Covid-19 and various aspects of mental health during the first lockdown in Germany. For data collection, standardized and validated self-report measures were used and for data analysis Mann-Whitney U-tests as well as regression and mediation analyses were performed. Results The results clearly show that the mental health burden is higher among individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 compared to individuals at low risk of severe illness from Covid-19. Moreover, our findings indicate that the association between Covid-19 risk status and depressive symptoms is mediated by concerns about mental health, anxiety and loneliness in a causal effect chain. Conclusions Individuals at increased risk of severe illness from Covid-19 have an increased need for psychosocial support during times of lockdown. Future public health policies should pay special attention to these individuals and support them by targeted offers. More research, however, is needed on possible long-term consequences of social distancing on mental health.

AB  - Background: The death of a loved one is considered as one of the most stressful life events. During the COVID-19 pandemic, grief processes are potentially affected by measures such as social distancing and self-quarantine. Aim: The aim of this study was to give insight in the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on quality of life, social support, and self-care of bereaved relatives of people with advanced cancer in order to evaluate whether care for bereaved relatives during the COVID-19 pandemic should be improved. Design: A cross-sectional analysis using data from bereaved relatives of a prospective, longitudinal, multicenter, observational study on quality of care and quality of life of people with advanced cancer and their (bereaved) relatives (eQuiPe). Setting/participants: Quality of life, social support, and self-care of bereaved relatives who completed a questionnaire within 3-6 months after their relative died during COVID-19 (April-November 2020) were compared with bereaved relatives who completed this questionnaire pre-COVID-19 (April-November 2019). Results: Ninety-one bereaved relatives were included in the analysis, 44 bereaved relatives completed the questionnaire pre-COVID-19 and 47 during COVID-19. The median age of the participants was 65 (IQR = 14) years and 58% were female. There were no significant differences between the pre-COVID-19 and during COVID-19 bereaved relatives in quality of life (68 vs 69), social support (17 vs 18), and self-care (20 vs 19). Conclusions: On the short-term, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have significant impact on bereaved relatives' wellbeing. However, long-term impact of the pandemic on their wellbeing should be assessed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Following the COVID-19 pandemic, the Government of India announced lockdown from March 25, 2020, which included measures such as social distancing, canceling mass gatherings, and closure of schools and colleges. Since the present generation of students spends a lot of time on social media, especially WhatsApp, the utility of the same to discuss the various public health domains of COVID-19 through multiple-choice questions (MCQs) was explored. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This longitudinal study was conducted among 154 participants (undergraduates, interns, postgraduates, and teaching faculty) for 3 months. MCQs on COVID-19 were disseminated through WhatsApp status of the investigator, and feedback regarding the same was taken at the end of 3 months. The activity log was maintained, and the information was downloaded as a comma-separated value (CSV) file and exported to MS Excel. Descriptive statistics were applied. The location of the participants was entered into the Microsoft Excel sheet and converted into CSV file. The Geographical data were analyzed in the Quantum Geographical information System (QGIS). RESULTS: Among the 154 study participants, 48% were undergraduates, 10.4% were interns, 30.6% were postgraduates, and 11% were teaching faculty. Eighty-nine percent of the participants felt that WhatsApp can be used as a platform for discussing MCQs. 89%, 93%, and 89.6% of the participants felt that the exercise improved their analytical skills, helped in self-directed learning, and improved collaborative learning, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Majority of the participants responded that WhatsApp can be used as a platform to discuss MCQs and that the exercise helped in collaborative and self-directed learning.

AB  - Background: Transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 varied by the settings of virus exposure. Understanding the inter-relationship between exposure setting and transmission networks would provide a basis for informing public health control strategies.
   Methods: Surveillance and clinical data from the first wave of COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong were accessed. Twelve exposure setting types were differentiated - household, neighbourhood, eateries, entertainment, parties, shopping, personalised service, workplace, education, worship, healthcare, transport. Clustering was investigated followed by reconstructing the transmission cascades of clustered cases using social networking approach. Linked and unlinked cases were compared in statistical analyses.
   Findings: Between 23 January and 19 June 2020, 1128 cases were reported. Among 324 cases related to local transmission, 123 clusters comprising two or more epidemiologically linked cases were identified. Linked cases had lower Ct value (p < 0 001) than unlinked cases. Households accounted for 63% of all clusters with half as primary setting, while entertainment accounted for the highest number of primary setting transmission cases. There were altogether 19 cascades involving >1 exposure setting, with a median reproduction number of 3(IQR: 2-4), versus 1(IQR:1-2) for cascades involving a single setting (n = 36 cascades). The longest cascade featured a bar (entertainment) as primary setting, with propagation through 30 non-primary exposure settings from seven setting types, reflecting, propensity for widespread dispersion and difficulty in containment.
   Interpretation: There was marked heterogeneity in the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission cascades which differed by exposure setting. Network epidemiological analyses of transmission cascades can be applied as a risk assessment tool in decision-making for calibrating social distancing measures. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Nomophobia is rising among high school students, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, such as social distancing, long-term online learning, and lack of social support. Many studies have also shown that students with high levels of nomophobia have a higher risk of stress. However, very few researchers are interested in studying loneliness as a mediation factor for the relationship between nomophobia and stress. This study investigated whether the loneliness factor is a mediator in the relationship between nomophobia and stress in Vietnamese high school students. Participants include 556 Vietnamese high school students. Participants completed the Nomophobia Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scales 21, The UCLA loneliness scale version 3. In this research, to test variable relationships, the mediation analyzing method by the PROCESS macro 3.5 will be applied. The research concludes that for Vietnam high school students, the mediating role of loneliness was identified in the relationship between nomophobia and stress. It is a suggestion through this research that nomophobia preventive and mitigating measures should reduce loneliness in students.

AB  - Although people with depression are stigmatized in many parts of the world, the negative prejudice and discrimination against individuals with depression may be particularly problematic for Chinese individuals. Previous attribution theory-guided studies indicate that reducing perceptions of controllability can indirectly increase willingness to provide social support to acquaintances and close others with depression through increased sympathy and reduced anger. Moreover, these studies indicate that strengthening beliefs regarding the temporary nature of depression indirectly increases willingness to provide support for close others but not acquaintances. Although these findings offer insight into how the harms of stigma can be reduced in the United States, it is unknown whether these results will generalize to the Chinese population. In the current study, participants from an urban city in China (N = 302) were randomly assigned to think of a close other or an acquaintance experiencing depression and then respond to measures of affect and help provision (willingness to provide social support, willingness to provide general support, and desire for social distance). Moderated mediation analyses indicated that participants were significantly less sympathetic when they perceived depression as controllable and this effect was significantly stronger toward acquaintances. Additionally, sympathy was significantly lower when participants perceived their close other's depressive symptomatology as stable. This effect was not observed among participants who perceived their acquaintances' experience with depression as stable. Findings suggest that Weiner's attribution theory could be a useful framework in reducing stigmatization of depression in China, but interpersonal relationships should be taken into consideration.

AB  - This study analyzes how people's attitudes to the European refugee crisis (ERC) correspond to selected psychological state and trait measures and impact the neural processing of media images of refugees. From a large pool of respondents, who filled in an online xenophobia questionnaire, we selected two groups (totalN= 38) with the same socio-demographic background, but with opposite attitudes toward refugees. We found that a negative attitude toward refugees (high xenophobia - HX) was associated with a significantly higher conscientiousness score and with a higher trait aggression and hostility, but there was no group effect connected with empathy, fear, and anxiety measures. At the neural level we found that brain activity during the presentation of ERC stimuli is affected by xenophobic attitudes-with more xenophobic subjects exhibiting a higher BOLD response in the left fusiform gyrus. However, while the fMRI results demonstrate increased attention and vigilance toward ERC-related stimuli in the HX group, they do not show differentiated patterns of brain activity associated with perception of dehumanized outgroup.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, when individuals were confronted with social distancing, social media served as a significant platform for expressing feelings and seeking emotional support. However, a group of automated actors known as social bots have been found to coexist with human users in discussions regarding the coronavirus crisis, which may pose threats to public health. To figure out how these actors distorted public opinion and sentiment expressions in the outbreak, this study selected three critical timepoints in the development of the pandemic and conducted a topic-based sentiment analysis for bot-generated and human-generated tweets. The findings show that suspected social bots contributed to as much as 9.27% of COVID-19 discussions on Twitter. Social bots and humans shared a similar trend on sentiment polarity-positive or negative-for almost all topics. For the most negative topics, social bots were even more negative than humans. Their sentiment expressions were weaker than those of humans for most topics, except for COVID-19 in the US and the healthcare system. In most cases, social bots were more likely to actively amplify humans' emotions, rather than to trigger humans' amplification. In discussions of COVID-19 in the US, social bots managed to trigger bot-to-human anger transmission. Although these automated accounts expressed more sadness towards health risks, they failed to pass sadness to humans.

AB  - Background: Before the advent of an effective vaccine, nonpharmaceutical interventions, such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and lockdowns, have been the primary measures to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Such measures are highly effective when there is high population-wide adherence, which requires information on current risks posed by the pandemic alongside a clear exposition of the rules and guidelines in place.
   Objective: Here we analyzed online news media coverage of COVID-19. We quantified the total volume of COVID-19 articles, their sentiment polarization, and leading subtopics to act as a reference to inform future communication strategies.
   Methods: We collected 26 million news articles from the front pages of 172 major online news sources in 11 countries (available online at SciRide). Using topic detection, we identified COVID-19-related content to quantify the proportion of total coverage the pandemic received in 2020. The sentiment analysis tool Vader was employed to stratify the emotional polarity of COVID-19 reporting. Further topic detection and sentiment analysis was performed on COVID-19 coverage to reveal the leading themes in pandemic reporting and their respective emotional polarizations.
   Results: We found that COVID-19 coverage accounted for approximately 25.3% of all front-page online news articles between January and October 2020. Sentiment analysis of English-language sources revealed that overall COVID-19 coverage was not exclusively negatively polarized, suggesting wide heterogeneous reporting of the pandemic. Within this heterogenous coverage, 16% of COVID-19 news articles (or 4% of all English-language articles) can be classified as highly negatively polarized, citing issues such as death, fear, or crisis.
   Conclusions: The goal of COVID-19 public health communication is to increase understanding of distancing rules and to maximize the impact of governmental policy. The extent to which the quantity and quality of information from different communication channels (eg, social media, government pages, and news) influence public understanding of public health measures remains to be established. Here we conclude that a quarter of all reporting in 2020 covered COVID-19, which is indicative of information overload. In this capacity, our data and analysis form a quantitative basis for informing health communication strategies along traditional news media channels to minimize the risks of COVID-19 while vaccination is rolled out.

KW  - ACCESS
AB  - Background The presence of COVID-19 in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is raising important concerns about effective pandemic response and preparedness in the context of fragile health systems and the pervasiveness of misinformation. The objective of this study was to gain an understanding of how COVID-19 was perceived by households experiencing extreme poverty in the Philippines.
   Methods This study was conducted in partnership with International Care Ministries (ICM), a Philippine-based non-governmental organization (NGO) that runs a poverty-alleviation program called Transform targeted towards extreme low-income households. We integrated knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) questions into ICM's cross-sectional program monitoring and evaluation systems from February 20 through March 13, 2020. Frequencies and proportions were calculated to describe the respondents' responses, and the Kruskal-Wallis test and binomial logistic regression were undertaken to determine the socio-demographic characteristics associated with COVID-19 KAPs.
   Results In total, 2224 respondents from 166 communities in rural, urban and coastal settings were surveyed. Although the survey was administered during the earlier stages of the pandemic, 94.0% of respondents had already heard of COVID-19. Traditional media sources such as television (85.5%) and radio (56.1%) were reported as the main sources of information about the virus. Coughing and sneezing were identified as a transmission route by 89.5% of respondents, while indirect hand contact was the least commonly identified transmission route, recognized by 72.6% of respondents. Handwashing was identified by 82.2% of respondents as a preventive measure against the virus, but social distancing and avoiding crowds were only identified by 32.4% and 40.6%, respectively. Handwashing was the most common preventive practice in response to COVID-19, adopted by 89.9% of respondents. A greater number of preventive measures were taken by those with more knowledge of potential transmission routes.
   Conclusions There is a need for targeted health education as a response strategy to COVID-19 in low-income settings, and it is important that strategies are contextually relevant. Understanding KAPs among populations experiencing extreme poverty will be important as tailored guidance for public health response and communication strategies are developed for LMICs.

AB  - Objective: There has been a heated discussion about mesh materials in urogynecology in recent years. The role of social media in this discussion is critical. This study aims to make a systematic analysis of videos uploaded to YouTube about mesh complications in urogynecology.
   Study Design: YouTube was searched using specific terms about mesh materials. The primary outcome was the relationship between the video characteristics-which were publisher identity, attitude, the main focus of the video country, and year- and the mesh debate in urogynecology.
   Results: We analyzed 1128 YouTube videos about mesh complications. There was no distinction between stress urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse when referring to the mesh material in 79 % of the videos. 35.2 % of the videos were in the News group, 31.2 % were in the Patients group, 19.6 % were in the Doctors group, and 14.0 % were in the Lawyers group. Videos in the News (75.7 %), Patients (92.6 %), and Lawyers (99.4 %) groups mostly had a negative attitude, while videos in the Doctors (48.9 %) group mostly had an informative attitude. News (43.2 %) and Patients (51.2 %) group videos were predominantly from the United Kingdom. However, Lawyers (81.0 %) and Doctors (44.3 %) videos were predominantly from the USA. In the last three years, the news and patients videos have increased by an average of 40 % each year.
   Conclusion: YouTube has influenced the mesh dilemma with a negative attitude. As long as social media is at the center of this discussion, a healthy outcome cannot be achieved. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced rapid evolution of the healthcare environment. Efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus through social distancing and shelter-at-home edicts have unintended consequences upon clinical and educational missions and mental well-being of radiology departments. We sought to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on radiology residencies with respect to the educational mission and perceptions of impact on well-being.
   Materials and Methods: This study was IRB exempt. An anonymous 22 question survey regarding the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on educational and clinical missions of residencies, its perceived impact upon morale of radiologists and trainees and a query of innovative solutions devised in response, was emailed to the Association of Program Directors in Radiology membership. Survey data were collected using SurveyMonkey (San Mateo, California).
   Results: Respondents felt the COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted their residency programs. Regarding the educational mission impact, 70.1% (75/107) report moderate/marked negative impact and 2.8%(3/107) that educational activities have ceased. Regarding the pandemic's impact on resident morale, 44.8% (48/107) perceive moderate/marked negative effect; perceived resident morale in programs with redeployment is significantly worse with 57.1% (12/21) reporting moderate/marked decrease. Respondents overwhelmingly report adequate resident access to mental health resources during the acute phase of the pandemic (88.8%, 95/107). Regarding morale of program directors, 61% (65/106) report either mild or marked decreased morale. Program innovations reported by program directors were catalogued and shared.
   Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has markedly impacted the perceived well-being and educational missions of radiology residency programs across the United States.

KW  - PEOPLE
KW  - SCALE
AB  - Background
   Nurse practitioners (NPs) play a critical role in the multidisciplinary management of patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Neurologists behavioral characteristics have been associated with suboptimal clinical decisions. However, limited information is available on their impact among NPs involved in MS care. The aim of this study was to assess nurses therapeutic choices to understand behavioral factors influencing their decision making process.
   Methods
   A non-interventional, cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted. NPs actively involved in the care of patients with MS were invited to participate in the study by the Spanish Society of Neurology Nursing. Participants answered questions regarding their standard practice and therapeutic management of seven simulated relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) case scenarios. A behavioral battery was used to measure participants ' life satisfaction, mood, positive social behaviors, feeling of helpfulness, attitudes toward adoption of evidence-based innovations, occupational burnout, and healthcare-related regret. The outcome of interest was therapeutic inertia (TI), defined as the lack of treatment escalation when there is clinical and radiological evidence of disease activity. A score to quantify TI was created based on the number of simulated scenarios where treatment intensification was warranted.
   Results
   Overall, 331 NPs were invited to participate, 130 initiated the study, and 96 (29%) completed the study. The mean age (SD) was 44.6 (9.8) years and 91.7% were female. Seventy-three participants (76.0%) felt their opinions had a significant influence on neurologists ' therapeutic decisions. Sixteen NPs (16.5%) showed severe emotional exhaustion related to work and 13 (13.5%) had depressive symptoms. The mean (SD) TI score was 0.97 (1.1). Fifty-six of NPs showed TI in at least one case scenario. Higher years of nursing experience (p = 0.014), feeling of helpfulness (p = 0.014), positive attitudes toward innovations (p = 0.046), and a higher intensity of care-related regret (p = 0.021) were associated with a lower risk of TI (adjusted R-2 = 0.28). Burnout was associated with higher risk of TI (p = 0.001).
   Conclusions
   Although NPs cannot prescribe MS treatments in Spain, their behavioral characteristics may influence the management of patients with RRMS. Continuing education and specific strategies for reducing occupational burnout may lead to better management skills and improve MS care.

AB  - Some students many not possess the necessary strategies and skills to meet the demands of academic life and develop negative attitudes, physical and mental exhaustion, and other attitudes that will undermine their personal and academic development. This study analyses the relationship and possible role of goal orientation as a mediator between engagement and academic self-concept. Methods: The study concerned a population of 1756 subjects from 12 secondary schools (ESO). The instruments used included the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale-Student (UWES-S), the Perception of Success Questionnaire (POSQ), and the Academic Self-Concept Scale (ASCS). Results: The results revealed significant correlations between academic engagement, task-oriented goal orientation, and academic self-concept. In addition, task orientation was found to play a positive mediating role between academic engagement and academic self-concept, leading to adaptive models in secondary school students. Conclusion: These results highlight the need to promote goal orientation in order to stimulate self-determined behaviours in the school environment and improved levels of academic self-concept, which in turn will facilitate the psychological and personal development of the student and increase the chances of academic success.

TI  - Rapid Systemwide Implementation of Outpatient Telehealth in Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT
LA  - English
AB  - EXECUTIVE SUMMARY The COVID-19 pandemic, with its resultant social distancing, has disrupted the delivery of healthcare for both patients and providers. Fortunately, changes to legislation and regulation in response to the pandemic allowed Emory Healthcare to rapidly implement telehealth care. Beginning in early March 2020 and continuing through the initial 2-month implementation period (when data collection stopped), clinicians received telehealth training and certification. Standard workflows created by means of a hub-and-spoke operational model enabled rapid sharing and deployment of best practices throughout the system's physician group practice. Lean process huddles facilitated successful implementation. In total, 2,374 healthcare professionals, including 986 attending physicians, 416 residents and fellows, and 555 advanced practice providers, were trained and certified for telehealth; 53,751 new- and established-patient audio-video telehealth visits and 10,539 established-patient telephone visits were performed in 8 weeks for a total of 64,290 virtual visits. This initiative included a new COVID-19 virtual patient clinic that saw 705 patients in a 6-week period. A total of $14,662,967 was charged during this time; collection rates were similar to in-person visits. Initial patient satisfaction scores were equivalent to in-person visits. We conclude that rapid deployment of virtual visits can be accomplished through a structured, organized approach including training, certification, and Lean principles. A hub-and-spoke model enables bidirectional feedback and timely improvements, thus facilitating swifter implementation and a quick rise in patient volume. Financial sustainability is achievable, but to sustain that, telehealth requires the support of continued deregulation by legislative and regulatory bodies.

AB  - Rationale and objectives: We aimed to create an open access online radiology podcast to educate listeners at any time, from anywhere. To meet learner needs and improve the likelihood of successful implementation and utilization, we assessed radiology trainee attitudes and experiences of podcasts.
   Materials and methods: We developed an educational podcast, From the Viewbox, focused on evergreen themes and practical approaches to radiology. Content categories included Diagnostic Approach, Specific Imaging Diagnoses, Noninterpretive Skills, and Special Topics. We released and promoted episodes on multiple digital platforms. Radiology trainees were surveyed and data were analyzed to assess listener preferences and usage trends. Results: Only 19% of our trainees had previously listened to a radiology podcast, yet 81% expressed interest in listening routinely. After initial release, 86% of trainees listened to the podcast and 62% listened routinely. Episodes gained the most plays immediately following release but retained and continued to attract more listeners. The most popular episode discussing COVID-19 diagnosis and imaging, emphasized the importance of selecting high yield content to match listener needs. Most trainees felt the podcast had "very high" or "high" value in educational value, accessibility, and time efficiency. Conclusions: From the Viewbox offers efficient and accessible audio-only learning modules that can be used independently or effectively paired with traditional resources to decrease barriers in radiology education and enhance learner productivity. Podcasting is an underutilized asynchronous remote learning tool that can help overcome current challenges of social distancing, and more importantly address the diverse preferences and needs of our learners.

AB  - Although social media have become important venues for right-wing populist (RWP) campaigns, the content, selection, and effects of RWP messages on social media remain largely unknown. Using content and panel analysis in two studies, we investigated the potential reciprocal relationship between RWP communication on social media and citizens? anti-immigrant attitudes, anti-elitist attitudes, and feelings of anger and anxiety. In Study 1, we analyzed 13,358 Facebook posts from German and Austrian political parties and their leading candidates. Among our results, RWP actors conveyed anti-immigrant and anti-elitist messages more often than non-RWP actors, and anti-immigrant messages especially induced negative emotional responses among followers of RWP actors. In Study 2, our analysis of data from a two-wave panel study with 559 respondents revealed that anti-immigrant attitudes drove selective exposure to RWP content on Facebook, which consequently fueled anti-immigrant attitudes, and that selective exposure to such content increased individuals? anti-elitist attitudes and anxiety.

AB  - Background: As a major life stressor now, the COVID-19 pandemic could substantially increase risks of cyberbullying and depression for global people, especially in the context of increased digital interconnectedness and strict social distancing. Though people are adopting different coping strategies, still little is known about their cyberbullying and depression and how the two associated with coping strategies.
   Methods: A web-based nationwide questionnaire survey was conducted among 5,608 netizens during the peak time of COVID-19 in China. The study collected cross-sectional data on participants' coping strategies, general cyberbullying behaviors, cyberbullying behaviors specifically to residents of Hubei Province where first COVID19 case was reported, and depression.
   Results: A two-factor structure applied to participants' coping strategies, namely problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping, and the former was more adopted. There existed gender, age, education, and income differences in the coping strategies. Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying behaviors while had no correlation with depression; emotion-focused coping was found positively correlated with cyberbullying and depression. The association between emotion-focused coping and depression was mediated by cyberbullying. Limitations: The study used cross-sectional design, and its findings should be cautioned to be generalized to other countries, due to the differences in culture, stage of crisis, and government policies on COVID-19.
   Conclusions: Problem-focused coping was associated with less cyberbullying, and emotion-focused coping predicted cyberbullying and depression. Cyberbullying mediated the correlation between emotion-focused coping and depression. These findings provide new perspectives for interventions on people's coping strategies towards COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This article analyses media representations of Lashawn Chan (dog) and Stevens Chan Kum Fai (human), who are considered the first recorded service animal-human team in Malaysia. The article reflects on the pair's public relationship as an intersectional, multi-framework that is relevant to both disability and animal justice. Following both critical animal and disability studies literature, we read media reports of Lashawn and Stevens' public encounters. These stories frame the pair as spectacle, threat, and resource. They reveal the influences of cultural and social conventions that utilise guide dogs as advocacy tools, as well as public attitudes towards guide dogs and their users in Malaysian and western contexts. The authors advocate for alternative representations based on interspecies interdependence.

AB  - The outbreak of COVID-19 has redefined how we carry out our daily activities with emphasis on safety measures like social distancing, the use of face masks and proper hygiene. With nursing personnel at the forefront of combating the menace created by this pandemic, the use of ICT has remained a vital technology that must be embraced by all in order to carry out a safe nursing practice. Therefore, becoming ICT compliant is no more an option to stay relevant and alive during this COVID era. This data article presents the outcome of a survey carried out among Moroccan nursing students. This was done with a view to assess their readiness and willingness to accept and use ICT as well as social media for learning and discharging their duties during and after this COVID era. Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model was adopted to structure the questionnaire items used in this survey. This was then administered to Moroccan nursing students via online Google forms. Seven hundred and two (702) respondents completed the questionnaire. After data screening and cleaning, normality assessment of the data was carried out in terms of skewness and kurtosis. Afterwards, Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to establish the statistical significance of the data in terms of the reflective indicator loadings, internal consistency reliability and convergence. This dataset includes the questionnaire used (in English and French), the responses obtained in spreadsheet format, the charts generated from the responses received, the SPSS file and the statistical analysis file. This dataset will help policy makers understand how nursing students use ICT and social media platforms and how these could be adopted as a more secure means of learning and discharging their during the COVID-19 era and beyond.

AB  - The recent approval of several COVID-19 vaccines signals progress toward controlling the pandemic. Although social distancing and masking have been effective, vaccines are an important additional measure of protection to reduce COVID-19 spread. Adequate uptake is essential to reach herd immunity, estimated to be approximately 67%. However, vaccine hesitancy, the fast-tracked nature of the COVID-19 vaccines, and misinformation circulating through various forms of media have contributed to lower vaccination intention than desired. The current research study developed an online survey conducted via Facebook to explore the attitudes and perceptions of adult Alabama residents about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines. Of the 3,781 respondents, only 44.3% reported intent to receive a vaccine, with a large proportion reporting they were unsure (28.1%). Lack of intention to vaccinate was associated with low educational attainment, low COVID-19 knowledge levels, low income, and African American race. The current survey also explored participants' influenza vaccine behavior as this information can also be used to inform successful COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Of the respondents, 56% report receiving the yearly influenza vaccine and the majority receive it at a pharmacy or healthcare provider office. This informs likely successful locations for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. Appropriate education targeted to populations most likely to refuse COVID-19 vaccination is essential to promote uptake. The information collected from the current study should be utilized to inform effective and efficient vaccine distribution strategies. (c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To investigate community and health-care workers'perspectives on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and on early pandemic responses during the first 2 weeks of national lockdown in Zimbabwe. Methods Rapid qualitative research was carried out between March and April 2020 via phone interviews with one representative from each of four community-based organizations and 16 health-care workers involved in a trial of community-based services for young people. In addition, information on COVID-19 was collected from social media platforms, news outlets and government announcements. Data were analysed thematically. Findings Four themes emerged: (i) individuals were overloaded with information but lacked trusted sources, which resulted in widespread fear and unanswered questions; (ii) communities had limited ability to comply with prevention measures, such as social distancing, because access to long-term food supplies and water at home was limited and because income had to be earned daily; (iii) health-care workers perceived themselves to be vulnerable and undervalued because of a shortage of personal protective equipment and inadequate pay; and (iv) other health conditions were sidelined because resources were redirected, with potentially wide-reaching implications. Conclusion It is important that prevention measures against COVID-19 are appropriate for the local context. In Zimbabwe, communities require support with basic needs and access to reliable information to enable them to follow prevention measures. In addition, health-care workers urgently need personal protective equipment and adequate salaries. Essential health-care services and medications for conditions other than COVID-19 must also continue to be provided to help reduce excess mortality and morbidity.

AB  - Objective: To describe the effects of stay-at-home orders and social distancing during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak on mental health and to compare these outcomes between individuals with normal weight and overweight.
   Methods: This cross-sectional study included 1857 Brazilian adults, who were invited through social media to answer an online questionnaire from 5 May 2020 to 17 May 2020. The instrument included questions related to health behaviour, mental health (anxiety, depression, self-esteem, sadness and stress) and overall health. Overweight was defined as body mass index (BMI) >= 25 Kg/m(2). Multiple logistic regression was conducted to identify whether overweight is associated with mental health variables.
   Results: Women reported increased anxiety (36.5% vs 22.2%, P < .01), depression (16.2% vs 8.8%, P < .01), low self-esteem (19.8% vs 10.6%, P < .01), sadness (17.7% vs 10.2%, P < .01), and stress (29.5% vs 19.3%, P < .01) relative to men. Women with overweight are more likely to report higher feeling of anxiety (OR 1.62, CI 95% 1.22-2.14), depression (OR 1.79, CI 95% 1.25-2.55), low self-esteem (OR 1.82, CI95% 1.28-2.58) and sadness (OR 1.51, CI 95% 1.08-2.10), adjusted for age, social isolation days, educational level, chronic diseases, smoke, alcohol intake and physical activity.
   Conclusion: Women, specially those with overweight are more vulnerable to the deleterious effects of stay-at-home orders on mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose The aim of the study is to determine the perception of general public on the Serbian police behaviors in combating COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the perception of the citizens how successful the police units were in fulfilling their tasks. Design/methodology/approach Due to the state of emergency declared due to COVID-19 pandemic, in particular the restriction of movement and the need for social distance, the data collection for this study had to be conducted via the online survey platform (Google.doc). The study was conducted during March-April 2020, only four weeks after the state of emergency was declared. The participants were invited to complete the online questionnaire in their native language by using the snowball sampling strategy focused on recruiting the general public via social media tools. Findings Considering the fact that police officers are not sufficiently prepared and trained to respond in these specific circumstances, it is necessary to improve their engagement in the future by conducting appropriate training, procuring adequate resources, implementing adequate planning activities, etc. The results of the multivariate regressions of public perception preparedness subscale show that the most important predictor is gender and it explains 23.6% of the variance in preparedness subscale. The remaining variables did not have significant effects on preparedness. This model with all mentioned independent variables explains 6.1% of the variance of preparedness subscale. Originality/value Bearing in mind that there were no completed studies on public perception of police behaviors about the COVID-19 disaster in Serbia, the research has a considerable scientific and social importance.

AB  - Social media is one of the most contextually based media ever created. As such, the effects anticipated by priming theory would be expected to be especially strong. Using an online experiment, this study assessed the effects of linguistic tone and message relatedness present in the context of social media on publics' attitudes towards organizations. It was expected that positive and negative tone would have positive and negative effects, respectively, and that the relatedness of the contextual prime would enhance those effects. About 100 participants in the study were randomly assigned to an experimental group to see a prime in the format of the popular social media site, Twitter. An analysis of the results showed that only negative primes had a significant effect on publics' attitudes towards organizations, possibly reflecting an expectancy violation effect. Public relations professionals are called to engage in broader environmental monitoring to ensure their messages will be most effective. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article aims to add to the relatively small body of literature on online hatred. In particular, it focuses on the role social networking sites may play in the development of polarisation, by exploring how online users respond to explicit online hate materials. Specifically, this article discusses the ways in which a self-selected sample of YouTube users responded, via posting online comments, to a video clip in which a White female train passenger (called Emma) could be seen to racially to abuse other passengers. Thematic analysis of the YouTube comments identified four main themes: (1) Making Sense of Emma, which encapsulated posters' attempts to find explanations for Emma's behaviour; (2) Meeting Hatred with Hatred, which described posters' attempts to oppose Emma's racism by means of resorting to aggressive, hateful language; (3) Us versus Them, which encapsulated posters' tendencies to categorise themselves and other posters into in- and outgroups, based on their particular stance on racism; (4) Contesting Britishness, which expressed posters' attempts to articulate (and contest) what it means to be British. Whilst the current analysis provides some evidence that hateful web content can fuel aggressive and hateful responses, many of the comments analysed here emphasised common group membership, alongside people's right to claim membership in a particular social category (i.e. Britishness). The current evidence, therefore, suggests that, at least in the specific context of this study, hateful web content may not necessarily lead to an automatic endorsement or escalation of hatred.

AB  - A core assumption often heard in public health discourse is that increasing trust in national political leaders is essential for securing public health compliance during crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic (2019-ongoing). However, studies of national government trust are typically too coarse-grained to differentiate between trust in institutions versus more interpersonal trust in political leaders. Here, we present multiscale trust measurements for twelve countries and territories across the West, Oceania and East Asia. These trust results were used to identify which specific domains of government and social trust were most crucial for securing public health compliance (frequency of mask wearing and social distancing) and understanding the reasons for following health measures (belief in effectiveness of public health measures). Through the use of linear regression and structural equation modeling, our cross-cultural survey-based analysis (N = 3369 subjects) revealed that higher trust in national and local public health institutions was a universally consistent predictor of public health compliance, while trust in national political leaders was not predictive of compliance across cultures and geographical regions. Institutional trust was mediated by multiple types of transparency, including providing rationale, securing public feedback, and honestly expressing uncertainty. These results highlight the importance of distinguishing between components of government trust, to better understand which entities the public gives the most attention to during crises.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic mandated rapid transition from face-to-face encounters to teleneurology visits. While teleneurology is regularly used in acute stroke care, its application in other branches of neurology was limited. Here we review how the recent pandemic has created a paradigm shift in caring for patients with chronic neurological disorders and how academic institutions have responded to the present need.
   Method: Literature review was performed to examine the recent changes in health policies. Number of outpatient visits and televisits in the Department of Neurology was reviewed from Yale University School of Medicine and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine to examine the road to transition to televisit.
   Results: The federal government and the insurance providers extended their supports during the COVID-19 pandemic. Several rules and regulations regarding teleneurology were revised and relaxed to address the current need. New technologies for video conferencing were incorporated. The transition to televisits went smoothly in both the institutions and number of face-to-face encounters decreased dramatically along with a rapid rise in televisits within 2 weeks of the declaration of national emergency.
   Conclusion and relevance: The need for "social distancing" during the COVID-19 pandemic has created a major surge in the number of teleneurology visits, which will probably continue for the next few months. It may have initiated a more permanent transition to virtual technology incorporated medical care.

   The article conducts a detailed and robust analysis of the social and attitudinal underpinnings of general support for the war in Afghanistan.
   The article contributes to scholarly understanding of public attitudes in Britain on foreign policy issues and to the wider literature on public opinion and war.
   The findings underline the long-standing 'gender gap' in attitudes to war, with men more in favour.
   Labour partisanship and political knowledge are directly related to support for the war, though there is only weak evidence that the effects of partisanship are mediated via political knowledge.
   This article analyses the micro-level factors affecting public opinion in Britain towards the long-running war in Afghanistan, a major foreign policy issue in the post-9-11 era. It examines the effects of social and attitudinal factors, including perceptions of how the war is going. There is a strong evidence of a 'gender gap', with men more in favour, while those with higher educational attainment are more supportive. Perceptions of the war's progress play a strong role in shaping general support. Labour partisans are more supportive while political knowledge is positively-related to support for the war. There is weaker evidence that the effects of partisanship are mediated via political knowledge. This article contributes to the scholarly understanding of public attitudes in Britain on foreign policy issues and to the wider literature on public opinion and military intervention.

AB  - The present research examines whether the perceived uniqueness of one's thoughts and salience of uniqueness motivations can influence attitude strength and resistance. Participants who rated their thoughts as relatively unique formed attitudes that showed greater correspondence with behavioral intentions to act on the attitude (Study 1). In Study 2, participants who recalled a previous purchase motivated by the desire to be unique (versus to fit in) after generating message counterarguments were less persuaded (more resistant) and reported greater willingness to act on their (negative) attitude. Moreover, attitudes mediated the effect of the purchase manipulation on intentions to act on the attitude.

AB  - The current study explored the differential roles of dimensions of body image (i.e., affective, cognitive, and behavioral) among a sample of 101 young adults (72.3% female, M=19.45; S.D.=1.28) who reported having engaged in non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), and a matched comparison group of young adults who did not. A mediational model of NSSI was tested, based on the hypothesis that emotion dysregulation would mediate the relationship between dimensions of body image and engagement in NSSI. Preliminary examination of the variables revealed that negative attitudes, suicide-related rumination, and behavioral practices associated with physical appearance significantly differentiated young adults who reported having engaged in NSSI and those who did not, regardless of gender. Path analytic modeling provided partial support for the proposed mediational model, with significant direct and indirect effects between dimensions of body image and NSSI through emotion dysregulation. Discussion focuses on the importance of understanding the differential roles of dimensions of body image and emotion dysregulation as intrapersonal risk factors related to NSSI engagement.

AB  - As the relationship between Cuba and the United States evolves, many Americans are entertaining the idea of travel to Cuba. This study used the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine predictors of US residents' intentions to travel to Cuba across three time horizons: 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years. TPB constructs were administered to a cross-sectional panel of US residents. Results varied by time horizon, with US residents' negative attitudes toward Cuba having a positive and significant influence on their intention to visit Cuba within one year. This finding suggests that some US residents match Plog's Allocentric profile of tourists and that the current rough edges of Cuba are what attract them to travel in the short rather than long term. Findings from this study provide baseline data that is valuable for Cuban and American tourism organizations, should the US market become more accessible.

AB  - What are the microlevel mechanisms that explain citizens' support of populist social movements? We address this question by focusing on the 'PEGIDA' (Patriotic Europeans against the Islamization of the Occident) protest groups in Germany, which became particularly prominent by attracting large numbers of attendees in street protests during the years 2015/16. We develop and test an integrative theoretical model that points to the key roles of anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction as mediators linking subjective socioeconomic deprivation with citizens' support of the 'Pegida'-movement. Equally important, this model holds that citizens' political dissatisfaction moderates the nexus between anti-immigrant attitudes and support for 'Pegida'. The results based on data from seven cross-sectional general population surveys provide clear support for these predictions. Combined, these efforts help to advance scholarly understanding of not only why, but also how and under what conditions non-activist citizens support anti-immigrant collective action as exemplified by the 'Pegida' movement.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 continues to mutate with the emergence of new variants. Variant B.1.617.2 (Delta) is a variant of concern with evidence of increased transmission, more severe disease, decreased effectiveness of treatment or vaccines, or failure of diagnostic detection. In this article, we report on the clinical and biological picture of the first confirmed delta variant COVID-19 infection in Indonesia. From May 31 to June 17, we identified ten cases with confirmed delta variant COVID-19 infection admitted to a tertiary academic hospital in Jakarta. All subjects that have been vaccinated presented with mild-moderate disease. Most patients present with initial respiratory complaints, without radiological abnormalities on chest x-ray examination, and an increase in C-reactive protein. Seven out of ten patients have been vaccinated; the three patients who had not been vaccinated experienced severe COVID-19 symptoms, two of whom died. Due to the increased transmission of this variant, we recommend vaccination, wearing a mask, and social distancing to reduce the impact of infection with delta variant B.1,617.2.

AB  - Media reports suggest that the tabletop roleplaying game Dungeons & Dragons saw its biggest year to date in 2020, with many such reports touting the interactive and social benefits for people facing COVID-19 lockdowns. This paper explores the reported challenges and benefits of playing D&D through teleconferencing hardware and software, and the experience of using virtual tabletops. A thematic analysis of a sample of Reddit threads discussing player experiences of transitioning D&D to remote play during COVID-19 social distancing was undertaken. The findings highlight a variety of player attitudes and preferences towards playing D&D remotely. The data suggest a mostly negative sentiment towards playing D&D online for groups that had transitioned from in-person to remote play. Loss of in-person socialisation was identified as an important contributor to a poor play experience, but groups would persevere with remote play to maintain social relationships, suggesting that, for many players, D&D serves an important social function beyond mere play. Some avenues for future research are identified.

AB  - The refugee crisis and the rising number of asylum seekers is one of the primary concerns of the EU. Political discussions reflect humanitarian, social and economic implications of the constant influx of new asylum seekers coming mainly from Syria. Within the political sphere in the V4 countries it is possible to observe negative attitudes. In this context, it is very important to emphasize that we are living in a democratic society, where media represent the role of democracy guardians. On the other hand, social media offer space for expression to the general public opinions, and their potential is also fully exploited by political leaders. The potential of social media must be perceived also against the backdrop of risks stemming mainly from disinformation and manipulative tendencies. In order to identify and clarify the presence of manipulative techniques in the communication of political and social groups to the attitudes of Generation Y in the sphere of migrant tolerance we present some introductory findings under the scope of project VEGA 1/0192/18.

AB  - Background & aims: Depression is a common and sometimes severe form of mental illness, and public attitudes towards depression can impact the psychological and social functioning of depressed patients. The purpose of the present study was to investigate public attitudes toward depression and three-year trends in these attitudes using big data analysis of social media posts in China.
   Methods: A search of publically available Sina Weibo posts from January 2014 to July 2017 identified 20,129 hot posts with the keyword term "depression". We first used a Chinese Linguistic Psychological Text Analysis System (TextMind) to analyze linguistic features of the posts. And, then we used topic models to conduct semantic content analysis to identify specific themes in Weibo users' attitudes toward depression.
   Results: Linguistic features analysis showed a significant increase over time in the frequency of terms related to affect, positive emotion, anger, cognition (including the subcategory of insight), and conjunctions. Semantic content analysis identified five common themes: severe effects of depression, stigma, combating stigma, appeals for understanding, and providing support. There was a significant increase over time in references to social (as opposed to professional) support, and a significant decrease over time in references to the severe consequences of depression.
   Conclusions: Big data analysis of Weibo posts is likely to provide less biased information than other methods about the public's attitudes toward depression. The results suggest that although there is ongoing stigma about depression, there is also an upward trend in mentions of social support for depressed persons. A supervised learning statistical model can be developed in future research to provide an even more precise analysis of specific attitudes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Social distancing restrictions due to COVID-19 challenged our ability to educate incoming surgery interns who depend on early simulation training for basic skill acquisition. This study aimed to create a profi-ciency-based laparoscopic skills curriculum using remote learning.
   DESIGN: Content experts designed 5 surgical tasks to address hand-eye coordination, depth perception, and precision cutting. A scoring formula was used to mea-sure performance: cutoff time -completion time -(K  pound errors) = score; the constant K was determined for each task. As a benchmark for proficiency, a fellowship-trained laparoscopic surgeon performed 3 consecutive repetitions of each task; proficiency was defined as the surgeon's mean score minus 2 standard deviations. To train remotely, PGY1 surgery residents (n = 29) were each issued a donated portable laparoscopic training box, task explanations, and score sheets. Remote train-ing included submitting a pre-test video, self-training to proficiency, and submitting a post-test video. Construct validity (expert vs. trainee pre-tests) and skill acquisition (trainee pre-tests vs. post-tests) were compared using a Wilcoxon test (median [IQR] reported).
   SETTING: The University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, Texas
   PARTICIPANTS: Surgery interns
   RESULTS: Expert and trainee pre-test performance was significantly different for all tasks, supporting construct validity. One trainee was proficient at pre-test. After 1 month of self-training, 7 additional residents achieved proficiency on all 5 tasks after 2-18 repetitions; trainee post-test scores were significantly improved versus pre-test on all tasks (p = 0.01).
   CONCLUSIONS: This proficiency-based curriculum demonstrated construct validity, was feasible as a remote teaching option, and resulted in significant skill acquisi-tion. The remote format, including video-based perfor-mance assessment, facilitates effective at-home learning and may allow additional innovations such as video-based coaching for more advanced curricula.

AB  - Background: End-stage kidney disease patients on dialysis are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection due to comorbidities, age, and logistic constraints of dialysis making social distancing difficult. We describe our experience with hospitalized dialysis patients with COVID-19 and factors associated with mortality. Methods: From March 1, 2020, to May 31, 2020, all dialysis patients admitted to 4 Emory Hospitals and tested for COVID-19 were identified. Sociodemographic information and clinical and laboratory data were obtained from the medical record. Death was defined as an in-hospital death or transfer to hospice for end-of-life care. Patients were followed until discharge or death. Results: Sixty-four dialysis patients with COVID-19 were identified. Eighty-four percent were African-American. The median age was 64 years, and 59% were males. Four patients were on peritoneal dialysis, and 60 were on hemodialysis for a median time of 3.8 years, while 31% were obese. Fever (72%), cough (61%), and diarrhea (22%) were the most common symptoms at presentation. Thirty-three percent required admission to intensive care unit, and 23% required mechanical ventilation. The median length of stay was 10 days, while 11 patients (17%) died during hospitalization and 17% were discharged to a temporary rehabilitation facility. Age >65 years (RR 13.7, CI: 1.9-100.7), C-reactive protein >100 mg/dL (RR 8.3, CI: 1.1-60.4), peak D-dimer >3,000 ng/mL (RR 4.3, CI: 1.03-18.2), bilirubin >1 mg/dL (RR 3.9, CI: 1.5-10.4), and history of peripheral vascular disease (RR 3.2, CI: 1.2-9.1) were associated with mortality. Dialysis COVID-19-infected patients were more likely to develop thromboembolic complications than those without COVID-19 (RR 3.7, CI: 1.3-10.1). Conclusion: In a predominantly African-American population, the mortality of end-stage kidney disease patients admitted with COVID-19 infection was 17%. Age, C-reactive protein, D-dimer, bilirubin, and history of peripheral vascular disease were associated with worse survival.

AB  - Objectives Previous pandemics have resulted in significant consequences for mental health. Here, we report the mental health sequelae of the COVID-19 pandemic in a UK cohort and examine modifiable and non-modifiable explanatory factors associated with mental health outcomes. We focus on the first wave of data collection, which examined short-term consequences for mental health, as reported during the first 4-6 weeks of social distancing measures being introduced.
   Design Cross-sectional online survey.
   Setting Community cohort study.
   Participants N=3097 adults aged >= 18 years were recruited through a mainstream and social media campaign between 3 April 2020 and 30 April 2020. The cohort was predominantly female (n=2618); mean age 44 years; 10% (n=296) from minority ethnic groups; 50% (n=1559) described themselves as key workers and 20% (n=649) identified as having clinical risk factors putting them at increased risk of COVID-19.
   Main outcome measures Depression, anxiety and stress scores.
   Results Mean scores for depression (x-=7.69, SD=6.0), stress (x-=6.48, SD=3.3) and anxiety (x-= 6.48, SD=3.3) significantly exceeded population norms (all p<0.0001). Analysis of non-modifiable factors hypothesised to be associated with mental health outcomes indicated that being younger, female and in a recognised COVID-19 risk group were associated with increased stress, anxiety and depression, with the final multivariable models accounting for 7%-14% of variance. When adding modifiable factors, significant independent effects emerged for positive mood, perceived loneliness and worry about getting COVID-19 for all outcomes, with the final multivariable models accounting for 54%-57% of total variance.
   Conclusions Increased psychological morbidity was evident in this UK sample and found to be more common in younger people, women and in individuals who identified as being in recognised COVID-19 risk groups. Public health and mental health interventions able to ameliorate perceptions of risk of COVID-19, worry about COVID-19 loneliness and boost positive mood may be effective.

AB  - This research examined the impact of a crisis on product attitudes and emotions of consumers in Norway and Russia, and the effectiveness of crisis marketing communication using authority endorsement across and within the two countries. Our research shows that not only are different communication strategies effective in the two markets, but also that those that work well in one country may actually worsen the crisis and lead to more negative attitudes and emotions in the other country. We conclude that research needs to incorporate country-level, individual-level dimensions of culture and consumer emotions in order to develop optimal marketing communication strategies.

AB  - Background: This paper explores the serendipity of residents accessing adequate food and fluids in aged care facilities. It draws on the findings of two discrete but interrelated research projects conducted in 2009 and 2011 relating to the experience of living in, or having a friend or family member living in, residential aged care.
   Methods: Participants were recruited through media outlets. Indepth interviews with participants were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed.
   Findings: This paper discusses a theme that was iterated by participants in both projects that is, the difficulty residents in aged care facilities experienced in receiving adequate and acceptable food and fluids. Unacceptable dining room experiences, poor quality food and excessive food hygiene regulations contributed to iatrogenic malnutrition and dehydration. Implications for staffing, clinical supervision, education of carers and the impact of negative attitudes to older people are discussed.
   Conclusion: The inability of dependent residents in aged care facilities to receive adequate nourishment and hydration impacts on their health and their rights as a resident, and is an ongoing issue in Australian residential aged care.

AB  - The Internet brings new opportunities and challenges to scientific development and science communication. Previous studies overwhelmingly focused on individual-level Internet factors but overlooked the potential explanatory strength of Internet context. This study addresses the existing gap by examining how the Internet influences Chinese people's scientific optimism from a comprehensive perspective (Internet as a medium and Internet as a context). Multilevel models were built based on individual-provincial merged data. The results indicate that (1) the Internet context impairs scientific optimism while Internet exposure has no significant effect. (2) The relationship between individual Internet exposure and scientific optimism varies by province. As a quantitative indicator of Internet context, Internet penetration mitigates the weakening effect of individual Internet exposure on scientific optimism. This research provides empirical evidence on scientific attitude formation in the non-Western environment and expands the analytic approach of public attitudes toward science.

AB  - The aim of this work was to study attitudes toward people with disabilities from the viewpoint of the integrated threat theory of prejudice. This theory postulates that threat may cause negative attitudes toward a group and posits that such threat may come from different sources. To test this model, a study was carried out with high school students (N = 228), which included social dominance orientation (SDO) as antecedent variable. Perceived threat for resources and intergroup anxiety were the mediating threats investigated in this process. Results showed support for the theory: Perceived threat for resources and intergroup anxiety seemed to be effective mediators. SDO also appeared as a potent antecedent predictor of attitudes toward people with physical disabilities.

AB  - With increasing numbers of laparoscopic hysterectomies, surgical trainees are compelled to learn more about endoscopy. Owing to coronavirus disease-related social distancing requirements, online education has gained prominence. Here, we aimed to investigate the laparoscopic hysterectomy video quality on YouTube using the LAParoscopic surgery Video Educational GuidelineS (LAP-VEGaS). YouTube was searched on June 7, 2020 using 'laparoscopic hysterectomy'. Three examiners evaluated videos using Global Operative Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS). Subsequently, videos were assessed for their conformity to the LAP-VEGaS and LAP-VEGaS Video Assessment Tool. Interobserver reliability was estimated using intraclass coefficients and Cronbach's alpha. Cochran's Q test was used to determine correlations among quantitative data. The median GOALS score was 21.50. The observers' GOALS scores were significantly correlated. The results showed low conformity to the LAP-VEGaS. YouTube is the most used platform among trainees. The low YouTube video educational quality highlights the necessity for peer review, as trainees increasingly seek such resources during the pandemic.IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? YouTube is the most commonly used online resource for educational material among surgical trainees. Online videos usually do not undergo a peer-review process. The LAParoscopic surgery Video Educational GuidelineS (LAP-VEGaS) may be used to assess the educational quality of surgical videos. What do the results of this study add? To our knowledge, this is the first study on the quality of laparoscopic hysterectomy videos available on YouTube and the first study to evaluate YouTube laparoscopic surgery videos using the LAP-VEGaS Video Assessment Tool (VAT). Our study revealed the low educational quality of YouTube laparoscopic hysterectomy videos. The LAP-VEGaS VAT seems to be a valid and practical tool for assessing online laparoscopic hysterectomy videos. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Medical communities, especially tertiary care or academic centres, may upload educational peer-reviewed videos for trainees seeking this type of resource, especially during the coronavirus disease pandemic, as surgical education alternatives are limited.

AB  - Celebrities saturate American culture and often become relevant in politics, yet political science has largely left unstudied how celebrities affect mass political behavior. We focus on the 2015 story of Caitlyn Jenner revealing her transgender identity. Using an original nationally representative survey from that summer, we examine whether following the Jenner story and evaluations of its social significance affected attitudes toward transgender rights policies. Specifically, we examine how age and transphobia interacted with engagement with the Jenner story to shape attitudes toward transgender rights. We find, counterintuitively, that older respondents who were more transphobic were less likely to see her story as representing negative social trends if they followed it in the media. Furthermore, more transphobic older respondents were more likely to support pro-transgender policies if they viewed Jenner's story less negatively. We then discuss the implications of our findings for research on celebrity effects on politics and transgender rights.

AB  - Past studies have documented the significant relationships between personality traits and voter turnout, but we know less about whether personality traits influence individual vote choices. This study examines whether such attitudinal factors as party identification, feeling thermometers toward the candidates, policy preferences and executive approval mediate the effects of personality traits on vote choice in the United States. Using data from ANES 2012, this study finds no direct relationship between personality traits and vote choice. More importantly, the results reveal that through previously mentioned attitudinal factors, higher levels of extraversion, conscientiousness and emotional stability indirectly decrease the probability of voting for Obama, whereas a higher level of openness to experience indirectly increases the probability of voting for Obama. Nevertheless, agreeableness only exerts an indirect, positive influence on vote choice via executive approval. Overall, this study provides insight into the relationship between personality traits and vote choice and makes up for the insufficiency in the study of personality and voting behavior.

AB  - Purpose The aims of this paper are to explore the rise of cyberhate on the Zoom video conferencing platform at the outset of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to examine victimized cases of Zoombombing where it was used as a cyberhate tool. The COVID-19 pandemic has not only impacted our lives and modes of working and studying, but also created new environments for cybercriminals to engage in cybercrime, cyberhate and hacking by exploiting tools such as Zoom. This new phenomenon called "Zoombombing" was first reported in mid-March 2020, when the social distancing and stay-at-home policies in the United States were nationally introduced. Design/methodology/approach This research conducted a news media content analysis on cases of Zoombombing. To conduct this analysis empirically, a dataset with all of the reported Zoombombing cases from March to April 2020 was created. Google Trends, news media and tweets were used to analyze Zoombombing as a form of cyberhate, particularly digital racism. Findings The results reveal prevalent Zoom-mediated racism toward Asian Americans, African Americans and Jewish Americans. This study understands Zoombombing from a sociopolitical/cultural perspective through news reporting of victimized cases and explores various ways that Zoombombing shapes, mediates, transforms and escalates racism. Originality/value This study is one of the very first studies to analyze Zoombombing in a way that builds upon an emerging body of literature on cyberhate. This paper considers Zoom as a space where curious young people, cybercriminals, extremists and hackers impose their ideologies and beliefs upon newly established online learning and working environments and engage in a struggle for identity recognition in the midst of increasingly accessible vulnerable software and cyberspace.

AB  - With service robots becoming more ubiquitous in social life, interaction design needs to adapt to novice users and the associated uncertainty in the first encounter with this technology in new emerging environments. Trust in robots is an essential psychological prerequisite to achieve safe and convenient cooperation between users and robots. This research focuses on psychological processes in which user dispositions and states affect trust in robots, which in turn is expected to impact the behavior and reactions in the interaction with robotic systems. In a laboratory experiment, the influence of propensity to trust in automation and negative attitudes toward robots on state anxiety, trust, and comfort distance toward a robot were explored. Participants were approached by a humanoid domestic robot two times and indicated their comfort distance and trust. The results favor the differentiation and interdependence of dispositional, initial, and dynamic learned trust layers. A mediation from the propensity to trust to initial learned trust by state anxiety provides an insight into the psychological processes through which personality traits might affect interindividual outcomes in human-robot interaction (HRI). The findings underline the meaningfulness of user characteristics as predictors for the initial approach to robots and the importance of considering users' individual learning history regarding technology and robots in particular.

AB  - This article explores how computers and the Internet are represented among young, educated people in Niger and the social expectations that are attached to their use. It argues that pre-existing social and economic conditions play an important role in shaping the meanings associated with these devices. Thus, in a context of poverty and unemployment, the Internet and computers are perceived as technologies that may help young people and their country integrate into a modern world of economic opportunities and well-being via the transnational and transcultural interactions that take place in cyberspace. The Internet is associated with the ideas of modernity and 'leapfrogging' development. However, because of the lack of computer equipment and adequate infrastructure, these expectations are largely exaggerated, and they divert attention from the actual possibilities for change that reside in people and not in technological devices. The research is based on fieldwork conducted among young, educated computer and Internet users during the summers of 2003 and 2004 in Niamey, the capital city of Niger and further complemented by data collected in 2008. Semistructured interviews were used to explore the reception of the Internet and the representations associated with them. Although the term 'educated' may sometimes refer to traditional or Arabic/Islamic education in Niger, we restricted the use of the word to refer to modern western-style education (without prejudice or pejorative label to those who are not in that category).

AB  - Background: The literature shows that mathematical achievement can be influenced by affective factors, metacognitive abilities, and personality traits. The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between mathematical achievement, mathematical anxiety, perfectionism, and metacognitive abilities in a sample of secondary school students.
   Method: The sample was composed of 272 students of secondary school, 43.8% males, and 56.3%, with an average age of 12.08 (SD=.89). The Evaluate Metacognition, Negative Attitudes, and Mathematics Anxiety, and the Almost Perfect Scale were administered, while the data on academic performance in mathematics was based on the average scores earned on written tests across all participants during the current school year. Correlational and path analyses were performed.
   Results: The results showed significant correlations between the variables investigated. Furthermore, mathematics achievement was positively predicted by control in performing, mathematics attitudes, beliefs related to mathematics, and adaptive perfectionism, while it was negatively predicted by math anxiety, and maladaptive perfectionism.
   Conclusion: This study has important educational implications for teachers as it highlights the role of metacognitive, affective, and personality factors in the learning and achievement of mathematics.

AB  - Journalists tend to serialize political scandals and publish scandalous information bit by bit instead of all at once in a single news article. Disseminating scandalous information in a serialized way may affect readers' perceptions of the scandal and the politicians involved in it independently of the information that is conveyed. To test this assumption, an experiment was conducted. All participants were exposed to identical scandalous information. However, the form of presentation-exposure to one, two, three, four, or five article(s)-was systematically manipulated. Serialization indeed indirectly increased participants' negative attitudes about the politician via the perceived scandal's importance, participants' reading duration, cognitive elaboration, and intensity of negative emotions.

AB  - The containment measures for the COVID-19 pandemic, including social distancing, lockdown or quarantining, have led to a paradigm shift in people's life. In the wake of the pandemic, many people have begun adopting technology as a way to maintain their daily activities and limit face-to-face human interactions. While the pandemic has facilitated the widespread use of technology, little attention has been paid to how consumers' intention to continue using technology is affected by their rational evaluation and habitual response, simultaneously. To address this knowledge gap, this study employs the expectation-confirmation model as a theoretical lens to propose the research model and explain the antecedents of technology continuance intention from both perspectives of conscious versus unconscious responses. The conscious response is reflected in perceived value and satisfaction, whereas the unconscious response is characterized as habit. The proposed research model and hypotheses are supported by the data collected from 308 online food delivery service users. Our results show that habit is driven by perceived value and satisfaction, and then mediates the effects of them on continuance intention. Moreover, habit exerts the strongest effect on continuance intention and weakens the importance of perceived value as well as satisfaction to continuance intention. This study is expected to set the theoretical foundation for more future research that focus on the exploration of the conscious versus unconscious nature of consumers' technology continuance. The study concludes with practical implications and suggestions for catering businesses and relevant stakeholders.

T2  - JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH
LA  - English
AB  - Background Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza are prevalent seasonal community viruses. Although not completely understood, SARS-CoV-2 may have the same means of transmission. Preventive social measures aimed at preventing SARS-CoV-2 spread could impact transmission of other respiratory viruses as well. The aim of this study is to report the detection of RSV and influenza during the period of social distancing due to COVID-19 pandemic in a heavily affected community.
   Methods Prospective study with pediatric and adult populations seeking care for COVID-19-like symptoms during the fall and winter of 2020 at two hospitals in Southern Brazil. RT-PCR tests for SARS-CoV-2, influenza A (Flu A), influenza B (Flu B) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was performed for all participants.
   Results 1435 suspected COVID-19 participants (1137 adults, and 298 children). were included between May and August. Median age was 37.7 years (IQR = 29.6-47.7), and 4.92 years (IQR = 1.96-9.53), for the adult and child cohorts, respectively. SARS-CoV-2 was positive in 469 (32.7%) while influenza and RSV were not detected at all.
   Conclusions Measures to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission likely exerted a huge impact in the spread of alternate respiratory pathogens. These findings contribute to the knowledge about the dynamics of virus spread. Further, it may be considered for guiding therapeutic choices for these other viruses.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19 has had a huge impact on the physical behavior and mental health of people. Long-term and strict isolation policies are widely used to ensure social distancing, which may cause excessive smartphone use and increase the risk of smartphone addiction. Previous researchers have identified that some factors that affect smartphone addiction, but there was little research conducted during COVID-19 pandemic. The present study aims to examine the effect of peer phubbing on smartphone addiction, how boredom proneness may mediate this effect, and lastly how refusal self-efficacy may moderate the indirect and direct pathways during COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A total of 1396 college students (mean age=20.48, SD=1.08) were surveyed and completed four scales (Peer Phubbing Scale, Refusal Self-efficacy Scale, Smartphone Addiction Index Scale, Boredom Proneness Scale). The statistical analyses were conducted by SPSS 22.0 and SPSS PROCESS macro.
   Results: This study found that peer phubbing was positively associated with smartphone addiction. Boredom proneness mediated the effect of peer phubbing and smartphone addiction. Furthermore, refusal self-efficacy moderated the relationship between peer phubbing and smartphone addiction as well as boredom proneness and smartphone addiction. Specifically, peer phubbing had a greater impact on smartphone addiction for college students with higher levels of refusal self-efficacy, and the boredom proneness on smartphone addiction was stronger for college students with low levels of refusal self-efficacy.
   Conclusion: This study is important in investigating how peer phubbing is related to the smartphone addiction of Chinese college students during COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that college students' boredom proneness and refusal self-efficacy may be prime targets for prevention and intervention programs. Thus, this study explored "how" and "when" peer phubbing may enhance college students' smartphone addiction during COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Few studies examine intercultural relations in emerging adulthood. Framed from the perspective of the Mutual Intercultural Relations in Plural Societies (MIRIPS) project, the current paper examined the mediating role of tolerance and perceived consequences of immigration in the relationship between multicultural ideology and attitudes towards immigrants. Additionally, the moderating role of context was analysed. A two-group structural equation modelling was performed on data collected from 305 Italian emerging adults living both in northern and in southern Italy with different socio-political climates towards immigrants. In both groups, tolerance and perceived consequences of immigration mediated the relationship between multicultural ideology and attitudes towards immigrants. Also, this indirect relationship was significantly higher for the northern than southern Italians. These findings provide provisional evidence of mediating and moderating processes in the relationship between multicultural ideology and attitudes towards immigrants and suggest important implications for practitioners interested in promoting intercultural relations among emerging adults.

AB  - Drawn from the stress process model, the pandemic has imposed substantial stress to individual economic and mental well-being and has brought unprecedented disruptions to social life. In light of social distancing measures, and in particular physical distancing because of lockdown policies, the use of digital technologies has been regarded as the alternative to maintain economic and social activities. This paper aims to describe the design and implementation of an online survey created as an urgent, international response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The online survey described here responds to the need of understanding the effects of the pandemic on social interactions/relations and to provide findings on the extent to which digital technology is being utilized by citizens across different communities and countries around the world. It also aims to analyze the association of use of digital technologies with psychological well-being and levels of loneliness. The data will be based on the ongoing survey (comprised of several existing and validated instruments on digital use, psychological well-being and loneliness), open for 3 months after roll out (ends September) across 11 countries (Austria, France, Germany, India, Malta, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Turkey, and UK). Participants include residents aged 18 years and older in the countries and snowball sampling is employed via social media platforms. We anticipate that the findings of the survey will provide useful and much needed information on the prevalence of use and intensities of digital technologies among different age groups, gender, socioeconomic groups in a comparative perspective. Moreover, we expect that the future analysis of the data collected will show that different types of digital technologies and intensities of use are associated with psychological well-being and loneliness. To conclude, these findings from the study are expected to bring in our understanding the role of digital technologies in affecting individual social and emotional connections during a crisis.

AB  - This article investigates the relationship between social resentment and Euroscepticism. It argues that that populist parties mobilize the resentment of the losers of modernization by addressing new cultural and political cleavages as well as the issue of European integration. Using survey data from the Belgian National Election Study 2014, the study covers two research objectives. First, we investigate the role of feelings of resentment in citizens' support for the EU. We theoretically distinguish three constitutive components of resentment - status insecurity, relative deprivation and powerlessness - and empirically test to what extent these feelings drive negative attitudes towards the EU. Second, we uncover how Euroscepticism is embedded in a populist 'politics of resentment', paving the way for further inquiry into how the effect of resentment on Euroscepticism is mediated by different types of blame attribution. Our results reveal that feelings of social resentment translate into stronger Euroscepticism. However, the effect on Euroscepticism is primarily mediated by cultural (anti-immigrant) and political (anti-establishment) blame attributions. In this regard, the study presents a more detailed understanding of the roots and processes that drive mass Euroscepticism.

AB  - Objective: In response to recent mass shootings, policy makers have proposed multiple policies to prevent persons with serious mental illness from having guns. The political debate about these proposals is often uninformed by research. To address this gap, this review article summarizes the research related to gun restriction policies that focus on serious mental illness. Methods: Gun restriction policies were identified by researching the THOMAS legislative database, state legislative data-bases, prior review articles, and the news media. Pub Med, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases were searched for publications between 1970 and 2013 that addressed the relationship between serious mental illness and violence, the effectiveness of gun policies focused on serious mental illness, the potential for such policies to exacerbate negative public attitudes, and the potential for gun restriction policies to deter mental health treatment seeking. Results: Limited research suggests that federal law restricting gun possession by persons with serious mental illness may prevent gun violence from this population. Promotion of policies to prevent persons with serious mental illness from having guns does not seem to exacerbate negative public attitudes toward this group. Little is known about how restricting gun possession among persons with serious mental illness affects suicide risk or mental health treatment seeking. Conclusions: Future studies should examine how gun restriction policies for serious mental illness affect suicide, how such policies are implemented by states, how persons with serious mental illness perceive policies that restrict their possession of guns, and how gun restriction policies influence mental health treatment seeking among persons with serious mental illness.

AB  - Background Oncology telemedicine was implemented rapidly after COVID-19. We examined multilevel correlates and outcomes of telemedicine use for patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) for cancer. Methods Upon implementation of a telemedicine platform at a comprehensive cancer center, we analyzed 468 consecutive patient RT courses from March 16, 2020 to June 1, 2020. Patients were categorized as using telemedicine during >= 1 weekly oncologist visits versus in-person oncologist management only. Temporal trends were evaluated with Cochran-Armitage tests; chi-squared test and multilevel multivariable logistic models identified correlates of use and outcomes. Results Overall, 33% used telemedicine versus 67% in-person only oncologist management. Temporal trends (p(trend) < 0.001) correlated with policy changes: uptake was rapid after local social-distancing restrictions, reaching peak use (35% of visits) within 4 weeks of implementation. Use declined to 15% after national "Opening Up America Again" guidelines. In the multilevel model, patients more likely to use telemedicine were White non-Hispanic versus Black or Hispanic (odds ratio [OR] = 2.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.03-4.72; p = 0.04) or receiving >= 6 fractions of RT versus 1-5 fractions (OR = 4.49, 95% CI 2.29-8.80; p < 0.001). Model intraclass correlation coefficient demonstrated 43% utilization variation was physician-level driven. Treatment toxicities and 30-day emergency visits or unplanned hospitalizations did not differ for patients using versus not using telemedicine (p > 0.05, all comparisons). Conclusion Though toxicities were similar with telemedicine oncology management, there remained lower uptake among non-White patients. Continuing strategies for oncology telemedicine implementation should address multilevel patient, physician, and policy factors to optimize telemedicine's potential to surmount-and not exacerbate-barriers to quality cancer care.

AB  - Introduction: In South Africa, online learning has been adopted to maintain the momentum of learning. The need for social distancing has resulted in the cancellation of many face-to-face activities that comprised the curriculum within higher education. This study explored the experiences of undergraduate diagnostic radiography students of online teaching and learning during the COVID-19 lockdown period.
   Methods: A qualitative case study design was adopted. Purposive sampling was employed to select undergraduate diagnostic radiography students at the study institution. One-on-one online interviews were audio recorded with fourteen (n = 14) students from second to fourth year and were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed through content analysis.
   Results: Two main themes emerged: (1) Maintaining balance in the new 'normal': (2) Enablers for an inclusive learning environment. The change in the method of teaching has highlighted the requirements for adequate teaching and learning. The students in the study were of the view that they deserve an equal opportunity to quality online education.
   Conclusion: The study reveals that the participants were concerned about the transition from face-to-face lectures to the online system. They felt they were required to adjust without adequate consideration of the prerequisites for the process, such as devices and data availability.
   Implications for practice: Radiography is both technical and theoretical. Therefore, the integration of online teaching and learning could be used to enhance digital literacy within the South African context. (C) 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Vaccine uptake can greatly impact on the ability of a country or region to eliminate a disease, which could be detrimental to society if allowed free reign. A high vaccine coverage can produce herd immunity, which confers protection upon the unvaccinated individuals within the population. Although some countries take a voluntary approach to vaccination policies, other countries have mandatory vaccination for specific pathogens. There is a clear inverse correlation between vaccine uptake and incidence of disease and in many countries a trivalent vaccine against measles, mumps and rubella is included in the vaccination schedule. Although naturally acquired immunity is gained from infection by the circulating wild-type virus, the live attenuated vaccine has an effect which wanes over a period of time. In recent years, there has been a global spike in the incidence of both measles and mumps and some authorities are using a third dose of the vaccine to inhibit the spread of any outbreaks which occur. Many factors, such as concerns over vaccine safety and susceptibility to disease have had an impact on vaccine uptake and media bias and misinformation have played a role. With the occurrence of a global pandemic of COVID-19 beginning in late 2019 and continuing for the duration of 2020, access to healthcare and routine vaccination have been affected and vaccine programmes interrupted because of the need for social distancing measures. This may have an impact on future generations, as a significant decline can reduce herd immunity, allowing diseases, which had obtained elimination status to re-emerge.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in unprecedented campus closures and social distancing, has reinforced the value of learning using a virtual teamwork format. While a large body of research focuses on the inputs (members' skills, motivation, technology, and virtuality) and outcomes (satisfaction, performance, and learning) of virtual teamwork, to date, only a limited number of studies have explored virtual teamwork processes involving university students. By drawing on the team processes model (Marks et al., 2001), in this qualitative study, we extend the scope of virtual team processes to a university online course. In addition, we explore transition, action, and interpersonal processes that undergraduate students experience when learning in virtual teams. The study participants included Japanese and international students (N = 20) from three universities in Japan taking a synchronous online course in international organizations during the summer of 2020; 15 combinations of virtual teams were created. The study is based on the inductive content analysis of e-portfolios created and managed by students taking the online course. The findings show that virtual teams are multitasking entities that transition through multiple processes simultaneously and consequentially to achieve team goals. From the analyzed e-portfolios, it can be observed that across all themes, systems monitoring (action processes), affect management (interpersonal processes), and strategy formulation and planning (transition processes) have been crucial in invigorating virtual teams toward task accomplishment. Finally, the study discusses both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, contact tracing applications have been proposed to limit positive cases and reinforce other measures, especially before the appearance of vaccines. A high rate of adoption by citizens is required. This study investigates the impact of trust on the adoption of tracking applications. A survey was administered in Morocco, where the authorities proposed the << Wiqaytna >> application. Structural Equation Modeling was used to test the hypotheses of the proposed model. The model explains 53% of the variance of the "intention to use" and 40.8% of the "actual use" of the application. The model was based on the UTAUT technology acceptance model and the GAM model of e-gov service acceptance. Our main objective was to study the impact of trust in the decision of Moroccans to use this type of application. Technology trust, government trust and social influence were important determinants of intention to use. The proposed model also shows that perceived awareness is an important antecedent of trust constructs. The impact of << perceived awareness >> on the trust constructs (technology and government) is stronger than the social influence on the latter. Moreover, our model shows that << Perceived Awareness >> has a more significant impact on << technology trust >> than on << government trust >>. Due to their lack of interest (in seeking information) and attention (communications on the application), citizens lack information about the application's usefulness and the security of users' data. Even those who have had contact with the information they are looking for cannot often verify its credibility (e.g. the source code of the << Wiqaytna >> application was available on Github). Therefore, cognitive and individual factors give way to social influence, and the intention to use becomes dependent on the norms and suggestions of influential people in the individual's environment. The latter construct is complex and has multiple determinants. Several factors act on the construction of trust in the authorities' quality of public services. Finally, the strongest relationship in the model is the effect of intention to use on using the Wiqaytna application. Based on these findings, suggestions are made for policymakers. First, a significant effort must be made to improve citizens' awareness of the importance of such an application for the control of the pandemic, even after the launch of the vaccination campaign and the application of social distancing measures. Indeed, a few posters here and there and a few commercials are not enough. An effective communication strategy must be built to explain to citizens the critical role these applications can play and reduce fears about citizens' privacy to increase the adoption rate of these applications. Secondly, the role of social influence is critical in adopting applications. This must be considered in communication campaigns and the involvement of opinion leaders and influencers to be more effective and increase the intention to use them.

AB  - During the pandemic, government policies such as social distancing and telework have impacted trust and working or social exchange relationships in the workplace. The behavior of leaders is critical for good leadership, employees' trust, and social exchange relationships. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to assess the associations among authentic leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships under the influence of leader behavior. A regression-based approach was used to test the moderating and mediating effects. The results show that authentic leadership positively impacts trust and social exchange relationships, whereas trust directly affects social exchange relationships. During COVID-19, leader behaviors with ability, ethics, and positive relationships have had a positive impact on the association between authentic leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships. Additionally, trust positively mediates authentic leadership and social exchange relationships. The findings of this paper suggest that authentic leadership promotes trust and high-quality social exchange relationships. Moreover, based on leader behaviors during COVID-19, the ability to manage change effectively, boost employees' work motivation, provide support, and take appropriate action is essential for authentic leadership to increase trust and foster a positive working relationship based on social exchange. Finally, regarding social exchange theory, high-quality leader behaviors and the leader-follower relationships drive positive associations among variables. These results will help organizational management teams to find methods to improve their organizational working relationships. The implication is that the abilities, ethics, and supportive and positive relationship behaviors of leaders are essential for effective management to improve leadership, trust, and social exchange relationships. Leaders should have the ability to manage work and people, even with teleworkers. Therefore, leader behaviors are important to maintain organizational sustainability. Further discussion on theoretical and practical implications is provided in the section.

AB  - Rationale and Objectives: To determine the impact of COVID-19 workflow changes on patient throughput at the outpatient imaging facilities of a large healthcare system in New York City.
   Materials and Methods: COVID-19 workflow changes to permit social distancing and patient and staff safety included screening at the time of scheduling, encouraging patients to use our digital platform to complete registration/safety forms prior to appointments, stationing screeners at all entrances, limiting waiting room capacity, implementing a texting system to notify patients of delays, limiting dressing room use by encouraging patients to wear exam-appropriate clothing, and accelerating MRI protocols without reducing image quality. We assessed patients' pre-exam wait times, MR exam times, overall time spent on site, and registration for and use of the digital portal before (February 2020) and after (June 2020) implementation of these measures.
   Results: Across 17 outpatient imaging centers, workflow changes resulted in a 23.1% reduction (-6.8 minutes) in all patients' pre-exam wait times (p <0.00001). Pre-exam wait times for MRI, CT, ultrasound, x-ray, and mammography decreased 28.4% (-10.3 minutes), 16.5% (-6.7 minutes), 25.3% (-7.7 minutes), 22.8% (-3.7 minutes), and 23.9% (-5.0 minutes), respectively (p < 0.00001 for all). MR exam times decreased 9.7% (-3.5 minutes) and patients' overall time on site decreased 15.2% (-8.0 minutes). The proportions of patients actively using the digital patient portal (56.1%-70.1%) and completing forms electronically prior to arrival (24.9%-47.1%) increased (p < 0.0001 for both).
   Conclusion: Workflow changes necessitated by the COVID-19 pandemic to ensure safety of patients and staff have permitted higher outpatient throughput.

AB  - According to the social identity approach to health, group memberships influence people's mental health to the extent that they identify with their group. Emerging evidence suggests that music groups, such as choirs, enhance mental health via group identification and the satisfaction of various psychological needs; however, more research is required to understand these processes in other types of music groups. Furthermore, the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) social distancing restrictions in 2020 prevented music groups from meeting face to face (F2F). Some music groups adapted virtually, but the rate of adaptation of various music activities is unknown, as is the impact of such adaptations on participants' group identification, psychological need satisfaction, and mental health. We explored these questions using a cross-sectional survey with 257 participants (M-age = 46 years, 78% female) of singing (n = 172), instrumental (n = 48), and dance groups (n = 37). Participants rated group identification and psychological needs satisfaction retrospectively for their music group in F2F mode and then for the group in adapted mode, along with mental health 12-item short form health survey (SF-12). Results showed that instrumental groups (60%) were less commonly adapted to virtual mode than singing (83%) and dance (86%) groups. Group identification and average psychological needs satisfaction (M = 4.04 and 3.50 out of 5) scores were significantly lower for groups in virtual mode than in F2F mode (M = 4.53 and 4.14, respectively). Psychological needs satisfaction did not mediate the relationship between group identification and SF-12 mental health. Despite this, values on group identification and psychological need satisfaction remained high, which suggests that virtual music groups may be beneficial during the COVID-19 pandemic and in contexts where F2F groups are less accessible.

AB  - BackgroundPoint-of-care ultrasound is becoming a ubiquitous diagnostic tool, and there has been increasing interest to teach novice practitioners. One of the challenges is the scarcity of qualified instructors, and with COVID-19, another challenge is the difficulty with social distancing between learners and educators. The purpose of our study was to determine if ultrasound-naive operators can learn ultrasound techniques and develop the psychomotor skills to acquire ultrasound images after reviewing SonoSim (R) online modules.MethodsThis was a prospective study evaluating first-year medical students. Medical students were asked to complete four SonoSim (R) online modules (aorta/IVC, cardiac, renal, and superficial). They were subsequently asked to perform ultrasound examinations on standardized patients utilizing the learned techniques/skills in the online modules. Emergency Ultrasound-trained physicians evaluated medical students' sonographic skills in image acquisition quality, image acquisition difficulty, and overall performance. Data are presented as means and percentages with standard deviation. All P values are based on 2-tailed tests of significance.ResultsTotal of 44 medical students participated in the study. All (100%) students completed the hands-on skills evaluation with a median score of 83.7% (IQR 76.7-88.4%). Thirty-three medical students completed all the online modules and quizzes with median score of 87.5% (IQR 83.8-91.3%). There was a positive association between module quiz performance and the hands-on skills performance (R-squared=0.45; p <0.001). There was no statistically significant association between module performance and hands-on performance for any of the four categories individually. In all four categories, the evaluators' observation of the medical students' difficulty obtaining views correlated with hands-on performance scores.ConclusionsOur study findings suggest that ultrasound-naive medical students can develop basic hands-on skills in image acquisition after reviewing online modules.

AB  - This study investigated how the prevalent visual depiction of obesity in the media promotes stigmatization of obese individuals. Particularly, this study proposed and tested the two sequential mechanisms which were not explicated in the previous models but indispensable in stigma research: (1) the disease avoidance response (i.e. discomfort for physical contact) and (2) dehumanizing perception. Results of two experiments overall supported the extended model: the headless photos of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which sequentially increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. The identity trait (e.g. gender) match increased readers' level of social identification with obese people and alleviated the disease avoidance response when they saw the photo of the obese model as a whole being. By contrast, the opposite effects (i.e. disidentification and heightened discomfort) were found when the participants saw the headless photo of the obese model of the same gender.

AB  - City is the place that shapes the social life and the relations between the humans; it is the place where the social distances minimize and the social relations gain utmost concentration. Not only residences make out the city, but also the city is made out of the integrity of the buildings bearing a series of activities therein and of the entities that bind them and distribute services such as transportation, infrastructure, and social equipping systems between them. Industrialization has caused not only positive changes in quality of city life but also brought about negative developments. Cittaslow movement was started as an international urban network in 1999, as an alternative model of sustainable urban against negative effect of economic and cultural globalization, basing on local sustainability where it basicly focus on environment, economy and equity, aiming to maintain and enrich the quality and viability of urban life. This movement organises towns that are sensitive to the environment, that has not connected its local economy to a foreign economy and is self sufficient with any kind of its artistic activity, education, energy and facility is now embraced over 20 countries and close to 150 cities and has tried to substantiate nearly 70 criteria to becoming a sustainable city. These criteria are collected under the titles of environment, infrastructure, protecting the local produce, technology for urban quality and creating facilities, hospitality and awareness. For this purpose, in the first part of this study, to ensure the understanding of Slow City concept, Slow City characteristics has been set forth by literature study. In the second part of study the documentaries which is explained the nine cittaslow cities in Turkey is analysied. One of documentary is made by TRT the goverment television the other is made by private production firm. Each documentary has 10 episodes. Totally 20 episodes will be analysed according to cittaslow criterias and urban communication features like public participation, awareness, infrastructure, culturel issues.

AB  - The COVID-19 global pandemic has adversely affected educational institutions worldwide, resulting in frequent mandatory lockdowns and social distancing rules. After waiting for a brief period, most organizations, including educational institutions, moved their operations from traditional in-class to virtual, web-based teaching-learning. As a result of unprecedented change, faculty, students, and administrators faced several challenges. However, how the educational institutions were coping with this challenging situation remained an important question. To address this, we present Knowledge Management Process (KMP), Knowledge Management System Infrastructure (KMSINF), and Knowledge Management System Quality (KMSQU) as resilient strategies to convert the challenges into opportunities. Using the KM processes and practices, a complex model is constructed to positively influence employee commitment, performance, and job satisfaction. A survey instrument was used to collect data from 747 faculty members from 14 higher educational institutions in the southern part of India. After testing the measurement properties using the Lisrel package of structural equation modeling, the complex model was tested using Hayes PROCESS macros. The results indicate (i) KMP is positively related to performance and employee commitment, (ii) employee commitment mediates the relationship between KMP and performance, (iii) KMSINF moderates the relationship between KMP and employee commitment, (iv) KMSQU moderates the moderated relationship between KMP and KMSINF in influencing the employee commitment, and (v) performance is positively related to job satisfaction. The results suggest that KM processes, system infrastructure, and system quality are effective, resilient strategies to bring educational institutions to normal functioning during the present global pandemic. The implications for KM, employee commitment, and job satisfaction are discussed.

AB  - Bringing digital teaching materials into residency training programs has seen slow adoption, expected for many new technologies. The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically shifted the paradigm for many resident teaching modalities as institutions instituted social distancing to prevent spread of the novel coronavirus. The impact of this shift on pathology trainee education has not been well studied. We conducted an online survey of pathology trainees, program directors, and faculty to assess pre- and post-COVID-19 use of, and response to, various digital pathology modalities. Responses were solicited through both social media and directed appeals. A total of 261 respondents (112 faculty, 52 program directors, and 97 trainees) reported a dramatic and significant increase in the use of digital pathology-related education tools. A significant majority of faculty and program directors agreed that this shift had adversely affected the quality (59% and 62%, respectively) and effectiveness (66%) of their teaching. This perception was similar among learners relative to the impact on quality (59%) and effectiveness (64%) of learning. Most respondents (70%-92%) anticipate that their use of digital pathology education tools will increase or remain the same post-COVID. The global COVID-19 pandemic created a unique opportunity and challenge for pathology training programs. Digital pathology resources were accordingly readily adopted to continue supporting educational activities. The learning curve and utilization of this technology was perceived to impair the quality and effectiveness of teaching and learning. Since the use of digital tools appears poised to continue to grow post-COVID 19, challenges due to impaired quality and effectiveness will need to be addressed.

AB  - Originalism is a subject of both legal and political discourse, invoked not just in law review scholarship but also in popular media and public discussion. This Essay presents the first empirical study of public attitudes about originalism. The study analyzes original and existing survey data in order to better understand the demographic characteristics, legal views, political orientation, and cultural profile of those who self-identify, as originalists. We conclude that rule of law concerns, support for politically conservative issue positions, and a cultural orientation toward moral traditionalism and libertarianism are all significant predictors of an individual preference for originalism. Our analysis suggests that originalism has currency not only as a legal proposition about constitutional interpretation, but also as a political commodity and as a culturally expressive idiom.

AB  - A survey of 168 White Australian community members examined whether ambivalence toward certain social groups by some religious individuals constituted a suppression effect in which authoritarian motivated prejudice suppressed more pro-social attitudes toward asylum seekers. Using mediation analysis, it was found that Christian religious identity was not significantly associated with prejudice at a bivariate level. However, when Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) was taken into account, Christians (compared with non-Christians) were less likely to hold negative attitudes toward asylum seekers in Australia. Inclusion of acculturation ideologies (assimilation, multiculturalism, and color-blindness) in the models indicated that the suppression effect was specific to RWA rather than due to other intergroup attitudes. However, findings suggest that multiculturalism may be one proximal indicator of Christian pro-sociality.

AB  - Background: Before COVID-19, preclinical medical students traditionally attended didactic lectures in in-person settings. Due to social distancing, students were required to switch to online meeting platforms, such as Zoom. For medical students accustomed to in-person interactions, these changes may add more stress to the already stressful medical school experience. Furthermore, it was unclear if students' stress levels were related to their preference for one learning modality over another. The purpose of this study was thus to explore associations between lecture modality (synchronous Zoom lectures versus live, in-person lectures) and stress in second-year medical students after they transitioned from a face-to-face learning experience to a fully online lecture platform.
   Methodology: Cross-sectional data were collected from 112 second-year medical students enrolled in a large U.S. medical school using an anonymous questionnaire delivered electronically via social media and emails. The survey contained items pertaining to students' attitudes towards different types of lecture modalities and how they relate to personal stress. Descriptive data and Spearman's rank correlation tests were conducted using IBM Corp. Released 2020. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 27.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.
   Results: This study examined correlations between preclinical medical school lecture delivery and personality type, stress levels, attendance, and burnout. Overall, no significance was found between mode of delivery and personality type. On the other hand, the mode of delivery significantly affected stress levels, attendance, and burnout. Moderate to strong correlations were found between the item "Zoom lectures have reduced stress compared to in-person lectures" and preference for Zoom, quality of education using Zoom compared to the in-person lectures, belief that Zoom lectures should continue as part of the curriculum delivery method, staying motivated with lectures fully online with Zoom, and liking that Zoom lectures save commute time to campus.
   Conclusions: Findings suggest that a fully online curriculum may play a role in reducing stress in medical students without compromising the quality of education.

AB  - Introduction: Any viral pandemic is a global health and mental health issue. The World Health Organization and mental health associations have warned that the current COVID-19 pandemic will lead to a drastic increase of stress-related conditions and mental health issues globally.
   Materials and Methods: An online web-based survey has been launched from 10 to 15 April 2020 in Paraguay in order to collect information regarding the stress related to the quarantine during the COVID-19 pandemic. It has been spread through social media ("WhatsApp," "Twitter," and "Facebook"). Two thousand two hundred and six Paraguayan citizens, over 18 years of age, completed the survey voluntarily. Socio-demographics as well as ratings at Self-perceived Stress Scale have been collected and analyzed.
   Results: Two thousand two hundred and six subjects (74.12% men) aged between 18 and 75 with an average of 34 +/- 11 years old completed the survey. 12.42% (276 subjects) of sample reported a preexisting diagnosis of mental disorder, and 175 participants (7.93%) reported an increase of preexisting symptoms with the onset of COVID-19 quarantine. 41.97% of them had anxiety and 54.38% did not receive any specific treatment. The general population rated 18.10 +/- 5.99 at Self-perceived Stress Scale, which indicates a moderate level of self-perceived stress. Significant association was found between higher levels of stress and female sex, being single, or reporting preexisting mental disorder, above all anxiety and depression (p < 0.01). In fact, in 63.87% of mentally ill subjects (n = 175), the quarantine has worsened symptoms of preexisting mental disorders.
   Conclusion: This study suggests a stressful impact of COVID-19 pandemic, with the majority of participants reporting a moderate level of self-perceived stress. We suggest mental health services to provide a phone-based or web-based support to the general population in order to contrast the psychological impact of the pandemic. This approach may improve the accessibility to mental healthcare services in Paraguay, especially in times of social distancing.

AB  - Many countries chose to establish social distancing as lockdowns after the COVID-19 outbreak. Households had to adapt their day-to-day lifestyles to new circumstances, affecting routines and time dedication to tasks. This national study was carried out to find out how the confinement by COVID-19 affected Spanish households on the perceived habit changes during this period, in relation to their socio-demographic characteristics and household composition. An online questionnaire was launched during the COVID-19 lockdown, from 30 April to 22 June 2020. Descriptive statistics were analyzed, stratified by gender, on time dedication, routine, home leaving, and habit change variables. Chi-square tests were used to explore the relations of significance with socio-demographic characteristics and home composition. All contrast analyses were performed for a 95% confidence level (significance considered for p < 0.05). In total, 1673 respondents participated from different age groups, educational level, employment status and household composition. Sixty percent of respondents maintained their routines. A third tried to establish a new one, being related to women, young people, not a university student, and living with others, including minors. Regarding dedication to tasks, adults aged 35-54 years, with more cohabitants, especially women, devoted themselves intensively to the home or to care, while those under 35 were dedicated more to rest, leisure, television or reading. People with university studies were more related to teleworking. The frequency of going outside was related to gender, age, educational level and living with elders, specifically for grocery shopping and taking out garbage. Changes in habits, routines and time dedication in confinement were strongly linked to the sociodemographic and coexistence conditions in Spanish homes. The greatest impacts were suffered by women, people with children, and adults between 35-54 years of age, especially on care and domestic chores.

AB  - center dot Context.-The main focus of education in most pathology residency and subspecialty pathology fellowships is the light microscopic examination of pathology specimens. Classes with multiheaded scopes are the most popular among pathology trainees. Until recently, it was difficult to imagine that this educational approach could change. In the beginning of March 2020, our country faced a serious challenge, which all of us now know as the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The rules of social distancing and work from home were applied. These types of restrictions were implemented in almost all parts of our life, including work and pathology education. Objective.-To share our experience in the Department of Hematopathology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during the COVID-19 pandemic. We describe our experience in modifying our approaches to education. We show how we overcame many obstacles to learning by building one of the largest virtual hematopathology educational platforms via Cisco WebEx and using social media, in particular Twitter. These tools facilitated the learning of hematopathology by medical students, pathology trainees, and practicing pathologists from all over the world. Data Sources.-During the first 3 months of the pandemic (April, May, and June, 2020), we evaluated the visitor attendance to the MD Anderson Cancer Center Hematopathology Virtual Educational Platform using data collected by the Cisco WebEx Web site. To determine the impact that the platform had on medical education for the hematopathology community on Twitter, the analytic metrics obtained from Symplur LLC (www.symplur.com, April 27, 2020) were used via its Symplur Signals program. Conclusions.-Our experience using the MD Anderson Hematopathology Virtual Platform showed that there is substantial global interest and desire for virtual hematopathology education, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has led to widespread implementation of public health measures, such as stay-at-home orders, social distancing, and masking mandates. In addition to decreasing spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, these measures also impact the transmission of seasonal viral pathogens, which are common triggers of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. Whether reduced viral prevalence mediates reduction in COPD exacerbation rates is unknown.
   METHODS: We performed retrospective analysis of data from a large, multicenter health care system to assess admission trends associated with community viral prevalence and with initiation of COVID-19 pandemic control measures. We applied difference-in-differences analysis to compare season-matched weekly frequency of hospital admissions for COPD prior to and after implementation of public health measures for COVID-19. Community viral prevalence was estimated using regional Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test positivity data and correlated to COPD admissions.
   RESULTS: Data involving 4422 COPD admissions demonstrated a season-matched 53% decline in COPD admissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, which correlated to community viral burden (r = 0.73; 95% confidence interval, 0.67-0.78) and represented a 36% greater decline over admission frequencies observed in other medical conditions less affected by respiratory viral infections (incidence rate ratio 0.64; 95% confidence interval, 0.57-0.71, P < .001). The post-COVID-19 decline in COPD admissions was most pronounced in patients with fewer comorbidities and without recurrent admissions.
   CONCLUSION: The implementation of public health measures during the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased COPD admissions. These changes are plausibly explained by reduced prevalence of seasonal respiratory viruses. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Antifat attitudes (AFA) refer to stereotyping based on people's weight. Literature suggests that people who have an ideologically conservative outlook on life also report negative attitudes toward obese people. Also, it is well established that one of the roots of AFA is the perception that prejudiced individuals have about the controllability of the weight. Therefore, in the current study it is analyzed if Right Wing Autoritharism (RWA, predisposition that individuals have to follow the dictates of a strong leader and traditional and conventional values) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO, the desire that one's ingroup dominates other outgroups) predicts prejudice toward obese people and if controllability of the weight mediates this relationship. 456 female students of the UNED (Spanish Open University) from 18 to 35 years were part of the final sample of the study. Results showed that RWA, SDO, controllability and AFA were positively correlated and that the relationship between RWA, SDO and AFA was mediated by the controllability of the weight.

AB  - Background: Since the global outbreak of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19), plastic surgeons were forced to transition from traditional didactics to virtual lectures to practice "social distancing." As this method of education continues to be widely used, understanding the current trend of its usage is critical. In this study, we performed a survey study of virtual lecture attendees and presenters to determine current usage and general consensus on virtual lectures in plastic surgery education.
   Methods: An electronic survey was sent to attendees and presenters of virtual lectures using Google Forms. Demographic data, webinar usage patterns, and views on virtual lectures were collected.
   Results: A total of 417 surveys were received. Prior to the COVID-19 era, 39.1percent of attendees did not use virtual lectures and 45.6percent of presenters did not give webinars at all. Both groups reported that the lack of opportunities and need were the most common cause of no use of lectures or webinars. After the outbreak, 35.4percent of attendees now use virtual lectures daily and 51.4percent of presenters give lectures weekly. Over 90percent of the study population reported a positive experience with the virtual lectures due to increased interaction, convenience, outreach, and usability. Finally, over 75percent stated that virtual lectures might replace classroom lectures in the future.
   Conclusion: Our study shows that a majority of plastic surgeons have begun to use and give virtual lectures daily after the COVID-19 outbreak. Virtual education is a powerful and versatile tool that has great potentials, and it may continue to serve as a part of surgical training in the future.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen that people can adapt quickly to ensure that their social needs are met after being forced to isolate and socially distance. Many individuals turned immediately to music, as evidenced by people singing from balconies, watching live concerts on social media, and group singing online. In this article, we show how these musical adaptations can be understood through the latest advances in the social neuroscience of music-an area that, to date, has been largely overlooked. By streamlining and synthesizing prior theory and research, we introduce a model of the brain that sheds light on the social functions and brain mechanisms that underlie the musical adaptations used for human connection. We highlight the role of oxytocin and the neurocircuitry associated with reward, stress, and the immune system. We show that the social brain networks implicated in music production (in contrast to music listening) overlap with the networks in the brain implicated in the social processes of human cognition-mentalization, empathy, and synchrony-all of which are components of herding; moreover, these components have evolved for social affiliation and connectedness. We conclude that the COVID-19 pandemic could be a starting point for an improved understanding of the relationship between music and the social brain, and we outline goals for future research in the social neuroscience of music. In a time when people across the globe have been unable to meet in person, they have found a way to meet in the music.
   Public Significance Statement This article uses individuals' musical adaptations to the COVID-19 pandemic as a launching point for a better understanding of the social neuroscience of music. The authors build on recent advances to provide a comprehensive model of the social brain regarding music and highlight the key neural and hormonal mechanisms involved in musical production.

AB  - Background Social connections are crucial for our health and well-being. This is especially true during times of high uncertainty and distress, such as during the COVID-19 lockdown. This period was characterized by unprecedented physical distancing (often communicated as social distancing) measures resulting in significant changes to people's usual social lives. Given the potential effects of this disruption on people's well-being, it is crucial to identify factors which are associated with negative health outcomes, and conversely, those that promote resilience during times of adversity.
   Aims We examined the relationship between individuals' levels of social connectedness during lockdown and self-reported stress, worry, and fatigue. Method: Survey data were collected from 981 individuals in a representative sample of Austrian citizens. Data collection occurred during the last week of a six-week nationwide lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The final sample consisted of 902 participants. Participants were asked to complete validated questionnaires to assess levels of social connectedness as well as measures of perceived stress, worry-both general and COVID-19 specific-and symptoms of fatigue during the previous two weeks.
   Results Our results demonstrate that greater social connectedness during the lockdown period was associated with lower levels of perceived stress, as well as general and COVID-19-specific worries. Furthermore, we found a negative relationship between fatigue and social connectedness, which was mediated by feelings of stress, general worries, and COVID-19-specific worries-respectively, indicating that individuals with smaller network sizes, who were highly distressed during the pandemic, were also likely to report feeling more fatigued.
   Conclusion Our findings highlight the important role that social connections play in promoting resilience by buffering against negative physical and mental health outcomes, particularly in times of adversity in times of adversity.

AB  - Climate change can only be tackled with public support for sustainable policies. Thus, public attitudes towards climate change matter. More than 3 decades of climate change opinion (CCO) research-conducted by geographers, environmental psychologists, behavioural scientists, sociologists etc.-have provided us with a wealth of information about which predictors shape public CCOs. This review synthesises these findings and highlights the different geographies (the self, the nation, the region, the digital) that emerge within this research. Given the increased importance of social media, virtual geographies of climate change scepticism are increasingly being identified. Our paper argues that new research agendas must be developed to address the meshwork of virtual space and small scale geographies (regions, towns, districts) in which CCOs are formed.

AB  - Cocaine misuse is increasing and it is evidently considered a relatively safe drug of abuse in Ireland. To address this perception, we reviewed the database of an 18-bed Dublin intensive care unit, covering all admissions from 2003 to 2007. We identified cocaine-related cases, measuring hospital mortality and long-term survival in early 2009. Cocaine-related admissions increased from around one annually in 2003-05 to 10 in 2007. Their median (IQR [range]) age was 25 (21-35 [17-47]) years and 78% were male. The median (IQR [range]) APACHE II score was 16 (11-27 [5-36]) and length of intensive care stay was 5 (3-9 [1-16]) days. Ten patients died during their hospital stay. A further five had died by the time of follow-up, a median of 24 months later. One was untraceable. Cocaine toxicity necessitating intensive care is increasingly common in Dublin. Hospital mortality in this series was 52%. These findings may help to inform public attitudes to cocaine.

AB  - Acknowledging the unique challenges of the socially stigmatized industry and the substantial but varying impact of COVID-19 on business, this study examined how corporate social responsibility (CSR) fit influences public attitudinal and behavioral responses. This study found that low (high) CSR fit generated a higher level of public -serving motive (firm-serving motive) than high (low) fit CSR. The fit effect on public-serving motives was changed by the valence of the COVID-19 impact (negative vs. positive) on the financial performance. This study also found that the fit affects attitudinal and behavioral intentions (word of mouth) mediated via public-serving motives, moderated by the valence of the pandemic impact. The findings hold implications for the stigmatized industry companies' CSR initiatives in the context of the unexpected crisis, like the pandemic.

AB  - This study explores the effects of televised presidential debate viewing on young citizens' candidate evaluations and normative democratic attitudes, including political cynicism and political information efficacy. Findings revealed that debate viewing decreases young citizens' political cynicism and strengthens political information efficacy. Longitudinal analysis tracked young citizens' democratic attitudes from pre-debate to post-election, finding that one's political information efficacy intensifies throughout the course of the ongoing campaign, but debates' immediate effect of reducing political cynicism is not sustained as the campaign progresses.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected many countries with increasing morbidity and mortality. Interestingly, many of the actions and policies adopted in countries are linked to the social determinants of health (SDH). The SDH are critical determinants of health and health inequalities that are not directly within the health sector. Policies such as social distancing, good hygiene, avoiding large gatherings, cancelling of social and sports events, using personal protective equipment, schools and restaurants closure, country lockdown, etc. are not necessarily within the health sector but have been promoted to prevent and attenuate COVID-19 infection rates significantly. The SDH that serve to reduce morbidity will forestall or substantially reduce the pressure on many weak health systems in developing countries that cannot cope with increased hospitalisation and intensive health care. This paper argues that one of the most critical social determinants of health (i.e. effective crisis and risk communication), is crucial in many developing countries, including those with fewer confirmed coronavirus cases. We note that the effectiveness of many of the other SDH in reducing the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic hinges on effective communication, especially crisis and risk communication. Although many countries are adopting different communication strategies during the COVID-19 crisis, effective crisis and risk communication will lead to building trust, credibility, honesty, transparency, and accountability. The peculiarity of many developing countries in terms of regional, cultural, linguistic and ethnic diversity is an essential consideration in ensuring effective crisis and risk communication. Developing countries facing significant poverty and disease burden cannot afford to handle the burgeoning of COVID-19 infections and must take preventive measures seriously. Thus, we submit that there is a need to intensify SDH actions and ensure that no one is left behind when communicating crisis and risk to the population to address the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - While a fair amount of research has examined consumer boycotts, prior research has yet to adequately examine the interaction of religious boycotts and backing by religious leaders influence consumption behavior, particularly in locations where there is a separation of church and state (a novel contribution that our paper addresses). Through a focus group and an experimental study, this research examines how boycotts that are encouraged by religious leaders versus those that are not influence consumption. Specifically, the focus groups show that refutational defenses and supportive defenses induce participation. The experimental study finds that participation in religiously motivated boycotts is greater for consumers that are more religious and when backed by religious leader support. Additionally, negative attitudes toward a business mediate this relationship. Discussion builds on the literature on consumer boycotts, inoculation theory, and value attribution theory as well as provides implications for marketing practitioners.

AB  - Input from scientific experts and lay audiences plays an important role in the realization of scientific advances and scientific policymaking. This study examines factors influencing expert and public attitudes toward the regulation of academic and commercial nanotechnology. Compared to scientific experts, lay publics are more likely to support the regulation of academic nanotechnology, with value predispositions playing a critical role in impacting such opinions. Among lay audiences, liberals and respondents reporting higher levels of religiosity were more likely to support regulation of both academic and commercial nanotechnology research, while those who paid greater attention to the media were more supportive of regulations for commercial research. Across the two groups, perceptions of risks relative to benefits consistently predicted attitudes toward regulation. Importantly, scientists rely less upon their value predispositions when forming regulatory attitudes, instead basing such attitudes on perceptions of regulatory impacts on scientific progress. The regulatory implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - "Rough sex" can be considered an act of sexual violence that is consensual or non-consensual, often resulting in bodily harm and in rare cases, fatalities. The rough sex defense is typically advanced by male perpetrators in an effort to portray a sexual encounter as consensual, to avoid criminal sanctions for causing injury or death. Public attitudes toward this defense are often reflected on social media following high profile cases and appear to echo dominant discourses that reinforce widely held sexual violence stereotypes. Therefore, this study aims to deconstruct public attitudes surrounding the rough sex defense. Namely, how female victims/survivors and male perpetrators of sexual violence are constructed online, whilst exploring the wider implications upon society. NVivo12 NCapture software was used to collect a sample of 1000 tweets mentioning the terms "rough sex" or "rough sex defense." Data were examined using Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA), underpinned by a social constructionist perspective, to elicit emergent discourses. Findings indicate that Twitter allowed women to resist harmful victim-blaming discourses and constrained binary identities. Opposingly, men were constructed as sexually entitled predators, yet resisted these subject positions by advocating support for male victims/survivors. Additional analyses examine account holders' constructions of British Parliamentarians (MP's) and their campaigns against the rough sex defense. These constructions demonstrated a cultural, heteronormative and victim-blaming understanding of sexual violence, which calls for legislative clarity.

AB  - The present study examined whether suspecting one's mother versus father of alcohol abuse was associated with parent-offspring relationships, and the degree to which parent-child relationships were associated with depressive symptoms. As compared to non-ACOAs (n = 288), ACOAs (n = 100) reported more negative parent-child relationships (i.e., greater alienation, poorer communication, less trust, greater emotional longing, and more negative attitudes toward the parent) and increased depressive symptoms on the POMS (McNair, Lorr, & Droppleman, 1992). A closer look revealed that suspected maternal alcohol abuse was associated with more negative mother-child relationships, whereas suspected paternal alcohol abuse was associated with more negative father-child relationships. Both maternal alcohol abuse and paternal alcohol abuse predicted depressive symptoms. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper presents an empirical analysis of propositions concerning the consequences of price (un)fairness perceptions in personalized pricing based on individual consumer characteristics or customers' previous pur-chase behavior. In three online experiments, we analyze consequences of personalized pricing for price-favored and price-disadvantaged customers in an e-commerce setting. Results reveal negative attitudinal and behavioral reactions to personalized pricing for both disadvantaged and even favored customers, mediated by price fairness perceptions. Respondents' aversion to personalized pricing is confirmed by a second study applying a within- subject design. In addition, we evaluate consumers' responses to various levels of information sensitivity in personalized pricing mechanisms and find that consumers generally refuse personalized pricing approaches regardless of the underlying personal data

AB  - Consumer robots are predicted to be employed in a variety of customer-facing situations. As these robots are designed to look and behave like humans, consumers attribute human traits to thema phenomenon known as the Eliza Effect. In four experiments, we show that the anthropomorphism of a consumer robot increases psychological warmth but decreases attitudes, due to uncanniness. Competence judgments are much less affected and not subject to a decrease in attitudes. The current research contributes to research on artificial intelligence, anthropomorphism, and the uncanny valley phenomenon. We suggest to managers that they need to make sure that the appearances and behaviors of robots are not too human-like to avoid negative attitudes toward robots. Moreover, managers and researchers should collaborate to determine the optimal level of anthropomorphism.

AB  - For almost 30 years, funk carioca has been one of the most "popular" musical genres among working-class young adults in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. However, funk's consolidation as a musical expression does not imply wide cultural acknowledgement. Associated with "bad taste" in music by middle-class music critics in Brazil and bearing connotations to violence and sex, the musical genre has been one of the most persecuted by the media and the police forces, who have repeatedly used moral panic arguments to address the phenomenon. During the last ten years, funk carioca obtained national visibility in Brazil through its circulation on social network sites and YouTube. However, the spread of funk music through these online spaces did not help to diminish the prejudice against the genre. On the contrary, social networks have been used by "haters" of this musical genre to express their prejudice against funk. Within this context, the article will discuss taste, stigma and value disputes around funk carioca on YouTube. The analysis will focus on comments posted by haters of funk about the 'Passinho do Volante' music video, which was the second most viewed music video on YouTube in Brazil in 2013. To do so, we collected, organized and analysed the most aggressive comments according to four categories: (1) racial prejudice, (2) social-territorial prejudice, (3) aesthetic criticism and repudiation of funk as cultural expression, and (4) funk popularization as a "threat" to the country's progress. Our theoretical and methodological discussions make reference to the sociology of music on value and taste, and, more specifically, Antoine Hennion's discussion on taste performance, as well as to actor-network theory related to the theoretical approach of cartography of controversies.

TI  - Pediatric Intensive Care Unit Admissions for COVID-19: Insights Using State-Level Data
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS
LA  - English
KW  - EPIDEMIOLOGY
AB  - Introduction. Intensive care has played a pivotal role during the COVID-19 pandemic as many patients developed severe pulmonary complications. The availability of information in pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) remains limited. The purpose of this study is to characterize COVID-19 positive admissions (CPAs) in the United States and to determine factors that may impact those admissions. Materials and Methods. This is a retrospective cohort study using data from the COVID-19 Virtual Pediatric System (VPS) dashboard containing information regarding respiratory support and comorbidities for all CPAs between March and April 2020. The state-level data contained 13 different factors from population density, comorbid conditions, and social distancing score. The absolute CPA count was converted to frequency using the state's population. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were performed to assess the association between CPA frequency and admission endpoints. Results. A total of 205 CPAs were reported by 167 PICUs across 48 states. The estimated CPA frequency was 2.8 per million children in a one-month period. A total of 3,235 tests were conducted of which 6.3% were positive. Children above 11 years of age comprised 69.7% of the total cohort and 35.1% had moderated or severe comorbidities. The median duration of a CPA was 4.9 days (1.25-12.00 days). Out of the 1,132 total CPA days, 592 (52.2%) involved mechanical ventilation. The inpatient mortalities were 3 (1.4%). Multivariate analyses demonstrated an association between CPAs with greater population density (beta coefficient 0.01, p<0.01). Multivariate analyses also demonstrated an association between pediatric type 1 diabetes mellitus with increased CPA duration requiring advanced respiratory support (beta coefficient 5.1, p<0.01) and intubation (beta coefficient 4.6, p<0.01). Conclusions. Inpatient mortality during PICU CPAs is relatively low at 1.4%. CPA frequency seems to be impacted by population density. Type 1 DM appears to be associated with increased duration of HFNC and intubation. These factors should be included in future studies using patient-level data.

AB  - This study expands the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) with rumor theory to examine the influence of online rumors on attribution of organizational crisis responsibility and attitude toward organization during a period of crisis uncertainty. Controlling for crisis issue involvement, findings from a three-group with control online experiment (N = 366) revealed that people tend to believe fact-based rumors more than rumors with subjective claims, leading to greater organizational blame and, consequently, more negative attitudes toward the organization. Findings extend the theoretical premise of rumor as postulated in SCCT with evidence that online rumors pose different levels of crisis attribution and reputational threat to organizations and suggest that organizational responses to fact-based rumors might need to be viewed beyond a victim-type crisis.

AB  - This research examined the association of social dominance orientation (SDO) and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) with the evaluations of the government's anti-coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) policies and performance. In Study 1 (N = 261), we found that SDO and RWA were positively associated with resistance to criticism about the government's anti-COVID-19 measures. In addition, SDO was positively associated with favorable evaluations of the government's performance in handling the crisis. Support for lockdown policies mediated these attitudes. In Study 2 (N = 438), the results show that SDO and RWA had indirect associations with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system through three mediation variables. Evaluations of the US government's performance in handling the COVID-19 pandemic were negatively associated with beliefs in the superiority of China's political system, and there was a negative relationship between evaluations of the Chinese and US governments' performances.

AB  - Purpose Product trials are an effective way to influence consumer attitudes. While research has established several factors that influence whether consumers will try a product or not, it is less understood how marketers can optimize the trial experience itself. The purpose of this paper is to explore flow as an optimal state and the factors that give rise to it during a product trail. Design/methodology/approach This research consists of three experimental studies in which people trial new music. This paper explores the ability of curiosity to optimize consumers' flow experience during the trial and their attitudes toward the trialed product. This paper manipulates curiosity before the trial using information about the music (Study 1) and music previews (Study 3) and also demonstrates that curiosity is naturally elevated among those high in openness to experience (Study 2). Findings The results demonstrate that curiosity before a product trial fosters an optimal experience during the trial in the form of flow states, defined as an enjoyable state of full engagement, which in turn mediates more positive attitudes toward the trialed product. This paper demonstrates that curiosity can be evoked using product information or a preview of the content and can vary based on individual differences in openness to experience. The relationship between curiosity and flow is moderated by the valence of the information that is used to elicit curiosity, such that negative-valence information thwarts the relationship. Research limitations/implications While the studies conducted by the authors focus on the positive influence of curiosity in the trial of music, the effects may be different for other products. These studies are also limited to two different manipulations of curiosity. Practical implications This research has implications for marketers, as it demonstrates the relevance of flow and how to enable it in product trials to optimize effectiveness. The manipulations also demonstrate how to manage the amount of information that is given to consumers before they trial a product. Originality/value This research reveals that flow states optimize the product trial experience. This research also advances the understanding of the relationship between curiosity and flow by moderating their relationship with the valence of information that elicits curiosity. The findings also broaden the relevance of curiosity and flow in marketing by demonstrating their benefits within product trials.

AB  - Prior research has examined public attitudes towardsand media portrayals ofMuslims in the United States following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Scholars, however, have yet to examine media portrayals of incarcerated Muslims in the era following the attacks. In this article, I analyze newspaper reports published before and after the 9/11 attacks to examine whether representations of incarcerated Muslims shifted following the attacks. Findings indicate that although terrorism and the war on terror, inmate radicalization, and the significance of Muslim chaplains are themes that emerged only in post-9/11 reports, there is also substantial overlap in the content of reports published before and after the attacks. These findings are interpreted by drawing on the minority threat perspective.

AB  - Many critics have raised concerns about online advertising directed to children. This study investigated the role of several antecedent variables that may impact children's attitudinal and behavioural responses to online advertising. Specifically, online ad scepticism, family communication patterns, time spent on the internet, and perceived internet competency were examined as factors that may impact children's online advertising attitudes and behaviours. A survey conducted with a dyad sample of 381 parents-preteens in South Korea revealed that children with high scepticism towards online advertising, who spent less time using the internet and who perceived lower levels of confidence about their internet skills were more likely to have a negative attitude towards online advertising and less likely to disclose personal information to online marketers. However, the relationship between family communication and children's responses to online advertising found in this study was inconsistent with the previous empirical findings. Implications of findings are discussed and directions for future research suggested.

AB  - This paper explores how women stereotypes are discursively evaluated in the TV sitcom 3rd Rock from the Sun by paying attention to the societal, cultural and ideological values they convey. Following recent trends for the study of television series (Bednarek, 2010), the analysis is both qualitative and quantitative, adopting a Corpus-Assisted Discourse Analysis approach (Baker, 2006; Partington, 2004). The contextualised analysis of words that refer to women confirms that the sitcom writers of 3rd Rock from the Sun purposefully resort to stereotyping as a verbal strategy to create humour while conveying negative attitudes towards women.

AB  - Background Male sex workers who have sex with men (MSW-MSM) are a high-risk group for sexually transmitted infections (STI) including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Provision of sexual services by MSW-MSM has shifted to the internet. Consequently, MSW-MSM have become hidden to care for providers of sexual healthcare services (SHS). The aim of this study was to 1) assess characteristics of the MSW-MSM population and 2) assess MSW-MSM's perceived barriers and facilitators to utilise SHS provided free and anonymously by the public health STI clinic in The Netherlands. Methods For this qualitative study, semi-structured individual in-depth interviews were conducted with 20 MSW-MSM who worked home-based in the Dutch province of Limburg. Participants were recruited from November 2018 to June 2019 by purposive sampling until saturation was reached via 1) five websites and smartphone applications commonly used by MSW-MSM, 2) STI clinic, 3) two gay saunas. A theory-informed interview guide was developed including themes such as sexuality, sex work, SHS and barriers and facilitators to SHS utilisation. The interviews' recordings were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed by inductive and deductive coding with Atlas.ti 8. Results The interviewed MSW-MSM were diverse in age (range: 18 - 66; median: 39.5) and mostly western European (85%). Identified barriers to SHS utilisation were lack of self-identification as homosexual and sex worker, perceived stigma on sex work and MSM, the lack of awareness of SHS and a low STI risk perception. Identified facilitators were trust in and positive attitude towards SHS, awareness of SHS's anonymous, confidential and free-of-charge nature, high STI risk perception and knowledgeable about STI/HIV. MSW-MSM-identified implications for SHS-providers were promotion of SHS on online MSW-MSM and general platforms (e.g. Facebook), offering one-on-one online and informal communication with an SHS-provider (e.g. STI clinic nurse) and providing STI (testing) information. Conclusion The MSW-MSM population's diversity and identified barriers, facilitators and implications should be taken into account to optimize accessibility and utilisation of SHS for MSW-MSM in Western Europe. SHS-providers could facilitate sex work disclosure by personally asking patients about sex in exchange for money or goods in a non-judgmental manner and explaining the medical relevance of disclosure.

AB  - Many refugees experience a wide range of mental health problems, but typically use mental health services less often than settled residents. Practical constraints like limited access to mental health care and language barriers largely account for this discrepancy. However, little is known about the psychological aspects explaining this difference in mental health service usage, like attitudes toward psychological help-seeking and the disclosure of distress. The present study compares German residents' and Syrian refugees' attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help (N = 384). Refugees reported more depressive symptoms and functional impairment than residents. Crucially, refugees also held more negative attitudes toward professional psychological help-seeking than residents. These group differences in attitudes were to a large part mediated by distress disclosure. We conclude that it is important to achieve a thorough understanding of how to address help-seeking attitudes and to encourage distress disclosure to promote treatment of mental health issues among many refugees.

AB  - Background: The Saudi government had implemented unprecedented preventive measures to deal with COVID-19. These measures included intermittent curfews, bans on public gatherings, limitations on many services, temporary suspension of Hajj, Umrah, and visit and launching awareness campaigns. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the KAP toward COVID-19 among residents of the border region of Jazan, Saudi Arabia.Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was distributed from May 4 to May 21, 2020, using a Google Form. The survey questionnaire covered demographic characteristics and KAP toward COVID-19. The KAP questions consisted of 17 items on knowledge, four items on attitude, and six items on practice.Results: A total of 597 participants responded to the survey questionnaire. Overall, participants demonstrated a good knowledge of COVID-19, correctly answering 77% of the knowledge questions. Most of the participants exhibited good attitudes and acceptable practices toward COVID-19. Multiple regression analysis revealed that participants with a university education (B = 1.75) or post-graduate education (B = 2.24), those with an income >SR 10,000-20,000 (B = 1.38) or >SR 20,000 (B = 2.07), and those who had received a personal health education (B = 1.19) had higher COVID-19 knowledge scores (p < 0.05). The ordinal logistic regression analysis found that compared to being female, being male was significantly associated with worrying about COVID-19 (p = 0.024, OR = 1.78), willingness to receive a COVID-19 vaccine (p = 0.003, OR = 1.81), and willingness to report potential symptoms of COVID-19 (p = 0.046, OR = 2.28). Worrying about COVID-19 was significantly associated with pre-university education vs. post-graduate education (p <= 0.001, OR = 7.94) and university education vs. post-graduate education (p <= 0.001, OR = 4.17). The binary logistic regression analysis found that compared to being female, being male was significantly associated with less face mask wearing in public (p = 0.009, OR = 0.31): Females were 3.23 times more likely to wear a face mask than were males.Conclusions: Most of the study participants had good knowledge, positive attitudes, and effective practices toward COVID-19. The findings of this study may help guide future awareness resources to the groups most in need in the Jazan region, particularly as the COVID-19 situation develops and changes. Further assessment should consider the groups omitted from this study, including immigrants and the elderly who have not adopted social media and technology.

AB  - There have been many surveys of public responses to Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), both reported in peer-reviewed journals and in the mainstream media.
   People anchor their representations of novel technological objects within their existing experience. What elements of such experience anchor AVs? We review academic English language survey studies from 2015 to 2017 and surveys publicised in UK National newspapers which typically reveal discomfort about the prospect of AVs. Against this background we report the results of our own survey of 11,827 drivers across 11 European countries, addressing attitudes to driving alongside AVs as well as to riding in them. We establish a composite indicator of perceptions of AVs that combines responses on using AVs and sharing the road with them, and analyse its relationship with a set of covariate measures. Respondents' technological optimism and uptake of driving technology was associated with more positive perceptions of AVs, and measures of respondents' enjoyment of driving, and how 'sociable' they were towards fellow road users, was associated with more negative perceptions. The negative association between driving 'sociability' and enthusiasm for AVs was attenuated by levels of general technological optimism. We discuss the difficulties in researching public responses to novel technological objects and make suggestions for improvement in future survey research on AVs.

FX  - Funding for the data collection was provided by a commercial company, Goodyear Tyre and Rubber Company. The question set was developed in collaboration with the company, and as noted the selection of countries surveyed within the EU was determined by the company's market interests. The terms of engagement required the company to respect the academic independence of the authors. Surveys are constrained by respondent attention span: keeping the survey to a manageable length requires a negotiation between stakeholders as to which questions are included and which left out. The authors are satisfied that the complete question set includes the material required for the research presented here, and that the response quality is not compromised by inclusion of a limited number of questions proposed by Goodyear. The company has had no role in the preparation of this paper and there was no obligation to seek their involvement or approval of research utilising the data subsequent to conclusion of the original project.

AB  - Societally salient issues, like migration, stimulate user engagement with political parties on social media. This user engagement, in turn, is associated with political behavior, such as voting. Nonetheless, few studies so far have investigated the interaction between these factors. We examine how anti-immigration attitudes are associated with user engagement with political parties on social media. In this study, user engagement is understood as following political parties on social media. Through online data that were collected in October 2019 among adults (N= 1,000) in Belgium, we investigate how attitudes and user engagement are associated with voting behavior. Results suggest that attitudes towards migration are associated with user engagement with both left and right-wing parties on social media. Moreover, these attitudes and user engagement - and the interaction between the two - are related to voting behavior: being against (being in favor of) migration and following right-wing (left-wing) parties on social media is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for a right-wing (left-wing) party.

AB  - These three studies found support for a process termed hedonic contamination, whereby exposure to advertisements before a movie or television show activates persuasion knowledge, directs attention to the product placements, and reduces consumption enjoyment. Study 1 showed that exposure to in-theater commercials led to more negative attitudes toward product placements in the feature movie and reduced overall enjoyment of the movie. Study 2 implemented an eye-tracking experiment showing that advertising exposure increased eye fixations on product placements in a subsequent television episode. Study 3 identified the activation of persuasion knowledge as the underlying process driving hedonic contamination. The collective results suggest new research directions for understanding the interplay between advertising exposures and how consumers respond to subsequent entertainment content and marketing messages.

AB  - Background: In line with calls for action from international health organizations, Chile implemented in June 2016 a set of regulations to tackle the obesity epidemic. The new regulation includes the mandatory use of front-of-package warning labels on packaged foods/beverages high in energy, sugars, saturated fats and sodium. Additionally, such foods cannot be sold nor offered in daycares/schools and cannot be promoted to children under 14yo. The law is targeted to children; thus, this study examined mothers' understanding, perceptions, and behaviors associated with the regulation one year after its implementation, using a qualitative approach.
   Methods: Nine focus groupsof mothers (7-10 people each) of children (2-14yo) were conducted in July 2017 in Santiago-Chile. They were stratified by socioeconomic status (SES) and children's age. Macrocodes were developed by three researchers, combining an iterative process of deductive and inductive thematic analyses. Quotations representing each category were selected.
   Results: Mothers understood the new regulation as a policy to fight child obesity and were aware that products with more labels were less healthy than products with fewer labels. Attention and use of labels in the buying decision-making process ranged from participants who did not pay attention to others whorelied on them as a quick shortcut (mostly from middle and upper-SES); many mothers indicated changing their purchase habits only when buying new products. Mothers declared that young children accepted school environment changes while teens/preteens resisted them more. Many mothers agreed that schools have become key promoters of food behavioral change. Mothers were less aware about the food marketing regulations. Mothers declared that they perceived that the regulation was changing the perceptions, attitudes and behaviors toward healthier eatingpatterns.
   Conclusion: After the first year of implementation, the regulation was well known by mothers of diverse SES and different children ages. The degree of use of warning labels was heterogeneous among participants, but most of them agreed that their children, particularly the youngest have positive attitudes toward the regulation and have become promoters of change in their families. Many mothers also expressed that they perceived an important shift toward healthier eating, which may lead to a change in eating social norms. This information contributes to better understand how regulatory actions may influence people's consumer behaviors.

AB  - Background: E-liquid is one of the main components in electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS). ENDS review comments could serve as an early warning on use patterns and even function to serve as an indicator of problems or adverse events pertaining to the use of specific e-liquids-much like types of responses tracked by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding medications.
   Objective: This study aimed to understand users' "vaping" experience using sentiment opinion summarization techniques, which can help characterize how consumers think about specific e-liquids and their characteristics (eg, flavor, throat hit, and vapor production).
   Methods: We collected e-liquid reviews on JuiceDB from June 27, 2013 to December 31, 2017 using its public application programming interface. The dataset contains 27,070 reviews for 8058 e-liquid products. Each review is accompanied by an overall rating and a set of 4 aspect ratings of an e-liquid, each on a scale of 1-5: flavor accuracy, throat hit, value, and cloud production. An iterative dichotomiser 3 (ID3)-based influential aspect analysis model was adopted to learn the key elements that impact e-liquid use. Then, fine-grained sentiment analysis was employed to mine opinions on various aspects of vaping experience related to e-liquids.
   Results: We found that flavor accuracy and value were the two most important aspects that affected users' sentiments toward e-liquids. Of reviews in JuiceDB, 67.83% (18,362/27,070) were positive, while 12.67% (3430/27,070) were negative. This indicates that users generally hold positive attitudes toward e-liquids. Among the 9 flavors, fruity and sweet were the two most popular. Great and sweet tastes, reasonable value, and strong throat hit made users satisfied with fruity and sweet flavors, whereas "strange" tastes made users dislike those flavors. Meanwhile, users complained about some e-liquids' steep or expensive prices, bad quality, and harsh throat hit. There were 2342 fruity e-liquids and 2049 sweet e-liquids. There were 55.81% (1307/2342) and 59.83% (1226/2049) positive sentiments and 13.62% (319/2342) and 12.88% (264/2049) negative sentiments toward fruity e-liquids and sweet e-liquids, respectively. Great flavors and good vapors contributed to positive reviews of fruity and sweet products. However, bad tastes such as "sour" or "bitter" resulted in negative reviews. These findings can help businesses and policy makers to further improve product quality and formulate effective policy.
   Conclusions: This study provides an effective mechanism for analyzing users' ENDS vaping experience based on sentiment opinion summarization techniques. Sentiment opinions on aspect and products can be found using our method, which is of great importance to monitor e-liquid products and improve work efficiency.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyze how the Spanish newspapers covered an international event such as the Egyptian spring from 2011 to 2013. From the perspective of the representation of Arab-Islamic issues, this study carries out a quantitative content analysis on the four reference newspapers in Spain (ABC, El Mundo, El Pais, and La Vanguardia) to find out whether there was an Islamophobic or Islamophilic treatment during the Egyptian revolution. The results of the 3,045 articles analyzed show that Spanish newspapers were remarkably interested in Egyptian events and that cultural discourses were not relevant in the coverage. However, it is necessary to specify these outcomes by newspaper, because each paper proposed its own take on the matter based on information provided by press agencies.

AB  - The perpetual increase in social media data due to social distancing policy in practice and the low cost of communication has acquired an interest in rumor detection in social media. During the togetherness of the globalized world in the pandemic situation of Covid-19, social media applications drive excellent value to the analysts and journalists working in different domains. However, the unmoderated nature of social media users often leads to the spread of rumors due to a variety of opinions on government decisions, which becomes notoriously hard to detect. Also, the users may deny rumors as soon as they are debunked. This research extracts diffused information such as word cloud, hashtags, re-tweets and so forth and uses it as features. These features are applied in the sliding windows of data streams to detect tweets that may be rumors by validating using credible news sources. To address the challenge of veracity, tweets are classified into rumors and nonrumors. A modified unsupervised VADER sentiment classifier is proposed to further classify rumors tweets into amalgamated, unauthoritative, or exaggerated. It is revealed from the results that the proposed classifier is quite efficient in finding and classifying rumorous tweets that arise in critical situations.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has reached pandemic status. Drastic measures of social distancing are enforced in society and healthcare systems are being pushed to and beyond their limits. To help in the fight against this threat on human health, a fully automated AI framework was developed to extract radiomics features from volumetric chest computed tomography (CT) exams. The detection model was developed on a dataset of 1381 patients (181 COVID-19 patients plus 1200 non COVID control patients). A second, independent dataset of 197 RT-PCR confirmed COVID-19 patients and 500 control patients was used to assess the performance of the model. Diagnostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model had an AUC of 0.882 (95% CI: 0.851-0.913) in the independent test dataset (641 patients). The optimal decision threshold, considering the cost of false negatives twice as high as the cost of false positives, resulted in an accuracy of 85.18%, a sensitivity of 69.52%, a specificity of 91.63%, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.46% and a positive predictive value (PPV) of 59.44%. Benchmarked against RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19, our AI framework can accurately differentiate COVID-19 from routine clinical conditions in a fully automated fashion. Thus, providing rapid accurate diagnosis in patients suspected of COVID-19 infection, facilitating the timely implementation of isolation procedures and early intervention.

AB  - This article investigates the reasons that trigger students to access social media, the challenges faced and what needs to be done to ensure that Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) can adopt the use of social media in learning. This study uses a narrative cross-sectional survey conducted using qualitative data collection techniques based on interviews with students and lecturers from Makerere University. Results suggest that students access social media to get updates around the world, carry out research, entertainment, carry out business, peer pressure, keep up with friends and avoid bad habits. Also, our study identified challenges such as unnecessary information, expensive data, delays in giving feedback, limited skills, slow internet connections, miss conduct of users, inability to own gadgets and negative attitude hindering effective adoption of social media for learning. Results further suggest various measures on how social media can be integrated in learning. This study indicates that more research is needed into the methods and implications of increased social media learning in Uganda.

AB  - Japan has one of the world's highest rates of psychiatric institutionalization, and popular images of mental health care and public attitudes toward mental illness there have been stigmatized for decades. However, there are transitions underway that are reshaping the mental health care landscape as well as affecting public representations of mental illness. Those transitions include attempts to promote community-based care, move away from long-term hospitalization, reduce stigma, increase utilization of services, and bring clinical psychological services under the national health insurance umbrella. This article discusses one cultural representation in which those transitions are brought into relief: a 2002 television series entitled PsychoDoctor that portrayed the clinical practice of a psychiatrist. The article analyzes the messages inherent in the series about the nature of mental illness, the everyday-ness of sufferers, and the expanded repertoire of treatments now available. In so doing, the article suggests that the efforts of progressive clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and mental health activists to put forth new images of mental illness and mental health care are now having a degree of success in the arena of popular culture.

AB  - Objective The study aimed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms in children and adolescents. Design Cross-sectional surveys were carried out on the mental health of children; one survey was conducted before the COVID-19 pandemic and one into the pandemic, 15 months after the school closures and implementation of lockdown and social distancing. Demographic data and COVID-19 pandemic-related data were collected from specific parent-report and self-report questionnaires. Participants Participants included children and adolescents between ages 6 and 16 years, attending a tertiary care hospital without any diagnosed major psychiatric or chronic disorder. Analysis Data were collected at two points (before the COVID-19 pandemic and during it) and compared. Levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms were compared and tested for statistically significant differences between these two points using appropriate statistical tests. Regression models were constructed to predict the factors affecting increased anxiety levels and depressive symptoms in the COVID-19 period. Results 832 and 1255 children/adolescents were included in the study during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 times, respectively. The median age of the participants was 10 years (IQR=4 years). The median (IQR) Spence Children's Anxiety Scale score was 24 (12) at the pre-COVID-19 point and 31 (13) during the COVID-19 pandemic (p<0.001, r=-0.27). 11% and 16% of children reported being depressed at these two-time points, respectively (p=0.004, phi(c)=-0.063). Regression analysis showed that many factors, including the duration of smartphone use, female gender and only child status, were associated with increased anxiety or depression levels. Conclusion A large proportion of children had elevated anxiety and depressive symptoms during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, suggesting a need for measures to engage children in healthy habits to protect children's mental health and continuous monitoring of children during such scenarios.

AB  - Objective: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the backbone of the healthcare system and a skilled and healthy workforce is vital during a health crisis, such as the present coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Healthcare workers are at higher risk of exposure to and transmission of the severe acute respiratory coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Hence, HCWs should possess good knowledge and attitudes toward COVID-19 to protect not only themselves but also their colleagues, families and the larger community. Thus, the current study aims to assess the knowledge and practice of protective measures by HCWs in Saudi Arabia during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify awareness of the disease, potential trends and associated predictors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional, web-based study was conducted among HCWs about knowledge related to COVID-19 and practice of protective measures, such as social distancing and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic. A Fisher exact test and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to investigate the level of association among variables.
   Results: A total of 674 HCWs were recruited in the study (51.8% male, 42.7% aged 28-37 years old and 52% specialists). The Saudi Ministry of Health (MoH) was the main source of knowledge for most of the HCWs (89%) followed by the WHO (44.5%) and social media (42.3%). Washing hands before touching the face was the most selected choice (97.9%) as a precautionary method to limit SARS-CoV2 transmission. Most of the HCWs (74.6%) scored low for staying at home while the majority (71.2%) showed a high practice of personal protective methods, with pharmacists and general physicians scoring the highest.
   Conclusion: Saudi HCWs showed high knowledge and practice of protective measures for COVID-19. Good knowledge correlates with adoption of appropriate practices to prevent spread of infection. The current findings highlight the importance of interventions such as tailored education and training courses for those with low scores to improve overall knowledge and practice.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the extent to which Twitter users engaged in uncivil and morally questionable expressions in their comments about specific Asian countries and citizens. The integrated threat theory (ITT) was used to formulate questions surrounding incivility and moral foundations within Twitter discourses related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The authors collected tweets and retweets posted by English-speaking Twitter users in the United States (US) across the following three phases: (1) initial discovery of COVID-19 in China, (2) high US mortality rate from COVID-19 and (3) the announcement that a vaccine would soon be available in the US. Findings The authors found a significant difference in uncivil tweets posted in cities with higher levels of reported hate crimes against Asians than cities with low levels. Lastly, English-speaking Twitter users tended to employ moral virtue words and moral vice words when discussing China and Chinese culture/populations. Research limitations/implications The bags-of-words employed are limited in capturing nuanced and metaphorical terms. In addition, the analysis focused solely on Tweets composed in English and thus did not capture the thoughts and opinions of non-English speakers. Lastly, this study did not address all Asian countries. In this sense, the findings of this study might not be applicable to Tweets about other nations. Practical implications Given that many Twitter users tend to use terms of moral virtue in support of Asians and Asian communities, the authors suggest that non-governmental organization administrators provide morally supportive social media campaigns that encourage users to engage in civil discourse. Social implications These findings have theoretical implications as the frameworks of integrated threats and moral foundations were used to offer group-level explanations for online behavior. Additional research is needed to explore whether these frameworks can be used to explain negativity in other communication environments. Originality/value This study expands the findings of prior studies that identified the extent to which Twitter users express hate speech, focusing on general Twitter discourse across three specific periods of the pandemic: degrees of incivility and moral foundations, and comparison of incivility based on the prevalence of reported hate crimes.

AB  - In 2017 Nike, Inc. announced the launch of a new product, a pro hijab. Journalistic coverage of this event allows for analysis of how news reporters balance their view of religion with predispositions to cover other important elements, such as women in sport, and the growth of corporate power. Through a critical discourse analysis, the researcher discovered reporters did not manifest strong Islamophobia or patriarchy in their coverage and that they rarely questioned Nike's corporate power.

AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed.

KW  - YouTube

KW  - copyright
KW  - everyday life
AB  - One of the common responses to the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns that have been a feature of almost all countries has been the making of what have come to be called parodies. These are songs with new lyrics set to the tunes of established and well-known popular songs. The new lyrics describe life during the pandemic, the experience of isolation during lockdown, the importance of wearing masks and washing hands, the importance of social distancing when one is out. The pandemic parodies are a comment, sometimes jocular sometimes more anguished, on the new normal. They are posted on social media sites, mostly YouTube but also other sites such as TikTok, and invite comments from their audience about everything from the quality of the recording to the accuracy of the lyrics in reflecting people's lives during this time. Some of these parodies are by semi-professional singers, others by amateurs. Most of the parodists are white males and most of the songs parodied are from the 1970s and 1980s, part of the cultural capital of Generation X. This article argues that calling these songs parodies invites misunderstanding. They function more like the ballads of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when new lyrics would be written to be sung to well-known tunes. Often these lyrics would be commentaries on significant public or political events. This article argues that the pandemic parodies function similarly only now rather than the new lyrics being sold in the streets by hawkers, the songs are available on the web. At a time when the popular music industry is undergoing a fundamental transformation as a consequence of the impact of new technologies such as streaming, these pandemic parodies suggest another transformation in the production and consumption of popular music.

AB  - Purpose To compare and analyze the incidence of otitis media with effusion (OME), before and during the COVID-19-related pandemic period, to evaluate the effects of the social changes (lockdown, continuous use of facial masks, social distancing, reduction of social activities) in the OME incidence in children and adults. Methods The number of diagnosed OME in e five referral centers, between 1 March 2018 and 1 March 2021, has been reviewed and collected. To estimate the reduction of OME incidence in children and adults during the COVID-19 pandemic period the OME incidence in three period of time were evaluated and compared: group 1-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2018 and 01/03/2019 (not pandemic period). Group 2-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2019 and 1/03/2020 (not pandemic period). Group 3-patients with OME diagnosis achieved between 1/03/2020 and 1/03/2021 (COVID-19 pandemic period). Results In the non-pandemic periods (group 1 and 2), the incidence of OME in the five referral centers considered was similar, with 482 and 555 diagnosed cases, respectively. In contrast, the OME incidence in the same centers, during the pandemic period (group 3) was clearly reduced with a lower total number of 177 cases of OME estimated. Percentage variation in OME incidence between the first non-pandemic year considered (group 1) and the pandemic period (group 3) was-63, 3%, with an absolute value decrease value of-305 cases. Similarly, comparing the second non-pandemic year (group 2) and the pandemic year (group 3) the percentage variation of OME incidence was-68, 1% with an absolute value of-305 cases decreased. Conclusions Our findings showed a lower incidence of OME during the pandemic period compared with 2 previous non pandemic years. The drastic restrictive anti-contagion measures taken by the Italian government to contain the spread of COVID-19 could have had a positive impact on the lower OME incidence during the last pandemic year.

AB  - Objectives: Most SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies have focussed on adults and high-risk populations, and little is known about young adults. The objective of the present study was to provide evidence on the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence among young adults in Germany and to explore determinants associated with seropositivity in general and, specifically, with previously undetected infections. Study design: This was a population-based SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence study. Methods: In November 2020, a population-based study on SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in young adults (aged 18-30 years) was conducted in a large German city. Serum samples were obtained to analyse the SARS-CoV-2 antibody status using the Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay. Descriptive statistics and odds ratios (ORs) of seropositivity and of previously undetected infections in relation to different determinants were calculated. Results: Among 2186 participants, SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 72 individuals, equalling a test performance-adjusted seroprevalence of 3.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.4-4.0). Based on reported COVID-19 cases to the public health authority, a moderate underascertainment rate of 1.7 was calculated. Seropositivity was higher among individuals who sought COVID-19-related information from social media (OR: 1.83, 95% CI: 1.2-3.1), and undetected COVID-19 infections were more prevalent among men and those not adhering to social distancing. Conclusions: The results show a substantial underascertainment of SARS-CoV-2 infections among young adults and indicate that seroprevalence is likely to be much higher than the reported COVID-19 prevalence based on confirmed COVID-19 cases in Germany. Preventive efforts should consider the heterogeneity of risk profiles among the young adult population. ?? 2022 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The rapid spread of COVID-19 has expanded into a pandemic, for which the main containment strategies to reduce transmission are social distancing and isolation of ill persons. Thousands of medical staff have been infected worldwide. Coronavirus testing kits have been in short supply, and early diagnostic reagents did not have high sensitivity. The aim of this study was to describe the characteristics of patients requiring emergency surgery in a COVID-19 outbreak area.
   Methods: We assessed medical data regarding all patients who underwent emergency surgery at the main campus of Wuhan Union Hospital from January 23, 2020, to February 15, 2020. We classified patients based on suspicion of COVID-19 infection (suspected vs not suspected) before they were admitted to the operating room. We used descriptive statistics to analyze the data. Outcomes included the incidence of confirmed COVID-19 infection and length of stay, which were followed until March 25, 2020.
   Results: Among the 88 emergency patients included in this study, the mean age was 37 years. Twenty-five patients presented with abnormalities observed on chest CT scans and 16 presented with fever. The median wait time for surgery was one day. The median preparation time and median time until short orientation memory concentration test (SOMCT) recovery from anesthesia were 44.0 min and 23.0 min, respectively. The median postoperative length of stay was five days. Compared with patients not suspected of COVID-19 infection, six patients were confirmed to be infected with COVID-19 in the suspected group. No health care workers were infected during this study period.
   Conclusion: Simple identification using temperature screening of patients, respiratory symptoms, and chest CT scans before being admitted for emergency surgery was rapid and effective. Shortened contact times might reduce the risk of infection. Additional investigations with larger samples and improved designs are needed to confirm these observations.

AB  - Introduction Social distancing and lockdown measures are among the main government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. These measures aim to limit the COVID-19 infection rate and reduce the mortality rate of COVID-19. Given we are likely to see local lockdowns until a treatment or vaccine for COVID-19 is available, and their effectiveness depends on public acceptability, it is important to understand public preference for government responses. Methods and analysis Using a discrete choice experiment (DCE), this study will investigate the public's preferences for pandemic responses in the UK. Attributes (and levels) are based on: (1) lockdown measures described in policy documents; (2) literature on preferences for lockdown measures and (3) a social media analysis. Attributes include: lockdown type; lockdown length; postponement of usual non-urgent medical care; number of excess deaths; number of infections; impact on household spending and job losses. We will prepilot the DCE using virtual think aloud interviews with respondents recruited via Facebook. We will collect preference data using an online survey of 4000 individuals from across the four UK countries (1000 per country). We will estimate the relative importance of the attributes, and the trade-offs individuals are willing to make between attributes. We will test if respondents' preferences differ based on moral attitudes (using the Moral Foundation Questionnaire), socioeconomic circumstances (age, education, economic insecurity, health status), country of residence and experience of COVID-19. Ethics and dissemination The University of Aberdeen's College Ethics Research Board (CERB) has approved the study (reference: CERB/2020/6/1974). We will seek CERB approval for major changes from the developmental and pilot work. Peer-reviewed papers will be submitted, and results will be presented at public health and health economic conferences nationally and internationally. A lay summary will be published on the Health Economics Research Unit blog.

AB  - Previous research has documented that political information in the mass media can shape attitudes and behaviors beyond voter choice and election turnout. The current study extends this body of work to examine associations between televised political campaign advertising (one of the most common forms of political communication people encounter) and worry about crime and violence in the context of the 2016 U.S. presidential election. We merge two large datasets-Kantar/CMAG data on televised campaign advertisement airings (n = 3,767,477) and Simmons National Consumer Survey (NCS) data on television viewing patterns and public attitudes (n = 26,703 respondents in the United States)-to test associations between estimated exposure to campaign ads about crime and crime worry, controlling for demographics, local crime rates, and political factors. Results from multivariate models show that estimated cumulative exposure to campaign ads about crime is associated with higher levels of crime worry. Exposure to campaign ads about crime increased crime worry among Republicans, but not Democrats.

AB  - Previous research has established a correlation between fear of crime and anti-immigrant sentiments. In this paper, we explore the role of television in explaining individual differences in fear of crime, perceived ethnic diversity and anti-immigrant sentiments. We use the Social Cohesion Indicators in Flanders' data, a representative survey in the Flemish region of Belgium, combined with real-life indicators of ethnic diversity and crime at the community level. Results of a multilevel structural equation model suggest that watching television is positively associated with fear of crime and perceived ethnic diversity, which in turn is associated with anti-immigrant sentiments. Preference for public television is, however, associated with lower anti-immigrant sentiments, perceived ethnic diversity and fear of crime levels. Real crime and ethnic diversity levels are only weakly related to anti-immigrant sentiments. We conclude that especially perceptions are important in influencing anti-immigrant sentiments and that television use is associated with these perceptions.

AB  - Individual awareness of the disease and adherence to preventative measures are essential for a successful response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Early media portrayals of COVID-19 health information may have an impact on public attitudes and behavior. To urge people to respond correctly, the media should ensure that its coverage is relevant, timely, and actionable. We looked at internet reportage in India to see how well the media conveyed health information regarding COVID-19 by WHO's Strategic Risk Communication standards Sixty-seven percent of publications that cited sources of information did so from reliable sources, including public health agencies and scholars. In addition, media coverage did not appear to reflect WHO changes promptly, with most of the material coming before the updates. According to the results, Indian media should focus on actionable and relevant news that gives individual reaction recommendations. To combat the spread of disinformation, the media should report on evidence-based preventive and treatment methods.

AB  - Compared with similar research mainly focusing on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in Australian mainstream media using discourse analysis, this paper explores the reasons for the narrative shift by conducting semi-structured interviews with leading and well-known Australian narrative producers. This paper takes two conditions as a given. Firstly, the BRI narratives in Australian mainstream media shifted in tone from mostly positive to highly critical. Secondly, the Australian mainstream media's increasingly negative attitudes towards the BRI are essentially not just about the BRI but the Chinese government. Based on my analysis and interviews, this paper makes contributions by filling in the gap of finding out reasons to explain this narrative shift. More concretely, this paper finds out that while mainstream media is influential in many areas of national policy making, mainstream media reporting on foreign affairs is less so. By comparison, the Australian government's BRI or China policy has a significant impact on Australian mainstream media reporting. This narrative shift has been driven by international politics and Australia's China policy, influenced by Australian audiences' preference of local news and their local position, and its democratic responsibilities. Meanwhile, the vagueness and constant changing characteristics of the BRI do not help the understanding of the BRI in Australian media.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate public attitudes towards barking dogs in New Zealand in order to quantify the extent to which people perceive barking dogs to be a problem, to compare tolerance of barking with that of other common suburban noises, to assess the level of public understanding about the function of barking, to determine risk factors for intolerance of barking and to assess knowledge of possible strategies for the investigation and management of problem barking.METHODS: A 12-page questionnaire was sent to 2,000 people throughout New Zealand randomly selected from the electoral roll. Risk factors for being bothered by barking were examined using logistic regression analysis.RESULTS: A total of 1,750 questionnaires were successfully delivered; of these, 727 (42%) were returned. Among respondents, 356/727 (49.0%) indicated that frequent barking during the day would bother them while 545/727 (75.0%) would be bothered by barking at night. Barking and howling were ranked above other suburban noises as a cause of annoyance. Risk factors for being bothered by daytime barking were not being home during the day, not owning a dog, and considering a dog bite to be a serious health risk. Risk factors for being bothered by night-time barking were not being home during the day, marital status, considering dog bites to pose a serious health risk, and having been frightened by a dog. Overall, 510/699 (73%) respondents understood that barking was a form of communication.Action likely to be taken by 666 respondents hearing frequent barking included notifying and offering to help the owner (119; 17.8%), complaining to the owner (127; 19.1%) or the authorities (121; 18.2%), or doing nothing (299; 48%). Possible responses by 211 dog owners if they had a barking dog included seeking help from dog trainers (59; 28%) or behaviourists (54; 26%), buying an anti-barking device (33; 15%) or getting rid of the dog (20; 10%).CONCLUSIONS: Barking was considered to be potentially disturbing by respondents to this survey. Attitudes towards barking were most influenced by age, dog ownership, past experience with dogs and attitude towards dog bites. Public understanding of the possible reasons for barking and appropriate methods of managing the behaviour when it becomes a problem could be improved by better education and the provision of information through veterinary clinics and social media.

AB  - In multi-ethnic nation-states, opposition to immigration has manifested itself in attitudes and behaviors. Past research has typically focused on:anti-immigrant attitudes, and relied on threat and competition theories to explain patterns in such attitudes. These theories suggest that perceived threats stemming from new influxes or large concentrations of immigrants should prompt dominant groups to protect their interests, leading to anti-immigrant attitudes. We extend the literature with a focus on anti-immigrant activity, and introduce the legitimating contexts model, which argues that dominant groups may actually hesitate to engage in exclusionary public actions in places where the political and demographic strength of immigrant and ethnic groups is strong. In contrast to theories of group threat, we contend that in contexts with low levels of immigrant political power and demographic strength, anti-immigrant activity is less likely to be noticed, let alone challenged, and thus more likely to become part of the status quo. Extending political opportunity theory, we also claim that conservative elites and voters in local areas coupled with low levels of threat further legitimate anti-immigrant activity. We test these ideas using a new data set of exclusionary action targeted at immigrants in over SO U.S. metropolitan areas. In support of the legitimating contexts model, we find that low levels of demographic and political threat when immigrants enjoy less power alone and coupled with a higher share of conservative voters act to legitimate and encourage restrictive events on the part of noninstitutional actors.

AB  - This study uses behavioral observation and pre-and post-mediation questionnaires to measure the impact of mediator behaviors on participant attitudes and case outcomes in 130 court-connected custody mediations involving 270 participants and 30 mediators. As a quasi-experimental design, regression analysis controlled for a broad range of participant attitudinal and case characteristics. Mediator reflecting and eliciting strategies were associated with positive outcomes, while directing strategies had significant negative effects. Proportionally greater time spent in caucus was associated with increased participant trust in the mediator but more negative attitudes among participants. The article considers implications for mediators and court mediation programs.
   Key Points for the Family Court Community: _ Mediator reflecting strategies are associated with positive short- term impacts on parents' attitudes toward each other and positive long- term impacts on their ability to work together. _ Mediator reflecting strategies alone decrease the likelihood of reaching agreement unless combined with mediator eliciting solutions from the parties. _ Mediator directing strategies are associated with increased likelihood of participants' filing adversarial motions in the long- term. _ Greater proportional use of caucus has mixed results, increasing participant trust in the mediator but making parties more hopeless about resolution with the other parent.

AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention-in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N5105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

AB  - Objective: Many college students may experience mental health problems but do not seek treatment from mental health professionals. The present study examined how perceived stigma and self-stigma toward seeking mental health treatment, as well as perceptions of self-reliance for coping with mental health problems, relate to college student treatment-seeking. Method: In total, 246 students completed a self-report survey that included measures of perceived stigma and self-stigma for treatment-seeking, self-reliance for addressing mental health concerns, self-reported mental health problems, symptoms of depression and alcohol-related problems, attitudes toward treatment-seeking, and treatment-seeking behavior. Results: Regression analyses revealed that higher perceived stigma, self-stigma, and self-reliance were all related to a more negative attitude toward treatment-seeking. In a 3-path mediation model, bootstrapping results indicated an indirect effect where perceived stigma was related to attitude toward treatment-seeking and treatment-seeking behaviors through self-stigma and self-reliance. Specifically, higher perceived stigma was related to higher self-stigma, higher self-stigma was related to higher self-reliance, and higher self-reliance was associated with a more negative attitude toward treatment seeking in the overall sample, and a decreased probability of having sought treatment among those who screened positive for a mental health problem. Conclusions and Implications for Practice: Perceived stigma may influence whether or not college students seek treatment for mental health problems by potentially increasing stigmatizing attitudes toward themselves and increasing preferences for handling problems on their own. Researchers and practitioners are recommended to seek a better understanding of the complex treatment bathers to reduce stigma and facilitate treatment-seeking.

AB  - Immigration is a worldwide subject of interest, and studies about attitudes toward immigrants have been frequent due to immigration crises in different locations across the globe. We aimed at understanding individual-level effects of human values and ideological beliefs (Right-Wing Authoritarianism-RWA, and Social Dominance Orientation-SDO) on attitudes toward immigrants, and whether country-level variables (perception of Islamic fundamentalism as a threat, perception of immigrants as a threat, and international migrant stock) moderate these relations. With representative samples from 20 countries (N = 21,362; the Americas, Europe, Asia, and Oceania), and using Multilevel Bayesian regressions, results showed the negative effect of RWA, SDO, and existence values on attitudes toward immigrants, and the positive effects of suprapersonal and interactive values. Cross-level interactions indicated that the effects of RWA, SDO, and suprapersonal and existence values were intensified in countries with societally high levels of perceiving Islamic fundamentalism as a threat. International migrant stock served as a country-level moderator for the effects of SDO and RWA only. When country-level moderators were included simultaneously, Islamic fundamentalism as a threat was the most consistent moderator. Framing theory is offered as a plausible explanation of these results.

AB  - After more than a year in a pandemic world, more than 171 million people worldwide have been infected and over 3.5 million have died. The number of those who have suffered mentally due to the pandemic is well above this number. The virus, lockdowns, forced quarantines, and problems related to jobs and everyday functioning have left their mark on mental health. Additionally, the massive spread of COVID-19 content of varying quality in social media is exacerbating this impact. On the other hand, in times of social distancing, these media are an important link with other people and a source of social support. The impact of the COVID-19 content in social media still requires further exploring. This influence on mental health may also vary geographically. There are more and more reports of discrimination against Asians due to COVID-19. We conducted a survey during lockdown in which 1664 respondents took part. After analyzing the impact of COVID-19 content in social media on the level of life satisfaction, anxiety, and depression, we compared this impact between European and Asian respondents. The results showed that dealing with these contents affects the level of anxiety, depression, and life satisfaction. Although most often these relations turned out to be negative, we have also identified those indicating a positive impact. This was particularly noticeable among Asian respondents, who additionally showed a lower relationship between reading COVID-19 content and their mental well-being than European respondents.

AB  - In this paper, we assess public attitudes on climate change in Europe over the last decade. Using aggregate figures from the Special Eurobarometer surveys on Climate Change, we find that environmental concern is directly re-lated to per capita income, social trust, secondary education, the physical distress associated with hot weather, media coverage, the share of young people in the total population, and monetary losses caused by extreme weather episodes. It is also inversely related to greenhouse gas emissions, relative power position of right-wing parties in government and tertiary education. Moreover, we find a significant, opposite impact for two dummies for years 2017 and 2019, which we respectively associate with the effects of Donald Trump's denial campaigns and the U.S. Paris Agreement withdrawal announcement, and Greta Thunberg's environmental activism.

AB  - Of the many changes in daily life brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing efforts and governmentally mandated lockdowns were among the most drastic. Coinciding with these changes, popular pornography websites made some previously premium content available for free, spurring dramatic increases in traffic to these websites. This increase in time spent at home and reported increases in traffic to specific pornographic websites led to some speculation that pornography use might generally increase over the course of the pandemic and that problematic use might also increase. To test these speculations and quantify the effects of the pandemic and its associated restrictions on social behaviors on pornography use, we analyzed data from a longitudinal sample of American adults. Baseline, nationally representative data were collected in August 2019 via YouGov (N = 2518). Subsequent data were collected in February 2020 (n = 1677), May 2020 (n = 1533), August 2020 (n = 1470), and October 2020 (n = 1269). Results indicated that, in May 2020, immediately following the height of the first wave of pandemic-related lockdowns, more people reported past-month pornography use than at other follow-up time points, but less did so than at baseline. Among those who reported use in May 2020, only 14% reported increases in use since the start of the pandemic, and their use returned to levels similar to all other users by August 2020. In general, pornography use trended downward over the pandemic, for both men and women. Problematic pornography use trended downward for men and remained low and unchanged in women. Collectively, these results suggest that many fears about pornography use during pandemic-related lockdowns were largely not supported by available data.

AB  - Purpose Although unfavorable pricing errors (UPEs) cost customers billions of dollars each year, research has not yet examined customers' reactions to UPEs. This paper aims to fill this gap by examining customers' reactions to UPEs in terms of frequency, magnitude and the interaction between frequency and magnitude. Also, this study explores the moderated mediating role of price consciousness. Design/methodology/approach Three experimental studies were conducted to examine customers' reactions to UPEs in terms of frequency, magnitude and the interaction between frequency and magnitude. PROCESS Model 6 and 84 along with multivariate regression analysis and MANOVA were used to test the hypotheses. Findings The results show that high-frequency and high-magnitude UPEs lead to increased perceived deception and dissatisfaction, resulting in a higher negative attitude toward the grocery store, decreased re-patronage intentions and increased negative word-of-mouth (NWOM). Also, results show that regardless of customers' price consciousness level, customers display negative reactions when encountering UPEs.
   Originality/value This paper represents the first attempt to empirically examine the relationship between UPEs frequency and magnitude, on the one hand, and perceived deception, dissatisfaction, customer attitude, re-patronage intentions, NWOM and price consciousness on the other.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19 has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. The unprecedented global health crisis we are facing is affecting all parts of society and changing lives and livelihoods. International efforts have been applied to prevent the spread of the virus through personal hygiene, masks and social distancing as prevention measures. The aim of this study is to assess the level of perceived attitude and practice and associated factors among Dessie and Kombolcha Town administrations, north-east Ethiopia.
   Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional population-based survey was conducted using a structured interview-administered questionnaire from June 7 to 14, 2020, among Dessie and Kombolcha town residents. The data were entered to Epi Info-7.1 and exported to SPSS23. Bivariable logistic regression was done, and variables with p < 0.25 were entered a multivariable logistic regression analysis model. Statistically significant level was declared at 95% CI and a p-value <0.05.
   Results: A total of 828 participants were involved with a response rate of 98%. Of the total participants, 29.35% (95% CI: 26.3, 32.5) had poor attitude and 41.79% (95% CI: 38.5, 45.3) had poor practice towards COVID-19 prevention. Multivariable regression results showed a significant association with being male, unable to read and write, and mass media with attitude and rural residence, being widowed, a merchant, family size 4-6, spring water source and information heard from social media with practice.
   Conclusion: Our findings revealed that there are inappropriate practices and poor attitudes towards COVID-19 prevention among Dessie and Kombolcha residents.

AB  - Requirements to integrate societal considerations into research and development practices began appearing throughout the democratic industrialized world in the early 2000s and eventually became a central feature of responsible innovation. Examining one of the earliest and most prominent policy examples, this paper investigates the conceptual basis of the U.S. nanotechnology program's mandate for socio-technical integration. It argues that policy makers adopted this innovative response to addressing the societal issues of an emerging technology due to their heightened awareness of potential interactions among public attitudes, research directions, and technological trajectories. Integration thus emerged as a governance mechanism for mediating the interaction between these dynamic sources of uncertainty. The mandate emerged in a self-consciously experimental and anticipatory manner and thus provides a practical instance of tentative governance.

   Political advertising can influence which issues are public policy priorities. Population health-relevant issues were frequently referenced in televised political advertising in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 US election cycles, with about one-fourth of all ads aired mentioning traditional public health and health policy topics and more than half referencing broader determinants of population health. The volume of population health-relevant issues referenced in political ads varied by geography, political office, political party, and election cycle. Ads referencing broader determinants of population health (such as employment, education, or gender equality) rarely tied these determinants directly to health outcomes. Context Political discourse is one way that policymakers and candidates for public office discuss societal problems, propose solutions, and articulate actionable policies that might improve population health. Yet we know little about how politicians define and discuss issues relevant to population health in their major source of electoral communication, campaign advertisements. This study examined the prevalence of references to population health-relevant issues conveyed in campaign advertising for political office at all levels of government in the United States in 2011-2012 and 2015-2016. Understanding advertising as part of the political discourse on topics of relevance to population health yields insights about political agenda-setting and can inform efforts to shape opinion. Methods We conducted a content analysis of all English-language, candidate-related campaign advertisements aired on local broadcast, national network, and national cable television in the 2011-2012 and 2015-2016 election cycles (3,980,457 and 3,767,477 airings, respectively). We analyzed the volume of coverage in these ads about issues relevant to population health, including narrowly defined public health issues as well as a broad range of other social, economic, and environmental factors that affect population health. Findings Across both election cycles and all electoral races, 26% of campaign advertising discussed issues relevant for the narrowly defined conceptualization of public health and 57% discussed issues pertinent to topics within the more expansive population health conceptualization. There was substantial variation in population health-related content in ads across election cycles, by level of political office, political party, and geographic area. Geographic variation indicates that where a person lives affects their potential exposure to political communication about various health-related topics. Conclusions Political campaign ads in the United States frequently referenced population health-relevant content at all levels of government, although the ads rarely connected population health-relevant issues to health. Variation in volume and content of these references likely shaped public opinion and the public will to address population health-related policy.

AB  - Background: The release of quality data from acute care hospitals to the general public is based on the aim to inform the public, to provide transparency and to foster quality-based competition among providers. Due to the expected mechanisms of action and possibly the adverse consequences of public quality comparison, it is a controversial topic. The perspective of physicians and nurses is of particular importance in this context. They are mainly responsible for the collection of quality-control data, and are directly confronted with the results of public comparison. The research focus of this qualitative study was to discover what the views and opinions of the Swiss physicians and nurses were regarding these issues. It was investigated as to how the two professional groups appraised the opportunities as well as the risks of the release of quality data in Switzerland.
   Methods: A qualitative approach was chosen to answer the research question. For data collection, four focus groups were conducted with physicians and nurses who were employed in Swiss acute care hospitals. Qualitative content analysis was applied to the data.
   Results: The results revealed that both occupational groups had a very critical and negative attitude regarding the recent developments. The perceived risks were dominating their view. In summary, their main concerns were: the reduction of complexity, the one-sided focus on measurable quality variables, risk selection, the threat of data manipulation and the abuse of published information by the media. An additional concern was that the impression is given that the complex construct of quality can be reduced to a few key figures, and it that it is constructed from a false message which then influences society and politics. This critical attitude is associated with the different value system and the professional self-concept that both physicians and nurses have, in comparison to the underlying principles of a market-based economy and the economic orientation of health care business.
   Conclusions: The critical and negative attitude of Swiss physicians and nurses must, under all conditions, be heeded to and investigated regarding its impact on work motivation and identification with the profession. At the same time, the two professional groups are obligated to reflect upon their critical attitude and take a proactive role in the development of appropriate quality indicators for the publication of quality data in Switzerland.

The discussion is a response to the reactions of some Botswana Pentecostal and African Independent Churches to the availability of ARV therapy, as reflected in several media reports of churches discouraging church members' use of ARV drugs. The article argues that this negative attitude to ARVs is a result of the Christian churches' understandings of life, death and healing through traditional Bible-based interpretations. Based on this, some churches view the ability of ARVs to prolong life as challenging God who is the source of life and healing. The article argues that this attitude grows from an initial Christian understanding of HIV and AIDS as a form of God's punishment on humanity for its sins. The article thus argues for the development of 'a Christian theology of ARVs' that sees ARVs as a manifestation and not a contradiction of God's healing powers.(1)

AB  - Objective: Long-term social distancing, isolation, and economic fallout may be significant psychological triggers during pandemic, such as COVID-19, especially for those with underlying psychiatric illness. This study was conducted to address the psychological impact of COVID-19 pandemic among patients with depression based at a teaching hospital in Malaysia.
   Methods: This is a cross-sectional online study among patients with depression from University Malaya Medical Centre, using Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Assessment (MADRS-S), Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices (KAP), and Social Media Addiction during COVID-19 Pandemic (SMACOP).
   Results: One hundred seventy-eight patients participated in this study. The mean total of the KAP score is 12.65 (SD = 2.65), with knowledge section (mean = 7.34 [SD = 2.13]), attitudes section (mean = 2.63 [SD = 0.58]), and practices section (mean = 2.69 [SD = 1.00]). They scored moderately on the MADRS-S (mean = 21.03 [SD = 4.62]) and ISI (mean = 20.25 [SD = 4.62]) but had high GAD-7 scores (mean = 16.8 (SD = 6.27]). From the multiple logistic regression analyses, depressive symptoms of greater severity (MADRS-S 18-34) are significantly associated with more severe insomnia (P <.001, adjusted OR = 9.101, 95% CI: 3.613-22.924). Furthermore, the high anxiety level is associated with the younger age group (P =.029, Adjusted OR = 2.274, 95% CI: 1.090-4.746), greater severity of insomnia (P <.001, Adjusted OR = 22.9, 95% CI: 6.145-85.343), and higher risk of COVID-19 related social media addiction (P =.011, adjusted OR = 2.637, 95% CI: 1.253-5.550).
   Conclusion: This study demonstrates the high levels of sleep disturbances and anxiety symptoms experienced by outpatients with depression during the COVID-19 pandemic. These are closely linked to the younger age group and at-risk social media addiction related to COVID-19.

AB  - In this essay, I describe and evaluate the contemporary debate over support for Confederate icons. This debate is often stylized as "heritage" versus "hatred." In this debate, one side alleges that their favored Confederate symbols represent pride in Southern-Confederate identity, whereas the other urges that Confederate symbols represent racial hatred and white supremacy. I argue that the "heritage versus hatred" framing that typifies the public debate and the academic literature is not helpful. Additionally, the literature has largely ignored the views of Black Southerners, who have far more negative attitudes toward Confederate symbols compared to whites. Thus, many works implicitly assume a distinctly white southern past. Together, these shortcomings mean that existing research has likely overestimated overall public support for Confederate symbols and overstated the importance of Southern pride or heritage in informing that support, while at the same time underestimating the extent to which racial animus undergirds pro-Confederate views among whites.

AB  - To engage effectively, it is important to understand audiences' values, attitudes, and background knowledge. Given that researchers are increasingly expected to be responsible for public engagement, we conducted a small study into their perceptions of publics' scientific knowledge. Our data show researchers feel public engagement is important and their particular field is not difficult to understand. However, our participants appeared to rely on guesswork when estimating public knowledge and to underestimate positive public attitudes toward science. We suggest if researchers develop a more accurate sense of audiences' knowledge and attitudes they will be able to engage more effectively and efficiently.

LA  - English
KW  - touch

KW  - well-being
KW  - attachment avoidance
AB  - Affectionate touch is crucial for well-being. However, attachment avoidance is associated with negative attitudes toward touch. We tested two preregistered hypotheses about how attachment avoidance influences the association between touch in romantic couples and psychological well-being. We examined whether greater attachment avoidance is associated with a reduced link between touch and well-being, and/or whether reduced touch mediates the relationship between attachment avoidance and lower well-being. Across three studies, including two dyadic ones, we measured retrospective self-reports (Studies 1 and 2), laboratory observations (Study 2), and daily experiences (Study 3) of touch. Touch and well-being were positively associated, and attachment avoidance was associated with lower well-being and less frequent touch. Touch was associated with greater well-being regardless of level of attachment avoidance, and less frequent touch mediated the negative association between attachment avoidance and well-being in most analyses. This underscores the importance of touch, even for those valuing distance and autonomy.

AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession's negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games.

KW  - sexual satisfaction

KW  - dehumanization

AB  - Women's bodies are frequent sites of stigmatization. The internalization of negative attitudes toward the body can have negative implications for women's sexual wellbeing. In the current study, we examined the relationships between young women's internalization of body stigma-including body shape, genitals, and menstrual periods-and sexual satisfaction. Additionally, we tested two mechanisms that may mediate the relationship between body attitudes and sexual satisfaction: dehumanization (i.e., feelings of a loss of autonomy and subjectivity) and communication with a sexual partner (e.g., expressing needs and desires). We collected and analyzed survey data from 569 undergraduate women. We tested serial mediation models, such that more negative body attitudes would predict greater feelings of dehumanization, and more dehumanization would predict less comfort communicating with a sexual partner, and less comfort communicating would then predict decreased sexual satisfaction. We found support for serial mediation, which suggests that the links between body attitudes and sexual satisfaction may be partially explained by feelings of dehumanization and communication with a sexual partner. Our findings identify opportunities for intervention in practice and policy, and further clarify the ways that sociocultural stigma surrounding women's bodies extends beyond the body-affecting women's feelings of power, relationships, and sexual lives.

AB  - When a terrorist attack occurs, a natural response may be increased public concern about terrorism. But when a self-described Muslim perpetrates a terrorist attack, do negative attitudes toward Muslims also increase? If so, is this effect conditional on the nature of people's past personal experiences with Muslims? We present natural experiment data based on a 2015 web-based survey of 2105 non-Muslims in the US, a survey that happened to span the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13 November and San Bernardino on 2 December. We thus test Americans' feelings toward Muslims immediately before and after both an international and a domestic terrorist attack. We find that, although the attacks significantly affected Americans' concerns about radicalism both in the US and abroad, they did not negatively affect Americans' thermometer feelings toward Muslims in the aggregate-a null finding conditioned only slightly by the nature of past personal experiences with Muslims.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has greatly altered the behavior of adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer. No data exists on how gender influences the adherence of individuals with cancer to COVID-19 related public health guidelines and their preferred methods of receiving COVID-19 related information.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of adolescents and young adults with cancer. Data were summarized using descriptive statistics. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess differences in adherence to COVID-19 preventative behaviors, and differences in preferred information sources of COVID-19 related information between men and women.
   Results: Among 633 participants, adherence to key COVID-19 preventative measures was 44.9-58.8% for males and 53.4-68.1% for females. After adjusting for key confounding variables in multivariable analysis, males were less likely to adhere to frequent hand washing (AOR [adjusted odds ratio] 1.45, 95% CI [confidence interval] 1.03-2.03), not touching face (AOR 1.82, 95% CI 1.29-2.56) and social distancing (AOR 1.93, 95% CI 1.37-2.71) than females. Both genders preferred to receive information from their cancer institutes and social media.
   Discussion: Gender-specific interventions are needed to improve the adherence of males to COVID-19 precautionary measures. Information should be disseminated via cancer institutes and social media as these are the preferred sources of COVID-19 related information among AYAs with cancer.

AB  - To curb the spread of Covid-19, Singapore, like other cities, had to impose movement restriction and social distancing measures that may affect the well-being of its residents. In this paper, we assessed the potential benefits of gardening on the mental well-being of Singapore residents, based on the concept of mental resilience. We hypothesized that gardening activities promote mental resilience. A survey was administered on 8,786 participants of a "Gardening with Edibles" programme, measuring their mental resilience status, engagement in gardening activities and socio-demographic information. The mental resilience scores of participants who engaged in weekly gardening were compared with the scores derived from another survey conducted during the pandemic on an online community comprising demographically representative respondents with an interest on Covid-19 related community care. The results showed that the mental resilience of those who gardened was statistically significantly higher than the online community. Within the gardening group, those with less than one hour of weekly gardening time had significantly lower scores in their total mental resilience, and five out of seven resilience factors, "emotional regulation", "relationship", "confidence", "positive thinking" and "spirituality", compared to those with more weekly gardening time, showing that the efficacy of the mediating effects may peak at a weekly gardening time of between one to four hours. Home gardening may be an effective way for people living in densely populated cities to interact with nature and build mental resilience during the pandemic.

AB  - Background. Data on pediatric coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has lagged behind adults throughout the pandemic. An understanding of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) viral dynamics in children would enable data-driven public health guidance.
   Methods. Respiratory swabs were collected from children with COVID-19. Viral load was quantified by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR); viral culture was assessed by direct observation of cytopathic effects and semiquantitative viral titers. Correlations with age, symptom duration, and disease severity were analyzed. SARS-CoV-2 whole genome sequences were compared with contemporaneous sequences.
   Results. One hundred ten children with COVID-19 (median age, 10 years [range, 2 weeks-21 years]) were included in this study. Age did not impact SARS-CoV-2 viral load. Children were most infectious within the first 5 days of illness, and severe disease did not correlate with increased viral loads. Pediatric SARS-CoV-2 sequences were representative of those in the community and novel variants were identified.
   Conclusions. Symptomatic and asymptomatic children can carry high quantities of live, replicating SARS-CoV-2, creating a potential reservoir for transmission and evolution of genetic variants. As guidance around social distancing and masking evolves following vaccine uptake in older populations, a clear understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics in children is critical for rational development of public health policies and vaccination strategies to mitigate the impact of COVID-19.

AB  - The first COVID-19 case in Brazilwas confirmed on February 25, 2020. OnMarch 16, the state's governor declared public health emergency in the city of Rio de Janeiro and partial lockdown measures came into force aweek later. Themain goal of thiswork is to discuss the impact of the measures on the air quality of the city by comparing the particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone concentrations determined during the partial lockdown with values obtained in the same period of 2019 and also with the weeks prior to the virus outbreak. Concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the three studied monitoring stations. CO levels showed themost significant reductions (30.3-48.5%) since theywere related to light-duty vehicular emissions. NO2 also showed reductions while PM10 levels were only reduced in the first lockdown week. In April, an increase in vehicular flux and movement of people was observed mainly as a consequence of the lack of consensus about the importance and need of social distancing and lockdown. Ozone concentrations increased probably due to the decrease in nitrogen oxides level. When comparing with the same period of 2019, NO2 and CO median values were 24.1-32.9 and 37.0-43.6% lower. Meteorological interferences, mainly the transport of pollutants from the industrial areas might have also impacted the results. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore participants' attitudes and receptivity to a #CondomEmoji campaign insofar as investigating whether attitudes and receptivity were important predictors for brand impression and intention to buy.
   Design/methodology/approach This study involved 206 research participants who live in Jakarta and Surabaya and who answered online questionnaires to measure attitudes, receptivity to #CondomEmoji advertising, brand impression and intention to buy condoms. Questionnaires were circulated on several social media platforms and instant messaging apps. The participants were asked to watch the #CondomEmoji advertising video before proceeding to fill out the questionnaires.
   Findings Research findings suggested that participants mostly held negative attitudes and receptivity to the campaign. Non-sexually active participants were more likely to perceive the advertising as offensive. Attitudes and receptivity were good predictors for brand impression, yet attitude was not significantly attributed to intention to buy condoms. The result was stronger in sexually active participants.
   Research limitations/implications Non-sexually active young people need to be more informed about healthy sexual behavior so that they would not feel embarrassed to discuss and ask about sexual behavior. A socially acceptable condom-use advertising campaign needs to be conducted to lessen the resistance of conservative audiences.
   Originality/value This paper offers an insight into how conservative audiences may respond to social-media-based campaign of safer sex.

AB  - The privacy paradox states that people's concerns about online privacy are unrelated to their online sharing of personal information. On the basis of a representative sample of the German population, which includes 1,403 respondents interviewed at three waves separated by 6 months, we investigate the privacy paradox from a longitudinal perspective. Using a cross-lagged panel model with random intercepts, we differentiate between-person relations from within-person effects. Results revealed that people who were more concerned about their online privacy than others also shared slightly less personal information and had substantially more negative attitudes toward information sharing (between-person level). People who were more concerned than usual also shared slightly less information than usual (within-person level). We found no long-term effects of privacy concerns on information sharing or attitudes 6 months later. The results provide further evidence against the privacy paradox, but more research is needed to better understand potential causal relations.

AB  - Mass media have been accused of cultivating anti-immigrant sentiments in Western societies. Most studies on this topic, however, have not made a distinction between the types of television program (information vs. entertainment) or television station (public vs. commercial). Adopting a comparative approach, we use data from the six waves of the European Social Survey (ESS, 2002-2012, n = 162,987) to assess the relationship between individual and aggregate level patterns of television consumption and anti-immigrant sentiments in European societies. Individual television viewing time is positively associated with anti-immigrant sentiments, while frequent exposure to news and information programs is associated with lower levels of anti-immigrant sentiments. At the aggregate level we observe a positive effect of the total viewing time in society on anti-immigrant sentiments. In the conclusion we offer some suggestions on how this effect could be explained.

AB  - The psychological perception of structural measures developed to respond to hydrogeological hazards is pivotal in determining their efficacy. In this regard, alongside the vast psychological literature on mitigation behaviors, there is a lack of research on psychological constraints related to adaptation infrastructures. To fill this gap, we investigated the role of attitudes toward such measures and their antecedents on risk perception. Based on the Solution Aversion Model, Study 1 (n = 194) showed that the more participants oppose the adaptation measures, the less they perceive the risk of flooding. Extending Study 1, Study 2 (n = 95) provided evidence that distrust in science predicts people's dislike and aversion toward adaptive measures, which in turn predicts the perception of hydrogeological risk. Finally, Study 3 (n = 250) revealed that for participants with a lower level of prior knowledge about adaptation measures, the lack of trust in science predicts more negative attitudes toward adaptation, which is associated with lower risk perception.

AB  - This study experimentally tested the effects of animation versus rotoscoping versus live action in direct-to-consumer television advertising on outcomes, including risk and benefit perceptions and attitudes toward the drug. The authors used an online panel to recruit participants with chronic dry eye (n = 504) and psoriasis (n = 490). The study found no effects of animation or rotoscoping on perceptions of drug risk or benefit, comprehension, or behavioral intentions. Animated advertisements, however, resulted in more negative attitudes than live-action or rotoscoped advertisements. Future research should explore whether animated advertisements are recalled better over time or have any lagged effects on perceptions.

AB  - This study applied the contingency theory of conflict management to examine how contingency factors influence the public's perceptual and behavioral responses to COVID-19 and stance toward the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In particular, we tested political ideology as an important individual characteristic variable to examine its roles in the contingency theory framework. The findings revealed that two situational variables (i.e., threat appraisal and attitudes toward CDC) positively influenced the public's contingency accommodation stance toward the CDC. Furthermore, greater conservatism was significantly associated with lower levels of threat appraisal and more negative attitudes toward the CDC, however it did not influence the stance toward the CDC. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - The current study uses path modeling to investigate the relationship between extrinsic and intrinsic factors that influence early childhood educators' digital technology use. Survey data from 1234 early childhood educators indicate that attitudes toward the value of technology to aid children's learning have the strongest effect on technology use, followed by confidence and support in using technology. Additionally, student SES has the strongest effect on attitudes, while support and technology policy influence teacher confidence, which in turn influences attitudes. In contrast, more experienced teachers have more negative attitudes. Overall, the study provides the first path model investigating early childhood educators' technology use and provides practical considerations to aid teachers' use of technology in the classroom.

AB  - Objective: We sought to understand spatial-temporal factors and socioeconomic disparities that shaped U.S. residents' response to COVID-19 as it emerged.
   Methods: We mined coronavirus-related tweets from January 23rd to March 25th, 2020. We classified tweets by the socioeconomic status of the county from which they originated with the Area Deprivation Index (ADI). We applied topic modeling to identify and monitor topics of concern over time. We investigated how topics varied by ADI and between hotspots and non-hotspots.
   Results: We identified 45 topics in 269,556 unique tweets. Topics shifted from early-outbreak-related content in January, to the presidential election and governmental response in February, to lifestyle impacts in March. Highresourced areas (low ADI) were concerned with stocks and social distancing, while under-resourced areas shared negative expression and discussion of the CARES Act relief package. These differences were consistent within hotspots, with increased discussion regarding employment in high ADI hotspots.
   Discussion: Topic modeling captures major concerns on Twitter in the early months of COVID-19. Our study extends previous Twitter-based research as it assesses how topics differ based on a marker of socioeconomic status. Comparisons between low and high-resourced areas indicate more focus on personal economic hardship in less-resourced communities and less focus on general public health messaging.
   Conclusion: Real-time social media analysis of community-based pandemic responses can uncover differential conversations correlating to local impact and income, education, and housing disparities. In future public health crises, such insights can inform messaging campaigns, which should partly focus on the interests of those most disproportionately impacted.

AB  - This study investigates the psychological mechanism by which source interactivity influences health message evaluations. Combining health communication and interactivity literature, two theoretical routes to persuasion were proposed: enhanced sense of community and reduced psychological reactance. A 2 x 2 (source interactivity: absence vs. presence X smoking status: nonsmoker vs. current smoker) factorial-design experiment (N = 343) was conducted on an anti-smoking website. Result revealed that the endorsing and sharing features that resembled the Like button on Facebook enhanced self-as-source perceptions and sense of community, which exerted significant effects on message credibility for smokers and message enjoyment for nonsmokers. Among smokers, self-as-source perceptions reduced psychological reactance, which promoted greater message credibility and more negative attitudes toward smoking behavior.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on public health and safety, economics, and the transportation system. To reduce the spread of this disease, federal and local governments around the world have introduced stay-at-home orders and other restrictions on travel to "non-essential" businesses to implement social distancing. Preliminary evidence suggests substantial variability in the impacts of these orders in the United States, both across states and over time. This study examines this issue using daily county-level vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data for the 48 continental U.S. states and the District of Columbia. A two-way random effects model is estimated to assess changes in VMT from March 1 to June 30, 2020 as compared with baseline January travel levels. The implementation of stay-at-home orders was associated with a 56.4 percent reduction in VMT on average. However, this effect was shown to dissipate over time, which may be attributable to "quarantine fatigue." In the absence of full shelter-in-place orders, travel was also reduced where restrictions on select businesses were introduced. For example, restrictions on entertainment, indoor dining, and indoor recreational activities corresponded to reductions in VMT of 3 to 4 percent while restrictions on retail and personal care facilities showed 13 percent lower traffic levels. VMT was also shown to vary based on the number of COVID case reports, as well as with respect to other characteristics, including median household income, political leanings, and how rural the county was in nature.

AB  - Purpose Prisoners are at greater risk of infectious diseases compared to the general population. While imprisoned, it is often difficult to observe Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) prevention strategies such as social distancing. To the authors' knowledge, no study has been conducted worldwide to examine the condition of female prisoners with COVID-19. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the epidemiological, clinical and imaging characteristics of prisoners with COVID-19 in Ahvaz Women's Prison (southwest, Iran). Design/methodology/approach The data for this descriptive cross-sectional study was collected using a checklist including epidemiological information, clinical symptoms, X-ray and computed tomography scan findings of the chest, underlying diseases and the final status of all female prisoners whose COVID-19 test was positive. Findings This study included 139 female prisoners with COVID-19 with a mean age of 37.19 +/- 12.67 years. The most common underlying diseases were hypertension (14.4%), obesity (10.8%) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (9.4%). The most common symptoms at the onset of the disease were myalgia (59.0%), cough (41.0%) and dyspnea (37.4%). The most common radiological symptoms were ground-glass opacity (12.9%) and atelectasis (7.2%). In terms of extension of involvement, both lungs were involved in 8.6% of patients. In terms of zonal involvement, the lower lobes were more involved (8.6%). In terms of involvement position, the most common was sub-pleural (10.1%). None of the patients died. Originality/value Because the incidence, morbidity and mortality rate of COVID-19 in the prison population are likely to differ from those of the public. This study sought to investigate the situation of prisoners with COVID-19 in Ahvaz Prison, Khuzestan Province. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first worldwide study in this regard in women's prisons.

AB  - Context: Health-care workers (HCWs), being the front-line warriors, have been at increased risk for COVID-19 throughout the pandemic. However, the current extent of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and associated risk factors is still unclear in low- and middle-income countries, like India, especially in the department of obstetrics and gynaecology, which propelled this study. Aims: (i) Frequency of infection among HCWs among OBGYN department and cycle threshold value (Ctv) of SARS-COV-2 on RT-PCR. (ii) Clinical presentation, assessment of risk factors, and its impact on HCWs. Settings and Design: This was a prospective study conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, VMMC and Safdarjung Hospital, New Delhi for the duration of 6 months. Methods and Material: All SARS-CoV-2-positive HCWs in the department were interviewed verbatim after recovery, through a self-formulated, validated questionnaire, and answers recorded on pre-designed proforma. Statistical Analysis Used: Categorical variables were presented as number and percentage (%), whereas continuous variables as mean +/- standard deviation (SD) and median values. Data were transferred on Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysed using SPSS v 27.0. Results: Amongst 727 HCWs working in the department, 350 RT-PCR tests were performed, and 110 tested positive (prevalence of 15.13%). Mean Ctv of RT-PCR was 28.03. Most HCWs were symptomatic (n = 94) with mild infection; working as nursing officers (40%). Majority of them acquired virus while working in non-COVID wards (76%). Noncompliance with IPC practices (40%) and lack of social distancing (34.5%) were key risk factors. Conclusion: Adept knowledge of the risk factors and IPC practices can aid in averting casualties due to SARS-COV-2 amongst the HCWs

TI  - Community pharmacists' needs, education, and readiness in facing COVID-19: Actions & recommendations in Egypt
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PRACTICE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak is considered one of the most important public health crises all over the world and in Egypt. Community pharmacists represent the third largest health care professional group after physicians and nurses. Community pharmacists are expected to be fully prepared at the frontline of defending their community needs by limiting the spread of COVID-19 via different pharmaceutical care services. Aim This study aimed to evaluate the sources of knowledge and readiness of community pharmacists in facing COVID-19 early outbreak in Egypt. Methods A descriptive cross-sectional study was performed via a self-administered online google form questionnaire during the early period from 14 April to 3 June 2020. The questionnaire focused on; evaluating education level, sources of information, and readiness of Egyptian community pharmacists in the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. Results A total of 318 community pharmacists from Egypt participated in this questionnaire. About half of the surveyed pharmacists reported that they were frequently consulted and that their patients were seeking consultation regarding COVID-19 management more than 10 times per day. More than half of the pharmacists reported using social media as a source of information and knew the right social distancing recommendations. Regarding protective measures, only a quarter of pharmacists disclosed the availability of personal protective equipment (PPE). Nevertheless, the majority of pharmacists significantly reported some initial lack of support either inform of recommendations or PPE supply. Conclusion The study revealed the dependence of community pharmacists on social media as the main source of information and the lack of early awareness of evidence-based practice resources. Community pharmacists were in need of more initial support to achieve better satisfaction, patient counselling and infection control. Corrective measures were promptly undertaken to support and satisfy the Egyptian community pharmacists' initial awareness and readiness facing COVID-19.

AB  - Author summary SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent disease presentation are dependent on exposure dose in a nonhuman primate model of inhalational COVID-19.
   While evidence exists supporting the potential for aerosol transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the infectious dose by inhalation remains unknown. In the present study, the probability of infection following inhalation of SARS-CoV-2 was dose-dependent in a nonhuman primate model of inhalational COVID-19. The median infectious dose, assessed by seroconversion, was 52 TCID50 (95% CI: 23-363 TCID50), and was significantly lower than the median dose for fever (256 TCID50, 95% CI: 102-603 TCID50), resulting in a group of animals that developed an immune response post-exposure but did not develop fever or other clinical signs of infection. In a subset of these animals, virus was detected in nasopharyngeal and/or oropharyngeal swabs, suggesting that infected animals without signs of disease are able to shed virus and may be infectious, which is consistent with reports of asymptomatic spread in human cases of COVID-19. These results suggest that differences in exposure dose may be a factor influencing disease presentation in humans, and reinforce the importance of public health measures that limit exposure dose, such as social distancing, masking, and increased ventilation. The dose-response data provided by this study are important to inform disease transmission and hazard modeling, and, ultimately, mitigation strategies. Additionally, these data will be useful to inform dose selection in future studies examining the efficacy of therapeutics and vaccines against inhalational COVID-19, and as a baseline in healthy, young adult animals for assessment of the importance of other factors, such as age, comorbidities, and viral variant, on the infectious dose and disease presentation.

AB  - Background: Although the proper use of hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) is paramount for preventing the spread of diseases such as COVID-19, health care personnel have been shown to use incorrect techniques for donning/doffing of PPE and hand hygiene, leading to a large number of infections among health professionals. Education and training are difficult owing to the social distancing restrictions in place, shortages of PPE and testing material, and lack of evidence on optimal training. Virtual reality (VR) simulation can offer a multisensory, 3-D, fully immersive, and safe training opportunity that addresses these obstacles.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the short- and long-term effectiveness of a fully immersive VR simulation versus a traditional learning method regarding a COVID-19-related skill set and media-specific variables influencing training outcomes.
   Methods: This was a prospective, randomized controlled pilot study on medical students (N=29; intervention VR training, n=15, vs control video-based instruction, n=14) to compare the performance of hand disinfection, nasopharyngeal swab taking, and donning/doffing of PPE before and after training and 1 month later as well as variables of media use.
   Results: Both groups performed significantly better after training, with the effect sustained over one month. After training, the VR group performed significantly better in taking a nasopharyngeal swab, scoring a median of 14 out of 17 points (IQR 13-15) versus 12 out of 17 points (IQR 11-14) in the control group, P=.03. With good immersion and tolerability of the VR simulation, satisfaction was significantly higher in the VR group compared to the control group (median score of User Satisfaction Evaluation Questionnaire 27/30, IQR 23-28, vs 22/30, IQR 20-24, in the control group; P=.01).
   Conclusions: VR simulation was at least as effective as traditional learning methods in training medical students while providing benefits regarding user satisfaction. These results add to the growing body of evidence that VR is a useful tool for acquiring simple and complex clinical skills.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed a significant strain on healthcare resources and utilisation globally. The appearance of the disease in the Republic of Ireland resulted in a broad postponement of scheduled and routine surgical care. The influence of the novel coronavirus, and the associated imposition of public health measures such as school closures and social distancing, on the burden of emergency surgical disease is less clear.
   Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the impact of COVID-19 on the number of patients presenting to our institution with emergent surgical illnesses or requiring emergency general surgical procedures.
   Methods: All patients attending our service between March 1st 2020 and April 30th 2020 were identified retrospectively by examining electronic handover and electronic discharge summaries, and data were collected relating to demographics, presenting illness, critical care utilisation, length of stay, operative or endoscopic procedure performed, and inhospital mortality. Similar data were collected March 1st to April 30th 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively to allow direct comparison.
   Results: 151 patients were admitted during the study period, compared to a total of 788 during the proceeding three years (mean 2.49 admissions per night versus 4.35 per night, 42.8% reduction, p < 0.001). Median age of admitted patients was 51.8 years, compared to 50.3 years formerly (p = 0.35). 53 emergency procedures were performed, compared to a median of 70 over the same period in the previous years (mean 0.87 per day versus 1.16 per day, 25.4% reduction, p = 0.05).
   Conclusion: A significant overall reduction in the number of patients being admitted to our unit and requiring emergency surgical procedures during March and April 2020 was seen, in line with patterns reported internationally.

AB  - During 2020-2021, the COVID-19 pandemics exacerbated the use of digital communication tools for the general population as well as for migrant and diasporic communities. Due to social distancing requirements, church activities had to be suspended or restricted, therefore, local congregations and denominations had to incorporate social media as part of their regular worship channels in an unprecedented way. At the same time, these new spaces opened an opportunity for diasporas to reconnect with their churches back home, and to participate in digital worship projects. In this paper, we study the case of the digital worship collective Adorando en Casa (AeC), which was started at the onset of the pandemics, producing several crowdsourced original musical compositions, uploaded in popular social media sites, and distributed via messaging apps. We focus on the reasons for participation of Venezuelan musicians and singers from different regions in the country, and from the large diaspora of Venezuelan Evangelicals. Additionally, we analyze the characteristics, structure, and theology of some of the songs recorded, to show how the concept of a digital diasporic spiritual consciousness is powerfully expressed through worship music.

AB  - Fact: Holding force constant, a snowball thrown from 10 feet away will hurt more than one thrown from 50 feet away; it will have more impact. We show that people expect charitable donations-much like snowballs-to have more impact on nearby (vs. faraway) targets. Therefore, because making an impact is a powerful motivator of prosocial behavior, people are more willing to take action to help nearby (vs. faraway) causes-independent of social distance. Six studies, including lab and field experiments, and secondary data from fundraising campaigns support this prediction. Specifically, Study 1 shows that people expect charitable donations to have a greater impact on nearby (vs. faraway) recipients, and that these judgments stem from metaphorical thinking. In the context of alumni giving to their alma mater, the next two studies show that donations increase as real (Study 2) or perceived (Study 3) distances decrease. Study 4 extends these findings using a more conservative manipulation of distance perception (Study 4). Finally, Study 5 demonstrates the mediating role of expected impact on the effect of perceived distance on charitable action, whereas Study 6 shows that a motivational focus on making an impact moderates this effect.

AB  - This study aimed to estimate the multilevel determinants of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age women living in six cities in Nigeria (Abuja, Benin, Ibadan, Ilorin, Kaduna, and Zaria). Data from cross-sectional surveys conducted between 2010 and 2011 were linked to provide information on five hierarchical levels of the Socioecological Framework. Multilevel logit models estimated the odds of modern contraceptive use among 9,473 non-pregnant married/cohabiting women aged 15-49 years living in 488 clusters. About 25 percent of the women reported using modern contraceptive methods at the time of survey. Individual-level factors found to have a positive association with modern contraceptive use were parity, family planning self-efficacy, and partner discussion about fertility desires while perception of negative attitudes from community member about contraceptive use was negatively associated with modern contraceptive use (p < 0.05). At the community level, media exposure to family planning messages and city of residence were significantly associated with modern contraceptive use in the studied sample (p < 0.05). The positive association between parity and modern contraceptive use was modified by the community's ideal family size. The results of this study support the evidence for multilevel interventions as a way to improve the prevalence of modern contraceptive use in urban Nigeria.

AB  - This study examined whether expecting prejudice is demotivating. Women were led to believe they were being evaluated for a co-manager position. They were randomly assigned to receive information that the evaluator held negative attitudes toward women or that he did not. We hypothesized that compared to women led to believe that the evaluator was unprejudiced, women led to believe the evaluator was prejudiced would: (a) have lower expectations for being chosen as co-manager; (b) place less value on being chosen as co-manager; and (c) be less motivated to perform a task that would influence selection as co-manager. We predicted that the effect of prejudice on motivation would be mediated by expectations and valuing of success. Results were consistent with predictions.

AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics.

AB  - In February 2014, the Food and Drug Administration launched The Real Cost, a national youth tobacco prevention campaign. This article examines youth receptivity to potential campaign ads using data from 3 message pretesting studies featuring the same design and consistent instrumentation. A total of 3,258 adolescents ages 13-17 were randomized to either an ad-viewing condition or a no-exposure control condition. Perceived ad effectiveness, smoking-related beliefs, and attitudes were measured as outcome variables. The sample consisted of both experimental smokers (58%) and current nonsmokers at risk for cigarette initiation (42%). A total of 14 ads were tested across the three studies. Participants who viewed the ads generally considered them to be effective (with a mean perceived ad effectiveness score of 3.66 on a scale from 1 to 5). Compared to those in the control condition, participants in the ad-viewing condition reported stronger beliefs about the health risks of smoking (p<.001), a greater likelihood that smoking would lead to loss of control in life (p<.001), and more negative attitudes toward smoking (p<.001). Responses to campaign ads were largely consistent between experimenters and at-risk nonsmokers. Implications of the findings for the campaign are discussed.

AB  - Background: Specifying the determinants of using health apps has been an important research topic for health scholars as health apps have proliferated during the past decade. Socioeconomic status (SES) has been revealed as a significant determinant of using health apps, but the cognitive mechanisms underlying the relationship between SES and health app use are unknown. Objective: This study aims to examine the cognitive mechanisms underlying the relationships between SES and use of health apps, applying the integrative model of behavioral prediction (IM). The model hypothesizes the indirect influences of SES on intentions to use health apps, which in turn predict actual use of health apps. The relationships between SES and intentions to use health apps were assumed to be mediated by proximal variables (attitudes, perceived behavioral control [PBC], injunctive norms, and descriptive norms).
   Methods: We conducted path analyses using data from a two-wave opt-in panel survey of Korean adults who knew about health apps. The number of respondents was 605 at baseline and 440 at follow-up. We compared our model with two alternative theoretical models based on modified IM to further clarify the roles of determinants of health app use.
   Results: Attitudes (beta=.220, P<.001), PBC (beta=.461, P<.001), and injunctive norms (beta=.186, P<.001) were positively associated with intentions to use health apps, which, in turn, were positively related to actual use of health apps (beta=.106, P=.03). Income was positively associated with intentions to use health apps, and this relationship was mediated by attitudes (B=0.012, 95% CI 0.001-0.023) and PBC (B=0.026, 95% CI 0.004-0.048). Education was positively associated with descriptive norms (beta=.078, P=.03), but descriptive norms were not significantly related to intentions to use health apps. We also found that PBC interacted with attitudes (B=0.043, SE 0.022, P=.046) and jointly influenced intentions to use health apps, whereas the results did not support direct influences of education, income, and PBC on health app use. Conclusions: We found that PBC over using health apps may be the most important factor in predicting health app use. This suggests the necessity of designing and promoting health apps in a user-friendly way. Our findings also imply that socioeconomic inequalities in using health apps may be reduced by increasing positive attitudes toward, and boosting PBC over, health app use among individuals with low income.

AB  - The aim of the article is to highlight the key elements related to the implementation of new technologies in education from the perspective of the opinions and experiences of educators in the field in Bolivia, Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Finland, Poland, Turkey, and Uruguay. The text compares issues related to attitudes towards the use of new media in education, experiences with different forms of e-learning, and the level of restrictions on the use of smartphones in school. These variables are juxtaposed with the self-assessment of digital competence and how cyberspace is used. The survey was conducted using a standardised survey questionnaire translated into the relevant national languages in the first half of 2019, and involved a sample of 873 teachers representing eight countries. On the basis of the pilot studies it was noted that: 1) Teachers from LAC and EU like to use digital media - this is a constant trend independent of geographical location; 2) Teachers note that new technologies are not always better than analogue didactic aids; 3) Teachers from selected countries (the Dominican Republic, Brazil, Turkey, and Uruguay) have much greater techno-optimism in themselves than teachers from Bolivia, Poland, Finland and Turkey in terms of the impact of ICT on student motivation and engagement; 4) In all countries teachers prefer free online courses (the different forms of e-learning are used most often by those in the Dominican Republic, and the least often in Bolivia and Poland); 5) In each country teachers who highly value their own digital competences and have a positive attitude towards new media use ICT much more actively; 6) There is also a global trend in that the extensive use of cyberspace (typical e-services) appears in combination with the extensive use of various forms of e-learning; 7) Teachers from Ecuador are most likely to want to ban the use of smartphones in schools. The most liberal approach in this respect is taken by the Uruguayans; 8) The knowledge of the conditions related to restricting the use of smartphones goes beyond the analyses related to the style of use and attitude towards new media. This article is the result of pilot studies conducted within the framework of the SMART ECOSYSTEM FOR LEARNING AND INCLUSION project carried out in selected Latin American, Caribbean (LAC) and European (EU) countries.

AB  - Purpose: This article reports the user-oriented evaluation of a text-and content-based medical image retrieval system. User tests with radiologists using a search system for images in the medical literature are presented. The goal of the tests is to assess the usability of the system, identify system and interface aspects that need improvement and useful additions. Another objective is to investigate the system's added value to radiology information retrieval. The study provides an insight into required specifications and potential shortcomings of medical image retrieval systems through a concrete methodology for conducting user tests.
   Methods: User tests with a working image retrieval system of images from the biomedical literature were performed in an iterative manner, where each iteration had the participants perform radiology information seeking tasks and then refining the system as well as the user study design itself. During these tasks the interaction of the users with the system was monitored, usability aspects were measured, retrieval success rates recorded and feedback was collected through survey forms.
   Results: In total, 16 radiologists participated in the user tests. The success rates in finding relevant information were on average 87% and 78% for image and case retrieval tasks, respectively. The average time for a successful search was below 3 min in both cases. Users felt quickly comfortable with the novel techniques and tools (after 5 to 15 min), such as content-based image retrieval and relevance feedback. User satisfaction measures show a very positive attitude toward the system's functionalities while the user feedback helped identifying the system's weak points. The participants proposed several potentially useful new functionalities, such as filtering by imaging modality and search for articles using image examples.
   Conclusion: The iterative character of the evaluation helped to obtain diverse and detailed feedback on all system aspects. Radiologists are quickly familiar with the functionalities but have several comments on desired functionalities. The analysis of the results can potentially assist system refinement for future medical information retrieval systems. Moreover, the methodology presented as well as the discussion on the limitations and challenges of such studies can be useful for user-oriented medical image retrieval evaluation, as user-oriented evaluation of interactive system is still only rarely performed. Such interactive evaluations can be limited in effort if done iteratively and can give many insights for developing better systems. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To quantify the efficacy of masking and "social distancing" on the transmission of airborne particles from a phantom aerosol source (simulating an infected individual) to a nearby target (simulating a healthy bystander) in a well-controlled setting. Methods: An aerosol was created using monodisperse polystyrene latex beads in place of infectious respiratory secretions. Detection was by aerodynamic particle spectrometry. Both reusable cloth masks and disposable paper masks were studied. Transmission was simulated indoors during a 3-minute interval to eliminate the effect of variable ventilation rate on aerosol exposure. The study commenced on September 16, 2020, and concluded on December 15, 2020. Results: Compared with a baseline of 1-foot separation with no masks employed, particle count was reduced by 84% at 3 feet of separation and 97% at 6 feet. A modest decrease in particle count was observed when only the receiver was masked. The most substantial exposure reduction occurred when the aerosol source was masked (or both parties were masked). When both the source and target were masked, particle count was reduced by more than 99.5% of baseline, regardless of separation distance or which type of mask was employed. Conclusion: These results support the principle of layered protection to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing COVID-19, and other respiratory viruses and emphasize the importance of controlling the spread of aerosol at its source. The combination of masking and distancing reduced the exposure to exhaled particulates more than any individual measure. Combined measures remain the most effective way to combat the spread of respiratory infection. (C) 2021 Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research

AB  - Many individuals diagnosed with eating disorders describe their disorder as being represented by an internal 'voice'. In line with cognitive models of voice-hearing, previous research has identified associations between voice appraisals and eating psychopathology in anorexia nervosa. Whether these findings generalise to other eating disorder subtypes remains unknown. The aetiology of the internal eating disorder voice also remains unclear. Traumatic-dissociative models of voice-hearing, which link such experiences to decontexualised material arising from early traumatic events, might also be relevant to eating disorder groups. To determine whether cognitive models of trauma and voice-hearing apply across eating disorder subtypes, 85 individuals fulfilling ICD-10 criteria for an eating disorder completed self-report measures regarding eating disorder cognitions, voice-related appraisals, childhood trauma, and dissociation. The relative power of the eating disorder voice was found to be positively associated with experiences of childhood emotional abuse, and this relationship was partly mediated by dissociation. In addition, eating disorder voices appraised as powerful and benevolent predicted more negative attitudes towards eating across diagnostic groups, but were unrelated to disordered eating behaviours or weight. These findings suggest that the eating disorder voice plays a meaningful role in eating pathology across diagnoses and that this experience might be related, in part, to experiences of childhood maltreatment. Therapeutic implications are discussed.

AB  - Young people are particularly vulnerable to health risk behaviors and interpersonal violence, stimulating scholars attention towards identifying factors that may reduce the likelihood that these actions will occur. Associated with positive outcomes in a variety of domains, mental toughness in young people might protect them from engaging in potentially deleterious interpersonal or health-risk behaviors, while potentially promoting positive psychological behaviors. Within this framework, the present study investigated the relationships between mental toughness, attitudes towards physical and psychological risk-taking, and trait forgiveness in a sample of 123 (males = 54, females = 69) South African youth (M age = 23.97 years, SD = 4.46). Univariate and multivariate analyses indicated higher levels of mental toughness were associated with being more forgiving, (eta(2)(p) = .036), perceiving physical risk-taking more positively (eta(2)(p) = .062), but having more negative attitudes towards psychological risk-taking (eta(2)(p) = .036). These findings give credence to mental toughness as a psychological characteristic involved in youth risk-taking perceptions and interpersonal functioning. Future research might explore the integration of mental toughness into the development of future youth risk behavior interventions.

AB  - Background: Patients are often confronted with diverse medical decisions. Often lacking relevant medical knowledge, patients fail to independently make medical decisions and instead generally rely on the advice of doctors.
   Objective: This study investigated the characteristics of and differences in doctor-patient medical decision making on the basis of construal level theory.
   Methods: A total of 420 undergraduates majoring in clinical medicine were randomly assigned to six groups. Their decisions to opt for radiotherapy and surgery were investigated, with the choices described in a positive/neutral/negative frame 6 decision making for self/others.
   Results: Compared with participants giving medical advice to patients, participants deciding for themselves were more likely to select radiotherapy (F-1,F- 404 = 13.92, p = 011). Participants from positive or neutral frames exhibited a higher tendency to choose surgery than did those from negative frames (F-2,F- 404 = 22.53, p < .001). The effect of framing on independent decision making was nonsignificant (F-2,F- 404 = 1.07, p = 35); however the effect of framing on the provision of advice to patients was significant (F-2,F- 404 = 12.95, p < .001). The effect of construal level was significant in the positive frame (F-1,F- 404 = 8.06, p = 005) and marginally significant in the neutral frame (F-2,F- 404 = 3.31, p = 07) but nonsignificant in the negative frame (F-2,F- 404 = .29, p = 59).
   Conclusion: Both social distance and framing depiction significantly affected medical decision making and exhibited a significant interaction. Differences in medical decision making between doctors and patients need further investigation.

AB  - Background In Japan, community medicine clerkships facilitate positive attitudes toward rural medical practice and encourage rural recruitment. Rural self-efficacy has been shown to influence rural career intent following a rural clinical placement. However, the impact of subjective difficulties of living in a rural area on future rural career intent is also important. This study aims to explore whether rural self-efficacy influences the relationship between difficulty with living in a rural area and rural career intent. Methods The subjects included 308 male and 255 female participants aged 20-41 [median (interquartile range): 22 (21-22)] years. Rural self-efficacy was based on a validated scale consisting of 15 questions. Difficulty with living in a rural area was measured asking students. A cohort survey was conducted to evaluate the effect of the rural self-efficacy score on the rural career intent of Japanese medical students after they completed their rural clinical training. Results The following variables were significantly associated with a higher rural self-efficacy score: female sex (p = 0.003), age < 21 years (p = 0.013), having a doctor as a role model (p < 0.001), gaining admission through a school recommendation (p = 0.016), living in a rural or remote area until the age of 18 years (p = 0.018), and orientation towards general medicine (p < 0.001). In addition, baseline difficulty with living in a rural area was significantly associated with a lower self-efficacy score (p < 0.001). Participants with a stronger intent to practice in a rural area before rural clinical training had higher rural self-efficacy and showed a stronger positive rural career intent after rural clinical training (p < 0.001). A multivariable logistic regression analysis demonstrated that difficulty with living in a rural area [odds ratio (OR): 0.61; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.39-0.84] was still associated with lower rural career intent after rural clinical training, independent of all confounders such as gender, age, scholarship for regional duty, rural background, and orientation towards general medicine. However, when rural self-efficacy (OR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16) was added as a factor for rural career intent, difficulty with living in a rural area (OR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.43-1.06) was no longer observed as an associated factor. Conclusion Subjective difficulty with living in a rural area was shown to reduce future rural career intent, but high rural self-efficacy ameliorated this decline.

TI  - COVID-19 and the public response: Knowledge, attitude and practice of the public in mitigating the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - OUTBREAK
AB  - Background
   The COVID-19 pandemic is impacting the global community in many ways. Combating the COVID-19 pandemic requires a coordinated effort through engaging public and service providers in preventive measures. The government of Ethiopia had already announced prevention guidelines for the public. However, there is a scarcity of evidence-based data on the public knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) and response of the service providers regarding COVID-19.
   Objective
   This study aimed to assess the public KAP and service providers' preparedness towards the pandemic in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, from late March to the first week of April 2020. Participants were conveniently sampled from 10 different city sites. Data collection was performed using a self-administered questionnaire and observational assessment using a checklist. All statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficient and chi-square tests were performed.
   Result
   A total of 839 public participants and 420 service providers enrolled in the study. The mean age was 30.30 (range = 18-72) years. The majority of the respondents (58.6%) had moderate knowledge about COVID-19, whereas 37.2% had good knowledge. Moreover, 60.7% and 59.8% of the participants had a positive attitude towards preventive measures and good practice to mitigate the pandemic, respectively. There was a moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitude, whereas the correlations between knowledge and practice and attitude and practice were weak. With regard to service providers' preparedness, 70% have made hand-washing facilities available. A large majority of the respondents (84.4%) were using government-owned media followed by social media (46.0%) as a main source of information.
   Conclusion
   The public in Addis Ababa had moderate knowledge, an optimistic attitude and descent practice. The information flow from government and social media seemed successful seeing the majority of the respondents identifying preventive measures, signs and symptoms and transmission route of SARS-CoV-2. Knowledge and attitude was not associated with practice, thus, additional innovative strategies for practice changes are needed. Two thirds of the service provider made available hand washing facilities which seems a first positive step. However, periodic evaluation of the public KAP and assessment of service providers' preparedness is mandatory to combat the pandemic effectively.

AB  - THE PRESENT STUDY EXPLORES views and attitudes of preschool teachers on the role of television in the life of preschool children by investigating the effects of TV viewing on the behaviour of preschoolers and the procedure of learning. A structured questionnaire was used to select opinions and views of 231 preschool teachers in the region of Central Macedonia in Northern Greece. Descriptive statistics and data analysis were performed with SPSS. The analysis revealed that preschool teachers have chiefly negative attitudes towards the effects of TV viewing on the behaviour and everyday life of preschool children and surprisingly these attitudes and views were the same among preschool teachers with different years of teaching experience.

AB  - Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an "intervention tournament" which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (N = 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19-including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidence-were implemented to identify which framings would "win" in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19.

AB  - The aim of this study was twofold: first to create a self-report scale that measures responsiveness to cuteness andkawaiiin three key domains (baby animals, baby humans, and animate objects), and secondly to apply the measure to predicting parental attitudes toward corporal punishment. Currently, there are no self-report measures of this construct in theoretically consistent domains that encompass both cuteness andkawaii. In Study 1, a 15-item Cuteness Responsiveness (CR-15) scale was developed to assess responsiveness to infantile human and non-humankawaiicreatures, which is defined as individual differences in the sensitivity to cuteness and readiness for a variety of caretaking behaviors. The CR-15 demonstrated evidence of good psychometric properties and fit into the three-factor structure. In Study 2, we recruited parents with a child/children under the age of 6 to test how responsiveness to cuteness affects parenting using the scale developed in Study 1. The results showed lower responsiveness to cuteness predicted parental approval for corporal punishment, and negative attitudes toward parenting mediated the link. Together, these studies demonstrate that the human baby subscale of the CR-15 can predict a tendency to experience positive emotions in response to infantile creatures and motivation for caretaking behaviors. Implications of cuteness/kawaiiresponses as a multidimensional construct and future directions are discussed.

AB  - In recent years, as part of the broader policies of economic liberalization, the sale of agricultural land to foreign citizens has attracted considerable political, social and media attention in transition societies. The regime of land ownership in Georgia has evolved from the complete restriction of foreign acquisition in the beginning of the 1990s, to the unrestricted sale of land to foreign citizens from 2010 onwards. An analysis of newly-available data from International Social Survey Programme's (ISSP) National Identity module suggests that respondents in Georgia, along with Russia, hold the most negative attitudes toward selling land to foreigners compared to other countries. I hypothesize that this is the result of a confluence of factors such as the communist legacy, historical memory, rural nationalism, agricultural underdevelopment and inequality. The quantitative part of this article tests socio-demographic, geographic, ideological, and identity-based explanations of within-country variation in attitudes toward the purchase of land by foreigners. The results suggest that socio-demographic and geographic variables such as respondents' age and regional belonging explain some variance in the dependent variable, but that the major effects stem from individuals' perceptions of economic protectionism, xenophobia, and ethnic national identity.

AB  - Background:Between January and April 2020, China implemented differentiated prevention and control strategies across the country, based on the severity of the COVID-19 epidemic/pandemic in different regions. These strategies included lockdowns, social distancing, and the closure of public places. These measures may have affected dietary intake to varying degrees. This study aimed to assess variations in food intake and diet quality among pregnant women according to regional severity and related control measures during the most severe period of COVID-19 restrictions in 2020. MethodsA total of 3,678 pregnant women from 19 provinces/municipalities in mainland China were analyzed in this nationwide, multi-center study. Food intake data were obtained and assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). Diet quality was quantified using the Diet Balance Index for Pregnancy (DBI-P), which included high bound score (HBS, excessive dietary intake), low bound score (LBS, insufficient dietary intake), and diet quality distance (DQD, dietary imbalance). Linear trend tests and multivariable regression analyses were performed to examine the association between food intake, DBI-P and the severity of pandemic. ResultsThe median daily intake of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy, and nuts decreased (p < 0.05) according to low, moderate, and high severity of the pandemic, while no significant differences in cereals/potatoes, eggs, and fish/shrimp intake. The median daily intake of cereals/potatoes exceeded the recommended ranges, and the daily intake of eggs and fish/shrimp was below recommended ranges regardless of the pandemic severity (p < 0.05). Regarding diet quality, HBS decreased (lower excessive consumption) (p = 0.047) and LBS increased (greater insufficient consumption) (p = 0.046) with increased severity of the pandemic. On multivariable analyses, moderate and high pandemic severity were related to lower HBS risk (OR = 0.687, OR = 0.537) and higher LBS risk (beta = 1.517, beta = 3.020) when compared to low pandemic severity. ConclusionsUnder more severe COVID-19 pandemic conditions, pregnant women consumed less quality food, characterized by reduced consumption of vegetables, fruit, livestock/poultry meat, dairy and nuts, while the quality of the foods that pregnant women consumed in excess tended to improve, but the overconsumption of cereals/potatoes was a problem.

AB  - Objectives: The role of overcrowded and multigenerational households as a risk factor for COVID-19 remains unmeasured. The objective of this study is to examine and quantify the association between overcrowded and multigenerational households and COVID-19 in New York City (NYC).
   Study design: Cohort study.
   Methods: We conducted a Bayesian ecological time series analysis at the ZIP Code Tabulation Area (ZCTA) level in NYC to assess whether ZCTAs with higher proportions of overcrowded (defined as the proportion of the estimated number of housing units with more than one occupant per room) and multigenerational households (defined as the estimated percentage of residences occupied by a grandparent and a grandchild less than 18 years of age) were independently associated with higher suspected COVID-19 case rates (from NYC Department of Health Syndromic Surveillance data for March 1 to 30, 2020). Our main measure was an adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) of suspected COVID-19 cases per 10,000 population. Our final model controlled for ZCTA-level sociodemographic factors (median income, poverty status, White race, essential workers), the prevalence of clinical conditions related to COVID-19 severity (obesity, hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, asthma, smoking status, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), and spatial clustering.
   Results: 39,923 suspected COVID-19 cases were presented to emergency departments across 173 ZCTAs in NYC. Adjusted COVID-19 case rates increased by 67% (IRR 1.67, 95% CI = 1.12, 2.52) in ZCTAs in quartile four (versus one) for percent overcrowdedness and increased by 77% (IRR 1.77, 95% CI = 1.11, 2.79) in quartile four (versus one) for percent living in multigenerational housing. Interaction between both exposures was not significant (binteraction = 0.99, 95% CI: 0.99-1.00).
   Conclusions: Overcrowdedness and multigenerational housing are independent risk factors for suspected COVID-19. In the early phase of the surge in COVID cases, social distancing measures that increase housebound populations may inadvertently but temporarily increase SARS-CoV-2 transmission risk and COVID-19 disease in these populations.

AB  - Based on the scarcity theory, this study focuses on exploring the relationship between the severity of public health emergencies (i.e., COVID-19) and individual irrational consumer behaviors through the serial mediating variables of perceived scarcity (PS) and negative mentality (NM). An online questionnaire was used to collect data from participants in China and we obtained 466 effective (115 male and 351 female) questionnaires in total. The findings showed that the relationship between each pair of factors - perceived pandemic severity, PS, NM, and irrational consumption behaviors - was significantly positive. Although the perception of the severity of this public health emergency did not directly predict irrational consumer behavior, the effect was mediated by PS and NM independently and serially. These findings reveal that people who strongly perceive scarcity and are prone to negative attitudes are more likely to demonstrate irrational consumer behaviors (such as rushing to buy and hoard living supplies) once the public perceives a public health emergency as severe. This effect occurs because the PS that results from the epidemic affects people's cognition, emotion, and behavior.

AB  - We analyze more than 3,000,000 Twitter, 800,000 Instagram, and 50,000 Tumblr posts concerning a single major in-real-life event, Super Bowl XLIX, to determine attitude. We consider three event phases (Pre, During, and Post). Findings show link-based recommendations and undirected broadcast patterns positively correlate with attitude in the Pre and Post phases, respectively. The usage of these specific features highlights the differing information needs of viewers during these phases, specifically the sharing of information in the Pre phase and the sharing of opinions in the Post phase. The volume of postings indicates a negative attitude for all social media platforms, demonstrating that adverse information is more likely to be shared than positive information; this finding contradicts prior findings. This second screens phenomenon research is important in identifying the sharing information on multiple social media platforms during an in real life event.

AB  - Previous research has shown the harmful effects of stereotypical messages on viewers, including increased negative attitudes toward outgroup members. In contrast, positive or counter-stereotypical portrayals can lead to less prejudiced attitudes toward outgroup members; however, these kinds of portrayals are not always easy to come by. As a result, alternative methods for combating the effects of stereotypical messages are necessary. The current study examined the ability of self-transcendent emotions, specifically awe, to reduce the negative effects of stereotypical portrayals of African American men. Contrary to expectations, results showed that participants who watched an awe-inducing video before a stereotypical video reported more negative explicit attitudes toward African Americans compared to those in control conditions.

TI  - Monitoring the Emotional Response to the COVID-19 Pandemic Using Sentiment Analysis: A Case Study in Mexico
T2  - COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - TWITTER
AB  - The world is facing the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to an unprecedented change in the lifestyle routines of millions. Beyond the general physical health, financial, and social repercussions of the pandemic, the adopted mitigation measures also present significant challenges in the population's mental health and health programs. It is complex for public organizations to measure the population's mental health in order to incorporate it into their own decision-making process. Traditional survey methods are time-consuming, expensive, and fail to provide the continuous information needed to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of governmental policies on the population's mental health. A significant portion of the population has turned to social media to express the details of their daily life, rendering this public data a rich field for understanding emotional and mental well-being. This study aims to track and measure the sentiment changes of the Mexican population in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, we analyzed 760,064,879 public domain tweets collected from a public access repository to examine the collective shifts in the general mood about the pandemic evolution, news cycles, and governmental policies using open sentiment analysis tools. Sentiment analysis polarity scores, which oscillate around -0.15, show a weekly seasonality according to Twitter's usage and a consistently negative outlook from the population. It also remarks on the increased controversy after the governmental decision to terminate the lockdown and the celebrated holidays, which encouraged the people to incur social gatherings. These findings expose the adverse emotional effects of the ongoing pandemic while showing an increase in social media usage rates of 2.38 times, which users employ as a coping mechanism to mitigate the feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. The findings have important implications in the mental health infrastructure for ongoing mitigation efforts and feedback on the perception of policies and other measures. The overall trend of the sentiment polarity is 0.0001110643.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic has affected health care services worldwide due to lockdowns, prevention measures, and social distancing. During this period, patients, including older adults and those with chronic conditions, need ways to obtain medical attention other than going physically to the clinic, such as telemedicine services. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate attitudes toward telemedicine during the COVID-19 lockdown in Israel, assess willingness to use such services in the future, and evaluate the extent to which consumers have changed their minds regarding these services.
   Method: A cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study was conducted among adults (age 20-90) using social media networks (N = 693). Data were collected using an online questionnaire explicitly designed to measure attitudes toward telemedicine.
   Results: Most of the participants had to use telemedicine during the lockdown and were satisfied therewith. The majority also stated that they would continue using telemedicine in the future. However, only a third stated that they had changed their minds regarding telemedicine. The main predictors of willingness to use telemedicine in the future were the necessity of using such services during lockdown, preference for going to a clinic, and satisfaction with telemedicine, alongside gender and having a chronic illness. Importantly, we found that a preference for visiting the clinic was negatively correlated with willingness to use telemedicine in the future. Education and being single were predictors of the change of mind regarding telemedicine. Participants with chronic conditions are more likely to use these services, and specific attention should be directed to their needs. A small portion of the study sample prefers live appointments with a physician.
   Conclusions: Telemedicine use is rapidly changing. It is vital for health care providers to identify non-telemedicine users and their common characteristics. Monitoring patients' attitudes regarding telemedicine is essential in the future after the pandemic ends. Targeted outreach plans should be formulated. These plans should be directed at identifying barriers to using telemedicine, and they should generate specific, focused plans.

AB  - The lack of treatment options for COVID-19 has raised many concerns among populations worldwide, which has led to many attempts to find alternative options to prevent the transmission of the disease or to alleviate the progression of the infection, including focusing more on preventive measures (to pre-vent transmission to other individuals) and the use of natural products and herbal extracts to increase immunity and decrease the probability of getting infected. This study explored the knowledge of the population of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) about COVID-19 preventive measures and their belief about the consumption of herbal products for the prevention of COVID-19 infection. A total of 5,258 individuals participated in this study. Participants' knowledge about the appropriate COVID-19 preventive measures in terms of handwashing procedures, self-quarantine and social distancing was moderate, with a mean score of 5.5 (SD: 1.7) out of 10 (representing around 55.0% of the total score). About 22.1% (n = 1,161) of the participants reported that they have used herbal products or nutritional supplements during the pandemic period, to protect themselves from the disease. Social media and the Internet (39.4%, n = 372) were the main motivators for the participants to try herbal products. Vitamin C was the most commonly used food supplement to increase immunity and reduces the chance of contracting COVID19. Our study demonstrated that the general population in Saudi Arabia has a moderate level of knowledge about COVID-19 transmission and preventive measures. A considerable proportion of the population reported the use of herbal products or food supplements in order to protect themselves from the disease. Policymakers are suggested to provide further educational campaigns that increase population knowledge about the disease transmission routes and preventive measures. In addition, the use of herbal products should be evidence-based to ensure patient safety. (C) 2020 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Childhood obesity prevention is a public health priority in industrialized countries. The Reggio Emilia Local Health Authority has implemented a program involving primary and secondary prevention as well as the care of obese children. There are many health-promoting mobile apps, but few are targeted to children and very few are sponsored by public health agencies.
   Objective: The goal of the research was to describe the process and tools adopted to cocreate a mobile app sponsored by the Reggio Emilia Local Health Authority to be installed in parents' phones aimed at promoting child health and preventing obesity.
   Methods: After stakeholder mapping, a consulting committee including relevant actors, stakeholders, and users was formed. Key persons for childhood obesity prevention were interviewed, focus groups with parents and pediatricians were conducted, and community reporting storytelling was collected. The results of these activities were presented to the consulting committee in order to define the functionalities and contents of the mobile app.
   Results: Three key trends emerged from community reporting: being active, playing, and being outdoors; time for oneself, family, and friends; and the pressures of life and work and not having time to be active and socialize. In focus groups, interviews, and labs, mothers showed a positive attitude toward using an app to manage their children's weight, while pediatricians expressed concerns that the app could increase their workload. When these findings were explored by the consulting committee, four key themes were extracted: strong relationships with peers, family members, and the community; access to safe outdoor spaces; children's need for age-appropriate independence; and professional support should be nonjudgmental and stigma-free. It should be a dialogue that promotes family autonomy. The app functions related to these needs include the following: (1) newsletter with anticipatory guidance, recipes, and vaccination and well-child visit reminders; (2) regional map indicating where physical activity can be done; (3) information on how to manage emergencies (eg, falls, burns, fever); (4) module for reinforcing the counseling intervention conducted by pediatricians for overweight children; and (5) a function to build a balanced daily diet.
   Conclusions: The pilot study we conducted showed that cocreation in health promotion is feasible, with the consulting committee being the key co-governance and cocreation tool. The involvement of stakeholders in this committee made it possible to expand the number of persons and institutions actively contributing to the project.

AB  - Aim of the Study: To evaluate the views of medical students about online classes started in view of COVID-19 pandemic. Methodology: An online survey was conducted using Survey monkey platform (R). A survey link which was sent through the WhatsApp platform (R) to the MBBS/BDS students across the country. The survey questionnaire evaluated the views about the various aspects of the online classes. Results: A total of 1059 students completed the survey, of which 1033 entries were analyzed. The participants' mean age was 20.8 years with nearly equal male-to-female ratio, majority being MBBS students who were taking part in online classes mostly from home (95.4%), by using smart phones (85%). When asked to compare the experience of online classes with regular in-person classes, a majority of the participants reported having poor attention and concentration, poor retention of knowledge, poor learning of theoretical aspects of subject, poor learning of practical aspects of the subject, poor questions/answers sessions, and only 38.9% and 10.6% rated online theory and online practical classes as 'good' or 'very good,' respectively. The most common advantages of online classes reported by the students were that they do not have to travel (69%) and do not have to dress up (69.9%), while the most commonly reported disadvantages included poor learning of practical aspects (75%), followed by strain on eyes (73.4%) and difficulties with internet connectivity (64.8%). A small proportion of students 'occasionally' or more often indulged in surfing Internet, Chatting on WhatsApp/Telegram/FB Messenger, and using Social Media (Facebook, Instagram, We Chat, Snap Chat, and Telegram) while attending online classes. Conclusions: This study suggests that although various colleges are running online classes, as a substitute for the regular in person classes in view of the need for social distancing, these classes are not well received by the students and are possibly does not fulfilling the desired needs of the students. Further, the present study suggests that students still prefer in-person classes.

AB  - Background: Ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with a wide range of acute and chronic health effects, including increased risk of respiratory infection. However, evidence specifically related to novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is limited.
   Methods: COVID-19 case counts for 111 Canadian health regions were obtained from the COVID-19 Canada Open Data portal. Annual PM2.5 data for 2000-2016 were estimated from a national exposure surface based on remote sensing, chemical transport modelling and ground observations, and minimum and maximum temperature data for 2000-2015 were based on a national interpolated surface derived from thin-plate smoothing splines. Population counts and sociodemographic data by health region were obtained from the 2016 census, and health data (self-rated health and prevalence of smoking, obesity, and selected chronic diseases) by health region, were obtained from the Canadian Community Health Survey. Data on total number of COVID-19 tests and changes in mobility comparing post-vs. pre-introduction of social distancing measures were available by province. Data were analyzed using negative binomial regression models.
   Results: After controlling for province, temperature, demographic and health characteristics and days since peak incidence by health region, long-term PM(2)(.5 )exposure exhibited a positive association with COVID-19 incidence (incidence rate ratio 1.07, 95% confidence interval 0.97-1.18 per mu g/m(3)). This association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in analyses excluding provinces that reported cases only for aggregated health regions, excluding health regions with less than median population density, and restricted to the most highly affected provinces (Quebec and Ontario).
   Conclusions: We observed a positive association between COVID-19 incidence and long-term PM2.5 exposure in Canadian health regions. The association was larger in magnitude and statistically significant in more highly affected health regions and those with potentially less exposure measurement error. While our results generate hypotheses for further testing, they should be interpreted with caution and require further examination using study designs less prone to bias.

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this paper is to investigate the association between suicide and Lyme and associated diseases ( LAD). No journal article has previously performed a comprehensive assessment of this subject.
   Introduction: Multiple case reports and other references demonstrate a causal association between suicidal risk and LAD. Suicide risk is greater in outdoor workers and veterans, both with greater LAD exposure. Multiple studies demonstrate many infections and the associated proinflammatory cytokines, inflammatory-mediated metabolic changes, and quinolinic acid and glutamate changes alter neural circuits which increase suicidality. A similar pathophysiology occurs in LAD.
   Method: A retrospective chart review and epidemiological calculations were performed.
   Results: LAD contributed to suicidality, and sometimes homicidality, in individuals who were not suicidal before infection. A higher level of risk to self and others is associated with multiple symptoms developing after acquiring LAD, in particular, explosive anger, intrusive images, sudden mood swings, paranoia, dissociative episodes, hallucinations, disinhibition, panic disorder, rapid cycling bipolar, depersonalization, social anxiety disorder, substance abuse, hypervigilance, generalized anxiety disorder, genital-urinary symptoms, chronic pain, anhedonia, depression, low frustration tolerance, and posttraumatic stress disorder. Negative attitudes about LAD from family, friends, doctors, and the health care system may also contribute to suicide risk. By indirect calculations, it is estimated there are possibly over 1,200 LAD suicides in the US per year.
   Conclusion: Suicidality seen in LAD contributes to causing a significant number of previously unexplained suicides and is associated with immune-mediated and metabolic changes resulting in psychiatric and other symptoms which are possibly intensified by negative attitudes about LAD from others. Some LAD suicides are associated with being overwhelmed by multiple debilitating symptoms, and others are impulsive, bizarre, and unpredictable. Greater understanding and a direct method of acquiring LAD suicide statistics is needed. It is suggested that medical examiners, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other epidemiological organizations proactively evaluate the association between LAD and suicide.

AB  - BackgroundCervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide. Sub- Saharan Africa has a high incidence, prevalence and mortality due to shortage and underutilization of screening facilities. This study aims to assess knowledge and attitude towards cervical cancer and its prevention, as well as practice of cervical cancer screening.MethodsThis cross-sectional community- based study was conducted in Butajira, Ethiopia in February 2018. Systematic cluster randomized sampling was used to select households from which women in the targeted age group of 30-49years were invited to participate. Data was collected using a quantitative door to door approach. The questionnaire included socio-demographic data, obstetric history, general knowledge, risk factors, attitude and practice. Logistic regression was used to assess factors associated with knowledge, attitude and practice after dichotomizing the scores using the median as cut off point.ResultsThree hundred forty-two out of 354 women completed the interviewer administered questionnaire making the response rate 96.3%. 125 women (36%) were aware of cervical cancer and 14 (4.7%) knew symptoms. None of the women named HPV as a risk factor. 61% thought it was a deadly disease, 13.5% felt at risk of developing cervical cancer and 60.7% said cervical cancer is treatable. Eight women (2.3%) had previously been screened. 48.1% had a source of information concerning cervical cancer, of which 66.5% named nurses. Better knowledge was associated with 1-8years of education (OR=2.4; CI: 2.4-1.3), having a source of information (OR=9.1, CI:4.0-20.6), use of contraceptives (OR=2.3, CI: 1.3-4.0) and a higher income (OR=1.009, CI: 1.00-1.01). Naming nurses (OR:5.0, CI:2.4-10.3), another source of information (OR=3.3, CI:1.2-9.0), use of contraceptives (OR=2.2, CI:1.2-3.8) and living in an urban area (OR=3.3, CI:1.2-9.0) were associated with a positive attitude. Naming nurses (OR=21,0, CI:10.4-42.3) and another source of information (OR=5.8, CI:2.4-13.5) were associated with participating in cervical cancer screening.ConclusionMost women were unaware of cervical cancer, HPV-infection as a risk factor and did not feel susceptible to cervical cancer. As Health workers were the most commonly mentioned source of information, focus should be put on their further education.

AB  - Current innovation literature provides a very limited understanding of the potential impacts of innovative culture on employees. Building on resource-based view theory, the authors investigate theoretically and empirically how a perceived innovative culture can be a building block for a firm's competitive resource and advantage by creating superior employee-level outcomes and how a market information-sharing process may moderate these effects. The authors identify three distinct types of individual-level outcomes stemming from an innovative culture. The three outcome variables-job satisfaction, organizational dynamism perception, and firm performance perception-reflect employees' psychological and cognitive reactions to the process of creating organizational innovation and innovative culture. The authors collect survey data from 3960 individual employees in China. Their findings first show that a perceived innovative culture significantly and positively affects employees' job satisfaction and perceptions of organizational dynamism and firm performance. Moreover, organizational dynamism perception plays an important mediating role among three employee-level outcomes by converting job satisfaction into firm performance perception. The authors also find support for the direct, positive effect of a perceived market information-sharing process on job satisfaction but not on perceptions of organizational dynamism and firm performance. Most importantly, their findings on the significant moderating role of a market information-sharing system contribute to innovation theory by emphasizing the importance of the innovation/ marketing interface: bundling market information sharing and innovative culture together enhances employees' positive attitudes and perceptions. This result also suggests that examining only the direct effects of innovative culture and market information sharing may lead to incorrect conclusions as to how to manage the cultural infusion process: the market information-sharing process shows only a weak effect on job satisfaction and no effect on perceptions of organizational dynamism or firm performance. Organizational designs should ensure simultaneous consideration of both variables in the cultural transformation process to enhance employees' derived benefits in the process of creating an innovative culture. We offer a new insight: a perceived market information-sharing process may strengthen the effect of an innovative culture on employees' job satisfaction and organizational dynamism perception, while it may weaken the effect of an innovative culture on firm performance perception. This more nuanced view of market information sharing in the cultural infusion process presents new wisdom and calls for further studies in entrepreneurial innovation.

AB  - Individuals with eating pathology, particularly those with diagnosed eating disorders, are at high risk for suicide. It is less clear whether undiagnosed eating pathology and subsyndromal eating disorders carry the same risk and, if so, what mechanisms may explain why higher levels of eating pathology yield greater risk for engaging in suicidal behaviors. The indirect relationship between disordered eating and risk for suicidal behaviors via facets of experiential avoidance was tested using a multiple-mediator model. The model was tested using bootstrapping estimates of indirect effects in a sample of 218 noncollege student adults (Mage=32.33, 66.1% women) with a history of suicidal attempt and/or history of nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI). Results revealed that disordered eating indirectly predicted risk for suicidal behaviors, distress aversion (i.e., negative attitudes or dislike of distress), and procrastination (i.e., delaying engagement with distressing activities). Results suggest that targeting experiential avoidance and helping those who have a history of engaging in suicidal behaviors and/or NSSI develop regulation strategies to use during times of distress may be of utmost importance for treatment and prevention of eating pathology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Capturing the baseline information on awareness, practices, and prevailing myths related to the ongoing coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic in rural India will help in planning interventions to improve the health literacy on COVID-19. The aim of the study was to assess the level of awareness, practices, and myths regarding COVID-19 among rural population of Kolar district in South India.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A concurrent mixed-methods study with a quantitative community-based cross-sectional analytical design and a qualitative phenomenological design was conducted in five randomly selected villages during June 2020. A prevalidated and pretested semi-structured questionnaire was administered to one adult in the households selected using systematic random sampling to capture the sociodemographic details and their awareness, practices, and myths related to COVID-19. The supervisors additionally and concurrently used a nonparticipant observation technique to record the real-time behaviors and preventive practices adopted by the villagers. Quantitative analysis was done using STATA and included multivariable regression analysis, and the association was reported using prevalence rates along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Qualitative analysis was done manually as per discussion and concordance among supervisors and reported as categories along with supporting statements.RESULTS: Among the 298 respondents, "poor awareness " was seen in 128 (43.0%, 95% CI: 37.5%-48.6%). Among the responders, 89 (29.9%) believed in the myth that "Corona disease is due to God's wrath or curse. " The field observations were categorized under three categories - "avoidance of masks, " "nonexistent social distancing, " and "rampant spitting. "CONCLUSION: About two in five villagers were found to have "poor awareness " to COVID, and practices related to COVID were found to be largely unsatisfactory. Lower level of education and belonging to nuclear family were associated with "poor awareness. " Various myths were identified that has to be debunked on priority basis by the government, especially targeting the people having low level of education in rural India.

AB  - Purpose - Today's organizations try to keep their employees loyalty but employees may still feel unsatisfied and adopt negative attitudes. Cynicism, as a negative attitude of employees toward their organization, leads to unwanted outputs such as lower performance or lower loyalties that can appear in every kind of sector. Accordingly, the purpose of this paper is to determine the effects of personality traits on organizational cynicism in the education sector.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used the survey method to collect data and survey forms were distributed to teachers from various private schools in Istanbul, Turkey. With the e-mail survey method, the authors received 254 healthy survey forms from teachers. For personality traits, the five-factor model of personality traits that was developed by McCrae and Costa (1987) was preferred and the organizational cynicism model was evaluated with three basic dimensions as based on Brandes's (1997) model.
   Findings - Based on data from 254 teachers of various private schools in Istanbul, interrelationships amongst personality traits and organizational cynicism were tested. On the basis of the partial least-squares method, the authors found that agreeableness had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism, conscientiousness had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism, neuroticism had a negative effect on cognitive cynicism and behavior cynicism, and openness to experience had a positive effect on cognitive cynicism and affective cynicism. Thus, it can be said that personality traits of teachers had a significant effect on organizational cynicism as a result of this study.
   Research limitations/implications - This study used two main scales: the scale of McCrae and Costa (1987) for personality traits and the scale of Brandes (1997) for organizational cynicism. The authors adapted both the scales for Turkish culture and the education sector that the results can be considered valid for only this study.
   Originality/value - This study shows a significant effect of personality traits on cynicism in the education sector and thus can be considered to be useful for future studies.

AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy.

AB  - Public acceptance constitutes an important factor in successfully establishing and operating nuclear power plants. This paper explores public attitudes to the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Project commissioned in 2013 and situated in Southern India, through assessing the role of socio-demographic factors, externalities, and social trust in determining the level of public acceptance. An exploratory survey (n = 100) was carried out in two administrative units in the vicinity of the plant. The study reveals that acceptance of the plant is positively correlated with positive externalities and trust in governmental entities, whereas negative externalities and trust in antinuclear nongovernmental organizations and media are associated with negative public perception. The results show that governmental policies on nuclear power must support the effects of positive externalities and reduce the effects of negative externalities.

AB  - On YouTube antismoking PSAs are widely viewed and uploaded; they also receive extensive commentary by viewers. This study examined whether such evaluative comments with or without uncivil expressions influence evaluations by subsequent viewers. Results showed PSAs with positive (i.e. antismoking) comments were perceived by smokers as more effective than PSAs with negative (prosmoking) comments. Smokers in the no-comment condition gave the highest perceived effectiveness score to PSAs. Smokers' readiness to quit smoking moderated the effect of comments on PSA evaluation. Smokers reading negative uncivil comments reported more negative attitude toward quitting and a lower level of perceived risk of smoking than those reading negative civil comments but positive civil and positive uncivil comments did not elicit different responses.

AB  - Consumption of insects has gained interest because it may provide a more sustainable and healthier alternative for conventional meat. However, in Western societies, insect consumption is met with resistance due to negative attitudes based on fear and disgust. To further understand consumers' willingness to try insect meat, a 2 (meat type: bovine vs. insect) x 2 (product type: common vs. uncommon) experiment was conducted (n = 130). Four food choice factors were expected to mediate the effect of meat type and product type on willingness to try: health, sensory appeal, risk perception, and disgust. Results indicate that meat type had no effect on willingness to try. Relative to bovine meat, insect meat was perceived as both healthier and more disgusting, which could explain the absence of a meat type effect. Unexpectedly, use of insects in common products (burgers) as compared to uncommon products (skewers) was met with a lower willingness to try. Also, common products with insect meat was considered to be less healthy and more disgusting, compared to uncommon products with insect meat.

AB  - Background The home environment is an important facilitator of young child movement behaviors, including physical activity (PA), sleep, and screen-time. Household chaos, characterized by crowding, noise, and disorder in the home, may hinder efforts to obtain adequate amounts of movement behaviors. The COVID-19 outbreak impacted many families, and social distancing during this time may create conditions for more household chaos. Family routines can help establish order in the home and encourage an appropriate balance of movement behaviors, such as less screen-time and more sleep. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the association between household chaos and young child movement behaviors during the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States, and the role of family routines in this relationship. Methods A national online survey including 1836 mothers of preschoolers (3.0-5.9 years) was conducted during May 2020. Mothers reported demographic characteristics, household chaos, family routines, and the preschooler's movement behaviors during the outbreak. Mothers completed a household chaos questionnaire and were grouped into chaos categories (low, moderate/low, moderate/high, and high) for analysis. Linear regression was used to assess the association between chaos category, family routines, and movement behaviors with adjustment for covariates. Results Mothers were 35.9 +/- 4.1 years of age, middle income (47.8%), and preschoolers were 3.8 +/- 0.8 years of age. Most mothers reported their preschooler was less physically active (38.9%), slept the same amount of time (52.1%), and increased their screen-time (74.0%) after the COVID-19 outbreak. Preschoolers in the high chaos households performed less total PA (beta = - 0.36 days/week, 95% CI:-0.62 to - 0.09, p = 0.008), slept less (beta = - 0.42 h, 95% CI:-0.59 to - 0.25, p = 0.001) and had more screen-time (beta = 0.69 h, 95% CI:0.45 to 0.92, p = 0.001) compared to those in low chaos households. In most chaos categories, having a bed-time ritual was related to more child sleep, and mothers who viewed routines as "less/not important" reported more preschooler screen-time compared to mothers who viewed routines as "very important". Conclusion Promoting bed-time rituals and prioritizing routines, even somewhat, may be related to an improved balance of child movement behaviors. Innovative measures are needed to support families during periods of disruption such as that experienced in the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: There are increasing efforts for the integration of mental health services into primary care settings in low- and middle-income countries. However, commonly used approaches to train primary care providers (PCPs) may not achieve the expected outcomes for improved service delivery, as evidenced by low detection rates of mental illnesses after training. One contributor to this shortcoming is the stigma among PCPs. Implementation strategies for training PCPs that reduce stigma have the potential to improve the quality of services.
   Design: In Nepal, a type 3 hybrid implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized controlled trial will evaluate the implementation-as-usual training for PCPs compared to an alternative implementation strategy to train PCPs, entitled Reducing Stigma among Healthcare Providers (RESHAPE). In implementation-as-usual, PCPs are trained on the World Health Organization Mental Health Gap Action Program Intervention Guide (mhGAP-IG) with trainings conducted by mental health specialists. In RESHAPE, mhGAP-IG training includes the added component of facilitation by people with lived experience of mental illness (PWLE) and their caregivers using PhotoVoice, as well as aspirational figures. The duration of PCP training is the same in both arms. Co-primary outcomes of the study are stigma among PCPs, as measured with the Social Distance Scale at 6 months post-training, and reach, a domain from the RE-AIM implementation science framework. Reach is operationalized as the accuracy of detection of mental illness in primary care facilities and will be determined by psychiatrists at 3 months after PCPs diagnose the patients. Stigma will be evaluated as a mediator of reach. Cost-effectiveness and other RE-AIM outcomes will be assessed. Twenty-four municipalities, the unit of clustering, will be randomized to either mhGAP-IG implementation-as-usual or RESHAPE arms, with approximately 76 health facilities and 216 PCPs divided equally between arms. An estimated 1100 patients will be enrolled for the evaluation of accurate diagnosis of depression, generalized anxiety disorder, psychosis, or alcohol use disorder. Masking will include PCPs, patients, and psychiatrists.
   Discussion: This study will advance the knowledge of stigma reduction for training PCPs in partnership with PWLE. This collaborative approach to training has the potential to improve diagnostic competencies. If successful, this implementation strategy could be scaled up throughout low-resource settings to reduce the global treatment gap for mental illness.

AB  - The current study examines the following questions: (1) the extent to which individual basic human values are linked with attitudes towards immigration; (2) whether symbolic threat by immigration mediates this relation; and (3) whether cultural values moderate the relations between individual values, threat, and attitudes towards immigration. The empirical analysis relies on the 2014/2015 data from the immigration module of the European Social Survey (ESS) for West and East European countries. We find that universalistic individuals expressed lower threat due to immigration and higher support of immigration while conservative individuals displayed the opposite pattern. Symbolic threat mediated the association between values and immigration attitudes, but in most countries the mediation was partial. The associations between values, symbolic threat, and attitudes towards immigration were stronger in countries characterised by higher levels of intellectual and affective autonomy and weaker in countries characterised by higher levels of cultural embeddedness. The findings provide support for the centrality of human values in the formation of threat and attitudes towards immigration.

AB  - In the aftermath of the global banking crises, a political economy of permanent state austerity has emerged, driven by and legitimated through a hardening anti-welfare commonsense. We argue that, while there is an excellent evidence base emerging around solidifying negative public attitudes towards welfare, critical policy studies needs to attend to the cultural as well as the political economies through which an anti-welfare commonsense is formed and legitimated. We adopt a cultural political economy' approach to examine the cultural and political crafting of benefit brood' families within the wider public sphere, to examine the mechanisms through which anti-welfare sentiments are produced and mediated. Through a case study of Mick Philpott, we demonstrate how benefits broods' operate both as technologies of control (through which to manage precariat populations), but also as technologies of consent through which a wider and deeper anti-welfare commonsense is effected.

AB  - Unexpected but exceedingly consequential, the COVID-19 outbreak has undermined livelihoods, disrupted the economy, induced upheavals, and posed challenges to government decision-makers. Under various behavioural regulations, such as social distancing and transport limitations, social media has become the central platform on which people from all regions, regardless of local COVID-19 severity, share their feelings and exchange thoughts. Our study illustrates the evolution of moods expressed on social media regarding COVID-19-related issues and empirically confirms the hypothesis that the severity of the pandemic substantially correlates with these sentiments by analysing tweets on Sina Weibo (China's central social media platform). Methodologically, we leveraged Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pre-training, the most state-of-the-art natural language processing pre-trained sentiment-related multipurpose model, to label Sina Weibo tweets during the most distressed period in 2020. Given that the model itself does not provide a feature explanation, we utilize a random forest and linear probit model with the labelled sample to demonstrate how each word plays a role in the prediction. Finally, we demonstrate a strong negative linear relationship between the local severity of COVID-19 and the local sentiment response by incorporating miscellaneous geo-economic control variables. In short, our study reveals how pandemics affect local sentiment and, in a broader sense, provides an easy-to-implement and explanatory pipeline to classify sentiments and resolve related socioeconomic issues.

AB  - Studies that have engaged parasport broadcasting, particularly through a narrative lens, have almost exclusively relied on textual and/or content analysis of the Paralympic Games as the source of cultural critique. We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that have led to such representations. In this study - based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the United Kingdom's Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 - we provide the first detailed examination of mediated parasport from this vantage point. We explore the use of promotional devices such as athletes' backstories - the 'Hollywood treatment' - to both hook audiences and serve as a vehicle for achieving its social enterprise mandate to change public attitudes towards disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that coalesce around representing the Paralympics, with respect to the efforts made to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders and a stated desire to make the Paralympics both a commercial and socially progressive success.

AB  - Objectives To assess the impact of relaxing the state of alarm restrictions on SARS-CoV-2 infections at 14 days among people attending reopened nightclub venues. Design Matched cohort study with a paired control group (1:5 ratio). Setting Five small nightclubs with indoor areas and outdoor terraces, in a nightlife-restricted area in Sitges, Spain, on 20 May 2021. Wearing masks was mandatory, drinking was allowed and social distance was not required. Participants Volunteers were selected through a convenience sampling. To attend the event, participants were required to be older than 17 years, with a negative rapid antigen diagnostic test (Ag-RDT) on the same afternoon, without a positive reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) or Ag-RDT and/or symptoms associated with COVID-19 in the previous 7 days, to not having knowingly been in close contact with someone infected in the previous 10 days and to not have knowingly had close contact with someone with a suspicion of COVID-19 in the previous 48 hours. A control group was paired by exact age, gender, residence municipality, socioeconomic index, previous SARS-CoV-2-confirmed infection and vaccination status, in a 1:5 ratio, from the primary care electronic health records. Primary outcome Evidence of infection at electronic health records by SARS-CoV-2 at 14-day follow-up. Results Among the 391 participants (median age 37 years; 44% (n=173) women), no positive SARS-CoV-2 cases were detected at 14 days, resulting in a cumulative incidence estimation of 0 (95% CI 0 to 943) per 100 000 inhabitants. In the control group, two cases with RT-PCR test were identified, resulting in a cumulative incidence of 102.30 (12.4 to 369) per 100 000 inhabitants. Conclusions Nightlife attendance under controlled conditions and with a requirement for a negative Ag-RDT was not associated with increased transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in a pandemic context of low infection rates. In such circumstances, secure opening of the nightlife sector was possible, under reduced capacity and controlled access by Ag-RDT, and environments where compliance with sanitary measures are maintainable.

AB  - Objectives: In late December 2019, a group of cases with 2019 Novel Coronavirus pneumonia (SARS-COV-2) in Wuhan, China, raised worldwide concern. This novel virus is turning into a global nightmare and a serious health problem. Even though an accurate estimate of the case-fatality risk is difficult; this research is useful to mitigate the spatial pattern of COVID-19. In this study, we aim to assess the impacts of covariates (age, sex, blood type, and disease severity, patients' previous health history, transmission type, and location) on the spatial distribution of COVID-19.
   Methods: Relevant data were obtained from the World Health Organization released by March 18, 2020 and some other information from published studies were taken into consideration. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-test, Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) and Multivariate Analysis of Covariance (MANCOVA) through STATA packages.
   Results: The spatial pattern of COVID-19 is varying with more than a half-million confirmed cases and thousands of deaths worldwide.. The result of the study has also shown that the spatial pattern of COVID-19 is fluctuating and reflected the large confirmed cases and deaths of the Republic of China, Italy, USA and Iran. There is also evidence that age and population density variation has a statistically significant association with deaths due to COVID-19 (Fcal=133.909 and P-value= 0.000*). The result also highlighted a statistically significant difference between male and female patients affected by COVID-19. The infection fatality rate in 0-9 years is almost nonexistent; whereas for patients over the age of 50 it is relatively suffering.. There is also statistical evidence of the outbreak of the epidemic that in Europe, America and the Western Pacific Region the local transmission is predominant, while in Africa and in other regional areas most cases are fugitive. Despite some variation in initial symptoms, most COVID-19 patients have a fever and respiratory symptoms. Social distancing and special care are recommended for elderly people and patients with smoking habits, diabetes, and cancer. The state and private media should try to raise awareness about the transmission of the disease. Healthcare providers should follow up with subsequent reports on time as the situation is likely to change.

AB  - Background: It is expected that COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China by the end of 2020. Vaccinating children against COVID-19 would contribute to the control of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. For children under the age of 18 years, parents are usually the decision makers regarding their children's vaccination.
   Objective: The goal of this study was to investigate parental acceptability of free COVID-19 vaccination for children under the age of 18 years in China.
   Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional, closed online survey among 2053 factory workers in Shenzhen, China, implemented from September 1 to 7, 2020. Participants of the online survey were full-time employees aged 18 years or over who had resumed work in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive physical examinations once a year. Eligible workers attending six designated physical examination sites were invited to complete an online survey. This study was based on a subsample of those who had at least one child under the age of 18 years (N=1052). After being briefed that COVID-19 vaccines developed by China are likely to be available by the end of 2020, participants were asked about their likelihood of having their children under the age of 18 years take up free COVID-19 vaccination provided by the government, if it existed. Multivariate logistic regression models were fitted to examine the associations of perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB) and exposure to information related to COVID-19 through social media with parental acceptability, after controlling for significant background characteristics.
   Results: The prevalence of parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children was 72.6% (764/1052). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.70, 95% CI 1.50-1.91), the perception that a family member would support them in having their children take up COVID-19 vaccination (ie, perceived subjective norm) (AOR 4.18, 95% CI 3.21-5.43), and perceived behavioral control to have the children take up COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.84, 95% CI 1.49-2.26) were associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination. Regarding social media influence, higher exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with higher parental acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.35, 95% CI 1.17-1.56). Higher exposure to negative information related to COVID-19 vaccination was negatively associated with the dependent variable (AOR 0.85, 95% CI 0.74-0.99).
   Conclusions: Parents' acceptability of COVID-19 vaccination for their children under 18 years of age was high in China The TPB is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination targeting parents. Transparency in communicating about the vaccine development process and vaccine safety testing is important. Public health authorities should also address misinformation in a timely manner.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines will become available in China soon. Understanding communities' responses to the forthcoming COVID-19 vaccines is important. We applied the theory of planned behavior as the theoretical framework.
   Objective: This study investigates the prevalence of and factors associated with behavioral intention to receive self-financed or free COVID-19 vaccinations among Chinese factory workers who resumed work during the pandemic. We examined the effects of factors including sociodemographics, perceptions related to COVID-19 vaccination, exposure to information about COVID-19 vaccination through social media, and COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by individuals and factories.
   Methods: Participants were full-time employees 18 years or older who worked in factories in Shenzhen. Factory workers in Shenzhen are required to receive a physical examination annually Eligible workers attending six physical examination sites were invited to complete a survey on September 1-7, 2020. Out of 2653 eligible factory workers, 2053 (77.4%) completed the online survey. Multivariate two-level logistic regression models and ordinal logistic regression models were fitted.
   Results: The prevalence of behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination was 66.6% (n=1368, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate) and 80.6% (n=1655, conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and free vaccines). After adjusting for significant background characteristics, positive attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.20, 95% CI 1.15-1.25 and AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.19-1.30), perceived support from significant others for getting a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.43, 95% CI 1.32-1.55 and AOR 1.37, 95% CI 1.25-1.50), and perceived behavioral control to get a COVID-19 vaccination (AOR 1.51, 95% CI 1.32-1.73 and AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.09-1.51) were positively associated with both dependent variables (conditional on 80% vaccine efficacy and market rate or free vaccines, respectively). Regarding social media influence, higher frequency of exposure to positive information related to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with a higher intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination at market rate (AOR 1.53, 95% CI 1.39-1.70) or a free vaccination (AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.35-1.71). Higher self-reported compliance with wearing a face mask in the workplace (AOR 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.58 and AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.24-2.27) and other public spaces (AOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.42-2.29 and AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.77), hand hygiene (AOR 1.21, 95% CI 1.00-1.47 and AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.19-1.93), and avoiding social gatherings (AOR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.47 and AOR 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.95) and crowded places (AOR 1.24, 95% CI 1.02-1.51 and AOR 1.73, 95% CI 1.37-2.18) were also positively associated with both dependent variables. The number of COVID-19 preventive measures implemented by the factory was positively associated with the intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination under both scenarios (AOR 1.08, 95% CI 1.04-1.12 and AOR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01-1.11).
   Conclusions: Factory workers in China reported a high behavioral intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccination. The theory of planned behavior is a useful framework to guide the development of future campaigns promoting COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to assess the level of knowledge, attitudes and practices adopted among University of Sharjah (UOS) students toward sustainability efforts done by their university.
   Design/methodology/approach
   An online survey was emailed to students with the assistance of the UOS Sustainability Office. The survey consisted of four sections assessing knowledge, attitudes, practices and preferred media to obtain sustainability information. A total of 200 responses from male and female students, representing 4 levels of study in sciences and humanities colleges, were received. Research data is analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics (version 26). For assessing knowledge, eight items were developed to measure if the student knew about the university's projects and activities in the field of sustainability. For assessing attitudes, six items were developed to indicate the level of agreement or disagreement toward main sustainability issues. For assessing practices, ten items were developed to measure the frequency of acting in a sustainable manner.
   Findings
   Survey results showed an advanced level of basic knowledge among university students regarding the programs and activities conducted by UOS, and a positive attitude toward these efforts and toward the importance of supporting sustainable practices. Most of the participating students disagreed with limiting the use of cars on campus - this may be because of a cultural aspect among young people in the Emirati society, who consider driving cars as an essential part of their daily life. Most students also indicated that they care about the behavior that supports sustainability in the university environment, such as rationalizing water consumption and using environment friendly products.
   Research limitations/implications
   The study's limitations are that it was applied to one university - UOS. The sample of the online survey was only 200 students from undergraduate students. Different universities may have their own sets of different environmental approaches, and because of this reason, university students may exhibit different levels of knowledge, attitude and practice toward sustainability in contrast to the findings from this study.
   Practical implications
   Findings from this research can give decision-makers a good picture of the university's performance in accomplishing sustainability. The authors recommend that UOS sustainability communication programs should be more comprehensive, and not only limited to protecting the environment that some students perceive as the primary aspect of sustainability. These efforts must address all economic and social aspects emphasized by the United Arab Emirates 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
   Originality/value
   To the best of the authors' knowledge, the current study is considered one of the first studies addressing sustainability efforts in Emirati universities and seeking to assess the level of student knowledge, attitudes and practices toward sustainability issues in the country. The study is crucial in providing better insights such as the level of knowledge, attitude and practices toward UOS sustainability performance. As found in this study, even with sufficient knowledge, students still lack the drive to convert them into actions. So, future research could investigate deeper into the barriers of converting sustainable knowledge and attitudes into practices. The results represent an added value to the research literature concerned with sustainability issues in the Arab world and the Middle East region.
   This paper will also contribute to the sustainability literature that will be benefited by other various organizations.

AB  - Building on and extending prior research demonstrating the role of both quality and quantity of intergroup contact in reducing negative attitudes toward outgroup members (Allport, 1954; Pettigrew & Tropp, 2006), the present study takes the novel approach of applying both contact theory and Intergroup Emotions Theory (lFT; Mackie & Smith, 2002) to the study of prejudice reduction as a function of intergroup contact. We examined the mediating role of both intergroup emotions and trust in predicting both positive and negative behavioral tendencies toward the outgroup. In a study of intergroup contact between Catholics and Protestant students in Northern Ireland, outgroup contact (measured by the product of quality and quantity of contact) was directly associated with outgroup trust, outgroup emotions (increases in positive emotion and decreases in negative emotions), and outgroup behavioral tendencies (increases in positive behavioral tendencies and decreases in negative behavioral tendencies). Additionally, the relationship between contact and outgroup behavioral tendencies was mediated by general outgroup trust as well as by positive and negative outgroup emotions.

AB  - LGBTQ politicians play an important role in advancing LGBTQ interests in government and in educating their fellow lawmakers about LGBTQ issues. But their under-representation in legislatures limits their opportunities to influence public policy. Historically negative attitudes toward sexual minorities suggest that public scrutiny could be an important barrier to candidacy for LGBTQ individuals. This study explores perceptions of public scrutiny and the forms in which they expect it to take for LGBTQ candidates. Interviews with 101 Canadians from diverse backgrounds reveal that some LGBTQ individuals forgo a career in politics to avoid the moral regulation of non-traditional lifestyles and identities that often underlies public scrutiny of politicians. While LGBTQ individuals share other study participants' concerns regarding the loss of privacy and political criticism, they also expect their sexuality and physical appearance to come under particular scrutiny. LGBTQ candidate experiences on the campaign trail provide support for their expectations, revealing the ways in which politicians are regulated to ensure they conform to the white heterosexist norms of politics.

AB  - Contemporary views regarding masculinity have focused on the ways in which socialized masculine ideologies influence, particularly negatively, the physical and psychological lives of men. Although sport has been conceptualized as an environment in which hypermasculine ideologies (e.g., emphasis on competition and indifference to physical pain) are learned and reinforced, few studies have quantitatively explored how. or if, masculine norms and gender roles differ between athletes and nonathletes and may be related to psychological distress and help-seeking. Male collegiate athletes (n = 220) and nonathletes (n = 203) completed a series of questionnaires to assess their level of conformity to masculine norms and gender role conflicts, depression, substance use, self-stigma, and attitudes and intentions to seek help. Through a series of multivariate and mediational analyses, we found that (a) athletes reported significantly higher levels of masculine norms (e.g., heterosexual self-presentation) and role conflicts than nonathletes; (b) gender role conflicts, such as between work and family, significantly predicted depressive symptomatology, whereas masculine norms, such as risk-taking, were related to greater alcohol use; and (c) across both groups of men, self-stigma partially mediated the relationship of conformity to masculine norms to negative attitudes about, and intentions to seek, psychological help. Although athletes more strongly identified with certain masculine norms, in both groups of men, overall conformity to masculine norms, but not gender role conflict, predicted more negative attitudes about seeking help, both directly and through increases in self-stigma.

AB  - The deficit syndrome was proposed over 20 years ago as a separate negative symptom syndrome within schizophrenia with a distinct neurobiological pathophysiology and etiology. Recent research, however, has indicated that psychological factors such as negative attitudes and expectancies are significantly associated with the broad spectrum of negative symptoms. Specifically, defeatist beliefs regarding performance mediate between neurocognitive impairment and both negative symptoms and functional outcome. Additionally, asocial beliefs predict asocial behavior and negative expectancies regarding future pleasure are associated with negative symptoms. The present study explored whether these dysfunctional beliefs and negative expectancies might also be a feature of the deficit syndrome. Based on a validated proxy method, 22 deficit and 72 nondeficit patients (from a pool of 139 negative symptom patients) were identified and received a battery of symptom, neurocognitive, and psychological measures. The deficit group scored significantly worse on measures of negative symptoms, insight, emotion recognition, defeatist attitudes, and asocial beliefs but better on measures of depression, anxiety, and distress than the nondeficit group. Moreover, the deficit group showed a trend for higher scores on self-esteem. Based on these findings, we propose a more comprehensive formulation of deficit schizophrenia, characterized by neurobiological factors and a cluster of psychological attributes that lead to withdrawal and protect the self-esteem. Although the patients have apparently opted-out of participation in normal activities, we suggest that a psychological intervention that targets these negative attitudes might improve their functioning and quality of life.

AB  - Purpose: The Public Opinion Survey of Human Attributes-Stuttering (POSHA-S) was developed to make available worldwide a standard measure of public attitudes toward stuttering that is practical, reliable, valid, and translatable. Mean data from past field studies as comparisons for interpretation of POSHA-S results are reported.
   Method: Means for POSHA-S items (converted to -100 to +100 scales), components comprising clusters of items, subscores comprising clusters of components, and Overall Stuttering Scores comprising two subscores for stuttering were generated from 64 samples, totaling 2876 respondents who completed experimental versions of the POSHA-S.
   Discussion: Lowest, highest, and median sample values, which vary with the addition of new sample data to the growing POSHA-S database archive, provide points of comparison for any potential sample rather than predetermined values.
   Conclusions: The final POSHA-S, together with an ongoing and growing archive, can provide increasingly meaningful comparisons for stakeholders measuring public attitudes toward stuttering. Educational objectives: (1) Describe the subscores and components of the POSHA-S, (2) describe the Overall Stuttering Score of the POSHA-S, and (3) describe the format for interpretation of the POSHA-S.

AB  - Competitive hypothesis testing may explain differences in predictive power across multiple health behavior theories.
   We tested competing hypotheses of the Health Belief Model (HBM) and Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) to quantify pathways linking subjective norm, benefits, barriers, intention, and mammography behavior.
   We analyzed longitudinal surveys of women veterans randomized to the control group of a mammography intervention trial (n = 704). We compared direct, partial mediation, and full mediation models with Satorra-Bentler chi (2) difference testing.
   Barriers had a direct and indirect negative effect on mammography behavior; intention only partially mediated barriers. Benefits had little to no effect on behavior and intention; however, it was negatively correlated with barriers. Subjective norm directly affected behavior and indirectly affected intention through barriers.
   Our results provide empiric support for different assertions of HBM and TRA. Future interventions should test whether building subjective norm and reducing negative attitudes increases regular mammography.

AB  - Background Bedside teaching (BST) facilitates medical education and has reduced in practice, often due to patient-related concerns. This study aimed to validate a questionnaire exploring patients attitudes towards BST. Methods International guidelines for questionnaire development were followed. Seven steps were included: literature review, patient interviews, development of clear and understandable items, expert validation, cognitive interviewing and pilot testing. Statistical analyses included exploratory factor analysis, internal consistency, investigation of demographic influences and discriminant validity across subscales. Results Following the literature review, 32 interviews were conducted. Potential items were developed, reviewed and adapted. Experts in medical education and statistics reviewed the draft questionnaire. Fifteen patients consented to cognitive testing and 401 consenting patients completed the final version. The median age of participants was 35 years of age (range: 18 to 70 years). Participants included women attending for antenatal (40%), postnatal (32%) and gynaecology issues (28%). Just under one third (29%) had taken part in medical student teaching previously. Statistical analyses found a two-factor solution, consisting of Educate medical professionals and Conditions for participation subscales with good internal consistency; responses did not vary by age or education. Participants who had opted-in for teaching in the ward and bedside endorsed higher levels of Educate medical professionals, suggesting discriminant validity. A majority of patients (> 92%) reported that they were happy to be involved in BST. Patients believed that they should not be asked to participate in BST should they feel stressed or unwell (68.2%). Conclusion This study shows extensive patient support for BST, independent of age or education. The desire to educate is a strong motivating factor. This strong support by patients for BST is an area that medical schools and universities can potentially develop. Future versions of this questionnaire may include virtual bedside teaching, in the context of social distancing.

AB  - Purpose: Evaluate changes in early adolescent substance use during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic using a prospective, longitudinal, nationwide cohort. Methods: Participants were enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. A total of 7,842 youth (mean age = 12.4 years, range = 10.5-14.6) at 21 study sites across the U.S. completed a three-wave assessment of substance use between May and August 2020. Youth reported whether they had used alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or other substances in the past 30 days. Data were linked to prepandemic surveys that the same youth had completed in the years 2018-2020, before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Results: Past-30-day substance use remained stable in the 6 months since stay-at-home orders were first issued in U.S. states/counties; was primarily episodic (1-2 days in the past month); and was typically limited to a single substance. Using pretest/posttest and age-period designs, we found that compared to before the pandemic, fewer youth were using alcohol and more youth were using nicotine or misusing prescription drugs. During the pandemic, youth were more likely to use substances when they were more stressed by pandemic-related uncertainty; their family experienced material hardship; their parents used alcohol or drugs; or they experienced greater depression or anxiety. Neither engagement in social distancing nor worry about COVID-19 infection was associated with substance use. Several risk factors were stronger among older (vs. younger) adolescents. Conclusions: Among youth in early adolescence, advent of the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with decreased use of alcohol and increased use of nicotine and misuse of prescription drugs.

AB  - BackgroundPresymptomatic COVID-19 patients have been identified as a major stumbling block in efforts to break the chain of transmission. Studies on temporal dynamics of its shedding suggests it peaks 1-2days prior to any symptom onset. Therefore, a large proportion of patients are actively spreading the disease unknowingly whilst undetected. However, lengthy lockdowns and isolation leads to a host of socioeconomic issues and are impractical. Conversely, there exists no study describing this group and their clinical significance despite their key role in disease transmission.MethodsAs a result, we devised a retrospective study to look at the prevalence of presymptomatic patients with COVID-19 from data sourced via our medical records office. Subsequently, we identify early indicators of infection through demographic information, biochemical and radiological abnormalities which would allow early diagnosis and isolation. In addition, we will look into the clinical significance of this group and their outcome; if it differs from asymptomatic or symptomatic patients. Descriptive statistics were used in addition to tabulating the variables and corresponding values for reference. Variables are compared between the presymptomatic group and others via Chi-square testing and Fisher's exact test, accepting a p value of <0.05 as significant.ResultsOur analysis shows a higher proportion of presymptomatic patients with atypical symptoms like chest pain while symptomatic patients commonly present with respiratory symptoms like cough and shortness of breath. Besides that, there were more females presenting as presymptomatic patients compared to males (p=0.019) and these group of patients were likely to receive treatment (p<0.001). Otherwise, we were not able to identify other statistically significant markers suggesting a patient is presymptomatic.ConclusionAs we have little means of identifying these silent spreaders, it highlights further the importance of general measures implemented to stop COVID-19 transmission like social distancing, face mask, and widespread testing.

AB  - When conceiving diversity training-a popular strategy to manage prejudice within organizations and educational settings-there is little reliance on social-psychological theorizing and a lack of research on training effectiveness. In line with the ingroup projection model (Mummendey & Wenzel, 1999), we postulate diversity training to improve intergroup attitudes by increasing perceived superordinate-group diversity. We tested this in two experiments with control-group designs and repeated measurement. In Experiment 1 (N = 62), a 2-hour diversity intervention (covered as get-to-know activities) increased perceived diversity of the superordinate group students and improved feelings towards the gender-outgroup. In Experiment 2 (N = 51), a 1-day diversity training increased perceived diversity of the superordinate groups adults and Germans and improved subgroup attitudes regarding gender, age, and nationality. Moreover, the training had positive long-term effects and reductions of ambivalent sexism were mediated by increased perceived diversity of the respective superordinate group adults. Our findings demonstrate that the ingroup-projection model provides a suitable theoretical foundation for real-world anti-prejudice interventions such as diversity training. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Children use electronic screens at ever younger ages, but there is still little empirical research on how and why parents mediate this media use. In line with Vygotsky's zone of proximal development, we explored whether children's media skills and media activities, next to parents' attitudes about media for children, and several child and parent-family characteristics, predicted parental mediation practices. Furthermore, we investigated children's use and ownership of electronic screens in the bedroom in relationship to the child's media skills. Data from an online survey among 896 Dutch parents with young children (0-7 years) showed that children's use and ownership of TV, game consoles, computers and touchscreens, primarily depended on their media skills and age, not on parent's attitudes about media for children. Only touchscreens were used more often by children, when parents perceived media as helpful in providing moments of rest for the child. In line with former studies, parents consistently applied co-use, supervision, active mediation, restrictive mediation, and monitoring, depending on positive and negative attitudes about media. The child's media skills and media activities, however, had stronger relationships with parental mediation styles, whereas age was not related. Canonical discriminant analysis, finally, captured how the five mediation strategies varied among infants, toddlers, pre-schoolers, and early childhood children, predominantly as a result of children's media skills, and media activities, i.e., playing educational games and passive entertainment use.

AB  - Purpose
   Knowledge-intensive business services (KIBS) firms focus on applying their expert knowledge to help solve the business problems of their clients: these clients confronted major new problems due to the COVID-19 pandemic and policy measures such as social distancing and travel restrictions, designed to reduce the rapid spread of the illness. Many KIBS were reliant upon extensive contact with clients, and within teams working on projects; they found their practices disrupted. This study aims to examine how KIBS are evolving to cope with both the sets of changes: those in their own operations, and those involving the emerging business problems of clients.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The main data sources are material contained in websites of a sample of leading firms in a range of KIBS sectors, and in media reports and other documentation of efforts to confront the pandemic.
   Findings
   The results indicate considerable efforts in KIBS to address emerging client problems, as well as to adapt their own practices. Their substantial role in confronting the pandemic and associated business difficulties has implications for future crises. KIBS are likely to be important players in shaping responses not only to future pandemics but also to the looming climate crisis.
   Originality/value
   The study demonstrates the growing role of KIBS and their "second knowledge infrastructure" in modern economies, exemplified by their role in the context of an emerging crisis.

AB  - In recent years in our increasingly globalized world in many countries we have seen the rise of anti-immigrant feelings among the youth. This has resulted in both discrimination against immigrants and negative psychological outcomes which harm both the individual and hinder social integration within society. In this article, we highlight how psychological research can play an important role in informing the design and conduct of educational interventions based on intergroup contact theory that are aimed at reducing prejudice toward immigrants. We review recent research showing anti-immigrant attitudes among the youth across the globe, and how these attitudes are related to parental and peer relationships. Research indicates that a color-blind approach to prejudice reduction among youth is not helpful and, in contrast, it suggests a more effective approach could be a multicultural approach to diversity, which celebrates both group differences and similarities while promoting social integration through quality contact between different social groups. Recent psychological research shows that this contact can take many forms, ranging from direct contact (i.e., cross-ethnic friendships), to extended contact (i.e., reading a book in which someone from your group has a positive interaction with someone from another group) and even imagined contact (i.e., engaging in imagined play involving characters from different groups having positive relations). The findings of this research demonstrate that it is possible to challenge anti-immigrant attitudes when and where they develop in young people.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 is one of the biggest challenges which are being faced by mankind. Researchers are continuously trying to discover a vaccine or medicine for this highly infectious disease but, proper success is not achieved to date. Many countries are suffering from this disease and trying to find some solution that can prevent the dramatic spread of this virus. Although the mortality rate is not very high, the highly infectious nature of this virus makes it a global threat. RT-PCR test is the only means to confirm the presence of this virus to date. Only precautionary measures like early screening, frequent hand wash, social distancing use of masks, and other protective equipment can prevent us from this virus. Some researches show that the radiological images can be quite helpful for the early screening purpose because some features of the radiological images indicate the presence of the COVID-19 virus and therefore, it can serve as an effective screening tool. Automated analysis of these radiological images can help the physicians and other domain experts to study and screen the suspected patients easily and reliably within the stipulated amount of time. This method may not replace the traditional RT-PCR method for detection but, it can be helpful to filter the suspected patients from the rest of the community that can effectively reduce the spread in the of this virus. A novel method is proposed in this work to segment the radiological images for the better explication of the COVID-19 radiological images. The proposed method will be known as SuFMoFPA (Superpixel based Fuzzy Modified Flower Pollination Algorithm). The type 2 fuzzy clustering system is blended with this proposed approach to get the better-segmented outcome. Obtained results are quite promising and outperforming some of the standard approaches which are encouraging for the practical uses of the proposed approach to screening the COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is unprecedented as it reached all countries in the world within a record short period of time. Even though COVID-19 infection may be just severe in any adults, older adults (65-year-old or older) may experience a higher mortality rate. Among those affected, cancer patients may have a worse outcome compared to the general population because of their depressed immune status. As the health resources of most countries are limited, clinicians may face painful decisions about which patients to save if they require artificial ventilation. Cancer patients, especially the older ones, may be denied supportive care because of their shorter life expectancy. Thus, special considerations should be taken to prevent infection of older cancer patients and to provide them with adequate social support during their cancer treatment. The following proposal was reached: (1) Education of health care providers about the special needs of older cancer patients and their risks of infection. (2) Special consideration such as surgical masks and separate scheduling should be made to protect them from being infected. (3) Social services such as patient navigators should be provided to ensure adequate medical supply, food, and daily transportation to cancer centers. (4) Close monitoring through phone calls, telecommunication to ensure social distancing and psychological support from patient family to prevent anxiety and depression. (5) Shorter course of radiotherapy by use of hypofractionation where possible to decrease the needs for daily transportation and exposure to infection. (6) Enrollment of older cancer patients in clinical trials for potential antiviral medications if infection does occur. (7) Home health care telemedicine may be an effective strategy for older cancer patients with COVID-19 infection to avoid hospital admission when health care resources become restricted. (8) For selected patients, immunotherapy and targeted therapy may become the systemic therapy of choice for older cancer patients and need to be tested in clinical trials.

AB  - Negative attitudes and explicit racism against Muslims are increasingly visible in public discourse throughout Europe. Right-wing populist parties have strengthened their positions by focusing on the 'Islamic threat' to the West. Concurrently, the Internet has facilitated a space where racist attitudes towards Muslims are easily disseminated into the public debate, fuelling animosity against European Muslims. This paper explores part of the online Islamophobic network and scrutinizes the discursive strategies deployed by three 'prominent' online actors. By combining social network analysis and critical discourse analysis, the study shows that Islamophobic web pages constitute a dynamic network with ties to different political and geographical milieus. They create a seemingly mainstream political position by framing racist standpoints as a defence of Western values and freedom of speech. The study also shows that Islamophobic discourse is strengthened by xenophobic currents within mass media, and by the legitimization of intellectuals and political actors.

AB  - Location-based social media data can offer useful insights on the spatial and temporal dynamics of public attitudes. In this study, we aim to investigate the gendered attitudes toward transit services in China, utilizing the case of Shenzhen. We collected 44,257 Weibo microblogs, a major source of social media data in China, and applied a series of text mining and visualization techniques to examine the gender differences among our focused themes. The microblogs reveal a distinct gender gap in terms of quantity, as nearly 74% are posted by women. While women tend to be more concerned about the comfort of transit environment (e.g., temperature, crowdedness, and safety, especially at night), men tend to be more interested in transit systems' e-payment services and reporting traffic incidents. Overall, this study presents a methodological framework and empirical case study about how we can utilize certain social media mining techniques to investigate gendered, subjective travel experiences, providing researchers and practitioners with an innovative way to gather customer service feedback and build more inclusive service systems.

KW  - Virtual teleconferencing
AB  - BACKGROUND: The coronavirus identified in 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic effectively ended all major spine educational conferences in the first half of 2020. In response, the authors formed a "virtual" case-based conference series directed at delivering spine education to health care providers around the world. We herein share the technical logistics, early participant feedback, and future direction of this initiative.
   METHODS: The Virtual Global Spine Conference (VGSC) was created in April 2020 by a multiinstitutional team of spinal neurosurgeons and a neuroradiologist. Biweekly virtual meetings were established wherein invited national and international spine care providers would deliver case-based presentations on spine and spine surgery-related conditions via teleconferencing. Promotion was coordinated through social media platforms such as Twitter.
   RESULTS: VGSC recruited more than 1000 surgeons, trainees, and other specialists, with 50-100 new registrants per week thereafter. An early survey to the participants, with 168 responders, indicated that 92% viewed the content as highly valuable to their practice and 94% would continue participating post COVID-19. Participants from the United States (29%), Middle East (16%), and Europe (12%) comprised the majority of the audience. Approximately 52% were neurosurgeons, 18% orthopedic surgeons, and 6% neuroradiologists. A majority of participants were physicians (55%) and residents/fellows (21 degrees k).
   CONCLUSIONS: The early success of the VGSC reflects a strong interest in spine education despite the COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing guidelines. There is widespread opinion, backed by our own survey results, that many clinicians and trainees want to see "virtual" education continue post COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Since December 29, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has been spreading and is associated with notoriously increased morbidity and mortality of populations worldwide, including Ethiopia. Medicine and the healthcare system have been challenged by both first and second-waves of SARS-CoV-2. During this entire crisis, the main purpose of this study was to determine the current evidence on the level of awareness and prevention practice of healthcare workers (HCWs) at the district primary hospital, Delghi Primary Hospital (DPH) regarding COVID-19 in the overall effort to control the spread of the virus.
   Methods: Institutional-based descriptive cross-sectional analysis was performed between late August and September 20, 2020. Participants of the study were HCWs with various occupations at DPH, North West Gondar, Ethiopia. In this study, among 112 health professions, we included a total of 104 HCWs. Written consent was obtained for willingness of the study participants from the DPH administrative office. Then, using a pre-tested, structured, and self-administered questionnaire, data were collected. The questionnaire included socio-demographics, sources of information, knowledge, and practice measures regarding COVID-19. The collected data were analyzed through IBM SPSS version 20. As a cut-off value, >= 8 out of 15 knowledge questions and >= 7 out of 14 practice questions were considered good knowledge and practice, respectively.
   Results: The result of this study showed the majority of the respondents were male (71/104, (68.3%)), with a median age of 28 (minimum age 20 and maximum age 50) years. Thus, 94.2% (n=98/104) was the overall rate of correctly answered questions out of 15 knowledge questions. However, 40.6% of them had poor prevention practices. 73.1% of participants used regular hand-washing with soap and 64.4% used hand sanitizer and handshake avoidance equally for prevention purposes. Whereas, social distancing rule and mask-wearing were reported as impracticable by 55.8% and 44.2%, respectively.
   Conclusion: 94.2% of HCWs had a good level of knowledge about COVID-19; in contrast, lack of preventive practice was observed. This implies that there is a gap between knowledge and implementation of preventive measures toward the disease.

AB  - Efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 within the United States have been compromised by varying levels of engagement in preventive behaviors, such as mask wearing, social distancing and vaccine uptake. The purpose of this study was to evaluate potential predictors of both (1) engagement in behaviors aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and (2) intention to get vaccinated against COVID-19. It was hypothesized that Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs would predict each outcome. Additionally, given the politicization of the pandemic in the US, HBM constructs were considered as possible mediators of a relationship between political party affiliation and each outcome. A total of 205 participants completed an online survey, and data from 186 were analyzed using linear and ordinal regressions. Findings indicate that greater perceived response efficacy predicted greater engagement in preventive behaviors and intention to get vaccinated. Other HBM constructs were not significant predictors of either outcome. Mediation analyses indicated that affiliation with the Republican Party predicted reduced engagement in preventive health behaviors and vaccination intention, although effects were fully and partially mediated by lower levels of response efficacy. Understanding the predictors of adherence to recommended strategies is essential to developing effective public health campaigns that address risk factors for non-adherence and target those least likely to adhere. Public health interventions aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in the US should emphasize the efficacy of preventive behaviors and encourage public trust in the safety and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccines, particularly among Republicans.

AB  - In the context of new modernity, intimacy, theorized in terms of families as the embodied practices which mediate relationships between parents and children across the life course, has been reconceptualized. As part of wider transformations in social relations wrought by the ideological extension of neoliberalism into the realm of social and affective relationships, the language and logic of the market in terms of the importance of individual autonomy and choice have infiltrated family practices, shifting many of the responsibilities and risks for maximizing the life chances of children from governments to families. This principle of parental responsibility for children's present and future well-being means that anxiety about doing the 'right thing' is at the centre of contemporary experiences of intimate family relationships. Yet how such attitudes are translated into everyday practices of knowing, loving, and caring for each other by parents and children within the affective space of the home has been relatively underrepresented in geographers' thinking about families. Drawing on a survey of 2089 parents/carers and case-study research with ten families with children aged 5-12 years old, the paper begins with an exploraiton of parents' perceptions of when, how, and where children ought to be introduced to alcohol (extrafamilial norms). It then focuses on lived realities by examining what practices parents model to their children through everyday family life. The conclusion reflects on how the social distance between adults and children is being reduced and the implications of the contemporary realities of everyday familial intimacy for wider processes of demoralization.

AB  - In recent years, western media coverage is frequently filled with issues relating to Islam, which are unfavorable to Muslims. The attitudinal consequences of such media messages are widely discussed; however, empirical research is scarce. This study uses large-scale panel data on adolescents in combination with newspaper data and takes advantage of an extensive fieldwork period during which media salience of Muslims has fluctuated. All unmeasured time-invariant characteristics are accounted for by adopting a fixed-effects panel design. The results provide evidence of immediate attitudinal responses to media salience: the more media salience of Muslims on the day of survey participation, the more negative adolescents feel about Muslims. However, the results do not point toward a secondary transfer effect because media-induced negative attitudes toward Muslims were not transferred to ethnic minorities. Findings of this study advance current research by providing evidence for the effect of daily variations in media salience on attitudes.

AB  - Objectives Concept mapping is used to promote critical thinking and meaningful learning in health professions education. This study aimed to evaluate dental undergraduates' perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for oral radiographic interpretation competency. Methods A total of 39 third-year undergraduates at a dental college participated in the oral radiological interpretation session. The students received 1 hour of instruction before creating their concept map (CM). Participants were provided an assignment of four relevant clinical cases to draw an individualised CM. The students' draft and final CM were submitted. The instructor evaluated the CMs to identify whether students could analyse, connect and organise the information in a meaningful way. Among them, 37 completed the questionnaire about their experiences and responses to concept mapping. Results Students perceived concept mapping positively. The instructor's feedback helped them recognise their misconceptions and fostered greater motivation to learn. Students attempted to integrate basic biomedical knowledge and clinical features through cross-linking. However, they also expressed negative attitudes toward concept mapping regarding time consumption and heavy burden. Conclusions Concept mapping motivated students' directed learning and gave them the opportunity to recognise their misconceptions. This study suggests the potential use of CMs as an adjunctive learning strategy in the oral radiographic interpretation class.

AB  - BACKGROUND: COVID-19 was declared an emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization in 2020. This study assesses patients' awareness, perception, and mitigating measures taken during the COVID-19 outbreak visiting an apex tertiary health-care center in North India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between September 15, 2020, and November 15, 2020, in a tertiary care public hospital, North India, using a structured self-administered questionnaire. The survey included 809 patients using a consecutive sampling strategy. The self-structured and prevalidated questionnaire was used to collect information on study variables. Chi-square test and independent samples t-test, followed by binary and multivariate logistic regression, was used to determine the factors associated with awareness toward COVID-19. RESULTS: The mean age of participants was 32.41 (+/- 11.24) years. Multivariate logistic regression shows that married participants (OR: 0.660, 95 % CI: 0.440-0.989, P= 0.044), reading books/magazine or attended institutional lectures (OR: 2.241, 95% CI: 1.545-3.249, P = 0.001), and watching television and radio (OR: 1.824, 95% CI: 1.283-2.592, P = 0.001) are significantly more aware than their counterparts. Participants with higher income group (>20,000 Indian rupee) significantly had higher awareness than participants having salary <10,000 rupees (OR: 0.280, 95% CI: 0.178-0.440, P = 0.001) or 10,001-20,000 rupees (OR: 0.481, 95% CI: 0.297-0.777, P = 0.003). Patients avoiding traveling across or abroad had significantly much reasonably good awareness than their counterparts (OR: 0.357, 95% CI: 0.139-0.918, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: Participants demonstrated good awareness, encouraging perception, and complied with appropriate mitigating measures during the outbreak. Considering frequent waves and the pandemic's long duration, consistent reinforcement of government measures, including masks, maintaining social distance, and frequent handwashing, is much needed.

LA  - English
AB  - Sentiment analysis-the automated extraction of expressions of positive or negative attitudes from text-has received considerable attention from researchers during the past 10 years. During the same period, the widespread growth of social media has resulted in an explosion of publicly available, user-generated text on the World Wide Web. These data can potentially be utilized to provide real-time insights into the aggregated sentiments of people. The tools provided by statistical natural language processing and machine learning, along with exciting new scalable approaches to working with large volumes of text, make it possible to begin extracting sentiments from the web. We discuss some of the challenges of sentiment extraction and some of the approaches employed to address these challenges. In particular, we describe work we have done to annotate sentiment in blogs at the levels of sentences and subsentences (clauses); to classify subjectivity at the level of sentences; and to identify the targets, or topics, of sentiment at the level of clauses.

TI  - Evaluation of patient satisfaction and perceptions of a long-acting injectable antipsychotic medication administration service in a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PHARMACISTS ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
KW  - SCHIZOPHRENIA
AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, restrictions, and social distancing requirements for medical offices reduced scheduling availability and increased virtual televisits by providers. COVID-19 restrictions created a barrier to health care access for patients who are being administered long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) in an already vulnerable population.
   Objective: To describe an LAI medication administration service at a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to evaluate patient satisfaction with the administration of LAIs by a pharmacist service in a community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare the patient's perceptions of receiving LAIs in a community-based pharmacy with those in another setting previously used for medication administration.
   Practice description: Independent full-service community-based pharmacy.
   Practice innovation: Implementation of an LAI administration service after an increase in provider referrals of patients to the community-based pharmacy during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Evaluation methods: A 4-month prospective convenience sample study conducted to evaluate the LAI medication administration service. The survey containing 32 questions was adapted with permission from a previous survey administered in a large grocery store chain to a similar population. Survey results were reported using descriptive statistics.
   Results: Eleven patients completed the survey. A total of 82% of patients strongly agreed that they felt comfortable with receiving this service at the community-based pharmacy and were satisfied with the privacy during the service. Seventy-one percent of patients who received this service elsewhere strongly agreed the LAI medication administration service was more convenient than a similar service received elsewhere, yet only 18% of patients strongly agreed that the community-based pharmacy was near their work or home.
   Conclusion: A medication administration service for LAIs was developed in a communitybased pharmacy, and patients were satisfied with the service. Further research needs to be completed to evaluate health outcomes and financial implications of this service for the patient and health care system. (C) 2022 American Pharmacists Association (R).

AB  - Objective: To evaluate predictors of stay-at-home order adoption among US states, as well as associations between order enactment and residents' mobility. Design: We assess associations between state characteristics and adoption timing. We also assess associations between enactment and aggregate state-level measures of residents' mobility (Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports). Setting: The United States. Participants: Adoption population: 50 US states and District of Columbia.Mobility population: state residents using devices with GPS tracking accessible by Google. Intervention and Exposures: State characteristics: COVID-19 diagnoses per capita, 2016 Trump vote share, Republican governor, Medicaid expansion status, hospital beds per capita, public health funding per capita, state and local tax revenue per capita, median household income, population, percent residents 65 years or older, and percent urban residents.Mobility exposure: indicator of order enactment by March 29, 2020 (date of mobility data collection). Main Outcome Measures: Order adoption timing: days since adoption of first order.Mobility: changes in mobility to 6 locations from February 6 to March 29, 2020. Results: In bivariate models, order adoption was associated with COVID-19 diagnoses (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.01; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.01), Republican governor (HR = 0.24; 95% CI, 0.13 to 0.44), Medicaid expansion (HR = 2.50; 95% CI, 1.40 to 4.48), and hospital capacity (HR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.70), consistent with findings in the multivariate models. Order enactment was positively associated with time at home (beta (B) = 1.31; 95% CI, 0.35 to 2.28) and negatively associated with time at retail and recreation (B= -7.17; 95% CI, -10.89 to -3.46) and grocery and pharmacy (B= -8.28; 95% CI, -11.97 to -4.59) locations. Trump vote share was associated with increased mobility for 4 of 6 mobility measures. Conclusions and Relevance: While politics influenced order adoption, public health considerations were equally influential. While orders were associated with decreased mobility, political ideology was associated with increased mobility under social distancing policies.

AB  - Objectives: Patients at risk of anaphylaxis are required to always carry an adrenaline auto-injector (AAI), as the first line of treatment, but their adherence is low. An Emergency Response Community (ERC) is a social network of patients who can potentially help other patients who find themselves without their medication in an emergency. ERC can be mediated by an Emergency Medical Services (EMS) agency or unmediated to provide direct patient-to-patient immediate first aid.The purpose of this research was to study physicians' attitudes towards anaphylaxis ERC (AERC).Methods: A convenience sample of 224 physicians were surveyed using an online questionnaire. Answers were analyzed using ANOVA, t-tests and ordinal regression.Results: Positive attitudes towards an AERC found 88.4% (n = 198) see potential in the ERC and 62.9% (n = 141) think that ERC is excellent and should be implemented immediately. Fewer respondents (6.25%, n = 14) rejected the ERC completely.Respondents showed high willingness to provide patients with solicited or unsolicited advice to join an AERC (78%, n = 175 and 50%, n = 111 respectively).Physicians' opinion about the minimum age to join an AERC is an average of 15.45 years. Leading concerns are 'being left without AAI' (54.5%, n = 122), 'expired AAI' (44.2%, n = 99) and 'wrong AAI administration' (41.1%, n = 92).High support for mediated AERC (79%, n = 177) was found and mediation seems to reduce concerns among the majority (68.3%, n = 153) of respondents.Conclusions: Physicians expressed high support for unmediated AERC. EMS mediation is preferred by the respondents and potentially lowers their concerns. Findings support the AERC approach for patients at risk of anaphylaxis.Public interest summary: Patients at risk of anaphylaxis are required to always carry an adrenaline auto-injector, as the first line of treatment, but their adherence is low.

AB  - This study evaluated a participatory-based, experiential learning program, Ontario Focus Farms (FF), which aimed to change dairy producer behavior to control Johne's disease (JD) in Ontario, Canada. The goals were to (1) assess the effect of FF on participating dairy producers' knowledge, attitudes, and behavior with regard to JD control; (2) compare changes in these factors among FF participants to changes among a group of nonparticipating dairy producers; and (3) describe the characteristics of producers who made at least one on-farm management change. Pre- and post-FF intervention questionnaires collected data on respondents' knowledge, attitudes, behavior, herd production, and demographic information; before and after JD-risk assessments were used to assess respondents' on-farm risk of JD transmission. Overall, 176 dairy producers participated in the FF process; 39.8% (70/176) of FF and 14.6% (52/357) of control participants responded to both the pre- and postintervention questionnaires. Upon comparison, FF respondents were more likely to be younger, have larger herds, and have higher management scores. The proportion of FF participants who reported making at least one on-farm change (81%) was significantly higher than that of control respondents (38%). Overall, FF respondents significantly changed their risk score in 4 out of 5 risk areas and had an average reduction of 13 points in their overall risk score between before and after risk assessments. Control respondents' risk assessment scores did not significantly change during the study period. In a JD knowledge assessment, FF and control respondents exhibited a moderate knowledge score before the intervention period, with median scores of 75.9% (22/29) in each group. The FF respondents significantly increased their score at the postintervention assessment, with a median of 82.8% (24/29); control-respondent scores did not significantly change. Both FF and control respondents held strong positive attitudes toward JD control and felt a moderate amount of social pressure from veterinarians and industry organizations to make on-farm changes. However, they questioned their ability to effectively control JD on the farm. Last, participating in FF, having a moderate herd management score, having a positive perception about the practicality of on-farm recommendations, and having a singular learning preference were associated with increased odds of making an on-farm change. Overall, the FF process appears to be effective at influencing producer behavior toward implementing on-farm management practices for JD control. Future JD control programs should consider implementing peer-learning extension processes, such as FF, in combination with other extension approaches, to influence producer behavior.

AB  - This study examines the interrelationships amongst and between news attention, education, and political tolerance. Based on the theoretical presumption that the mainstream news media tend to reflect the prejudices and ideologies of the dominant groups in a society, news portrayal of groups regarded as deviant and/or controversial can be expected to be negative in valence. Hence, news attention is expected to lead to more negative attitudes toward such groups, which in turn breeds intolerance toward them. Meanwhile, education may moderate the relationship between news attention and tolerance. Research questions and hypotheses are examined through analyzing the data from a representative survey conducted in Hong Kong. The findings confirm the negative, indirect effect of news attention on tolerance through attitude toward deviant groups. Education is also found to relate to tolerance in a complicated and contradictory manner: while education has a direct positive effect on tolerance, it also strengthens the negative impact that attitude toward deviant groups has on tolerance. The theoretical and social implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed a large, initially uncontrollable, public health crisis both in the United States and across the world, with experts looking to vaccines as the ultimate mechanism of defense. The development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccines have been rapidly advancing via global efforts. Hence, it is crucial for governments, public health officials, and policy makers to understand public attitudes and opinions towards vaccines, such that effective interventions and educational campaigns can be designed to promote vaccine acceptance.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate public opinion and perception on COVID-19 vaccines in the United States. We investigated the spatiotemporal trends of public sentiment and emotion towards COVID-19 vaccines and analyzed how such trends relate to popular topics found on Twitter.
   Methods: We collected over 300,000 geotagged tweets in the United States from March 1, 2020 to February 28, 2021. We examined the spatiotemporal patterns of public sentiment and emotion over time at both national and state scales and identified 3 phases along the pandemic timeline with sharp changes in public sentiment and emotion. Using sentiment analysis, emotion analysis (with cloud mapping of keywords), and topic modeling, we further identified 11 key events and major topics as the potential drivers to such changes.
   Results: An increasing trend in positive sentiment in conjunction with a decrease in negative sentiment were generally observed in most states, reflecting the rising confidence and anticipation of the public towards vaccines. The overall tendency of the 8 types of emotion implies that the public trusts and anticipates the vaccine. This is accompanied by a mixture of fear, sadness, and anger. Critical social or international events or announcements by political leaders and authorities may have potential impacts on public opinion towards vaccines. These factors help identify underlying themes and validate insights from the analysis.
   Conclusions: The analyses of near real-time social media big data benefit public health authorities by enabling them to monitor public attitudes and opinions towards vaccine-related information in a geo-aware manner, address the concerns of vaccine skeptics, and promote the confidence that individuals within a certain region or community have towards vaccines.

AB  - Recent research suggests that inducing fixed (rather than malleable) beliefs about groups leads to more negative attitudes toward out-groups. The present paper identifies the underlying mechanism of this effect. We show that individuals with a fixed belief about groups tend to construe intergroup settings as threatening situations that might reveal shortcomings of their in-group (perceived threat). In the present research, we measured (Study 1) and manipulated (Study 2) participants' lay theories about group malleability. We found that the extent to which individuals had an entity (versus an incremental) group theory influenced the level of threat they felt when interacting with out-group members, and that perceived threat in turn affected their level of ethnocentrism and prejudice. These findings shed new light on the role of lay theories in intergroup attitudes and suggest new ways to reduce prejudice. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to (a) assess knowledge of official vaccination recommendations and attitudes towards vaccinations among adults and (b) examine their association with vaccination uptake among adults.
   Methods: This study was part of the HaBIDS study (Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Survey), which is an online panel established in March 2014 in Lower Saxony, Germany with males and females aged between 15 and 69 years (n = 2379). Every few months, participants completed questionnaires on different aspects of infectious diseases. In September 2014, knowledge of vaccination recommendations, attitudes towards vaccinations and information on uptake of vaccinations in the last 10 years (practice) were collected using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) questionnaire. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to identify underlying structures in each KAP domain and fractional polynomial regression analysis to examine the associations of knowledge and attitudes with vaccination uptake.
   Results: Of the 2379 panel members, 1698 (71%) completed the KAP questionnaire on vaccinations. The majority of participants (80%) knew that the vaccine against diphtheria and tetanus should be administered every 10 years. Regarding other recommendations, the proportion of correct answers varied between 35% and 60%. 82% of participants agreed that adult vaccinations should be mandatory for selected groups such as health care workers and 40% stated that vaccinations should be mandatory for all adults. For the different vaccines, the odds of being unvaccinated were 1.5- to 5-times higher among participants with poor knowledge of vaccination recommendations compared to participants with good knowledge. Participants with negative attitudes towards vaccinations were also more likely to be unvaccinated.
   Conclusions: Efforts should be undertaken to improve knowledge of official vaccination recommendations in the general population and reduce common misconceptions about vaccinations. This information can be provided during general practitioner visits or through media campaigns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

KW  - virtual visit
AB  - Telemedicine has been in existence for decades with little traction for global mainstream medicine. However, COVID-19 has exposed the importance of providing continued care for patients while minimizing the risk of exposure during pandemics. There has been robust growth in the use of telemedicine since the pandemic began, rendering safety in care provided by minimizing exposure to patients and healthcare workers. There has been tremendous growth and innovation in various digital applications that facilitate telehealth as the platforms continue to improve. Even in the absence of a pandemic, telemedicine allows for care of patients who may live in remote areas or have issues with transportation and comorbidi ties prohibiting ambulation.
   This study is based on a questionnaire for healthcare providers who have been exposed to telemedicine during COVID-19. A survey was shared in social media forums involving groups of physicians and nurse practitioners who were willing to take the survey.
   Telemedicine is one of the best approaches to handling situations like pandemics or disease surges. In these circumstances, a virtual visit is beneficial for social distancing if a laptop, smartphone, or tablet is available, along with internet or cellular coverage.
   This survey was conducted among healthcare workers of various specialties and it was found out that there was a considerable impetus for the continued benefit from telemedicine as an alternative to in-person visits for selected patients.
   Ongoing improvements in the quality of applications/tools, education, and cost are essential to maintain telemedicine. There is also a constant necessity for vast improvements in healthcare policies and reimbursements to allow for telemedicine to evolve.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, key policies aimed at reducing exposure to the virus from social distancing, restrictions on travel through to strongly enforced lockdowns. However, COVID-19 restrictions required people to spend more time at home so the exposure to air pollutants shifted to being derived from that of domestic interiors, rather than outdoors or the workplace environment. This study aims to characterise the influence of lockdown intervention on the balance of indoor and outdoor PM2.5 exposure in a Malaysian suburb. We also calculate the potential health risk from exposure to both indoor and outdoor PM2.5 to give context to personal exposure assessment in different microenvironments during the COVID-19 lockdown, known locally as Movement Control Orders (MCO). The implementation of the MCOs slightly reduced daily average of outdoor PM2.5 concentrations (median of 12.63 mu g m(-3) before and 11.72 mu g m(-3)). In the Malaysian apartment considered here, cooking led to a substantial increase in exposure from increasing concentrations in PM2.5 during a COVID-19 lockdown (maximum average concentration at 52.2 mu g m(-3)). The estimated excess risk to health was about 25% for lung cancer from staying indoor. Thus, there seems a potential for greater exposure to fine particles indoors under lockdown, so it is likely premature to suggest that more lives were saved through a reduction of outdoor pollutants than lost in the pandemic. Unfortunately, little is known about the toxicity of indoor particles and the types of exposures that result where people increase the amount of time they spend working from home or staying indoors, especially during periods of lockdown.

AB  - Background COVID-19 has affected the entire world. We aimed to determine the impact of COVID-19 containment measures on the daily life and follow up of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   Methods During May 2020, we evaluated 179 (79.6%) patients with Crohn's disease (CD) and 46 (20.4%) with ulcerative colitis (UC) by telephone, using a structured questionnaire to gather information on social impact and IBD follow up.
   Results Some kind of social distancing measure was reported by 95.6% of our patients, self-quarantine (64.9%) being the most frequent. Depressive mood was the most prevalent social impact ( 80.2%), followed by anxiety/fear of death (58.2%), insomnia (51.4%), daily activity impairment (48%), sexual dysfunction (46.2%), and productivity impairment (44%). The results were similar when we compared patients with active disease to those in remission and patients with UC to those with CD. Analysis of IBD follow up showed that 83.1% of all patients missed an IBD medical appointment, 45.5% of the patients missed laboratory tests, 41.3% missed the national flu vaccination program, 31.3% missed any radiologic exam, 17.3% missed colonoscopy, and 16.9% failed to obtain biologic therapy prescriptions. Biologics were discontinued by 28.4% of the patients. UC patients had higher rates of missed vaccination than CD patients ( 56.5% vs. 37.4%, P=0.02) and more failures to obtain a biologic prescription (28.3% vs. 14.0%, P=0.02).
   Conclusions Our study reveals alarming social impacts and declining follow-up care for IBD patients during the COVID-19 outbreak. These findings may have implications for disease control in the near future.

AB  - Introduction While the secondary impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychological well-being of pregnant women and parents has become apparent over the past year, the impact of these changes on early social interactions, physical growth and cognitive development of their infants is unknown, as is the way in which a range of COVID-19-related changes have mediated this impact. This study (CoCoPIP) will investigate: (1) how parent's experiences of the social, medical and financial changes during the pandemic have impacted prenatal and postnatal parental mental health and parent-infant social interaction; and (2) the extent to which these COVID-19-related changes in parental prenatal and postnatal mental health and social interaction are associated with fetal and infant development. Methods and analysis The CoCoPIP study is a national online survey initiated in July 2020. This ongoing study (n=1700 families currently enrolled as of 6 May 2021) involves both quantitative and qualitative data being collected across pregnancy and infancy. It is designed to identify the longitudinal impact of the pandemic from pregnancy to 2 years of age as assessed using a range of parent- and self-report measures, with the aim of identifying if stress-associated moderators (ie, loss of income, COVID-19 illness, access to ante/postnatal support) appear to impact parental mental health, and in turn, infant development. In addition, we aim to document individual differences in social and cognitive development in toddlers who were born during restrictions intended to mitigate COVID-19 spread (eg, social distancing, national lockdowns). Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was given by the University of Cambridge, Psychology Research Ethics Committee (PRE.2020.077). Findings will be made available via community engagement, public forums (eg, social media,) and to national (eg, NHS England) and local (Cambridge Universities Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust) healthcare partners. Results will be submitted for publication in peer-reviews journals.

AB  - We present a cohort study of attendees at a youth sleep-away camp with a COVID-19 outbreak and highlight transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in youth congregate settings.
   OBJECTIVES: In late June 2020, a large outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) occurred at a sleep-away youth camp in Georgia, affecting primarily persons ?21 years. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among campers and staff (attendees) to determine the extent of the outbreak and assess factors contributing to transmission. METHODS: Attendees were interviewed to ascertain demographic characteristics, known exposures to COVID-19 and community exposures, and mitigation measures before, during, and after attending camp. COVID-19 case status was determined for all camp attendees on the basis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) test results and reported symptoms. We calculated attack rates and instantaneous reproduction numbers and sequenced SARS-CoV-2 viral genomes from the outbreak. RESULTS: Among 627 attendees, the median age was 15 years (interquartile range: 12?16 years); 56% (351 of 627) of attendees were female. The attack rate was 56% (351 of 627) among all attendees. On the basis of date of illness onset or first positive test result on a specimen collected, 12 case patients were infected before arriving at camp and 339 case patients were camp associated. Among 288 case patients with available symptom information, 45 (16%) were asymptomatic. Despite cohorting, 50% of attendees reported direct contact with people outside their cabin cohort. On the first day of camp session, the instantaneous reproduction number was 10. Viral genomic diversity was low. CONCLUSIONS: Few introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into a youth congregate setting resulted in a large outbreak. Testing strategies should be combined with prearrival quarantine, routine symptom monitoring with appropriate isolation and quarantine, cohorting, social distancing, mask wearing, and enhanced disinfection and hand hygiene. Promotion of mitigation measures among younger populations is needed.

AB  - Background: The application process for Core Surgical Training (CST) in the United Kingdom (UK) is competitive and hence, careful preparation is required for trainees to obtain their posts of choice. There are multiple resources for preparation for selection including face-to-face courses and online question banks, however there is a paucity of webinars to educate trainees. With the cancellation of such courses due to social distancing restrictions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, this cross-sectional study aims to evaluate the usefulness of a webinar to educate trainees on CST selection in the UK.
   Materials and methods: A free online webinar was held on a single day by a second year core surgical trainee and was attended by 111 junior doctors. Beforehand, all attendees were invited to complete a survey on Google Forms (Google, USA) to ascertain their level of experience with webinars, obtain demographic information and elicit their level of knowledge about CST selection using a 1-5 Likert scale.
   Results: Most attendees were in Foundation Year 2 (38.7%) and many had not previously attended a webinar as part of CST application preparation (93.7%). Over half of respondents (55.0%) preferred a webinar over a face-to-face tutorial, appreciating the flexibility, convenience and zero financial cost associated. Many candidates received minimal advice on CST application by their Foundation School (47.7%) and 50.5% of respondents rated their confidence on the application process at '3 out of 5.'
   Conclusion: Our study suggests webinars have been underused in preparation for CST applications. Traditional courses and advice from colleagues are more popular ways in which applicants prepare for selection. However, given the degree of uncertainty surrounding the return of face-to-face courses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, preparation for CST application may become increasingly reliant on online materials, which may result in an increased demand for high quality, engaging and informative webinars.

AB  - This generation faces existential threats because of the global assault of the novel Corona virus 2019 (i.e., COVID-19). With more than thirteen million infected and nearly 600000 fatalities in 188 countries/regions, COVID-19 is the worst calamity since the World War II. These misfortunes are traced to various reasons, including late detection of latent or asymptomatic carriers, migration, and inadequate isolation of infected people. This makes detection, containment, and mitigation global priorities to contain exposure via quarantine, lockdowns, work/stay at home, and social distancing that are focused on "flattening the curve". While medical and healthcare givers are at the frontline in the battle against COVID-19, it is a crusade for all of humanity. Meanwhile, machine and deep learning models have been revolutionary across numerous domains and applications whose potency have been exploited to birth numerous state-of-the-art technologies utilised in disease detection, diagnoses, and treatment. Despite these potentials, machine and, particularly, deep learning models are data sensitive, because their effectiveness depends on availability and reliability of data. The unavailability of such data hinders efforts of engineers and computer scientists to fully contribute to the ongoing assault against COVID-19. Faced with a calamity on one side and absence of reliable data on the other, this study presents two data-augmentation models to enhance learnability of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM)-based deep learning models (DADLMs) and, by doing so, boost the accuracy of COVID-19 detection. Experimental results reveal improvement in terms of accuracy of detection, logarithmic loss, and testing time relative to DLMs devoid of such data augmentation. Furthermore, average increases of 4% to 11% in COVID-19 detection accuracy are reported in favour of the proposed data-augmented deep learning models relative to the machine learning techniques. Therefore, the proposed algorithm is effective in performing a rapid and consistent Corona virus diagnosis that is primarily aimed at assisting clinicians in making accurate identification of the virus.

AB  - Objective: This study examined weight bias among students training in health disciplines and its associations with their perceptions about treating patients with obesity, causes of obesity, and observations of weight bias by instructors and peers.
   Methods: Students (N = 107) enrolled in a post-graduate health discipline (Physician Associate, Clinical Psychology, Psychiatric Residency) completed anonymous questionnaires to assess the above variables.
   Results: Students reported that patients with obesity are a common target of negative attitudes and derogatory humor by peers (63%), health-care providers (65%), and instructors (40%). Although 80% of students felt confident to treat obesity, many reported that patients with obesity lack motivation to make changes (33%), lead to feelings of frustration (36%), and are non-compliant with treatment (36%). Students with higher weight bias expressed greater frustration in these areas. The effect of students' weight bias on expectations for treatment compliance of patients with obesity was partially mediated by beliefs that obesity is caused by behavioral factors.
   Conclusions: Weight bias is commonly observed by students in health disciplines, who themselves report frustrations and stereotypes about treating patients with obesity. These findings contribute new knowledge about weight bias among students and provide several targets for medical training and education.

Methods: Research primarily utilised the questionnaire survey method to collect and analyse public attitudes towards COVID-19 to achieve the research goals. We checked the adequacy of measurements and tested the hypotheses with regression analysis based on 801 participants in China. Results: The results indicated that the levels of the public WeChat COVID-19 risk information attention and trust had a significant positive impact on the public's risk perception and willingness of pandemic prevention. The improved public risk perception of COVID-19 as a mediator enhanced the public pandemic prevention ability, which allowed WeChat to play a more effective role in major disaster emergency.

AB  - Studies suggest an association between older adults' sexual health and quality of life. Despite this, previous research suggests a lack of assessment of older adults' sexual health. To understand this gap, we examined predictors of practicing psychologists' attitudes to and assessment of the sexual health of older adults. This study utilized purposive online sampling to recruit 119 US practicing psychologists (median years licensed=11). Participants completed questionnaires on sociodemographics, education and training, and were randomized to a vignette condition depicting a middle-aged or older adult with mood and sexual health concerns. Following the vignette, participants completed a survey on attitudes and their willingness to assess patients' sexual health. Participants' vignette condition, sociodemographics, clinical education, experience, and specialty did not predict attitudes toward older adults' sexuality. However, results indicated that negative attitudes toward older adults' sexuality (p=.01) and sexuality education and training (p=.001) predicted psychologists' willingness to assess sexual health. Results indicate that in order to increase psychologists' assessments of older adults' sexual health, interventions should focus on changing attitudes toward older adults' sexuality, and increasing psychologists' sexuality education and training.

AB  - In multilingual schools students have diverse identities, cultural backgrounds, perceptions, capacities and linguistic experiences. The space for teaching and learning is also mediated by stereotypes and prejudices associated with this diversity. Diversity, stereotypes and prejudices shape how teachers and learners operate in a world of complex social relationships. In this survey we explore the hidden attitudes of immigrant students and teachers in secondary education in Catalonia (Spain). The research uses the distinction between explicit and implicit attitudes to analyse immigrant students' perceptions and teachers' subconscious perceptions about school involvement. The sample includes 4078 immigrant students with more than six months of residence in the host country that were attending linguistic support classes in secondary schools of Catalonia during the year 2006-2007, and also their regular classroom teachers and support teachers. The survey aims to establish if is there any statistically significant associations between the attitudes of newcomer students and teachers, and the linguistic and geographical origins of the students. We wanted to know if teacher and student perceptions agreed or differed and to characterise stereotypes and prejudices affecting positive or negative attitudes about the organisation of teaching while learning. The results show how the teachers' perceptions about newcomer students' involvement differ in many cases from the views of the students, and how lower expectations and subjective manifestations of racism are evident with some groups, especially with students of African origin.

AB  - The disposal of nuclear wastes is one of the most controversial issues faced by authorities in Japan. In this regard, a survey was conducted among 172 university students to analyze the attitude towards the sitting of a nuclear waste repository in the country. The study focused on a number of variables that influenced the perception of risks before the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami. Results indicate that nuclear wastes were not a top priority for the Japanese public before the event. However, there was already a strong concern about the potential leakage of radionuclides. Most respondents believed the government would take proper steps to protect them, but overall, trust in authorities was modest Moreover, people were especially doubtful about scientists. Findings from the survey showed a polarization between supporters and opponents to the project. The NIMBY (not in my backyard) phenomenon was relevant, as acceptance decreased drastically if the facility located near the respondents' residential place. Economic incentives might not be enough to overcome the reluctance towards the sitting and therefore, authorities would need additional strategies to solve the controversy. At this stage the study provides only partial answers to a complex issue. Nevertheless, the study adds new information about public attitude on radioactive wastes, and help policy-makers in subsequent phases of the repository program.

Accordingly, people may be especially motivated to consume nostalgia-inducing media in times of crisis. One such crisis that has strongly affected the personal lives of most people around the world is the global COVID-19 pandemic. In our study, we investigate the role of nostalgic media use during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic. We investigate whether nostalgic media use has increased during the early 2020 lockdown, what kinds of media people used to become nostalgic, and how nostalgic media use is associated with well-being and escapism. In a cross-sectional panel survey conducted during lockdown measures in Germany in April and May 2020, participants (N = 534) were asked about their current stress, fear of isolation, nostalgic media usage, and functional as well as dysfunctional escapism. Controlling for nostalgia proneness, our findings indicate that nostalgic media usage was positively associated with fear of isolation and that it was related to both functional and dysfunctional escapism. Respondents in our survey most commonly used music, movies, and series and also (audio-)books, videogames, and private photos and videos to become nostalgic. Overall, our findings indicate that media-induced nostalgia may function as a resource to cope with social stress (fear of isolation) for some people during the lockdown measures and that this coping strategy may have both functional as well as dysfunctional components.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement This research offers evidence that fear of isolation that many people experienced during the lockdown measures to contain the COVID-19 pandemic is positively related to the consumption of media that elicits nostalgia. Moreover, nostalgia was positively related to both functional and dysfunctional escapism. These findings indicate that people may use nostalgia-inducing media as a coping mechanism to deal with fears related to social isolation during times of social distances.

AB  - Background To reduce COVID-19 infection rates during the initial stages of the pandemic, the UK Government mandated a strict period of restriction on freedom of movement or 'lockdown'. For young people, closure of schools and higher education institutions and social distancing rules may have been particularly challenging, coming at a critical time in their lives for social and emotional development. This study explored young people's experiences of the UK Government's initial response to the pandemic and related government messaging. Methods This qualitative study combines data from research groups at the University of Southampton, University of Edinburgh and University College London. Thirty-six online focus group discussions (FGDs) were conducted with 150 young people (Southampton: n = 69; FGD = 7; Edinburgh: n = 41; FGD = 5; UCL: n = 40; FGD = 24). Thematic analysis was conducted to explore how young people viewed the government's response and messaging and to develop recommendations for how to best involve young people in addressing similar crises in the future. Results The abrupt onset of lockdown left young people shocked, confused and feeling ignored by government and media messaging. Despite this, they were motivated to adhere to government advice by the hope that life might soon return to normal. They felt a responsibility to help with the pandemic response, and wanted to be productive with their time, but saw few opportunities to volunteer. Conclusions Young people want to be listened to and feel they have a part to play in responding to a national crisis such as the COVID-19 epidemic. To reduce the likelihood of disenfranchising the next generation, Government and the media should focus on developing messaging that reflects young people's values and concerns and to provide opportunities for young people to become involved in responses to future crises.

AB  - Background The Covid-19 pandemic has led to substantial and unexpected increases in morbidity and mortality in France. Vulnerable populations housed in accommodation centres have a greater risk of infection because collective housing and their dependence on social support services mean it is more difficult to apply preventive measures. They are also at greater risk of developing severe forms of Covid-19 and waiting longer before seeking healthcare (for Covid-19 or other) treatment. We aimed to identify the factors associated with SARS-CoV2 infection in the most vulnerable populations in the city of Marseille. Methods The study sample comprised users of various services provided by the association AAJT in Marseille, France, some presenting symptoms suggestive of Covid-19 and others not. All had routine health surveillance provided by AAJT's dedicated healthcare team between March 2020 and May 2020. Using univariate and multivariate analyses, we studied the influence of several variables on morbidity associated with Covid-19. Results The study included 64 participants, 29 of whom tested positive for Covid-19 and 35 control subjects. Median age was 21.16 years old. Individuals in the 'Covid-19 case' group (p < 0.005) - which included persons testing positive and those suspected of being infected - were younger. The study sample's male/female ratio was seven. In our multivariate analyses, living in a shared apartment and poor adherence to social distancing measures were factors associated with Covid-19 infection. Furthermore, mental health problems - such as anxiety disorder - were very frequent in the study sample. Conclusions Allocating more and specific housing units to structures providing accommodation services to the most vulnerable people would seem to be a decisive factor in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV2, and deserves more attention from public authorities.

AB  - Background: The Fear of COVID-19 Scale (FCV-19S) is a brief self-report measure developed at the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. The scale evaluates the emotional responses to COVID-19. To date, the FCV-19S has been translated and validated in about 20 languages and has been used in many published research. The current study aimed to validate the Polish version of the FCV-19S.
   Method: The FCV-19S was translated into Polish using forward- and back-translation. From May 15th to June 15th 2020, a total of 708 community members (Sample 1: 383 persons, 209 females, Sample 2: 325 persons, 198 females) participated in the online study. The participants were recruited using online advertisements in social media. Participation was anonymous, voluntary, and without compensation. A confirmatory factor analysis was performed to test the one-factor structure of the FCV-19S. Then, measurement invariance was analyzed across samples, gender and age groups. To assess the validity of the scale, correlations between the FCV-19S and the remaining scales were computed.
   Results: Internal consistency of the FCV-19S was good in both samples (Cronbach's alpha 0.89 and 0.85). The CFA showed that the one-factor model fits the data well (RMSEA = 0.067, 90% CI [0.059-0.094], CFI = 0.977, TLI = 0.965, GFI = 0.986). The criteria for configural, metric, scalar and strict invariance were met for all models tested. The FCV-19S scores correlated significantly with age, subjective vulnerability to the disease, neuroticism, self-reported compliance with the pandemic measures, and three kinds of preventive behavior (i.e., social distancing, hand hygiene, and disinfecting things).
   Conclusion: The Polish version of the FCV-19S had a unidimensional structure, good reliability, and correlated as predicted with other variables. With the FCV-19S and the obtained results, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the government can gain more valuable information about people who may be at risk for negative psychological outcomes during the pandemic or who are not implementing protective behavior. The tool can be used in hospitals to quickly screen the level of fear in patients and minimize its severe adverse consequences.

AB  - Intergroup contact is the leading strategy for reducing the stigma associated with mental illness. For the first time, the current study examines the effectiveness of a contemporary intergroup contact strategy, called electronic or E-contact, to reduce stigma against people diagnosed with schizophrenia. It also examines the mediating role of three target-relevant intergroup emotions, namely fear, anger, and pity. In total, 133 participants engaged in E-contact with a person diagnosed with schizophrenia (intergroup E-contact), E-contact with a person without a mental illness (intragroup E-contact), or no contact. Compared to the intragroup E-contact and no-contact conditions, intergroup E-contact reduced fear, anger, and stereotyping toward people with schizophrenia. Additionally, fear and anger, but not pity, were found to be significant affective mediators of the E-contact effect. The findings demonstrate the value of computer-mediated intergroup contact for stigma reduction, and emphasize the importance of intergroup emotions in this domain.

AB  - Antifat attitudes refer to stereotyping based on people's weight. A potential explanation for the strong negative attitudes toward obese individuals relates to people's emotional reactions. In this study, conducted with 373 female students, it is suggested that physical disgust, germ aversion and perceived controllability of weight play a central role in explaining the individual differences that exist in antifat attitudes. Our results showed a positive relationship between physical disgust and germ aversion. Additionally, it has been found a positive correlation between physical disgust and perceived controllability of weight. Furthermore, a positive relationship between antifat attitudes, physical disgust and germ aversion was found. Finally, perceived controllability of weight was positively related to antifat attitudes. The path analysis conducted showed the mediational effect of perceived controllability of weight in the relationship between physical disgust and antifat attitudes. Finally, it is discussed the results in the frame of antifat attitudes literature.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has spread globally and has been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. While influenza virus shows seasonality, it is unknown if COVID-19 has any weather-related affect. In this work, we analyze the patterns in local weather of all the regions affected by COVID-19 globally. Our results indicate that approximately 85% of the COVID-19 reported cases until 1 May 2020, making approximately 3 million reported cases (out of approximately 29 million tests performed) have occurred in regions with temperature between 3 and 17 degrees C and absolute humidity between 1 and 9 g/m(3). Similarly, hot and humid regions outside these ranges have only reported around 15% or approximately 0.5 million cases (out of approximately 7 million tests performed). This suggests that weather might be playing a role in COVID-19 spread across the world. However, this role could be limited in US and European cities (above 45 N), as mean temperature and absolute humidity levels do not reach these ranges even during the peak summer months. For hot and humid countries, most of them have already been experiencing temperatures >35 degrees C and absolute humidity >9 g/m(3)since the beginning of March, and therefore the effect of weather, however little it is, has already been accounted for in the COVID-19 spread in those regions, and they must take strict social distancing measures to stop the further spread of COVID-19. Our analysis showed that the effect of weather may have only resulted in comparatively slower spread of COVID-19, but not halted it. We found that cases in warm and humid countries have consistently increased, accounting for approximately 500,000 cases in regions with absolute humidity >9 g/m(3), therefore effective public health interventions must be implemented to stop the spread of COVID-19. This also means that 'summer' would not alone stop the spread of COVID-19 in any part of the world.

AB  - Young climate activist Greta Thunberg was Time magazine's Person of the Year for 2019. In this study, the authors examine the role of social media in Thunberg's rise to prominence by investigating Twitter communications over 14 months, analyzing tweet contents and user profiles. The changes in sentiment revealed on Twitter are examined, along with four major events from the period. The paper also compares Swedish and American user characteristics in relation to Thunberg. The findings reveal that celebrities and public figures played an essential role in amplifying the influence of the activist. To categorize the influencer group, the authors identified each user's occupation, organization, location and position on other social issues. The results show that some people held a negative attitude toward Thunberg, not only because of their skepticism about climate change but also because of their views on other social issues, such as gender and age.

AB  - Objective: The study was done to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices of women within the child bearing age with regard to smoking and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) on children's health.
   Subjects and Methods: A cross-sectional study with quantitative and qualitative components was designed to collect data from women in the child-bearing age. The sample comprised of persons from the two largest combined family planning and antenatal clinics in Kingston, Jamaica.
   Results: The women surveyed had a fair level of knowledge about ETS health risks, negative attitudes to smoking in general, and most supported a ban on smoking in public places. Significant knowledge differences existed between young and older women and between smokers and non-smokers.
   Conclusion: Women with the highest level of knowledge were the non-smokers: of the low knowledge score group (current smokers), 50% were in the 15-24-year age range. There is a need for more public education on smoking and the consequences of environmental tobacco smoke exposure on children's health.

AB  - The Netflix documentary Making a Murderer made national headlines by chronicling the conflict between Steven Avery and the Manitowoc County legal system. After spending 18 years in prison for a wrongful conviction, Avery was arrested again and found guilty of the murder of Teresa Halbach. Due to the controversial nature of the case, and the popularity associated with the documentary, this event was used to evaluate several variables that may influence judgment on decisions of a defendant's guilt or innocence. Participants (N = 905) were recruited online via several social media platforms and included in the study if they acknowledged watching the documentary. They then completed an online survey containing questionnaires related to demographics (e.g., gender, ethnicity), perceptual (e.g., punitive attitudes), and psychosocial characteristics (e.g., posttraumatic stress symptom severity). The majority of participants rated both Avery and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, also convicted in association for the crime, as innocent. Female participants reported higher ratings of guilt than males. Lower ratings of guilt were associated with lower levels of socioeconomic status, greater religious involvement, higher posttraumatic stress symptoms, and greater negative attitudes toward the judicial system. Race and political beliefs were unrelated to ratings of guilt. These results support previous research suggesting psychological and demographic variables may influence jurors' judgments of guilt in murder trials. Implications concerning maintaining impartiality among jury peers and preventing implicit biases are discussed.

AB  - Drawing on attribution theory, research on police discretion, and public attitudes toward mental illness, we examine attributional processes in police decision making in response to domestic violence situations involving veterans and nonveterans with signs of mental illness. Using data from experimental vignettes varying veteran status, victim injury, and suspect compliance administered to a sample of 309 police officers, the results indicate that 1) veterans are perceived as less responsible for troublesome behavior but more dangerous than nonveterans, 2) suspects' veteran status has a significant effect on officers' preference for mental health treatment versus arrest, and 3) part of the effect of veteran status on officer response is mediated by internal and external attributions for problematic behavior and by perceptions of dangerousness. The study empirically demonstrates countervailing processes in police decision makingrecognition of the causes for troublesome behavior and the need for mental health treatment on the one hand and concern for community safety and enforcing the law on the other.

TI  - A critical appraisal of heterosexism in Zambia
T2  - SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY
LA  - English
AB  - On 24 February 2012, then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon visited Zambia for three days. His call to respect human rights and give protection to all people regardless of sexual orientation was received mostly with hostility by the Zambian public. The media was inundated with opposing press statements from both government and civil society persons and entities. Politicians, church leaders, and the public widely condemned Ban's advocacy for gay rights. Although the debate on homosexuality is not new in Zambia, there is a dearth of research on the subject. This paper seeks, modestly, to re-examine popular rationale for heterosexism to contribute to the resolution of one of the perennial problems colouring African political, social, and cultural discourse. By deconstructing the popular views and systematising the debate, the paper aims at providing a baseline and guideline for addressing the problem of heterosexism in Zambia. Without suggesting that Africa is homogenous, what happened in Zambia following Ban's visit could have predictably happened in many African countries, notably Uganda and Nigeria. This paper, however, uses Zambia as a point of reference. The paper relies on views indicating negative attitudes and beliefs that legislators, and policy makers, church leaders and ordinary citizens have toward homosexuality. These positions have been thematised into six major grounds for the sexual prejudices against homosexuality. These are subjected to logical and epistemic scrutiny. Ultimately, the arguments in support of heterosexism are shown to be untenable.

AB  - The growth of the Latino community has increased levels of contact between this minority group and the predominately white majority. How does exposure to immigrants impact attitudes towards immigrants and immigration held by white Americans? We argue that previous work has not adequately tested the relationship posited by inter-group contact theory, whereby contact should shape policy attitudes. We test our theory drawing on the 2018 Cooperative Congressional Election Study (CCES). We find that among non-Hispanic whites, having a loved one who is a Latino immigrant improves attitudes towards immigrants as a group, which in turn is associated with declining support for punitive immigration policy. We likewise find that attitudes towards immigrants as a group mediates the relationship between proximal contact and policy attitudes. We draw on a variety of strategies to assess the robustness of the findings and to tease out evidence for the causal pathway we theorize is at work. As the demographics of the nation continue to change, growing closer to minority-majority status, understanding the factors that shape how white Americans regard their minority neighbors is of heightened importance.

AB  - The media often play the role of translating new science to consumers. We discuss the recent literature that has examined the supply and demand factors that affect media coverage of new food technologies and the impact on public perceptions and consumer behavior toward food that utilizes these technologies. We start with a discussion of the ways in which the media influence public perceptions and consumer behavior related to foods made with new technologies. We then discuss the incentives of news media and the potential sources of biases in their reporting. We review empirical studies that have examined media reporting of new agricultural and food technologies, especially biotechnology, in terms of both their agenda setting and framing effects and the social amplification of risk. We synthesize the findings of studies that have examined the influence of media coverage on public attitudes and consumer behavior. We conclude and discuss avenues for future research.

AB  - As a social problem, little is known about how individuals are portrayed in the news when race/ethnicity and mental illness intersect. This is important because of the agenda-setting ability of the news. This article examines how individuals with mental illness who were killed by police during 2015 and 2016 were portrayed in the news. An examination of 301 news reports indicates that mental illness is particularly emphasized in news reports about whites with mental illness, and less so in news reports about African Americans or Hispanics with mental illness. Findings have implications for public attitudes about mental illness across race/ethnicity.

AB  - Objectives Psychological and neural evidence suggests that negative attitudes toward stigmatized individuals arise in part from failures to perceive them as social targets. Here, we tested whether experimentally upregulating neural regions involved in social cognition would predict subsequent decreases in bias toward stigmatized individuals (i.e., people who use substances). Methods Participants underwent fMRI while completing either a lovingkindness intervention task or a control task, and each task was reinforced via daily text messages for a month following the one-time fMRI scan. Changes in implicit bias against stigmatized individuals were measured by Implicit Association Tests. Results The lovingkindness intervention task, compared with a control task, elicited greater baseline activity in the right temporoparietal junction (RTPJ), implicated in mentalizing, or the process of making inferences about others' mental states. The lovingkindness task compared with the control task also produced marginal decreases in bias over the month of the intervention. Individual differences in initial RTPJ activity at baseline during the fMRI intervention tasks further predicted improved implicit attitudes toward stigmatized individuals a month later. Conclusions The current study suggests that individual differences in people's tendency to engage brain regions that support taking others' perspectives are associated with greater changes in bias reduction over time. It is possible that strategies that upregulate mentalizing activity, such as lovingkindness training and other strategies that increase social cognitive processing, may be effective in shifting people's biases against stigmatized individuals.

AB  - This article examines the effects of trust versus doubt news frames during the 2018 denuclearization summit between the United States and North Korea in June 2018, an issue that is characterized by negative media coverage about North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. An experimental study conducted in 2018 at a public university in the United States found that participants (N = 297) showed a more negative attitude toward North Korea if they read an article framed as doubt compared with an article framed as trust. Exposure to the doubt-framed article was significantly related to participants' strong support for maintaining sanctions against North Korea and weak support for deepening diplomatic ties with the country. The analysis also reveals that low "need to evaluate" individuals were more affected by the doubt-framed news about North Korea than the trust-framed news.

AB  - With the explosion of social media, automatic analysis of sentiment and emotionfrom user-generated content has attracted the attention of many research areas and commercial-marketing domainstargeted at studying the social behavior of web users and their public attitudes toward brands, social events, and political actions. Capturing the emotions expressed in the written language could be crucial to support the decision-making processes: the emotion resultingfrom a tweet or a review about an item could affect the way to advertise or to trade on the web and then to make predictions about future changes in popularity or market behavior. This paper presents an experience with the emotion-based classification of textual data from a social network by using an extended version of the fuzzy C-means algorithm called extension of fuzzy C-means. The algorithm shows interesting results due to its intrinsic fuzzy nature that reflects the human feeling expressed in the text, often composed of a mix of blurred emotions, andat the same time, the benefits of the extended version yield better classification results.

AB  - It is well investigated that the expression of racial prejudice is often induced by news coverage on the internet, and the exposure to media contributes to the cultivation of long-term prejudice. However, there is a lack of information regarding the immediate effects of news delivered through television or television-like media on the expression of racial prejudice. This study provides a framework for understanding such effects by focusing on content-audience associations using the logs of an "online television" service, which provides television-like content and user experiences. With these logs, we found an association between the news-watching and comment-posting behaviors. Consequently, logs relevant to two distinct forms of racism, modern and old-fashioned racism, were extracted. Using mathematical modeling, which considers the different levels of program inducements to racist expression, personal inclinations of audiences to racism, and certainty of prediction of audience behaviors, we found three associative patterns between the news programs and audiences. The relevance of the topics covered to the basic beliefs of each form of racism was characterized into three clusters: expression as a reaction to news that is directly relevant to the basic beliefs of racism with weak inducements by non-bigots, minority abuse by distorting the meanings of news content indirectly relevant to the beliefs but with strong inducements by audiences with a strong bias, and racial toxic opinions independent of the news content by clear bigots. Our findings provide implications for inhibiting the expression of online prejudice based on the characteristics of these patterns.

AB  - The perceived sexual threat of ethnic outgroups has been argued to contribute to anti-immigrant attitudes within societies. The current study investigates to what extent news media might contribute to such negative outgroup perceptions by analyzing implicit sexual threat associations in Dutch news. The study draws on a sample of more than two million news articles published between 2008 and 2018 in five major Dutch newspapers. To identify implicit bias in this corpus, we use word embeddings-an advanced language modeling technique in Natural Language Processing (NLP). The results show that ethnic outgroups (i.e., nationalities that were most prominently represented among asylum applications in the Netherlands during the refugee crisis) are associated more strongly with sexual threat than ethnic ingroups. These findings proved robust across a diverse set of outgroups and ingroup nationalities and names, and point to the existence of considerable implicit bias in the coverage of ethnic minorities. Moreover, the sexual threat associated with Arabic names has grown stronger since the "refugee crisis". Such implicit biases reflect and potentially reinforces individuals' implicit associations between ethnic minorities and sexual threat, potentially explaining growing anti-immigration attitudes, especially since the refugee crisis.

AB  - Today, internet provides opportunities for solidarization and collective action to initiative groups of social movements, including those of high degree of radicalism. For radical groups, language continues to be a crucial instrument through which social movements influence public attitudes. In this article, we analyze discursive strategies that the radical social movement (RSM) of Russian lesbian feminism uses to shape its image among the out-group and in-group publics. To identify the strategies of RSM self-representation, we employ semi-structured interviewing, qualitative content analysis, discourse analysis, and semantic network visualization. We find that, in a hostile anti-LGBT legal and discursive environment, self-representation of lesbian feminists is mostly linked to issues of aggression, violence, and systemic social, political, and legal constraints, unlike in the United States; it is also based on separation from the wider society and dehumanization of bearers of patriarchal views.

AB  - Children with special needs such as those with autism spectrum disorder have been recorded as ostracized and stigmatized in many parts of the world. Little is known about whether such negative views are present among mainstream teachers in Oman. A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate school teachers' awareness about autism spectrum disorder in an urban region in Oman. A total of 164 teachers were randomly enrolled from five schools. Misconceptions about autism spectrum disorder were found to be common among mainstream teachers in the country. We posit that such lack of awareness was likely to be rooted with sociocultural patterning as well as conflicting views often spun by the scientific community and mass media. Enlightened views toward children with autism spectrum disorder should be presented to Omani teachers to overcome misconceptions and negative attitudes toward children with autism spectrum disorder.

AB  - Online reviews have become a significant information source for customers in decision-making. Such reviews are particularly important to firms like Airbnb as consumers have limited direct information regarding the quality of the property and the services. Researchers and practitioners, in general, favor positive reviews as they increase customers' booking intentions. However, this study theorizes that positive reviews could backfire and induce negative consequences under certain circumstances. More specifically, this research examines the interaction effects between the cause of an expectation disconfirmation and review dispersion on customers' attitudes and behavioral intention. Results indicated that when an expectation disconfirmation was caused by reviewers, participants showed more negative attitudes and lower intentions to spread positive WOM and repurchase when review dispersion was low (vs. high). In contrast, when the expectation disconfirmation was caused by property descriptions, participants reported similar responses regardless of review dispersion. Further, such interaction effects were mediated by perceived fairness.

AB  - - President Donald Trump (4/18/2018), Twitter- In three studies, we demonstrate that common metaphors used to describe immigrants in news media interact with national, but not political, identity to lead to feelings of disgust as well as anti-immigrant attitudes. The first study demonstrates that the current discourse in the U.S. surrounding unauthorized immigrants includes metaphors that readily activate thoughts of vermin (e.g., rodents). The second study shows that when these metaphors are present in a news article about immigrants, the more participants identify as American the more disgust they experience reading the article. The final study further shows that after reading a news article in which the vermin metaphors are present, the more participants identify as American the more likely they are to support stringent immigration policies. This research shows the power of metaphor to shape intergroup attitudes and support for government policies.

AB  - Aim The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships between turnover intention and related constructs in an abusive supervision climate. Background An abusive supervision climate is a work environment that is affected by the negative attitudes of an abusive supervisor. Method The constructs are chosen in light of upper echelons theory and social learning theory. The snowball sampling method is used to reach the participants, and 230 nurses working in Turkish hospitals participated in this survey that measured abusive supervision, workplace incivility and ostracism. Pearson's correlation analysis and multiple and hierarchical linear regression analyses are carried out. Results The results suggested that abusive supervision, workplace incivility and workplace bullying have a positive effect on turnover intention as hypothesized. Abusive supervision has a significant and positive effect on workplace incivility and workplace bullying. The partial mediating effects of workplace bullying, workplace incivility and workplace ostracism on the relationship between abusive supervision and turnover intention are also confirmed. Conclusion The significant relationships and the nonsignificant relationship provided evidence for an abusive supervision climate. Implications for Nursing Management Top managers of the health care facilities should attempt to determine the abusive supervisors to manage the work environment and turnover intention of nurses.

AB  - Most research with Muslim populations has been conducted with samples of immigrants living in the West as minority populations. This study investigates how the culture-related variables of family values and self-construal relate to religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services among Muslims living in Turkey, a country where over 99% of the population identifies as Muslim. To examine how these cultural variables may relate to attitudes toward psychological services, Muslim Turks completed a survey which included measures of religiosity, hierarchical and harmonious family values, cultural self-construal, and attitudes toward psychological services. Religiosity was associated with negative attitudes toward psychological services. The relationship between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was fully mediated by hierarchical family values such that when the variable hierarchical family values was added to the model, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was no longer significant. The mediation of hierarchical family values on the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services was moderated by independent self-construal, so that independent self-construal weakened the mediation while interdependent self-construal had no effect. The results of this study indicate that among Muslim Turks, the relation between religiosity and attitudes toward psychological services is more fully explained when culture-related variables are considered.

TI  - Dancing with decorum The eclectic usage of kalathiskos dancers and pyrrhic dancers in Roman visual culture
T2  - OPUSCULA-ANNUAL OF THE SWEDISH INSTITUTES AT ATHENS AND ROME
LA  - English
AB  - This article examines two groups of motifs in Roman visual culture: females modelled on kalathiskos dancers, and males modelled on pyrrhic dancers. Eclecticism is emphasized as a strategy which was used to introduce novelties that were appropriate within a Roman cultural context. The figures representing kalathiskos dancers and pyrrhic dancers were both changed in an eclectic manner and this resulted in motifs representing the goddess Victoria, and the curetes respectively. Kalathiskos dancers and eclectic Victoriae occur on many different media at least from the Augustan era and into the 2nd century AD. It is argued here that the establishment of these two motifs in Roman visual culture is closely related to the aesthetics which came to the fore during the reign of Augustus. Thereafter, both kalathiskos dancers and eclectic Victoriae lingered on in the Roman cultural context until many of the material categories on which they were depicted ceased to be produced Unlike the kalathiskos dancers, the male figures modelled on pyrrhic dancers are so rare within Roman visual culture that we can only assume they were, to some extent, perceived as an inappropriate motif. This can most likely be explained by the negative attitude, amongst the Roman elite, towards male dancing.

AB  - Background Social distancing and lockdowns were implemented during the first period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary care physicians needed to adapt quickly to deliver remote care/telemedicine. Methods A cross-sectional, 47-item online Google Survey was distributed through the Israel Association of Family Physicians (IAFP) mailing list between March 31-May 5, 2020. The questionnaire included demographics, physician characteristics, and information on usage and perceived telemedicine quality. Sampling weights by sex and age groups were applied. Results One hundred fifty-nine primary care physicians (10.6% of registered IAFP members; 63.5% women; mean age 53.4 +/- 10.4 years and median professional experience 21.3 years) replied to the survey. The majority (59.7%) of the participants performed a mixture of in-person along with phone counseling. About 40% had no former telemedicine experience. The majority indicated that telephone and video formats were inferior to in-person consultation (68%, 57.1% online and phone, respectively). The overall counseling quality grade (on a 1-10 scale,)median (IQR)) was 6.2 (3) for telephone and 7(2) for video. While 66.9% reported experiencing no challenges, 10% had technical problems, 10% interpersonal problems, 5.6% scheduling difficulties, and 7.5% other difficulties. Majority of 56.6% physicians indicated they prescribed more antibiotics,16.4% sent more blood tests, 24.5% referred more to experts, and 49.7% referred more to imaging in comparison to usual counseling. Higher phone quality score was significantly associated with physicians who indicated not prescribing more antibiotics during the pandemic (OR = 0.30, 95%CI 0.134-0.688, p = 0.004). Higher online quality score was associated with physicians who indicated not sending more blood tests during the pandemic (OR = 0.06 95%CI 0.008-0.378, P = 0.003). Conclusions Our findings suggest telehealth holds considerable promise for counseling in the primary care setting. However, interpersonal challenges raised by physicians should be understood in-depth to develop tailored training and further examine it in randomized trials while integrating patient-reported outcomes. Finally, further research on utility, cost, and cost-efficiency during remote counseling with follow-ups, medical prescribing, and additional referrals is needed.

AB  - Background
   According to the World Health Organization, viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue for public health. The elderly and those with underlying chronic diseases are more likely to become severe cases. Our study sets out to present in-depth exploration and analyses of the community's risk perception and barriers to the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in South Gondar Zone, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods
   A qualitative study was done in three districts of South Gondar Zone. Community key informants and health extension workers were selected purposely for in-depth interviews and focus group discussion. The interviews were conducted by maintaining WHO recommendations for social distancing and use of appropriate personal protective equipment. The sample size for the study depended on the theoretical saturation of the data at the time of data collection. The qualitative data generated from in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was transcribed verbatim and translated into English language and thematically analyzed using open code software version 4.02.
   Results
   Three main themes and five categories emerged from the narrations of the participants regarding the perceived barriers for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures. A total of 9 community key informants (5 women development armies (HDA), 2 health extension workers (HEW), and 2 religious leaders participated in the in-depth interview, while two focus group discussions (7 participants in each round) were conducted among purposely selected community members. The age of the participants ranged from 24 to 70 years with the median age of 48 years. The major identified barriers for practicing COVID-19 prevention measures were the presence of strong cultural and religious practices, perceiving that the disease does not affect the young, misinformation about the disease, and lack of trust in the prevention measures.
   Conclusions
   Socio-cultural, religious, and economic related barriers were identified from the participant's narratives for the practice of COVID-19 prevention measures in south Gondar Zone. Our findings suggest the need to strengthen community awareness and education programs about the prevention measures of COVID-19 and increase diagnostic facilities with strong community-based surveillance to control the transmission of the pandemic.Y

AB  - Purpose of Study: The purpose of this paper is to describe Turkish Language and History Candidate teachers' use of metaphors in their perception of a computer and to explore the meanings attached to this concept, as well as to collect data related to the nature of a computer.
   Problem Statement: According to literature review, in Turkey and North Cyprus, teachers' positive attitude towards computer and computer-assisted teaching indicates teachers cannot use but want to use computers, which is an important problem deserving further researches. In-depth studies on this topic have to be conducted to reveal the meanings attached by teachers to computers. So, the problem sentence of this study was determined as "What are the mental images of Turkish and history candidate teachers related to the concept of a computer?"
   Method: In this qualitative study, phenomenology design has been taken as the basis. Results are presented in a descriptive exposition and direct citations are made frequently. The participants of the study were determined with purposive sampling method and convenient case sampling was taken as the basis. Thus, the participants of the study are 128 students studying at departments of Turkish Language Teaching and History Teaching at 2011-2012 spring semester at Near East University. The data was analyzed through content analysis and in 4 stages: coding and elimination, sample metaphor compilation, category development and validation and verification stages.
   Findings and Results: Participants used 47 different mental images related to the concept of a computer. The two most frequently used mental images are "brain" and "human", respectively. Findings of the study revealed that the mental images of a computer are grouped under 3 categories with 81 of the participants (65.3%) choosing the function of a computer as its basis, 41 (33%) describing its value, and 2 (1.7%) its physical structure. Evaluating subcategories, it can be seen that emphasis on the "function" category was the computer providing access to information (30.6%), giving assistance and making life easier (23.3%), and providing social-emotional support (11.4%). When the "value" category is considered, it is demonstrated that a computer is a risky tool with troublemaking potential (14.5%), is open to change (7.2%), has a range from powerful-weak (5.6%), is a vital need (4%), and also has a range from endless-infinite (1.7%). Finally, 2 participants (1.7%) described the computer as a physical structure dimension.
   Conclusions and Recommendations: The negative values developed by teachers and candidate teachers must be turned into positive so that computers can be used in education. What has to be done is display all problems such as copy-paste, ready-made, pornography and misleading information etc., informing pedagogues about these issues and educating them on how to deal with these problems. Teachers mentioned about the existence of wrong information on computers and on the internet media. In this case it can be recommended that technology-assisted history and Turkish language courses be added to the undergraduate curriculum. Thus, critical examination of web sites related to each lecture, evaluation of education CDs and preparation of new and qualified education CDs with projects must be supported.

AB  - We analyze President Trump's Twitter posts on the COVID-19 pandemic to quantitatively construct his sentiment proxy to examine its predictive power in industry-level equity returns. With the growing influence of social media, some "special" people have been able to use their celebrity status for wielding significant market influence, thereby causing a new modern crisis. This study parsed words from 2574 tweets from President Trump's Twitter account to explore the predictive power of his sentiments on the US market during the pandemic. After controlling for rigorous factors, result shows that an industry-level negative tone in general content is unlikely to be predictive of stock returns. Furthermore, the consumer goods industry exhibited a negative return when Trump displayed a negative attitude toward the pandemic. Industries adversely affected by the pandemic because of travel restrictions, consumption shocks, and public health issues are statistically correlated with Trump's negative tone on the pandemic.

AB  - This study examined the consequences of negative change in mothers' implicit appraisals of their adolescents after engaging in a family disagreement. Participants included 194 mothers and their early adolescents (M-age = 12.4 at Wave 1; 50% female) followed over 1 year. Mothers' implicit appraisals of her child as "unlovable" were assessed using the Go/No-Go Association Task-Child (Sturge-Apple, Rogge, Skibo, et al., 2015), an associative word-sorting task, before and after engaging in a family conflict task. Mothers' implicit appraisals, on average, did not become more negative following conflicts with their teen. However, substantial variability was evident, suggesting that important individual differences exist in mothers' cognitive reactivity to conflict. Greater susceptibility to implicit change predicted more harsh and insensitive parenting in response to their adolescents' bids for support 1 year later. This effect held over and above mothers' emotional reactivity to the conflict, their explicit negative attitudes about their adolescent, and maternal harshness at Time 1. Harsh and insensitive parenting, in turn, mediated the link between maternal implicit reactivity and subsequent increases in adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems. The results suggest that individual differences in maternal susceptibility to changes in implicit appraisals following conflictual interactions serve as a unique determinant of parenting in adolescence.

AB  - Cancer survivors treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplant rely on their social network for successful recovery. However, some survivors have negative attitudes about using social resources (negative social network orientation) that are critical for their recovery.
   We examined the association between survivors' social network orientation and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and whether it was mediated by social resources (network size, perceived support, and negative and positive support-related social exchanges).
   In a longitudinal study, 255 survivors completed validated measures of social network orientation, HRQoL, and social resources. Hypotheses were tested using path analysis.
   More negative social network orientation predicted worse HRQoL (p < .001). This association was partially mediated by lower perceived support and more negative social exchanges.
   Survivors with negative social network orientation may have poorer HRQoL in part due to deficits in several key social resources. Findings highlight a subgroup at risk for poor transplant outcomes and can guide intervention development.

AB  - The existence of a gap between public preferences for more restrictive immigration policies and relatively expansive immigration policy in Western democracies has received considerable attention. Sometimes, this gap has been explained by the nature of immigration policies: dominated by elites while the public remained uninterested. In many countries, however, immigration has gained considerable salience among the public. There are competing expectations and accounts relating to whether policy-makers ignore or follow public demands on immigration. In this article we examine the potential drivers of variations in the opinion-policy gap on immigration in seven countries (1995-2010). We analyse the effect of the politicisation of immigration on this opinion-policy gap. The strength of anti-immigrant parties is unrelated to the opinion-policy gap on immigration. The salience of the issue and the intensity of the public debate are associated with the opinion-policy gap, and the combination of negative attitudes with extensive media coverage seems particularly conducive to policy congruence.

AB  - The modern socio-political climate is defined by conflict between ethnic, religious and political groups: Bosnians and Serbs, Tamils and Singhalese, Irish Catholics and Protestants, Israelis and Arabs. One impediment to the resolution of these conflicts is the psychological bias that members of each group harbor towards each other. These biases, and their neural bases, are likely different from the commonly studied biases towards racial outgroups. We presented Arab, Israeli and control individuals with statements about the Middle East from the perspective of the ingroup or the outgroup. Subjects rated how 'reasonable' each statement was, during fMRI imaging. Increased activation in the precuneus (PC) while reading pro-outgroup vs. pro-ingroup statements correlated strongly with both explicit and implicit measures of negative attitudes towards the outgroup; other brain regions that were involved in reasoning about emotionally-laden information did not show this pattern.

AB  - There is currently controversy surrounding the effectiveness of universal versus selective prevention in eating disorders (ED). The present study aims at evaluating the effectiveness of universal school-based ED prevention administered to female secondary school students (n = 349). Students received either the full prevention programme (learning basic concepts of nutrition, criticism of aesthetic models of beauty emphasising extreme thinness, media literacy (ML)), a partial version of the programme (without nutritional education), or no prevention programme. Students were also classified oil the presence or absence of distinct risk factors for ED: Early menarche, overweight, dieting, negative attitudes to food and perceived pressure to be thin. Pre-test data were collected I week prior to implementation of the prevention programme, and post-test data were collected on the last day of the programme. Results suggested that both the full and partial prevention programmes reduced perceived pressure to be thin and improved eating attitudes and knowledge of nutrition in all the participants (regardless of risk); however, greater effect sizes were found among particular high-risk groups (early menarche, overweight and highly influenced by aesthetic models of beauty emphasising extreme thinness). School-based programmes of universal intervention may have ail important role to play in the prevention of ED. Copyright (C) 2009 John Wiley & Soils, Ltd and Eating Disorders Association.

AB  - Fiction is often credited with shaping public attitudes to science, but little science communication research has studied fans' deep engagement with a science-themed fiction text. This study used a survey to investigate the impacts of television series Doctor Who (1963-89; 2005-present) on its viewers' attitudes to science, including their education and career choices and ideas about science ethics and the science-society relationship. The program's reported impacts ranged from causing participants to fact-check Doctor Who's science to inspiring them to pursue a science career, or, more commonly, prompting viewers to think broadly and deeply about science's social position in diverse ways.

AB  - Do military endorsements influence Americans' political and foreign policy views? We find that senior military officers have the ability to nudge public attitudes under certain conditions. Through a series of large, survey-based experiments, with nearly 12,000 completed interviews from national samples, we find that participants respond to survey questions in predictable ways depending on whether they have been prompted with information about the views of senior military leaders on the very same questions. When told that senior military leaders oppose particular interventions abroad, public opposition to that intervention increases; endorsements of support boost public support but by a smaller magnitude. Subsequent causal mediation analysis suggests that military opinion influences public opinion primarily through its impact on a mission's perceived legitimacy and, to a lesser degree, it's perceived likelihood of success.

AB  - Assessing risk for transmission of a blood-borne pathogen requires the use of the hazard and risk model. Infection control is a system that uses a number of individual processes to eliminate or reduce the probability of a hazard occurring. Strategies employed to reduce risk should be rehearsed, used routinely, audited, reviewed, and the results shared. Continuing dental education has improved dental healthcare worker willingness to treat people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) and has decreased negative attitudes and staff fears. Providing care for PLWHA during undergraduate dental school or dental hygiene programme is also associated with a greater willingness to treat. Whether by identifying suspect oral lesions or offering rapid screening tests in the dental setting for HIV, the dental team can play an important role in linkage to confirmatory diagnosis and care with the goal of reducing to zero the number of undiagnosed cases.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions generate public interest and attract substantial media attention. This becomes particularly interesting in regions where different languages are used by media reports, creating the opportunity to investigate associations between language and the perspectives presented in the reports. In this article, we used 207 English articles (from 2006 to 2019) and 721 Chinese articles (from 2016 to 2019) on human-wild boar interactions in Hong Kong to analyze the gaps and differences in how the interactions are presented in the Chinese and English language media. Although English and Chinese news reporting on interactions follow similar geographical patterns, they differed significantly in terms of the content included, the identity of interviewees, the management strategies mentioned and the reported causes of "conflict." The distinct presentation of human-wild boar interactions in English and Chinese news has the potential to contribute to diverging public attitudes toward the wild boar and policy development.

AB  - Majority-group members often hold negative attitudes toward minority-group members who identify with both the majority and their minority group. Integrating perspectives from social identity theory and acculturation research with a coalitional psychology framework. we show that an underlying mechanism for such bias is the perception that dual identifiers are disloyal to the majority group. In Study I. majority-group participants in the U.S. questioned the loyalty of a dually identified Arab immigrant more than one who identified solely with the (American) majority group, especially under intergroup threat, which in turn predicted less favorable feelings toward the immigrant. Study 2 conceptually replicated the effect of the identity manipulation and the mediating influence of perceived loyalty on judgments about an immigrant being allowed to enlist in the U.S. military. Study 3, partially replicated the findings in Poland, focusing on Russian immigrants as targets. In Study 4. which independently manipulated both the identity expressed by immigrants and their loyalty, a dually identified immigrant whose loyalty to the majority group was portrayed as high was not judged as less qualified than an immigrant who identified only with the majority group for jobs with the potential to inflict damage on the majority group. Study 5, replicated and extended the previous studies in the context of fans of allied or rival soccer teams in Germany, revealing the moderating role of existing group relations on the hypothesized loyalty processes. In summary, coalitionally driven perceptions of (dis)loyalty appear to undergird bias toward minority-group members who hold dual identifications.

Methods: The study is based on the examination of the units of analysis that present Islamophobia through a system of deductive or predefined frames, and inductive frames, which emerge from reading the texts. Specifically, 428 journalistic pieces are examined through an analysis of quantitative content, and twenty-two editorials based on a qualitative content analysis. Results and conclusions: The results reveal that Islamophobia, when it does appear, does so in a subtle way. Moreover, it concentrates as much on political Islamism as on discourses that subscribe to the incompatibility between Islam and democracy, or the backwardness and homogeneity of the Arab-Islamic world with respect to Western superiority.

AB  - Background: Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing, self-quarantining, wearing masks, and washing hands have become part of the new norm for many, but not all. It appears that such preventive measures are critical to "flattening the curve" of the spread of COVID-19. The public's adoption of such behaviors is an essential component in the battle against what has been referred to as the "invisible enemy."
   Objective: The primary objective of this study was to develop a model for predicting COVID-19 preventive behaviors among US college students. The Health Belief Model has a long history of use and empirical support in predicting preventive health behaviors, but it is not without its purported shortcomings. This study identifies a more optimal and defensible combination of variables to explain preventive behaviors among college students. This segment of the US population is critical in helping slow the spread of COVID-19 because of the relative reluctance of college students to perform the needed behaviors given they do not feel susceptible to or fearful of COVID-19.
   Methods: For this study, 415 US college students were surveyed via Qualtrics and asked to answer questions regarding their fear of COVID-19, information receptivity (seeking relevant information), perceived knowledge of the disease, self-efficacy, and performance of preventive behaviors. The PROCESS macro (Model 6) was used to test our conceptual model, including predictions involving sequential mediation.
   Results: Sequential mediation results show that fear of COVID-19 leads individuals to seek out information regarding the disease, which increases their perceived knowledge and fosters self-efficacy; this is key to driving preventive behaviors.
   Conclusions: Self-imposed preventive measures can drastically impact the rate of infection among populations. Based on this study's newly created sequential mediation model, communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 preventive behaviors are offered. It is clear that college students, and very possibly adults of all ages, must have a healthy fear of COVID-19 to set in motion a process where concerned individuals seek out COVID-19-related information, increasing their store of knowledge concerning the disease, their self-efficacy, and ultimately their likelihood of performing the needed preventive behaviors.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has forced parents across the United States to quickly transition to a new way of living. These transitions present new stressors, including the stress associated with physical health, with the demands of social distancing placed on families, and with the possibility of losing a job or not being able to pay bills. Such stressors have the potential to disrupt basic functioning, such as sleep and daily energy levels. Furthermore, the impact of stress might have repercussions on parents' capacities to be psychologically flexible, thus putting their psychological functioning at risk. Drawing upon a contextual behavioral science perspective, the current study sought to examine links between COVID-19-related stressors and psychological flexibility/inflexibility through such basic processes as parents' perceived sleep quality and daily energy level.
   Methods: A total of 1003 parents (97% from the US; 74% female; M = 40.9 years old, SD = 8.5) of children (ages 5-18) completed an online survey from the end of March to the end of April of 2020.
   Results: Path analyses suggested that, after controlling health-related stress and the stress of work and parenting demands due to the pandemic directly predicting greater inflexibility and lower inflexibility, two mediation paths emerged. Specifically, higher levels of health-related stress were associated with lower levels of energy, which, in turn predicted lower levels of psychological flexibility. In addition, higher levels of health-related stress were associated with lower perceived sleep quality, which, in turn, was associated with higher levels of psychological inflexibility. In secondary analyses on the specific dimensions of flexibility and inflexibility, results suggested that lower energy levels indirectly linked health-related stress to lower levels of all 6 dimensions of flexibility and poorer sleep quality indirectly linked health-related stress to higher levels of self-as-content, fusion, and inaction.
   Conclusions: The stressors associated with COVID-19 pandemic have the potential to disrupt parents' perceived sleep quality and daily energy levels, reducing their abilities to respond to difficult or challenging experiences in a flexible manner and instead promoting more reactive and inflexible responses.

AB  - Rationale: Many people overestimate the amount of alcohol that increases their risk of harm and so may not perceive any need to change their drinking behaviour. Several countries have developed low-risk drinking guidelines, yet awareness of these guidelines remains low. Furthermore, mass media campaigns about alcohol-related harms may have limited impact if people do not perceive their current consumption as potentially harmful. Integrating drinking guidelines into media campaigns about alcohol's harms can concurrently provide drinkers with information about low-risk drinking levels and compelling reasons to comply.
   Objective: Our aim was to build understanding of the effectiveness of messages about the long-term harms of drinking and low-risk drinking guidelines, by testing the mediating effects of estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol on subsequent intentions and behaviours.
   Method: In an online experiment conducted in 2016, n = 1156 Australian adult monthly drinkers were randomly assigned to view advertisements for non-alcohol products (NON-ALC; control), advertisements featuring long-term harms of alcohol (LTH), or LTH advertisements plus a guideline message (LTH + G). Immediately following exposure, we measured estimates of harmful drinking levels and attitudes towards drinking alcohol. One week later, we measured intentions to drink less and behavioural compliance with the guideline.
   Results: Compared to NON-ALC advertisements, exposure to LTH + G advertisements increased (i) the proportion of respondents who correctly estimated harmful drinking levels, which in turn, strengthened intentions to drink less (42% of the total effect was mediated), and (ii) negative attitudes, which in turn, also increased intentions to drink less (35% mediated) and behavioural compliance (24% mediated). Compared to NON-ALC, LTH advertisements increased negative attitudes, which in turn strengthened intentions to drink less (53% mediated).
   Conclusions: When paired with effective alcohol harm reduction television advertisements, messages promoting low-risk drinking guidelines can increase drinkers' intentions to reduce their alcohol consumption and compliance with low-risk drinking guidelines.

AB  - Older adults can frequently serve as a reminder of death to younger adults. People can develop a negative attitude towards aging and elderliness because they see old age as an obstacle in reaching their goals and what they want to do, which they see as the purpose of their lives. This research was conducted to answer to the question of whether attitudes towards aging and elderliness have a mediating role in the relationship between meaning and purpose of life and death anxiety. Relational screening model was used in the research. The research was conducted with 422 participants between the ages of 18-59. In the analysis of the data, Pearson Correlation Analysis and Regression analysis were performed. In addition, Hayes Macro was used in SPSS program to analyze the mediator variable effect. As a result, it was determined that the attitude towards aging had a significant mediator role in the effect of the meaning and purpose of life on death anxiety. It was found that there was a moderate positive correlation between the attitude towards aging and elderliness and death anxiety, a moderate negative correlation between the attitude towards aging and elderliness and the meaning and purpose of life, and a weak negative correlation between death anxiety and the meaning and purpose of life.

AB  - This work utilizes data from Twitter to mine association rules and extract knowledge about public attitudes regarding worldwide crises. It exploits the COVID-19 pandemic as a use case, and analyzes tweets gathered between February and August 2020. The proposed methodology comprises topic extraction and visualization techniques, such as WordClouds, to form clusters or themes of opinions. It then uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover frequent wordsets and generate rules that infer to user attitudes. The goal is to utilize ARM as a postprocessing technique to enhance the output of any topic extraction method. Therefore, only strong wordsets are stored after discarding trivia ones. We also employ frequent wordset identification to reduce the number of extracted topics. Our findings showcase that 50 initially retrieved topics are narrowed down to just 4, when combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation with ARM. Our methodology facilitates producing more accurate and generalizable results, whilst exposing implications regarding social media user attitudes. (C) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To test a possible boundary condition for the risk information seeking and processing (RISP) model, this study experimentally manipulates risk perception related to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in a nationally representative sample. Multiple-group structural equation modeling results indicate that psychological distance was negatively related to systematic processing in the high-risk condition. In the low-risk condition, psychological distance was positively related to heuristic processing; negative attitude toward media coverage dampened people's need for information, which subsequently influenced information processing. Risk perception elicited more fear, which led to greater information insufficiency and more heuristic processing in the low-risk condition. In contrast, sadness was consistently related to information processing in both conditions. Model fit statistics also show that the RISP model provides a better fit to data when risk perception is elevated. Further, this study contributes to our understanding of the role of discrete emotions in motivating information processing.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic brought unforeseen challenges that could forever change the way societies prioritize and deal with public health issues. The approaches to contain the spread of the virus have entailed governments issuing recommendations on social distancing, lockdowns to restrict movements, and suspension of services.
   Objective: There are concerns that the COVID-19 crisis and the measures adopted by countries in response to the pandemic may have led to an upsurge in violence against children. Added stressors placed on caregivers, economic uncertainty, job loss or disruption to livelihoods and social isolation may have led to a rise in children's experience of violence in the home. Extended online presence by children may have resulted in increased exposure to abusive content and cyberbullying.
   Participants and setting: This study uses testimonial-based and conversational-based data collected from social media users.
   Methods: Conversations on Twitter were reviewed to measure increases in abusive or hateful content, and cyberbullying, while testimonials from Reddit forums were examined to monitor changes in references to family violence before and after the start of the stay-at-home restrictions. Results: Violence-related subreddits were among the topics with the highest growth after the COVID-19 outbreak. The analysis of Twitter data shows a significant increase in abusive content generated during the stay-at-home restrictions.
   Conclusions: The collective experience of the COVID-19 pandemic and related containment measures offers insights into the wide-ranging risks that children are exposed to in times of crisis. As societies shift towards a new normal, which places emerging technology, remote working and online learning at its center, and in anticipation of similar future threats, governments and other stakeholders need to put in place measures to protect children from violence.

AB  - This study focuses on public opinion towards the face veiling of Muslim women and investigates the possibility of identifying different groups of citizens supporting distinct combinations of arguments regarding face veiling criticisms. Two groups are expected to argue for or against face veiling. Also, two other groups are expected to vary depending on their idea of liberalism inherent in face-veiling arguments: a specific way of life versus respect for different ways of life. Using latent class (regression) analysis, the findings show that different groups emerged and that the political leftists were more diverse regarding argument patterns than the political rightists. Following the debate of why many political leftists have negative attitudes towards religious practices, this study does not find empirical support that anti-Muslim and anti-Islam attitudes systematically differ between the observed groups.

AB  - While scientific consensus and political and media messages appear to be increasingly certain, public attitudes and action towards the issue do not appear to be following suit. Popular and academic debate often assumes this is due to ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of the public, but some studies have suggested political beliefs and values may play a more important role in determining belief versus scepticism about climate change. The current research used two representative postal surveys of the UK public to: measure scepticism and uncertainty about climate change; determine how scepticism varies according to individual characteristics, knowledge and values; and examine how scepticism has changed over time. Findings show denial of climate change is less common than the perception that the issue has been exaggerated. Scepticism was found to be strongly determined by individuals' environmental and political values (and indirectly by age, gender, location and lifestyle) rather than by education or knowledge. Between 2003 and 2008, public uncertainty about climate change has remained remarkably constant, although belief that claims about the issue are exaggerated has doubled over that period. These results are interpreted with reference to psychological concepts of motivated reasoning, confirmation bias and 'finite pool of worry'. Implications for communication and policy are discussed.

AB  - In our study we investigated how individualizing and binding moral foundations partially mediate the relationship between the attitudinal clusters of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO), and the dimensions of generalized prejudice. We found that binding moral foundations partially mediate the association between RWA and negative attitudes towards dissident and dangerous groups, while individualizing moral foundations had a positive relationship with the evaluations of all three clusters of dissident, dangerous, and derogated outgroups, and partially mediated the effects of both SDO and RWA. Based on these results we claim that intergroup attitudes are at least partly determined by moral concerns, and different personal needs activate or inhibit different moral concerns. Furthermore, while individualizing moral foundations seem to have a universal prejudice reducing effect, the effect of binding foundations is selective, increasing prejudice principally against dangerous and derogated outgroups that threaten one's personal need for security and certainty.

AB  - During the 2016-2017 season, several NFL players started kneeling during the national anthem as a protest against institutional racism. These actions sparked considerable public controversy and polarized attitudes toward the protests. Two explanations were raised in the media for differences in attitudes: sensitivity to racial inequality and respect for tradition. We examined the extent to which these explanations, as assessed by ethnocentrism and right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), respectively, accounted for attitudes toward the protests in a sample of white, U.S. college students (N = 294). When examined as simultaneous predictors, RWA, but not ethnocentrism, predicted more negative attitudes toward the protests. These findings suggest that attitudes toward the protests may have been based more on how the protest was enacted (respect for tradition), rather than the topic of the protest (racial inequality).

AB  - Why do essentialist beliefs promote prejudice? We proposed that essentialist beliefs increase prejudice toward Black people because they imply that existing social hierarchies reflect a naturally occurring structure. We tested this hypothesis in three studies (N = 621). Study 1 revealed that racial essentialism was associated with increased prejudice toward Blacks among both White and Black adult participants, suggesting that essentialism relates to prejudice according to social hierarchy rather than only to group membership. Studies 2 and 3 experimentally demonstrated that increasing essentialist beliefs induced stronger endorsement of social hierarchies in both Black and White participants, which in turn mediated the effect of essentialism on negative attitudes toward Black people. Together, these findings suggest that essentialism increases prejudice toward low-status groups by increasing endorsement of social hierarchies and existing inequality.

AB  - Purpose - This research aims to investigate effect of consumer creativity on their evaluations of brands. Consumers' creative participation is often used by online retailers as a promotional tool nowadays. The authors propose that consumer creativity exerts a positive impact on brand attitudes by affecting their attitudes toward the creative activity itself. Furthermore, consumer creativity moderates the effect of consumers' perceived level of fit on their acceptance of brand extensions, such that creative consumers will show a higher level of acceptance of distant brand extensions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors test their hypotheses in three laboratory experiments. Study 1 examines the effect of consumer creativity on brand evaluations. Study 2 explores the moderating effect of consumer creativity on perceived level of fit on acceptance of brand extensions. Study 3 replicates the authors findings in Studies 1 and 2 using a better representative sample and a different type of creative task.
   Findings - Study 1 finds that consumer creativity results in a positive attitude toward brand; this effect is mediated by attitude toward the creative activity. Study 2 shows that creativity leads to a greater level of brand acceptance when the brand extension has a low fit with the focal brand. Study 3 further provides evidence of proposed effects using a different type of creative task with a more representative sample.
   Research limitations/implications - In the experiments, this study examined three types of online creative marketing communication activities. Future research could examine other types of consumer creative activities so as to enhance the generalizability of the findings.
   Practical implications - Our results provide important implications for firms that intend to exploit the promises of online creativity-themed marketing communications. First, because consumers' attitudes toward the focal brand hinge on their attitudes toward the creative activity, it is important that firms design their creativity-themed activities carefully, so that they are attractive to the users. Second, firms can exploit the creativity edge by launching new brand extensions that target creative consumers. This effect is even more pronounced when the brand extension exhibits a low fit with the focal brand. These guidelines suggest that firms' investments in online creativity-themed marketing communications can pay off in terms of improved consumers' attitudes toward the firms' brands and brand extensions.
   Originality/value - This research makes several theoretical contributions. First, the authors explore the important role of creativity in the context of brand attitudes and brand extensions. This study adds to extant consumer creativity literature by documenting the consequences of consumer creativity in terms of positive outcomes for firms. Second, by examining the mediating effect of attitude toward the creativity task, the authors broaden the scope of attitude-toward-the-site and attitude-toward-the-sponsorship-event research to the online marketing communications setting. Third, by showing that consumer creativity can facilitate the acceptance of distant brand extensions, this study also enriches extant brand extension literature.

AB  - Author summary The ups and downs of dengue cases require the Outdoor Residual Spraying (ORS) technique as an alternative method to control dengue in Malaysia. However, the introduction of ORS depends on stakeholders' acceptance. Here, the purpose of this study was to determine the factors that predict attitude to ORS and the role of religiosity as a moderator. The results indicate positive responses for implementing the ORS as a suitable technique to control dengue in Malaysia. Perceived benefit emerged as the most significant direct predictor of attitude towards the ORS (beta = 0.618, p<0.001), which they viewed this technique as less risky. Trust in key players had a significant positive relationship with attitudes towards the ORS that makes this factor the second most important direct predictor (beta = 0.151, p<0.001). Interestingly, the religiosity factor significantly moderated the relationship between perceived benefit and risk with attitudes towards the ORS. This study also showed the role played by both perceived benefit and risk as mediating factors.
   Outdoor Residual Spraying (ORS) technique is a complementary preventive measure for dengue. The alarming number of dengue cases in Malaysia requires an alternative method to control dengue besides the traditional method such as fogging. However, the introduction of new technologies depends on social acceptance. Therefore, this study was important to determine the factors that influence stakeholders' attitudes towards the ORS and the moderating factor. A validated instrument was used to randomly interview 399 respondents representing two stakeholder groups which consist of scientists, and the public in Klang Valley, Malaysia. The findings revealed that the stakeholders claimed to have a high degree of religiosity, a high level of trust in the key players, perceived ORS as having high benefits, and displayed highly positive attitudes towards the ORS. The attitudes model towards the ORS model was developed using the SmartPLS software version. The perceived benefit was endorsed as the most important direct predictor of attitudes towards the ORS (ss = 0.618, P<0.001), followed by trust in the key players (ss = 0.151, P<0.001). It is also interesting to note that religiosity served as a moderator for the association between perceived benefit (ss = 0.075, P = 0.024) and perceived risk (ss = 0.114, P = 0.006) with attitudes towards the ORS. The identified predictor factors of stakeholders' attitudes toward the ORS and the moderating factor can serve as indicators for social acceptance of ORS in developing countries. These indicators can help the policymakers in decision making to implement this technique.

TI  - Public perception of genetically-modified (GM) food: A Nationwide Chinese Consumer Study
T2  - NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD
LA  - English
AB  - After more than 25 years of research and development on the genetic modification of a wide range of crops for food and fodder, China has reached a decision point as to whether it should accept, reject, or go slow with the use of genetically modified (GM) technology to produce the food and feed needed to sustain its population growth and economic renaissance. Here, we report a consumer survey on GM food that includes input from all provinces in China. Chinese consumers were surveyed for their awareness, knowledge, and opinion on GM food. The survey resulted in 11.9, 41.4, and 46.7% of respondents having a positive, neutral, or negative view on GM food, respectively. A minority of respondents (11.7%) claimed they understood the basic principles of GM technology, while most were either "neutral" or "unfamiliar with GM technology". Most respondents (69.3%) obtained their information on GM food through the Internet and 64.3% of respondents thought that media coverage was predominately negative on GM food. The reasons given by consumers in favor of, or against, the use of GM food, were complex, as seen by the response of 13.8% of respondents who felt GM technology was a form of bioterrorism targeted at China. China's Ministry of Agriculture and the science community generally expressed a positive attitude toward GM food, but the percentage of respondents that trusted the government and scientists was only 11.7 and 23.2%, respectively. Post-survey comments of respondents made suggestions on how the industrialization of GM technology might impact the future of China's food supply and value chains. Finally, the impact of emerging technologies like genome editing and genome-edited organisms (GEOs) on the GM food debate is discussed.
   Food safety: Inadequate knowledge underlies public scepticism about GM food Chinese consumers generally have limited understanding about genetically modified (GM) technology and this may explain their negative views about GM food. In a nationwide survey that covers all provinces of China, Kai Cui from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in China studied public awareness, knowledge and opinions on GM food with colleagues. They found that most respondents hardly understand the basic principles of GM technology and are concerned about the safety of GM food. While respondents, in general, have a relatively low level of trust about information from the government or even scientists, the internet becomes the major source of information about GM food and technology, and the media coverage is perceived as predominantly negative. The results highlight the importance of strengthening communication and respecting public opinions for future development of GM technology in China.

AB  - Data from a self-report survey of 400 homeless street youths are used to explore the relationship between self-control and negative orientations towards the police. The study examines whether the relationship is direct and/or mediated through its association with deviant attitudes, criminal peers, police contacts, criminal behaviour, and homelessness factors found in past research to have been linked to young people's attitudes towards police. Findings reveal that self-control is directly associated with negative attitudes towards the police. This relationship is mediated by deviant attitudes, criminal peers, police contacts, and criminal participation. The study shows the importance of recognizing both the direct and the indirect relationship of self-control with attitudes towards police in marginal populations as well as specifying the continued importance of various street life factors in understanding the way youth perceive the police.

AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

AB  - Commentators on Milgram's classic and controversial experiments agree that better integration of theories of obedience to authority with current archival research on participants' viewpoints is essential in explaining compliance. Using conversation analysis, we examine an archived data source that is largely overlooked by the Milgram literature, yet crucial for understanding the interactional organization of participants' displayed perspectives. In hundreds of interviews conducted immediately after each experiment, participants received one of two types of debriefing: deceptive or full. Analyzing 56 full debriefings from three experimental conditions, we find they featured interactional structuring as news delivery sequences and that debriefing news could transform initially ambivalent or negative assessments of the experiment into positive ones. Such findings reveal limitations of engaged followership, the currently dominant theory of obedience. Following discussion of improved assessments' relevance to public attitudes toward science, we conclude that multiple social psychological processes were at work in producing Milgram's results.

AB  - Objectives The objective was to provide a longitudinal assessment of anxiety levels and work and home concerns of U.S. emergency physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods We performed a longitudinal, cross-sectional email survey of clinically active emergency physicians (attending, fellow, and resident) at seven academic emergency departments. Follow-up surveys were sent 4 to 6 weeks after the initial survey and assessed the following: COVID-19 patient exposure, availability of COVID-19 testing, levels of home and workplace anxiety/stress, changes in behaviors, and performance on a primary care posttraumatic stress disorder screen (PC-PTSD-5). Logistic regression explored factors associated with a high PC-PTSD-5 scale score (>= 3), indicating increased risk for PTSD.
   Results Of the 426 surveyed initial respondents, 262 (61.5%) completed the follow-up survey. While 97.3% (255/262) reported treating suspected COVID-19 patients, most physicians (162/262, 61.8%) had not received testing themselves. In follow-up, respondents were most concerned about the relaxing of social distancing leading to a second wave (median score = 6, IQR = 4-7). Physicians reported a consistently high ability to order COVID-19 tests for patients (median score = 6, IQR = 5-7) and access to personal protective equipment (median score = 6, IQR = 5-6). Women physicians were more likely to score >= 3 than men on the PC-PTSD-5 screener on the initial survey (43.3% vs. 22.5%; Delta 20.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 9.3% to 31.5%), and despite decreases in overall proportions, this discrepancy remained in follow-up (34.7% vs. 16.8%; Delta 17.9%, 95% CI = 7.1% to 28.1%). In examining the relationship between demographics, living situations, and institution location on having a PC-PTSD-5 score >= 3, only female sex was associated with a PC-PTSD-5 score >= 3 (adjusted odds ratio = 2.48, 95% CI = 1.28 to 4.79).
   Conclusions While exposure to suspected COVID-19 patients was nearly universal, stress levels in emergency physicians decreased with time. At both initial and follow-up assessments, women were more likely to test positive on the PC-PTSD-5 screener compared to men.

AB  - This research examined the effects of the labels "fat" vs. "overweight" in the expression of weight bias, with the prediction that the label "fat" biases individuals to respond more negatively than does the label "overweight." In Study 1, participants' attitudes toward people labeled as fat were less favorable than were their attitudes toward people labeled as overweight. In Studies 2 and 3, although participants chose similar-sized figures to depict fat and overweight targets, weight stereotypes and weight attitudes were more negative toward people labeled as fat than those labeled as overweight. In addition, the endorsement of weight stereotypes mediated the biasing effect of the "fat" label on weight prejudice. Implications of this work for prejudice researchers and for public attitudes are discussed.

AB  - Making sound food and agriculture decisions is important for global society and the environment. Experts tend to view crop genetic engineering, a technology that can improve yields and minimize impacts on the environment, more favorably than the public. Because there is a causal relationship between public opinion and public policy, it is important to understand how opinions about genetically engineered (GE) crops are influenced. The public increasingly seeks science information on the Internet. Here, semantic network analysis is performed to characterize the presentation of the term "GMO (genetically modified organism)," a proxy for food developed from GE crops, on the web. Texts from three sources are analyzed: U.S. federal websites, top pages from a Google search, and online news titles. We found that the framing and sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative attitudes) of "GMO" varies across these sources. It is described how differences in the portrayal of GE food by each source might affect public opinion. A current understanding of the types of information individuals may encounter online can provide insight into public opinion toward GE food. In turn, this knowledge can guide teaching and communication efforts by the scientific community to promote informed decision-making about agricultural biotechnologies.

AB  - The Province of Ontario is aggressively pursuing renewable energy development, but not without significant turbulence. Ontario's Green Energy Act (2009) reflects this aggressive pursuit, and is aimed at making the province a global leader in renewable energy development. Wind energy is an integral but controversial part of these commitments. While several installations have been built or announced, conflicts surrounding the development of the technology continue to grow. This article documents, analyses and interprets media coverage in order to understand public discourse potentially driving support for and resistance to wind energy development (WED) in Ontario. Contrary to numerous studies which have elucidated public attitudes towards WED, the media discourse analysed suggests that roadblocks to public acceptance of the technology are more rooted in the development process (renewable energy policies and their implementation) rather than the products of WED (wind turbines). The study highlights the need for increased procedural justice to ameliorate feelings of unfairness which play a key role in fuelling resistance to the technology.

AB  - An examination of a Crime Stoppers initiative - a weekly page published in a major city-based tabloid newspaper - afforded a rare glimpse into this understudied global entity. It also offered a means of reflecting on the co-option of CCTV images; partnerships between police, media organisations, and diverse publics; and the harnessing of citizen labour in a culture of surveillance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the images, accompanying texts, and rhetoric of this feature page for a two-year period. From a media criminology perspective, the portrayals underscore the abrogation of the presumption of innocence, a focus on mundane property offences, with the potential to exacerbate fear of crime and to engender more punitive public attitudes. From a conceptual frame, this article proffers the notion of surveil-labour where the repurposing of CCTV data in the context of a Crime Stoppers scheme reinforces an alliance of police, media, and the public to enhance an infrastructure of informing.

AB  - Betel nut chewing has become prevalent in Hunan Province, China. There are different voices over its health risks. In spite of this, the local government has not taken any effective measures to control its expansion. It is necessary to reveal the concern of interests and public health behind such voices. This study used qualitative and quantitative methods to investigate the dispute over the health risks of betel nut chewing. The different voices over the risks demonstrate the tension of power, interests and public health among the government, institution, business, media and medical elites. Discursive practices of these institutions and individuals are associated with the exercise of power and expression of interests. With the deep concern about its cancerogenicity, majority of the public hold a negative attitude, and agree that the related industry should be controlled. Faced with conflicting perspectives, the government has the responsibility to clarify the issue and express an official stance. Measures should be taken to protect public health.

AB  - What factors explain majority members' anti-Muslim prejudice? This is an increasingly important question to ask, but to date only relatively few studies have sought to provide answers from a cross-national comparative perspective. This study aims to help fill this gap. Using data from the seventh round of the European Social Survey (ESS) linked with country-level characteristics, our results indicate that (a) a larger Muslim population size, (b) more liberal immigrant integration policies and (c) greater state support of religion are all associated with lower levels of majority members' negative attitudes towards Muslim immigration - our indicator of anti-Muslim prejudice. Such attitudes, however, prove to be unrelated to (d) cross-national differences in the frequency of negative immigration-related news reports as measured by the ESS media claims data. Collectively, these findings bring us one important step closer towards a better understanding of interethnic relations between majority members and Muslim immigrants in European host societies.

AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report-selected from a larger corpus-which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

AB  - Background: The largest effort undertaken in precision health research is the Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), also known as the All of Us Research Program, which aims to include 1 million or more participants to be a part of a diverse database that can help revolutionize precision health research studies. Research participation from Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in precision health research is, however, limited; this includes Vietnamese Americans, especially those with limited English proficiency. PMI engagement efforts with underserved communities, including members of minority populations or individuals who have experienced health disparities such as Vietnamese Americans with limited English proficiency, may help to enrich the diversity of the PMI.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the attitudes towards and perceptions of precision health, motivations and barriers to participation in precision health research, and acceptability of SMS text messaging as a recruitment and intervention strategy among underserved Vietnamese Americans.
   Methods: A community sample of 37 Vietnamese Americans completed a survey and participated in one of 3 focus groups classified by age (18-30, 31-59, and >= 60 years) on topics related to precision health, participation in precision health research, texting or social media use experience, and insights on how to use text messages for recruitment and intervention. Participants were recruited via community organizations that serve Vietnamese Americans, flyers, word of mouth, and Vietnamese language radio announcements.
   Results: Most participants had little knowledge of precision health initially. After brief education, they had positive attitudes toward precision health, although the motivation to participate in precision health research varied by age and prior experience of research participation. The main motivators to participate included the desire for more knowledge and more representation of Vietnamese Americans in research. Participants were open to receiving text messages as part of their research participation and provided specific suggestions on the design and delivery of such messages (eg, simple, in both English and Vietnamese). Examples of barriers included misinterpretation of messages, cost (to send text messages), and preferences for different texting platforms across age groups.
   Conclusions: This study represents one of the first formative research studies to recruit underserved Vietnamese Americans to precision health research. It is critical to understand target communities' motivations and barriers to participation in research. Delivering culturally appropriate text messages via age-appropriate texting and social media platforms may be an effective recruitment and intervention strategy. The next step is to develop and examine the feasibility of a culturally tailored precision health texting strategy for Vietnamese Americans.

AB  - We discuss some aspects of a pilot e-learning technical writing course addressed to 11th grade vocational high school students in Greece. The application of this alternative teaching intervention stemmed from the researcher-instructor's reflections relating to the integration of a problem based e-pedagogy that aims not just to familiarize students with some technical writing text-types, but to trigger a positive way of thinking and writing and thus enhance students' linguistic literacy. Can genuine interest to content learning (the school's vocational sectors and technical subjects) revert the negative attitude towards school writing activities? And what if the teachers, taking advantage of this interest, converted the conventional language lesson to a web mediated, e-learning problem based language course by engaging more energetic, student-centered teaching and learning approaches? The study showed that a job-related language course through the application of motivating e-pedagogy can revert the vocational students language literacy in a positive direction.

AB  - Background: Online education became mandatory for many students during the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and blurred the distinction between settings where processes of stress and restoration used to take place. The lockdown also likely changed perceptions of the indoor acoustic environment (i.e., soundscape) and raised its importance. In the present study, we seek to understand how indoor soundscape related to university students' self-rated health in Bulgaria around the time that the country was under a state of emergency declaration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Between 17 May and 10 June 2020, we conducted a cross-sectional online survey among 323 students (median age 21 years; 31% male) from two universities in the city of Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Self-rated health (SRH) was measured with a single-item. Participants were asked how frequently they heard different types of sounds while at home and how pleasant they considered each of those sounds to be. Restorative quality of the home (the "being away" dimension of the Perceived Restorativeness Scale) was measured with a single-item. A priori confounders and effect modifiers included sociodemographics, house-related characteristics, general sensitivity to environmental influences, and mental health. Our analysis strategy involved sequential exploratory factor analysis (EFA), multivariate linear and ordinal regressions, effect modification tests, and structural equation modeling (SEM). Results: EFA supported grouping perceived sounds into three distinct factors-mechanical, human, and nature sounds. Regression analyses revealed that greater exposure to mechanical sounds was consistently associated with worse SRH, whereas no significant associations were found for human and nature sounds. In SEM, exposure to mechanical sounds related to lower restorative quality of the home, and then to poorer SRH, whereas nature sounds correlated with higher restorative quality, and in turn with better SRH. Conclusions: These findings suggest a role of positive indoor soundscape and restorative quality for promoting self-rated health in times of social distancing.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between internalized and public stigma on treatment-related attitudes and behaviors in a community sample of 449 African American and white adults aged 18 years and older Telephone surveys were administered to assess level of depressive symptoms, demographic characteristics, stigma, and treatment-related attitudes and behaviors. Multiple regression analysis indicated that internalized stigma mediated the relationship between public stigma and attitudes toward mental health treatment. Within group analyses indicated that the mediating effect of internalized stigma was significant for whites only. Among African Americans, internalized stigma did not mediate public stigma; it was directly related to attitudes toward mental health treatment. The internalization of stigma is key in the development of negative attitudes toward mental health treatment, and future research should focus on this aspect of stigma in both individual and community-based efforts to reduce stigma.

AB  - Legal attitudes, religion, and attributions relate to insanity defense attitudes and legal decisions in insanity cases. Religious fundamentalism has consistently predicted punitiveness associated with insanity; however, the current research focuses on moral disengagement as an explanatory link in the fundamentalist and insanity chain. Additional exploratory interests examined how defendants' perceived proximity to jurors might act as a potential moderator. The current study uses factorial survey design to examine the relationships between the variables using a mock jury insanity trial. Results suggest religious fundamentalism is related to harsher verdicts and sentences, and these relationships are mediated by moral disengagement attributions, authoritarian attitudes towards the persons with mental illness, and negative attitudes towards the insanity defense. Based on findings, prosecution and defense should consider moral and religious themes presented in their arguments. Additionally, defendants pleading insanity should be aware of how juror attitudes and biases might affect the trial and verdict processes.

AB  - This paper examines the effectiveness of popularity cues in online fashion retail. Despite the fact that popularity cues have shown to be effective, we expect that popularity cues can be detrimental to expressive products like fashion products under certain conditions. Two experimental studies were conducted. The first study adopted a single-factor (popularity vs. no cue) between-subjects design. The results revealed that consumers exhibited a negative attitude toward the brand (Ab) for fashion products with a popularity cue vs. no cue. In the second study, a 2 (popularity vs. no cue) by 2 (conspicuous vs. non-conspicuous fashion product) by 3 (low vs. medium vs. high price) between-subjects factorial design was conducted. Upon running a series of moderated mediation analyses, the results showed that the price level and the product conspicuousness moderated the indirect effect of popularity cues on Ab through perceived quality.

AB  - Purpose This research aims to investigate consumers' food waste prevention behaviour through the lens of an extended theory of planned behaviour. The extension includes the examination of the role of social media usage in affecting consumers' decision-making process of food waste prevention behaviour. Design/methodology/approach A survey questionnaire is developed based on measurement items of previously validated studies. 210 samples are collected and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings The results show that social media usage has a significant influence on attitude and injunctive norms. In addition, intention can be predicted by injunctive norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control but not attitude. Lastly, the intention to reduce food waste is a significant predictor of food waste prevention behaviour. Originality/value Overall, the extended theory of planned behaviour is useful in explaining consumers' food waste prevention behaviour. Interestingly, this study reveals that a negative attitude towards food waste behaviour does not translate into the intention to engage in food waste prevention behaviour. Furthermore, it is found that social media usage plays a significant in shaping consumers' attitudes towards food waste and injunctive norms.

AB  - Previous studies have investigated the effects of a humanitarian rapport-orientated and a dominant non-rapport-orientated interview style on the memory performance of adults in two interviews separated by a 6-month interval. Also, the impact of interviewees' personality on recall was investigated. In the present exploratory study, the data that formed the basis of previous findings were re-analysed for potential indirect effects of interview approach on interviewees' recall, and for any potential relation between the interview approach and interviewees' recall as moderated by their personality. Results showed three full mediation effects in the second interview: the rapport index (interviewers' demeanour) mediated the relation between the interview approach and increased recall; the non-rapport index mediated the relations between the interview approach and decreased recall. Follow-up analyses showed a full mediation effect for the individual items friendliness and cooperation in the rapport index, and for negative attitude, nonchalance, impatience and brusqueness and obstinacy in the non-rapport index. Moreover, the results showed a significant moderation effect; the relationship between the interview approach and confabulated memories being moderated by openness to experience; and a high level of openness was associated with an increase in confabulated memories.

AB  - Identifying factors that influence adolescent intentions for COVID-19 vaccination is essential for developing strategic interventions to increase uptake, particularly in subgroups of at-risk adolescents. Attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in adolescence is characterized by difficulties regulating attention and behavior, social impairment, and impulsive risk-taking behaviors, which may impact vaccine hesitancy and vaccine uptake. This study examined hesitancy toward COVID-19 vaccines among adolescents with and without ADHD, and explored how ADHD status interacted with malleable social mechanisms and other social determinants of health in predicting vaccine hesitancy. Participants were 196 U.S. adolescents (44.4% male), 45.6% diagnosed with ADHD. Adolescents reported their confidence and willingness toward COVID-19 vaccines from March to May 2021. Adolescents with ADHD reported greater hesitancy and less confidence in COVID-19 vaccine safety compared to adolescents without ADHD (p < .01). Only 61.8% of adolescents with ADHD reported vaccine acceptance, compared to 81.3% of adolescents without ADHD. For all adolescents, those who identified as Black or Latinx and with lower family income had greater hesitancy and reduced confidence, whereas greater COVID-19 concerns, media use, and perceived negative impact on relationships was associated with greater vaccination willingness. Social contextual processes significantly interacted with ADHD status such that for adolescents without ADHD, concerns about COVID-19 were associated with increased confidence in vaccine safety. Being noncompliant with social distancing guidelines was associated with greater vaccine hesitancy, only for adolescents with ADHD. A concerted effort is needed to increase trust, confidence, and social relevance among adolescents, especially those with ADHD and from lower socio-economic backgrounds.

AB  - The social distancing measures and the related closure of education institutions have confronted young families, in particular, with various challenges. Additional risk factors such as an insecure or even unresolved maternal attachment representation may affect mental health of mothers and their children in times of increased stress such as during the ongoing pandemic. We aimed to analyze the interplay between maternal attachment representation and mother's and children's mental health before and during the SARS-CoV-2-pandemic. 91 mothers completed a "SARS-CoV-2 pandemic survey" examining the pandemic-related stress of their families including their own depressive symptomology and their children's mental health. Our mediation analysis demonstrates that the mothers' depressive symptomology significantly and fully mediated the relationship between maternal attachment representations and children's mental health during the pandemic. In contrast, the indirect effect of the maternal attachment representation on children's mental health before the pandemic through the depressive symptoms experienced by the mothers before the pandemic did not reach significance alongside the total and direct effect. The quality of the maternal attachment representation, promoted by childhood maltreatment, seems to be one relevant risk factor for the mothers' and children's mental health during a stressful time like a pandemic. The risk for mothers to develop depressive symptoms in times of a pandemic is significantly influenced by their current representation of previous attachment experiences. In addition, the mental well-being of mothers showed a considerable influence on the children's mental health during a pandemic. The results underline the necessity to consider unique needs of family members and to offer specific support in the current crisis focusing on attachment issues.

KW  - QUARANTINE
AB  - Objective COVID-19 has disrupted the normal way of life in the UK, but for some patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), the impact of this unprecedented global emergency was far greater. We aimed to assess the experience of patients with IBD during the COVID-19 lockdown.
   Design We designed a survey focused on the impact of COVID-19 on IBD healthcare, social and psychological well-being and quality of life. To capture those most likely to be affected we targeted survey invitations at our British Society of Gastroenterology (BSG) defined high and moderate-risk IBD population. Access to the survey was also available via our trust's social media pages.
   Results 685 responses were received. 76% of respondents categorised themselves in BSG defined moderate or high-risk groups, requiring stringent social distancing or shielding. 87% did not change their IBD medication, with most reported changes initiated by the IBD team. 39% were worried about their IBD care, but most services were largely uninterrupted. 90% received 'at-risk' notification often from multiple sources, but 17% not until May. The majority reported a negative impact of COVID-19 on their quality of life and significantly increased perceived stress. Patients expressed a strong wish of having future care delivered remotely.
   Conclusion COVID-19 has had a significant negative impact on psychological well-being of patients with IBD. Local IBD services must have a robust data set of vulnerable patients and be designated future responsibility for prompt communication of advice to avoid delayed and sometimes conflicting information. Remote patient management systems should be further developed and embedded in clinical practice.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for first responders (eg, police, fire, and emergency medical services) and nonmedical essential workers (eg, workers in food, transportation, and other industries). Health systems may be uniquely suited to support these workers given their medical expertise, and mobile apps can reach local communities despite social distancing requirements. Formal evaluation of real-world mobile app-based interventions is lacking.
   Objective: We aimed to evaluate the adoption, acceptability, and appropriateness of an academic medical center-sponsored app-based intervention (COVID-19 Guide App) designed to support access of first responders and essential workers to COVID-19 information and testing services. We also sought to better understand the COVID-19-related needs of these workers early in the pandemic.
   Methods: To understand overall community adoption, views and download data of the COVID-19 Guide App were described. To understand the adoption, appropriateness, and acceptability of the app and the unmet needs of workers, semistructured qualitative interviews were conducted by telephone, by video, and in person with first responders and essential workers in the San Francisco Bay Area who were recruited through purposive, convenience, and snowball sampling. Interview transcripts and field notes were qualitatively analyzed and presented using an implementation outcomes framework.
   Results: From its launch in April 2020 to September 2020, the app received 8262 views from unique devices and 6640 downloads (80.4% conversion rate, 0.61% adoption rate across the Bay Area). App acceptability was mixed among the 17 first responders interviewed and high among the 10 essential workers interviewed. Select themes included the need for personalized and accurate information, access to testing, and securing personal safety. First responders faced additional challenges related to interprofessional coordination and a "culture of heroism" that could both protect against and exacerbate health vulnerability.
   Conclusions: First responders and essential workers both reported challenges related to obtaining accurate information, testing services, and other resources. A mobile app intervention has the potential to combat these challenges through the provision of disease-specific information and access to testing services but may be most effective if delivered as part of a larger ecosystem of support. Differentiated interventions that acknowledge and address the divergent needs between first responders and non-first responder essential workers may optimize acceptance and adoption.

AB  - In the wake of the global refugee crisis, children are exposed to negative attitudes from public and private spheres. Previous research has identified family, peer, and school norms as significant predictors of children's inter-ethnic attitudes. We extend this literature by examining normative influence from wider society, which has received substantially less attention. Among 266 children (M-age = 11.24), this study investigates the relative contributions of norms from five ingroups (family, class-peers, Irish, religious and all-humanity) to predict children's anti-refugee bias. Perceptions of positive family and religious norms were the strongest unique predictors of contact intentions and warmth towards refugees. Intergroup anxiety and perceived threat mediated these relationships. Social dominance orientation mediated family normative influence only. These findings highlight the importance of broader groups (beyond that of proximal ingroups) for understanding children's intergroup attitudes.

AB  - Disabled children experience many barriers to inclusion in society. Such barriers include public attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions towards disability. There is a specific gap in the literature examining the representation of disabled children in mass media, especially within an Irish context. Previous research primarily focuses on representations of disabled adults. Eighty-nine Irish broadsheet newspaper articles from a 12-month period were analysed using qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis. Although disabled children featured within the discourse, the child's voice was predominantly absent. Reports regarding the lived experience predominantly came from the third person, providing a non-authentic voice of disability in childhood. Articles highlighted some of the challenges faced by children e.g. difficulty in accessing educational placement. Opportunities for disabled children to share their experiences using their preferred communication means offer valuable insights into their lives. Media professionals should be supported in facilitating children to have their voice heard.Points of interest Two methods were used to examine how disabled children were represented in three Irish newspapers and what types of words were used to represent them Although disabled children are featured within Irish newspaper articles, parents and people who work with disabled children tended to speak on their behalf Sometimes disabled children were labelled using impairment first terminology Irish newspapers highlight some of the challenges faced by disabled children e.g. accessing appropriate schools and social outlets Healthcare professionals have a role in advocating for and supporting disabled children to actively participate and have their voices and stories heard in the media Healthcare professionals have a role in educating media professionals to support communication with disabled children so as to deliver a first-person account of living with a disability

AB  - Previous studies have reported reliable associations between personality and music preferences, but have tended to rely on cross-genre preferences at the expense of preferences within a single subgenre. We sought to overcome this limitation by examining associations between individual differences and preferences for a specific subgenre of music, namely, contemporary heavy metal. A total of 414 individuals from Britain were presented with clips of 10 tracks of contemporary heavy metal and asked to rate each for liking. Participants also completed measures of the Big Five personality traits, attitudes toward authority, self-esteem, need for uniqueness, and religiosity. A multiple regression showed that stronger composite preference for the heavy metal tracks was associated with higher Openness to Experience, more negative attitudes toward authority, lower self-esteem, greater need for uniqueness, and lower religiosity. In addition, men showed a significantly stronger preference for the tracks than women (d - 0.54). These results are discussed in terms of the psychological needs that contemporary heavy metal fills for some individuals.

TI  - How can we demonstrate the public value of evidence-based policy making when government ministers declare that the people 'have had enough of experts'?
T2  - PALGRAVE COMMUNICATIONS

KW  - IDEAS

AB  - Recent political campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic have led some to argue that we live in the age of 'post-factual' or 'post-truth' politics, suggesting evidence has a limited role in debate and public policy. How can we demonstrate the public value of evidence-informed debate under those circumstances? Survey evidence on public attitudes to expertise offers some hope that the tone of much of this debate is unduly pessimistic. While policy-making always develops in an environment where evidence is contested, this paper will argue that understanding of the routines through which Ministers work and assimilate evidence is actually under-researched. Not only are Ministers open to evidence, but there is an institutional grounding for evidence-based policy in government. Meanwhile, the creation of devolved institutions has created new sites in the UK for evidence-based policy-making, despite the political tensions between UK and devolved governments. Drawing on academic and think tank insights, and experience as a Welsh Government Minister between 2007 and 2016, this paper argues for three key approaches for the academic community to adopt: understanding the temporal focus of ministers, building trust amongst ministers and those who advise them in the evidence-promoting capacity of the academic policy community, and shaping the wider authorising environment, including the media that contributes to the framing of key policy debates.

AB  - Attitudes of health professionals towards patients with addiction continues to be negative, which is increasingly recognized as a major barrier to the receipt of optimal clinical care by those patients. This study aims to describe nurses' attitudes and the underlying factors influencing nurses' attitudes towards patients in two addiction rehabilitation centers in Jordan. Employing a case study design, using ethnographic fieldwork, we collected data from a purposive sample of twenty-one clinical nurses, using semi-structured interviews, which were analyzed for themes derived from the literature. Negative nurses' attitudes towards "addicted" patients ranged from stigmatization, marginalization, avoidance of patients, to class discrimination. Major socio-cultural factors (honor-gender-shame triad, socialization process, mass media, perceiving addiction as a "hopeless" condition), and other contributory factors played a role in constructing nurses' negative attitudes. We recommend a nursing curriculum that includes education regarding addiction behavioral patterns, and a continuing education regarding patients' rights, legal and ethical aspects of nursing care.

AB  - Stigma negatively affects the health of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA). Negative attitudes and discriminatory actions towards PLWHA are thought to be based, among other factors, on stigma towards sexual minorities and beliefs about personal responsibility. Yet, there is little evidence to support these linkages and explain how they take place, especially among Latinos. This study analyzes attitudes towards PLWHA among 643 Latino gay/bisexual men and transgender (GBT) people. It examines whether discriminatory actions are predicted by beliefs about personal responsibility and internalized homosexual stigma. Results indicate that Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA is associated with HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs and Internalized Homosexual Stigma. Further, HIV/AIDS Personal Responsibility Beliefs partially mediates the relationship between Internalized Homosexual Stigma and Discriminatory Actions towards PLWHA. Latino GBT persons who have internalized negative views about homosexuality may project those onto PLWHA. They may think PLWHA are responsible for their serostatus and, hence, deserving of rejection.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to outline government online training practice. We searched individual research domains of the human-dimensions of Human Computer Interaction (HCI), information and communications technologies (ICT) and instructional design for evidence of either corporate sector or government training practices. We overlapped these domains to investigate primary research outcomes. Corporate sector and government employees encounter barriers to their adoption of web-mediated training. One such barrier is a lack of enthusiasm, possibly due to ineffective instructional design, which in turn affects motivation towards online learning. Although the Australian Government offers training incentives to the general community, a negative attitude towards online training persists in the community, particularly throughout the government sector. Adoption of effective ICT training tools is a critical issue for the corporate sector and government agencies worldwide. This paper presents a compelling case for courseware designers to develop sound instructional design principles to enhance web-mediated learning programmes.

AB  - The novel coronavirus (Covid-19) infection outbreak has posed a major threat to the international health system and economy. This study is aimed at investigating the biological and epidemiological trends in the prevalence and mortality due to outbreaks of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infections. The data on the global outbreak of COVID-19, were obtained from World Health Organization (WHO), Worldometer, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and research institutes. The information was also recorded from research documents published in global scientific journals indexed in Pub Med and Institute of Scientific Information (ISI) Web of Science on the trends in the prevalence and mortality due to COVID-19 infection outbreaks. The results show rising trends in the transmission, prevalence and mortality rate due to coronavirus COVID-19. During the period of December 29, 2019 through March 31, 2020, it has infected 750,890 people worldwide, resulting in 36,405 deaths with a mortality rate of 4.84%. The infections were more frequent among male gender over 60 years of age. The mean growth rate index for total number of cases from January 23 to March 31, 2020 was 1.20 and growth rate index for mortality rate was 1.12. There was a positive association between the prevalence and mortality rate (R-2 = 0.996). The novel coronavirus COVID-19 is highly contagious and has affected a large number of people worldwide. It is still spreading with mutable prevalence and mortality outbreak trends. The global health officials have taken priority measures to prevent further outbreaks of this emerging pathogen across the globe. However, the rising number of cases and mortality risk estimates are demonstrating that enhanced public health mediations, good hygienic conditions, social distancing, and movement limitations may control the COVID-19 epidemics.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to systematically analyze and describe the tone of media coverage of the nursing home sector and its relationship to other dimensions of the coverage reported. Through a search of the LexisNexis database, 16,280 articles were identified from 51U.S. newspapers from 1999 to 2008. Articles were analyzed for tone, themes, prominence, central actor, and issue jurisdiction. Multinomial logit was used to examine the correlates of tone. Most articles were negative (36.9 percent) or neutral (45.5 percent) in tone; very few were positive (12.6 percent) or mixed (5.0 percent). Differences in tone were noted with regard to article placement and content. Findings highlight the preponderance of negative coverage and suggest that its adverse influence on public attitudes toward nursing homes may be enhanced by its prominence and focus on state/local concerns and industry interests/behavior. Future research should examine the relationship between media coverage and government agendas and outcomes related to nursing homes.

AB  - How can agents of social change increase public support for minority communities? In three studies, we demonstrate how heightened feelings of community connection can predict support for addressing injustice in minority communities. Community connection, when experimentally evoked (Study 1) or measured (Study 3), was associated with heightened support for the government addressing substandard conditions in an African American housing project (Studies 1 and 3) and Native American reservations (Study 1). Mediation analyses revealed that this effect emerges, at least in part, because of a heightened perceived value of all communities-not merely one's own (Studies 1 and 3). One reason that stronger feelings of community connection lead to (Study 2) or are associated with (Study 3) greater valuing of communities is a strengthened superordinate community identity. We tested additional potential mediators of the community connection-support relationship; out-group identification mediated but outgroup attachment did not. Implications for social change are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study is to explore the effects of recent Chinese international propaganda by adopting a conditional process analysis of U.S. and South Korean audiences. Our study yields three major findings. First, perceived credibility plays a significant role as a mediator between new propaganda and its persuasive effect. Second, both the perceived credibility of a message and its persuasive effect are moderated by the nationality of the audience (American or Korean in our study). Third, the indirect persuasive effect of a piece of Chinese international propaganda, as mediated through its perceived credibility, is further moderated by the nationality of the audience (i.e., American or Korean). This paper thus stands to contribute to cross-national studies of the media effect of international propaganda by identifying factors associated with perceived credibility and the persuasive effect and assessing the influence of propaganda on public attitudes in other nations.

TI  - Identification of nonliteral language in social media: A case study on sarcasm

KW  - VERBAL IRONY
AB  - With the rapid development of social media, spontaneously user-generated content such as tweets and forum posts have become important materials for tracking people's opinions and sentiments online. A major hurdle for current state-of-the-art automatic methods for sentiment analysis is the fact that human communication often involves the use of sarcasm or irony, where the author means the opposite of what she/he says. Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. Lack of naturally occurring utterances labeled for sarcasm is one of the key problems for the development of machine-learning methods for sarcasm detection. We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine-learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine-learning techniques and human judges on this task.

AB  - This study applies the contact hypothesis to computer-mediated communication (CMC) and examines whether intergroup computer-mediated contact can facilitate relationships between conflicting groups. The effectiveness of different CMC modes, text-based and video-based, in improving interpersonal and intergroup attitudes was compared. The results from an experiment indicated that video-based CMC exerted greater influence in improving participants' attitudes towards a targeted outgroup member when compared to text-based CMC. However, text-based CMC produced a stronger effect than video-based CMC in improving one's attitudes towards the outgroup as a whole.

AB  - Objective Rural areas in the Southern United States are characterized by certain cultural values that may delay or prevent mental health service utilization. The present study examined a four-stage chain of serial mediation where higher levels of general self-reliance would be related to greater levels of public stigma, which would in turn be related to higher levels of self-stigma, followed by greater self-reliance about managing mental health problems, and finally, more negative attitudes toward seeking help from psychologists. Method Community members who lived in rural counties in the Southern United States (N = 783) completed measures of these constructs online. Results Mediation analyses supported a direct association between general self-reliance and attitudes toward help-seeking that was explained in serial by higher levels of public stigma, self-stigma, and mental health self-reliance. Conclusions Clinical implications for rural practitioners are suggested including instilling policy changes, increasing provider visibility, and addressing barriers in therapy.

AB  - The paper relates the results of an ethnolinguistic vitality (ELV) survey among the Kashubs in Poland. The results reveal two interrelated layers of ELV: (1) an individual ELV reflected in language use and shaped by personal experience, emotions, and language proficiency; (2) a more collective ELV associated with the perception of the group's language strength, its status and utility. The most surprising predictor of linguistic praxis in our study, in addition to language skills, was the positive impact of experienced discouragement on language use. This remained significant when controlling for proficiency. We argue that the correlation between experiencing discouragement and increased language use is best explained by the self-empowerment of speakers who, earlier in their lives, met with negative attitudes toward their heritage language. Rather than succumbing to this discouragement and assimilating to the dominant language, their response was to develop an emotional link to Kashubian and increase their use of this minority language as a conscious act of self-determination and engagement.

AB  - With the general aggression model and presence (i.e., sense of "being there") theory as frameworks, this study investigates the effects of violence cues (blood and screams of pain) and players' individual differences in aggression (trait aggression) on brand logo memory and on attitude change in a violent first-person shooter game (Half-Life 2). Physiological arousal (skin conductance levels) was assessed during game play and participants reported their sense of presence in the game. Results indicate that violence cues influence brand logo memory through engagement and affect attitude change via arousal. Although physiological arousal led to positive change in brand attitude, it does not significantly influence logo memory. Conversely, although higher levels of spatial presence led to better logo memory, there was a corresponding reduction in attitude change for highly recognized brands. We consider the possibility that increased memory but negative attitude change with higher presence in violent video games could deter advertisers from placing their messages inside violent games.

AB  - This article views appraisal as co-selection patterns of target, source and evaluative parameters and investigates the ways in which news discourse retells news stories and reproduces truthful reality. We combined the corpus-assisted method and quantitative/qualitative analysis of the data, i.e., 904 sentences which were extracted from the corpus of German 5G news reports by selecting the top 5 items from each of the noun keywords lists of the three subcorpora of economics, politics and technology news reports. It was found that the German media restage the necessity and desirability to promote the development of German communication facilities/technology through international cooperation, particularly Germany-Sino cooperation. In addition, a hesitant image was evoked as to the high-profile 5G development in Germany with an awareness of the potential security risks and economic losses. On the intersubjective dimension, our findings suggest that journalists make full exploitation of different dialogistic positioning strategies for closing down or opening up the dialogic space to a greater or lesser degree. More specifically, they tend to acknowledge and endorse the positive/negative attitudes attributed to the non-authorial voices towards particular targets in the fields of economics, politics or technology. A future comparison with the genre of news comments or editorials would deepen our understanding of the performativity of media.

AB  - The aim of this sociolinguistically-oriented study is to explore the Arabizi phenomenon which is characterized by spelling Arabic words using the Latin script. It is prevalent in the text-based computer-mediated communications among Saudi Arabians. The study focuses on why Arabizi is used, how, particularly in respect to with whom and in which topics, it is used, the attitudes of its users toward its use and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of its use. Using an online survey, data were collected from 241 participants, 72 of which were users of Arabizi. The findings revealed that the primary reasons for using Arabizi were its being a communication code among youths and a compensation for the lack of Arabic keyboard from technological devices as well as being more expressive than Arabic language. It was also found that Arabizi was primarily used to communicate with friends and individuals of the same age, but not with parents and older people or in formal relationships. In addition, the study revealed that Arabizi is used in occasional conversations and social matters, but not in academic, scientific, business, economic, religious or poetry and literature- related topics. Arabizi users were found to hold both positive and negative attitudes based on different advantages and disadvantages of the phenomenon. These findings will be discussed and recommendations for future research will be given.

AB  - The context of stigma, in which lesbians and gay men live in most countries, exposes them to possible discrimination and promotes the internalization of negative attitudes about their own sexual orientation, which may have negative consequences for their mental health. Their psychological distress may increase when lesbians and gay men are exposed to other sources of stress such as intimate partner violence. With the aim of analyzing the relationship between these variables, this study intends to present a moderated mediation model that proposes: (a) self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology; (b) receiving psychological abuse within same-sex couples moderates the relationship between self-stigma and depressive symptomatology. For this purpose we conducted an online survey with a sample of 357 Spanish lesbians and gay men. Our findings show that self-stigma mediates the relationship between private collective self-esteem and depressive symptomatology. Furthermore, participants who had higher levels of self-stigma and received more psychological abuse by the partner showed stronger negative effects on depressive symptomatology. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Aim: This study investigated the vaccination status of those children who received inpatient treatment due to measles and explored the beliefs and practices of their parents related to the refusal of childhood vaccines.
   Materials and Metkods: This study was a descriptive research performed at a training and research hospital in eastern Turkey. The study data were collected from the parents of children with measles who were receiving inpatient treatment. In this study, the introductory information form and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory were used.
   Results: The results revealed that 61.8% of those children with measles had not been vaccinated against measles. Factors that played a role in the parents' vaccine refusal included family elders' unwillingness, negative media reports, the side effects of vaccines, and negative attitudes towards health care workers. Parents with poor socio-economic status, low educational status, and extended family types were found to have significantly higher rates of vaccine refusal. The parents had an average state anxiety score of 60.15 +/- 5.73 and an average trait anxiety score of 50.21 +/- 3.33.
   Conclusion: Many factors were found to influence the causes of parents not having their children vaccinated. Community-based training is needed to address the parents' misconceptions, concerns, and lack of knowledge about vaccinations. Renewing policies on vaccinations, establishing standards, and imposing legal sanctions can be effective in reducing vaccine refusal rates.

AB  - This study examines discourses in Chinese online discussions of gene editing by multiple social actors on Weibo before and after a significant scientific crisis, the 2018 scandal of Chinese gene-edited human babies. A content analysis of 2074 posts was done to identify frames, emotions, and metaphors. Findings reveal that Chinese social media have opened up new spaces for multiple social actors to generate multiple discourses. This has resulted in a more participatory public engagement with science and technology on Chinese social media, potentially influencing the online agenda and policy decisions on science and technology. Finally, findings indicate that a scientific crisis can serve as a trigger for significant changes in public attitudes and opinions regarding gene editing.

TI  - Impact of Visual Context on Public Perceptions of Non-Human Primate Performers
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Prior research has shown that the use of apes, specifically chimpanzees, as performers in the media negatively impacts public attitudes of their conservation status and desirability as a pet, yet it is unclear whether these findings generalize to other non-human primates (specifically non-ape species). We evaluated the impact of viewing an image of a monkey or prosimian in an anthropomorphic or naturalistic setting, either in contact with or in the absence of a human. Viewing the primate in an anthropomorphic setting while in contact with a person significantly increased their desirability as a pet, which also correlated with increased likelihood of believing the animal was not endangered. The majority of viewers felt that the primates in all tested images were "nervous." When shown in contact with a human, viewers felt they were "sad" and "scared", while also being less "funny." Our findings highlight the potential broader implications of the use of non-human primate performers by the entertainment industry.

AB  - Is it possible to infer information about public opinion by looking at how the media discuss controversial technoscientific public issues? We conduct content analysis on media coverage of nuclear power in Italy in the years 1992-2012 and compare it with longitudinal public opinion surveys. By treating a large amount of textual data and applying an innovative methodology based on indicators of the presence of risky terms', that is, keywords referring to the issue of risk and danger, very high correlation has been found between media discourse on risk and opposition within public opinion. The analysis is conducted testing as a preliminary step Mazur's hypothesis on quantity of coverage and opposition towards controversial technoscience. Then, risk content measures are used in order to gain stronger correlations between media and public attitudes towards nuclear power.

AB  - This article describes the 2011 English Heritage 'Industrial Heritage at Risk' project. Having examined the findings of a public attitudes survey on the industrial heritage, it looks at the key risks and conservation solutions facing industrial sites, and the role the lead organisations play in their rescue. The entries on the Heritage at Risk Register are examined and the top ten industrial heritage at risk sites in England identified. A range of outputs are described together with the media coverage that accompanied the launch of the project.
   Progress since 2011. is considered including the separation in April 2015 of English Heritage into two organisations-Historic England and the English Heritage Trust. The important role that volunteers and local groups play in the conservation and management of England's industrial heritage is acknowledged throughout, and a possible new role for the Association for Industrial Archaeology suggested as part of Heritage 2020.

AB  - Men with greater gender role conflict (GRC) tend to exhibit a variety of body image concerns, including a drive for muscularity (DM). In accordance with the theory of planned behavior (TPB), men with higher levels of GRC also report negative attitudes and a lack of intentions to seek help for problems. Additionally, prior research regarding other individual and contextual help-seeking related variables has shown that men with higher GRC report increased stigma of both seeking help and having mental health problems, as well as greater concrete barriers to help-seeking. In this study, 176 undergraduate men were assessed for GRC, DM, and help-seeking-related variables including attitudes, intention to seek help, self-stigma of seeking help, self-stigma regarding mental health problems, and concrete barriers to seeking help. Results indicate that GRC is positively correlated with DM and negatively correlated with help-seeking variables. Mediation analyses suggest a relationship between DM, GRC, and help-seeking. Specifically, results demonstrate that GRC mediates the relationship between DM and intentions to seek help, thus explaining why men with body image concerns may be less likely to utilize treatment. In addition, self-stigma of seeking help and attitudes toward seeking help emerged as mediating factors between GRC and intentions to seek help. Intervention strategies aimed at increasing help-seeking behavior for men who suffer from body image concerns, and disordered eating and exercise behaviors, may benefit from targeting stigmatization and attitudes toward seeking help.

AB  - Indicators of collective user behavior and opinion are increasingly common features of online news stories and may include information about how the story made users feel. An experiment (N = 298) examined the effects of the presence and valence of a "mood meter" posted alongside an online human-interest story on memory for, attitude toward, emotional response to, and intentions to share the story. The presence of a mood meter led to lower recall of story content, more negative attitudes toward the story, and less positive emotional responses. The results suggest that participating in a mood meter may attenuate positive responses to human-interest stories.

AB  - This study illustrates the Two Sessions and proposes the concept of public diplomacy network to investigate the effect of China's public diplomacy communication on Twitter. Twitter data comprising 14,874 tweets and 7773 users was collected during March 5 to March 20 in 2018, the combination of social network analysis and content analysis were employed from a holistic, relational and networked approach. The results present public diplomacy networks' structural characteristics, key participants' networking patterns, communication strategies, issue participation, and homophily effect that participants who take the same attitude towards China (negative & neutral or positive) are clustered in each group. In conclusion, although China's state-owed media takes the lead in public diplomacy communication, foreign practitioners dominate the NGOs, researchers, correspondents, and generally take negative attitude towards China. China's media outlets underperform in allying closely, and China is entrenched in traditional one-way monologue. The theoretical, methodological and practical implications are addressed.

AB  - Studies that explore the mechanisms of treatment effect are needed in the area of smoking cessation induction, the primary goal of which is to promote the occurrence of a quit attempt among individuals who report little interest in smoking cessation. This study tested the mediational effect of 5 psychological variables (motivation to quit, abstinence self-efficacy, knowledge of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), and both positive and negative attitudes toward NRT) on the relationship between NRT sampling and smoking outcomes. Adults who reported low levels of intention to quit in the next month (n = 593) were recruited for a nationwide randomized clinical trial of NRT sampling. Participants provided self-report data via telephone interview on multiple occasions, with the final follow-up at 6 months. Motivation to quit, and to a lesser degree, abstinence self-efficacy at the end of the 6-week intervention best accounted for the effect of NRT sampling as a promoter of quit attempts, smoking reduction, and 7-day point prevalence abstinence. Providing smokers with free NRT samples, in addition to encouraging them to engage in temporary abstinence, results in meaningful change in motivation and self-efficacy, which in turn influence smoking outcomes. Cessation induction interventions should aim to increase motivation to quit and abstinence self-efficacy, above and beyond any efforts to increase knowledge or prompt attitudinal shifts.

AB  - Aim: This Universite du Quebec en Outaouais study examined professionals' attitudes towards fathers, their perceived self-efficacy when working with them and their perceptions of the importance of including fathers in family interventions.
   Methods: Professionals in Quebec, Canada, working in childcare fields such as education, social services, health, community services and management answered a self-report questionnaire between 2013 and 2015. The 296 respondents (90% females) had a mean age of 39 (20-65), were from urban, semi-urban and rural settings and provided services to families with children up to five years of age.
   Results: Social service professionals perceived fathers more negatively than did other professionals. Even though male professionals perceived fathers more negatively, they felt more confident working with them than did their female counterparts. Positive perceptions of fathers were associated with more favourable attitudes towards including them in family interventions, and this association was mediated by the professionals' perceptions of their own self-efficacy.
   Conclusion: The most negative attitudes were reported by social service professionals. Male professionals viewed fathers more negatively but were more confident working with them than were female colleagues. Improving professionals' perceptions of fathers could help to promote their inclusion in family interventions.

AB  - Since the existing measures to prevent ambush marketing are widely ineffective, sponsors can use countercommunications, a public response to an ambushing attempt that aims to strengthen their own brand, relative to the ambusher. This research examines consumer responses to three types of counterambush marketing ads: humorous complaining, naming and shaming, and consumer education. Three experimental studies using both real and fictitious brands as well as different event settings indicate that a humorous counterad (vs. naming and shaming and consumer education counterads) results in more favorable consumer evaluations of the countermessage. The studies also show that perceptions of the advertising tactic's appropriateness mediate these effects and that a humorous counterad is only advantageous when consumers hold positive (vs. negative) attitudes toward the practice of ambush marketing. In addition, comparing the three types of counterads with a common sponsorship leveraging ad suggests that a humorous counterad and simply ignoring the ambusher produce equal perceptions of tactical appropriateness and similar positive indirect effects on consumer attitudes toward the ad. The studies thus provide implications for how sponsors can respond to ambushers. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - In this paper we examine the role of Hip Hop and rap lyrics in the reevaluation and legitimization of a new multiethnolectal speech style developed in multiethnic and multilingual environments in Oslo, Norway. This speech style, commonly referred to as "Kebab-Norwegian", has been met with negative attitudes not only from the establishment but also in mainstream media. However, attitudes seem to be changing, partly due to the efforts of rappers from immigrant backgrounds who promote themselves as users and propagators of the new speech style. They take a clear stance against the prevalent idea that "Kebab-Norwegian" poses a threat to the Norwegian language. In our paper we present on-going research on some of the most recent high school textbooks where lyrics from these performers have been included, and we also consider the strategies of promotion employed by some of the publishing houses.

AB  - Medical students begin their education inside a laboratory dissecting cadavers to learn human gross anatomy. Many schools use the course experience as a way to instill empathy and some have begun integrating video and recorded interviews with body donors to humanize the experience, but their impact has yet to be measured. This study examines the effects of a brief documentary film and the initial cadaver encounter on student perceptions and attitudes towards the laboratory experience. A pre-test, exposure, post-test design was used with 77 first-year medical students at the University of Central Florida. A previously validated questionnaire was adapted to measure attitudes, emotions, initial reaction to cadaver, perception of the donor as a person, and impressions of the film. An online questionnaire was completed before the first day of laboratory, in which students watched the film Anatomy and Humanity and handled their respective cadavers (no dissection was performed). The post-test was administered immediately following the activities of the first laboratory day. Results indicate an increase in negative attitudes towards dissection, but a more positive initial reaction to the cadaver than originally anticipated. Students also experienced a decrease in emotions like sadness and guilt regarding anatomy laboratory and were less likely to view the cadaver as a once-living person. Findings suggest a higher comfort level, but also greater detachment toward the cadavers from day one despite the video intervention. These results provide novel insight that may aid other interventions aimed at promoting humanism in the anatomy laboratory experience. (C) 2015 American Association of Anatomists.

   The meaning in life consists of an individual's values, experiences, goals and beliefs. It has been shown to be negatively associated with depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation.
   Depression and hopelessness are related to increased suicidal ideation. Meaning in life has been shown to be a protective factor against depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation.
   What the paper adds to existing knowledge
   A path model was developed to clarify the associations among meaning in life, depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation. For clarity, the outcomes were depression and suicidal ideation, the independent variable was hopelessness, and the mediator was meaning in life. Hopelessness had a direct association with meaning in life, and meaning in life had a direct association with depression, supporting the mediating effect of meaning in life from hopelessness to depression.
   Meaning in life had the strongest association with depression, and depression had the strongest association with suicidal ideation. Meaning in life did not have a significant direct association with suicidal ideation; it did have an indirect association with suicidal ideation through depression. This study estimated that one-point increase in meaning in life score was associated with 0.47-point decrease in depression score and 0.13-point decrease in suicidal ideation score, respectively.
   What are the implications for practice
   Logotherapy is a meaning-centred therapy to find meaning in life. This study reveals that increased levels of meaning in life are associated with decreasing degrees of depression. Mental health nurses could help patients to find meaning in life by logotherapy and thus associated with reductions in depression.
   Mental health nurses could help patients to find hope by exploring meaning in life and promoting positive attitudes towards life from meaningless life to meaningful life, there is a reduction in depression, which in turn reduces suicidal ideation indirectly.
   Introduction
   Meaning in life can be good protective factor against depression, hopelessness and suicidal ideation.
   Aim
   To analyse the mediating effect of meaning in life on the associations among hopelessness, depression and suicidal ideation.
   Method
   A cross-sectional study was conducted among 90 patients diagnosed with depression. A structural equation modelling approach was applied for this path analysis to examine the mediating effect of meaning in life on the association among hopelessness, depression and suicidal ideation.
   Results
   The results showed that meaning in life mediated the association between hopelessness and depression. Hopelessness had a direct positive association with depression (beta = 0.23, p < .03), and meaning in life had a direct negative association with depression (beta = -0.51, p < .01) and indirect association with suicidal ideation through depression; this indirect association was -0.21 (p < .01).
   Discussion
   Meaning in life revealed strong mediating association with the relationship between hopelessness and depression. By reducing the level of depression, meaning in life demonstrated its mediator association with suicidal ideation.
   Implications for Practice
   Logotherapy is a meaning-centred therapy to find meaning in life. Mental health nurses could help patients to manage their depression through logotherapy, thus leading to reductions in suicidal ideation.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic is causing direct and indirect effects in the global population. In this paper, fear and its possible forthcoming consequences on health will be investigated and discussed. Fear is an innate reactive emotion to the immediate threats produced by danger. It is hardwired within subcortical survival circuits and originally had to defend the organism from predators. Besides, fear is a cognitive emotional process mediated by the cortical structures, and implies a subjective evaluation both at implicit (subsymbolic, unconscious) and explicit (symbolic, conscious) levels. Within a defensive taxonomy framework, fear can be defined as a reflex triggering a prompt behavior aimed at surviving from predating attacks (freezing), whereas anxiety as a deliberate pattern aimed at planning behaviors for anticipating and avoiding future harm. Fear and anxiety overlap at a subjective level, but are generated by different neurobiological networks and serve different evolutionary goals. The current viral danger and the need for social distancing worsen the sense of loneliness. A wide body of experimental and epidemiological literature evidence that psychological stress, social isolation, and loneliness have a detrimental effect on multiple health-related outcomes including comorbidity, multimorbidity, and mortality. The negative effects can be even higher for people currently living a massive limitation of physical and interpersonal contacts. A strong effort to integrate psychological and medical care is needed to face post-pandemic health issues.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore the impact of the robot restaurant servicescape and robot service competence (RSC) on customers' behavioral intentions and to analyze the mediating role of hedonic value (HV) and utilitarian value (UV) in these relationships and the moderating role of individual characteristics. Design/methodology/approach This research involves seven constructs to be measured, namely, servicescape, RSC, negative attitude toward robots (NAR), openness to change (OC), HV, UV and behavioral intention. This research selects Foodom robot restaurants, located in Shunde and Guangzhou of China, as the research site, and the research objects are customers having dinner in the restaurant. A total of 485 valid data was collected. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data, verify the proposed research model, and test the research hypotheses. Findings The study finds that servicescape and RSC improve customer behavioral intention. Additionally, HV and UV mediate the influence of servicescape and RSC on customer behavioral intention. Moreover, OC negatively moderates the influence of servicescape on UV and that a NAR negatively moderates the influence of RSC on HV. Originality/value Through carefully design of servicescape and the improvement in service capabilities of robots, the original service delivery dominated by frontline service personnel can be transformed into service delivery dominated by service robots, which is conductive to providing a pleasant and unforgettable experience for customers.

AB  - Prior research has established many factors which are linked with mental illness stigma (MIS). One such factor is that of socioeconomic status (SES). The current research intended to address if the link between SES, specifically income level, and MIS might be explained by social dominance orientation (SDO) and the legitimizing myth that mental illness onset is controllable in nature. A sample of 926 participants reported their level of household income and completed self-report measures of MIS, SDO, and mental illness controllability attributions (MI-Control). Results demonstrated that higher levels of income were associated with higher levels of MIS, SDO, and MI-Control. Furthermore, a significant three-path mediated effect was found from SES to MIS through SDO and MI-Control. Findings highlight the extent to which socio-demographic factors may be linked with negative attitudes toward those with mental illnesses, particularly when such factors work in tandem with competitive social worldviews. Implications in regard to the 4 importance of socioeconomically diverse mental health funding committees are discussed.

AB  - Background: A central component of the public health strategy to control the COVID-19 pandemic involves encouraging mask wearing and social distancing to protect individuals from acquiring and transmitting the virus.
   Objective: This study aims to understand the psychological factors that drive adoption or rejection of these protective behaviors, which can inform public health interventions to control the pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted an online survey of a representative sample of 1074 US adults and assessed three novel potential predictors of COVID-19 behaviors: trait reactance, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, and COVID-19 apocalypse beliefs. Key outcomes (dependent variables) included an index of COVID-19 protective behaviors, the number of trips taken from the home, and COVID-19 knowledge.
   Results: In bivariate analyses, all three predictors were significantly correlated in the hypothesized direction with the three COVID-19 outcomes. Specifically, each predictor was negatively (P<.01) correlated with the COVID-19 protective behaviors index and COVID-19 knowledge score, and positively correlated with trips taken from home per week (more of which was considered higher risk). COVID-19 protective behaviors and COVID-19 knowledge were significantly lower in the top median compared to the bottom median for all three predictors. In general, these findings remained significant after adjusting for all novel predictors plus age, gender, income, education, race, political party, and religiosity. Self-identified Republicans (vs other political affiliations) reported the highest values for each of the novel predictors.
   Conclusions: This study can inform the development of health communication interventions to encourage the adoption of COVID-19 protective behaviors. Interestingly, we found that higher scores of all three novel predictors were associated with lower COVID-19 knowledge, suggesting that lack of an accurate understanding of the virus may be driving some of these attitudes; although, it is also possible that these attributes may interfere with one's willingness or ability to seek and absorb accurate health information. These individuals may be particularly immune to accepting new information and yielding their beliefs. Health communication professionals may apply lessons learned from countering similar beliefs around climate change and vaccine hesitancy. Messages designed for individuals prone to reactance may be more effective if they minimize controlling language and emphasize the individual's independence in adopting these behavioral recommendations. Messaging for those who possess conspiracy beliefs should similarly not assume that providing evidence contrary to these beliefs will alone alter behavior. Other communication techniques such as rolling with resistance, a strategy used in motivational interviewing, may be helpful. Messaging for those with apocalyptic beliefs may require using religious leaders as the message source and using scripture that would support the adoption of COVID-19 protection behaviors.

AB  - Background: Since the declaration of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, COVID-19 has affected the responses of emergency medical service (EMS) systems to cases out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). The purpose of this study was to identify the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA in an area of South Korea. Methods: This was a retrospective observational study of adult OHCA patients attended by EMS providers comparing the EMS responses to and outcomes of adult OHCA during the COVID-19 pandemic to those during the pre-COVID-19 period. Propensity score matching was used to compare the survival rates, and logistic regression analysis was used to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the survival of OHCA patients. Results: A total of 891 patients in the pre-COVID-19 group and 1,063 patients in the COVID-19 group were included in the final analysis. During the COVID-19 period, the EMS call time was shifted to a later time period (16:00-24:00, P < 0.001), and the presence of an initial shockable rhythm was increased (pre-COVID-19 vs. COVID-19, 7.97% vs. 11.95%, P = 0.004). The number of tracheal intubations decreased (5.27% vs. 1.22%, P < 0.001), and the use of mechanical chest compression devices (30.53% vs. 44.59%, P < 0.001) and EMS response time (median [quartile 1-quartile 3], 7 [5-10] vs. 8 [6-11], P < 0.001) increased. After propensity score matching, the survival at admission rate (22.52% vs. 18.24%, P = 0.025), survival to discharge rate (7.77% vs. 5.52%, P = 0.056), and favorable neurological outcome (5.97% vs. 3.49%, P < 0.001) decreased. In the propensity score matching analysis of the impact of COVID-19, odds ratios of 0.768 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.592-0.995) for survival at admission and 0.693 (95% CI, 0.446-1.077) for survival to discharge were found. Conclusion: During the COVID-19 period, there were significant changes in the EMS responses to OHCA. These changes are considered to be partly due to social distancing measures. As a result, the proportion of patients with an initial shockable rhythm in the COVID-19 period was greater than that in the pre-COVID-19 period, but the final survival rate and favorable neurological outcome were lower.

AB  - This article looks at explanatory approaches of fear of terrorism. Until now, empirical studies looking at determinants of fear of terrorism have used the theoretical framework from the field of research regarding fear of crime. We argue that the cognitive link between terrorism and Islam is currently so strong that explanatory models should include measures of attitudes towards Muslims. On an argumentative level, the fear of crime theoretical framework is unconvincing. Our empirical analysis using structural equation modelling shows that fear of terrorism shares almost no determinants with the fear of violent crime. Negative attitudes towards Muslims are the strongest determinant of fear of terrorism and totally mediate all other effects. Discussions about tackling the issue of fear of terrorism should consider these findings as solutions may otherwise be inappropriate, at best. At worst, solutions based on an improper understanding of the determinants of fear of terrorism may serve only to exacerbate the problem.

AB  - In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists posting self-portraits ("selfies") to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images. Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists.

AB  - This study examines the effects of self-generated and other-generated electronic word-of-mouth communication (eWOM) in inoculating individuals against potential misinformation. A three-phase between-subject experiment (N = 543) was conducted to compare the persuasive effects of inoculation messages combined with different eWOM content (self-generated, other-generated, and inoculation only) over two health topics (Covid-19 vaccine and e-cigarette). The results show that exposure to inoculation messages did not significantly increase resistance to misinformation. But inoculation messages combined with other-generated eWOM helped the participants develop more negative attitudes toward alternative smoking immediately after exposure to the inocula-tion stimuli. The participants who wrote eWOM after exposure to inoculation messages were more resistant to the attack of misinformation in Phase 3. Self-generated and other-generated eWOM did not significantly differ in their persuasive effects in any phases. The findings extend the literature on the effects of WOM in the inoculation process and offer theoretical implications over inoculation theory in online contexts. The study provides empirical guidance on using inoculation messages to combat misinformation in social media.

AB  - Ethnic and racial intergroup attitudes are assumed to develop due to the influence of socialization contexts. However, there is still little longitudinal evidence supporting this claim. We also know little about the relative importance of socialization contexts, the possible interplay between them as well as about the conditions and mechanisms that might underlie socialization effects. This longitudinal study of adolescents (N=517) examined the effects of parents and peers' anti-immigrant attitudes as well as intergroup friendships on relative changes in adolescents' anti-immigrant prejudice, controlling for the effects of socioeconomic background. It also examined whether the effects of parents or peers would depend on adolescents' intergroup friendships. In addition, it explored whether the effects of parents, peers, and intergroup friendships would be mediated or moderated by adolescents' empathy. Results showed significant effects of parents, peers, intergroup friendships, and socioeconomic background on changes in youth attitudes, highlighting the role of parental prejudice. They also showed adolescents with immigrant friends to be less affected by parents and peers' prejudice than youth without immigrant friends. In addition, results showed the effects of parents, peers, and intergroup friendships to be mediated by adolescents' empathic concern. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - This article examines Taiwanese police officers' and cadets' attitudes towards immigrants in Taiwan. We examine how attitudes vary based on individual characteristics, and we focus on observed generational differences. The study aim is to better understand attitudinal differences between officers and cadets, towards the increasingly salient issue of immigration in Taiwan, while also accounting for other predictor variables. Utilising survey data collected from 538 officers and cadets in Taiwan we examine attitudes towards immigrants and crime, encouragement of immigration, police treatment of immigrants, and interactions with and perceptions of immigrants. This study finds support for the notion that there are notable attitudinal differences between older, experienced officers and younger, non-experienced cadets. Cadets were more likely to have positive and open attitudes compared to officer counterparts. Implications for police training and education in Taiwan are discussed.

AB  - Purpose It has been over a year since the first known case of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged, yet the pandemic is far from over. To date, the coronavirus pandemic has infected over eighty million people and has killed more than 1.78 million worldwide. This study aims to explore "how useful is Reddit social media platform to surveil COVID-19 pandemic?" and "how do people's concerns/behaviors change over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina?". The purpose of this study was to compare people's thoughts, behavior changes, discussion topics, and the number of confirmed cases and deaths by applying natural language processing (NLP) to COVID-19 related data. Methods In this study, we collected COVID-19 related data from 18 subreddits of North Carolina from March to August 2020. Next, we applied methods from natural language processing and machine learning to analyze collected Reddit posts using feature engineering, topic modeling, custom named-entity recognition (NER), and BERT-based (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) sentence clustering. Using these methods, we were able to glean people's responses and their concerns about COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina. Results We observed a positive change in attitudes towards masks for residents in North Carolina. The high-frequency words in all subreddit corpora for each of the COVID-19 mitigation strategy categories are: Distancing (DIST)-"social distance/distancing", "lockdown", and "work from home"; Disinfection (DIT)-"(hand) sanitizer/soap", "hygiene", and "wipe"; Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)-"mask/facemask(s)/face shield", "n95(s)/kn95", and "cloth/gown"; Symptoms (SYM)-"death", "flu/influenza", and "cough/coughed"; Testing (TEST)-"cases", "(antibody) test", and "test results (positive/negative)". Conclusion The findings in our study show that the use of Reddit data to monitor COVID-19 pandemic in North Carolina (NC) was effective. The study shows the utility of NLP methods (e.g. cosine similarity, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling, custom NER and BERT-based sentence clustering) in discovering the change of the public's concerns/behaviors over the course of COVID-19 pandemic in NC using Reddit data. Moreover, the results show that social media data can be utilized to surveil the epidemic situation in a specific community.

AB  - Research has long identified narrative persuasion as an effective health communication strategy. This study explores temporal distance perception, which is the perceived distance of a health threat, as a possible psychological mechanism through which narrative persuasion influences young adults' attitude and behavioral intention related to e-cigarette use. When reading the narrative message featuring negative consequences of nicotine addiction, participants demonstrate a higher level of transportation and subsequently perceive the health threat related to e-cigarette as temporally closer. The shortened temporal distance perception, along with transportation, mediates the relationship between exposure to the narrative message and participants' attitude and behavioral intention. Participants' past experience also plays an important role. In particular, participants who have not used e-cigarette before report more negative attitude after reading the narrative message. Findings of the current study indicate that narrative persuasion may be an effective strategy to deter young adults from using e-cigarettes.

AB  - The Fukushima nuclear disaster has significantly changed public attitudes toward nuclear energy. It is important to understand how this change has occurred in different countries before the global community revises existing nuclear policies. This study examines the effect of the Fukushima disaster on public acceptance of nuclear energy in 42 countries. We find that the operational experience of nuclear power generation which has significantly affected positive public opinion about nuclear energy became considerably negative after the disaster, suggesting fundamental changes in public acceptance regardless of the level of acceptance before the disaster. In addition, contrary to our expectation, the proportion of nuclear power generation is positively and significantly related to public acceptance of nuclear energy after the Fukushima accident and government pressure on media content led to a greater decrease in the level of public acceptance after the accident. Nuclear energy policymakers should consider the varied factors affecting public acceptance of nuclear energy in each country depending on its historical, environmental, and geographical circumstances before they revise nuclear policy in response to the Fukushima accident.

AB  - This paper looks into the language shift of Teochew, a dialect of the minority Chinese community in Klang, Malaysia. The aim of this research is to rationalise the language shift of Teochew to other Chinese languages, such as Mandarin. Two theoretical frameworks guided the methodology; that is, a) the linguistic variation framework, and b) the "acts of identity" framework. A combination of both of these frameworks enabled the scrutiny of external and the internal forces that caused the linguistics variation, and the identification of the attitudes of the younger generation of Teochew speakers towards Teochew. Findings indicated that the younger generation of Teochew speakers in Klang is indeed participating in the process of language shift from Teochew to Mandarin, and they displayed more negative attitudes than positive ones towards Teochew. Although they do not look highly upon their native language, they still think that knowing their native language is important. External factors, such as the demographic factors and the mass media too contributed to the rate of the language shift.

AB  - Introduction: Men who have sex with men (MSM) are a vulnerable group, and their psychological, physical, and social well-being could be affected by various factors. They are also at higher risk of HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). This study was conducted to identify socio-demo-graphic characteristics and HIV-related risk behaviors among MSM in Iran.
   Material and methods: A qualitative study was conducted among MSM attending a sexual health clinic in a referral hospital, in Tehran in 2018. Data was collected through four focus group discussions. Con-tent analysis approach was used in data analysis.
   Results: One hundred MSM were enrolled in this study. Majority of them were 18-25 years old. Partic-ipants had numerous comments about their sexual identity and orientation; some were confused about it and mentioned stigma, discrimination, and lack of social and legal support as the most important contributing factors. Social media and parties were the most common places to find a partner. Moreover, majority had a negative attitude toward emotional attachment and marriage in sexual minorities; this was attributed to partner's infidelity, low commitment, and lack of family support by some participants.
   Conclusions: MSM is a vulnerable to psychosocial problems group due to low sexual knowledge and lack of community and legal supports. Data also indicated high probability of HIV transmission among this group because of risky sexual behaviors.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, studies show negative attitude among medical students toward psychiatry and mental illness. The knowledge of the attitude and awareness of the undergraduate medical students toward psychiatry, mental health, and psychiatric disorders are most important as they are going to be involved in the care of these patients either directly or indirectly during the later years of their careers. Aim: This study aims to assess attitude toward psychiatry and mental illness among undergraduate medical students. Methodology: The responses of 67 medical students from the 6th semester (third professional year) batch who completed their 2-week clinical posting of psychiatry in 4th semester (i.e., second professional year) were collected using validated questionnaires, attitude towards mental illness (AMI), and attitude towards psychiatry (ATP) that assessed their attitudes to psychiatry and mental illness. Double data entry and validation were done using EpiData and analysis using Epi Info software. Results: Median AMI score was 54 (out of maximum 100) showing a neutral AMI. Median ATP score was 82 (out of maximum 150) also showing a neutral ATP. The theme-wise analysis showed that the attitude of students toward psychiatrist and psychiatry branch was relatively better compared to their AMI. Conclusion: Undergraduate students have a neutral attitude to psychiatry and mental illness. More efforts are needed to change the attitude to favorable side.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION
LA  - English
AB  - This study investigates how different character perspectives (a main vs. supporting character) impact story-consistent attitudes and beliefs and how that effect varies as a function of modality (mobile phone vs. VR headset) in an immersive story for preventing binge drinking. Results of a controlled experiment (N = 147) showed that participants assuming the perspective of a binge drinker (the main character) reported less negative attitudes toward binge drinking and less perceived severity of binge drinking than those assuming the perspective of a non-binge drinking friend (the supporting character). Moreover, participants who watched the story in VR headsets (vs. phones) reported greater perceived susceptibility of binge drinking. A moderated mediation effect was found, suggesting that psychological reactance significantly mediated the effect of perspective on attitudes when the immersive story was viewed in phones. This study highlights the importance of character perspective and viewer's modality when designing immersive stories for health.

AB  - Trait body shame impacts psychological health, but its influence on physical health heretofore has not been examined. While body shame may be expected to impact physical health through many mechanisms, this investigation tested whether trait body shame predicts physical health outcomes by promoting negative attitudes toward bodily processes, thereby diminishing health evaluation and ultimately impacting physical health. Correlational (Study 1, N = 177) and longitudinal (Study 2, N = 141) studies tested hypotheses that trait body shame would predict infections, self-rated health, and symptoms, and that body responsiveness and health evaluation would mediate these relationships. In Study 1, trait body shame predicted all three poor health outcomes, and body responsiveness and health evaluation mediated these relationships. Study 2 partially replicated these results while controlling for depression, smoking, and BMI, and longitudinal analyses supported the temporal precedence of trait body shame in the proposed model. Limitations and alternative pathways are discussed.

AB  - This article presents the results of a content study of how nanotechnology has been framed in Danish national newspapers by taking a random sample of 250 articles published between 1996 and 2006 from a population of 1,062 articles. The articles were analyzed for "dominant frame" and "dominant tone" with respect to risks and benefits of nanotechnology. The findings demonstrate a remarkable positive tone in the articles with a ratio of ten to one in favor of "benefits outweigh risks" versus "risks outweigh benefits." Using data from this content study the author analyzes patterns of newspaper attention and framing. The data are used in a comparative study to challenge simplistic narratives of general similarities and differences between European and US contexts, making a claim for paying more attention to local cultural and national contexts in studies of media coverage of emerging technologies.

AB  - We aimed to assess the Iranian people's attitude and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, their concerns about the safety of vaccines, and their reasons for accepting or rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study with a mixed qualitative-quantitative approach from December 2020 to February 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of a COVID-19 vaccine attitude questionnaire, a COVID-19 vaccine confidence inventory, a modified vaccine safety scale, and questions about participants' decision to accept or refuse the COVID-19 vaccine, and their explanations for their decisions. The research included 1928 people with an average age of 34.88 years with 1236 (64.1%) being female. A total of 1330 participants desired to have the COVID-19 vaccine (69%). Female gender, lower educational levels, following COVID-19 news through sources other than websites and social media, not following COVID-19 news, and loss of a first-degree relative due to COVID-19 were all associated with a more negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.01). To conclude, the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among Iranians is comparable to the international average; however, it is still unfavorable. There are serious challenges to the vaccination program in Iran, such as older adults' lower intention to undergo the COVID-19 vaccine and misinformation.

AB  - This study presents findings from a randomized control trial replication evaluation of Pulse, an app-based pregnancy prevention program implemented with Black and Latinx women aged 18-20, a population with high rates of unplanned pregnancy. We used social media advertisements to enroll 1013 women online across the U.S. and automatically randomized participants to either the Pulse reproductive health app or a general health control app, stratifying by age and race/Latinx ethnicity. Participants received reminder text messages to view the app as well as text messages with app-related content throughout the intervention. Linear probability models were conducted on the analytic sample of 871 participants who completed the six-week survey and 798 who completed the six-month survey and adjusted for permuted block randomization and multiple hypothesis testing. Compared to the control group, intervention group participants had higher contraceptive knowledge (p = 0.000), which replicates findings from an earlier evaluation. However, these impacts were not sustained at six-month follow-up (p = 0.162). We found no other significant program impacts. This contrasts with an earlier evaluation that found intervention participants were less likely to have had sex without a hormonal or long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) method and had greater self-confidence to use contraception consistently than the control group. Different demographic characteristics, lower app usage, and more negative attitudes about and usage of hormonal/LARC contraception in the current sample may help to explain fewer impacts than the earlier evaluation.

AB  - Recent research highlights the significant role of political ideological identities in America's increasing political polarisation. In line with social identity theory, self-placement as a US liberal or conservative predicts favouritism toward the ideological in-group and negative attitudes and behaviours toward the outgroup. The theory also holds that the link between self-categorisation and behaviour is mediated by the content of that identity, by what an individual believes it means to be a member of that group. Although previous research has done much to analyse the differences between US liberals and conservatives on various a priori dimensions, little work has been aimed at gaining a holistic account of ideological identity content from the individual's lay perspective. Through qualitative analysis of 40 interviews (20 liberals and 20 conservatives), this study identifies central themes in the meaning self-identified US liberals and conservatives attribute to these labels and finds evidence for asymmetrical constructions of these identities. The liberal participant group's identity construction revolved around identification as, and concern for, individuals, supported by reference to personal values and political issues and underpinned by a motivation to move toward a more equal society. Conversely, the conservative participant group connected the understanding of their identity directly to the political ideology of the nation through a thread of self-reliance and reverence for the national group. Implications for political behaviour and the study of ideological identity are discussed.

AB  - Based on comparative qualitative research in five local authority areas, this article argues that local context is key to understanding the roots of the U.K.'s crisis of political trust and the result of the 2016 E.U. referendum. The competing cultural and economic causes of discontent suggested by the literature were found to be deeply intertwined when analyzed from a local perspective. The sense of political disempowerment and negative attitudes toward migration were ingrained in and reinforced by locally specific socio-economic and political trajectories. These experiences were articulated and amplified by dominant discourses, which channeled frustration against the political elite and the E.U. These populist narratives, promoted by the Leave campaign and the tabloid press, became dominant in certain areas, decisively shaping citizens' voting behavior. Overall, the article highlights the value of studying how local experiences and interpretations mediate the interplay of cultural and economic causes of discontent and political distrust.

AB  - The novel human coronavirus (COVID-19) began in Wuhan China as an interstitial pneumonia of unidentifiable origin in December 2019 and thereafter spread its tentacles all over the world. There is a need for radiology departments in both government and private facilities to be prepared to meet this crisis. Their efforts should be geared not only toward diagnosis, but also to preventing patient-to-patient, staff-to-patient, and staff-to-staff transmission of infection by utilizing social distancing measures and personal protective equipment (PPE). Aim: To evaluate the preparedness of radiologic departments of government hospitals and private centers, by assessing the outlay of the facility and likelihood to attend to COVID patients, type of equipment in the centers, and plans in place for protection of staff and the public. Materials and Methods: The radiology departments of government and private facilities in each geopolitical zone of the country were randomly selected to discuss radiology preparedness in Nigeria using preset guidelines which were sent to radiologists at the facilities. Written informed consent was obtained from the radiologists at the participating centers. Ethical approval was also obtained from the Lagos University Teaching Hospital Health Research Ethics Committee. Results: A total of twelve centers were included in the study, comprising eight government and four private centers. All had plans in place to attend to COVID patients; majority were in the process of developing standard operating procedures (SOPs). Majority of the government facilities lacked mobile equipment and adequate PPEs, with only one computed tomography machine and no holding area in some of the facilities for symptomatic patients unlike the private facilities. They, however, had infection control teams in place. Conclusion: Private radiological centers appear better prepared and more equipped to cope with the crisis than government hospitals. Adequate PPEs, mobile equipment, and isolation rooms need to be provided for the government facilities. Radiology information systems should be installed for remote viewing. Training and retraining on COVID management and decontamination should be conducted periodically. SOPs should be drafted universally and modified for each facility.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of social media within the context of heterosexual Black teen girls' romantic partner selection processes. To better understand Black teen girls' experiences, five focus groups (N = 27; aged 14-18 years) were conducted over Zoom. An inductive thematic analysis revealed four major themes: (1) the use of different platforms to gather different types of information, (2) the rules of social media scouting, (3) detecting partner qualities through social media, and (4) exploring Black teen girls' experience with social media and dating. Participants in our study primarily used Instagram to understand a potential partner's true self, while Twitter was used to assess a potential partner's political leanings. Our participants shared numerous "rules" related to the partner-scouting process. Black teen girls in our study explained that photos index a potential partner's style and hygiene, while memes were used to gauge sense of humor compatibility. More specific to Black teen girls, across all focus groups, participants shared their experiences of racism and bias, such as being associated with Black stereotypes, cultural invalidation, and being accused of "acting White." Although teen girls of various racial and ethnic groups may use social media to vet romantic partners, findings reveal that Black teen girls navigate social media in a unique way, including being highly attuned to signs of bias. Our findings suggest that in the first few months of COVID-19 social distancing had little impact on our participant's practice of using social media to vet potential romantic partners.

AB  - Despite increasing efforts to implement legislative gender quotas, many countries still encounter substantial popular opposition to this policy. Previous work cannot explain why opposition to legislative gender quotas persists, particularly among young men, a group believed to be open to diversity. We develop and test a theoretical framework linking group threat to men's attitudes toward legislative gender quotas. While the salience of perceived group threat could trigger men's opposition to legislative gender quotas, we expect that this effect will be more profound among young men due to the heightened degree of economic insecurity experienced by younger generations. Using original survey experiments in South Korea, this study demonstrates the strong influence of group threat in the formation of negative attitudes toward legislative gender quotas among young men. These effects, however, are not mediated by traditional gender norms. Our findings have significant implications for the study of gender and politics and democratic representation.

AB  - This study examined how maternal employment status during the first year of a child's life influenced later attachment quality. A sample of 1,364 mothers participated in the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development was categorized into five groups including consistent working, transition to working, transition to nonworking, consistent nonworking, and multiple transitions. Results supported the hypothesized model by showing two interrelated mediating mechanisms of depressive symptoms and maternal sensitivity. Mothers who have not worked consistently and experienced transition to nonworking showed higher levels of depressive symptoms when compared with mothers who have worked consistently, which in turn negatively influenced maternal sensitivity. Tests of moderated mediation indicated that among nonworking mothers, only those with negative attitudes toward employment showed lower levels of depressive symptoms compared with the consistent working group. Findings suggest different mechanisms involved in the relationship between early maternal employment and the development of secure attachment.

AB  - This study presents a systematic comparison of two alternative measures of citizens' perceptions of risks and benefits of emerging technologies. By focusing on two specific issues (nanotechnology and biofuels), we derive several insights for the measurement of public views of science. Most importantly, our analyses reveal that relying on global, single-item measures may lead to invalid inferences regarding external influences on public perceptions, particularly those related to cognitive schema and media use. Beyond these methodological implications, this analysis suggests several reasons why researchers in the area of public attitudes toward science must revisit notions of measurement in order to accurately inform the general public, policymakers, scientists, and journalists about trends in public opinion toward emerging technologies.

Higher anxiety is associated with less-favorable outgroup attitudes. We hypothesized that this meditational association would be moderated by frequency of mindfulness and contemplative practices. Study 1 surveyed Christian, Hindu, and Muslim college students in India regarding their frequency of practices, intergroup contact, intergroup anxiety, and attitudes (i.e., favorability and trait ratings) about primary and secondary outgroups. Study 2 measured these same variables with White/European, African, and Hispanic American adults. The results showed that participants that reported higher intergroup anxiety reported more negative outgroup attitudes. This relationship, however, was moderated by mindfulness-type practices: among participants who frequently engaged in these practices, this association was reduced compared with those who reported little or no mindfulness-type practices. The findings suggest that mindfulness and contemplative practices may help people regulate feelings of intergroup anxiety, which may in turn reduce the likelihood that intergroup anxiety exacerbates negative attitudes toward outgroups.

AB  - Background: Through the extensive use of public media, the government of England was heavily involved in encouraging and instructing people on how to manage their life during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). This model of health emergency governance replicates the practice of 'calculative technologies' and 'bio-politics' embedded in population management. Previous research on COVID-19 governance both in the United Kingdom and beyond provides varied revelations on broader 'technologies of government' and bio-politics by numerous governments. However, rarely have any studies explicitly and distinctively highlighted the unique 'calculative technologies' mobilised by governments within their bio-politically designed "technologies of government" to compel the populations to manage their lives under their COVID-19 guidance. The paper therefor examines how the UK government deployed "calculative technologies," as part of its strategies of health governance and governmentality during the first wave of COVID-19 in England. Methods: This study uses document analysis as its data collection method. Its review includes documents, press releases, social media disclosures and health guidance issued by the UK government from March to December, 2020. The data are analysed employing the Foucault's governmentality and bio-political scholarship. Results: The paper's findings reveal the UK government's use of integrated calculative technologies of self-governance in the form of risk calculations and metrices/statistics (eg, death tolls, infection rates), performance management (eg, two metre social distancing, and hand washing for twenty seconds) and discipline and control (eg, fourteen days self-isolation), in addition to a more conventional top-down, managerial decision-making process adopted in the past. By these newly initiated "calculative technologies," the government has "bio-politically" governed the behaviours and lifestyles of vulnerable community members, health workers and general public at a distance, inculcating self-management and individualisation of responsibility. Conclusion: The newly adopted calculative technologies used by the UK government created a multi-faceted discourse of obligations, entitlements and scale of engagement, and facilitated directions about what people should do to protect themselves and others from the spread of the virus. Overall, the overtly and idiosyncratically used calculative technologies resemble a unique 'art of government' and produce a set of 'bio-political' interventions enforcing the populations to manage their own wellbeing and governing them at a distance during COVID-19.

AB  - This study explored the impact of advertisements featuring individuals either with or without a physical disability on attitudes towards sexuality and disability. In addition, the authors sought to determine whether there is a relationship between these attitudes and endorsement of traditional versus egalitarian gender role beliefs. A total of 707 online participants completed the Gender Role Belief Scale, then rated a series of ads featuring individuals with or without a disability (or served as a no ad control), and completed the Attitudes toward Sexuality Questionnaire and Perceptions of Sexuality Scale. Results demonstrated a complex relationship between gender role beliefs and exposure to advertisements on attitudes towards the sexuality of women and men with physical disabilities. As hypothesized, the endorsement of traditional gender role beliefs was related to more negative attitudes towards the sexuality of women with physical disabilities.

AB  - Though not having children is no longer as unusual as it once was, voluntary childlessness is still a controversial choice that might generate moral outrage against people who choose not to have children. The current study explored the associated factors related to the attitudes towards voluntary childlessness in a sample of 418 adults aged 18 to 82 (M = 28.94, SD = 12.63, 76.1% females). Specifically, we investigated the links between participants' attitudes toward benevolent and hostile sexism, religiosity, and a series of demographic variables (i.e., age, gender, education, relationship status, and parental status). Based on previous related literature, we hypothesized that sexism would mediate the relationship between religiosity and voluntary childlessness. Results suggested that older and married participants with children had more negative attitudes related to voluntary childlessness. Additionally, overall sexism and its two dimensions (hostile and benevolent sexism) partially mediated the relationship between religiosity and attitudes towards voluntary childlessness. The practical implications of these results are discussed in light of Romania's cultural and socio-economic context, a post-communist country and the most religious state in Europe.

AB  - Background School closure is one of the main policies of global health care strategies performed worldwide. Despite all benefits, there might be some threats for younger groups spending their time in quarantine. This study aims to determine the impacts of lockdown and school closure on children's major lifestyle aspects, especially their leisure and sleep pattern during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods For the purpose of this study, an online questionnaire was distributed from 14th to 31st of March 2020 among the schools and students from the first grade to the 12th grade (before university) in Fars province, southern Iran. The questionnaire consisted of five sections which included data regarding the students' general information, activity priorities, adherence to quarantine, attitude toward school closure, and sleep patterns. Results In our study, 20,697 filled questionnaires were received from the participants with an average age of 13.76 years; 29.7% of them were male, 80.6% were from urban areas, and 83.3% were from public schools. The overall first preference of students during school closure was mobile and computer games (30.1%), followed by studying (26.6%) and watching television (13.8%). Our results demonstrated that the majority of students adhered to social distancing and there was also a significant correlation among education levels and desire for schools to be closed till the end of the semester (P = 0.015). Also, regarding sleep patterns, the majority (53.5%) had above 12 h of sleep throughout the day. Conclusion It seems that lockdown following COVID-19 pandemic has changed various aspects of the students' lifestyle remarkably, especially by increasing screen time and even sleep duration and pattern. We believe that certain strategies should be implemented by the Health and Educational Ministry to control not only the visible side effects of the quarantine period, but also the collateral consequences on their psychological and mental health.

AB  - The free press performs essential democratic functions, but widespread negative attitudes toward the press threaten its legitimacy and effectiveness as a check on formal institutions. In order to combat these attitudes, media organizations must understand who holds them and why. A survey-based study of U.S. adults (N = 2052) focuses on associations between perceptions of the news media industry as a threat to political performance and a range of politically oriented behaviors (i.e. news media exposure, political talk, political participation). Analyses reveal a series of non-monotonic relationships. Group differences between those who hold the most extreme views concerning news-media-as-threat are also explored. The opposing groups are distinct in some important ways (e.g. ideology, race), but are also found to be surprisingly similar (e.g. income, education, gender, news media exposure). The results suggest new strategies for maintaining and restoring confidence in media organizations.

AB  - Although one of the most severe forms of bias all over Europe, anti-Roma prejudice has been neglected within social psychology. We argue that anti-Roma attitudes need to be recognized as a unique form of prejudice because (a). they reflect socially approved dominant societal norms, (b) intergroup contact increases rather than decreases prejudice, and (c) not just negative stereotyping, but also cultural distancing of Roma people is a form of social exclusion. We developed an integrative Attitudes Toward Roma Scale (ATRS) based on existing measures and theoretical assumptions about prejudice toward Roma people. We conducted a study (N = 1082) relying on student and community samples in Hungary and Slovakia. Exploratory factor analysis revealed and confirmatory factor analysis supported the structural equivalence of a three-factor solution of the 16-item scale, consisting of Blatant Stereotyping, Undeserved Benefits, and Cultural Difference.
   Our findings confirmed that intergroup contact with Roma people is associated with more negative attitudes, and prejudice is mostly expressed in blatantly negative ways, made possible by social contexts that approve of these beliefs. The analysis also revealed that essentialist, romanticized ideas of cultural differences between Roma and non-Roma populations contribute to the psychological distancing of Roma people from the national ingroup.

   What is known on the subject?
   People in their twenties, including college students, experience a high level of stress and prevalence of related mental health problems including depression, anxiety and alcohol addiction, but they are the least likely age group in Korea to utilize professional help for mental health issues.
   Mental health literacy (MHL) refers to the knowledge and abilities necessary for maintaining mental health and preventing mental health problems. MHL also plays an important role in help-seeking for mental health issues. Therefore, studying MHL and other variables related to help-seeking is likely to enhance our overall understanding of students' mental health.
   What this study adds to existing knowledge?
   Although there have been some studies of college students' MHL in Korea, this is the first study to identify the paths and relationships between MHL and help-seeking intentions in Korean college students. Additionally, this study examined the mediating role of stigma in the relationship between MHL and attitudes toward help-seeking.
   The findings of this study suggest that MHL promotion can have a positive impact on the mental health of Korean college students by improving their attitudes toward help-seeking and increasing their help-seeking intentions.
   This study supports the idea that increased social support among Korean college students may reduce stigma and facilitate their seeking of professional help.
   The paths and relationships found in the present study provide evidence that a nursing intervention on-campus that improves students' MHL and reduces stigma may facilitate more effective use of help-seeking services among college students.
   What are the implications for practice?
   MHL plays a significant role in how college students manage their mental health and the likelihood that they will seek professional help for mental health issues. Increasing MHL reduces mental health-related stigma and promotes positive attitudes toward help-seeking. A mental health nursing intervention that includes MHL improvement strategies would likely enhance students' utilization of mental health services on campus.
   Although students' MHL is improved by existing campus programmes and educational efforts to raise awareness of mental health, interventions should also address campus culture and stigma to facilitate mental health help-seeking. Ultimately, enhancing MHL will contribute to the prevention of mental health problems and protect the deterioration of mental health among college students.
   Introduction
   There is a high prevalence of mental health problems among college students in Korea. Although the usage rate for mental health services among Korean college students was not reported, it is known that the usage rate for Koreans is low compared to that in the United States.
   Aim
   To explore the relationships linking mental health literacy (MHL) to intentions of help-seeking in a sample of Korean college students.
   Method
   Using a cross-sectional study, data from 200 participants were analysed using a structural equation modelling approach.
   Results
   Mental health literacy had both direct and indirect effects on attitudes toward help-seeking and an indirect effect on attitudes toward help-seeking through stigma. The direct effect of MHL on attitudes toward help-seeking was fully mediated by stigma.
   Discussion
   Mental health nursing professionals have a responsibility and a challenge to enhance MHL in college students through individual or group interventions.
   Implications for practice
   MHL plays a significant role in individuals' willingness to seek professional help when in need of mental health care. Thus, mental health nursing interventions that include MHL improvement strategies would favourably enhance students' use of adequate sources of care and contribute to the prevention of mental health problems in college students.

AB  - In recent years, scholars have argued that protests that employ nonviolent tactics attract greater support and are therefore more likely to succeed than those that use violence. We argue that how protest tactics are perceived is not a purely objective determination, but can be influenced in part by observer characteristics - in particular, by partisan identity. We conducted a survey experiment on two independent samples through the MTurk platform, randomly assigning protester group identity and tactics. Results show that when controlling for assigned tactics, self-identified Republicans but not Democrats perceive higher levels of violence when a disliked group is protesting. The effect is strongest in regard to tactics that are nominally the least disruptive. The findings have implications for theories of nonviolent protest, the legitimacy of repression, and the prospects for marginal groups to influence policy in polarized societies.

AB  - A wide variety of social media platforms have become integral to contemporary forms of social engagement, including mass protests. Twitter is considered specifically indicative of public attitudes in this regard. This study attempts to examine the feasibility of using Twitter sentiment analysis to predict the 2014 revolution in Ukraine. Tweets representing public opinion are clustered by means of the 'StreamKM++' algorithm into three classes (likely, neutral and unlikely). The resulting prediction model for the three classes (using Naive Bayes) was 96.75 per cent. As such, this study offers a promising way to perform an online prediction of social movements.

   Objective: The first objective of this paper was to describe the content and delivery of a single-session, internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention, which has been developed to help parents cope with children's anxiety and manage daily situations with their children. The second objective was to report user adherence and satisfaction among the first participants who completed the intervention.
   Methods: The Let's Cope Together intervention has been developed by our research group. It combines evidence-based CBT elements, such as psychoeducation and skills to manage anxiety, with parent training programs that strengthen how parents interact with their child and handle daily situations. A pre-post design was used to examine user satisfaction and the skills the parents learned. Participants were recruited using advertisements, media activity, day care centers, and schools and asked about background characteristics, emotional symptoms, and parenting practices before they underwent the iCBT. After they completed the 7 themes, they were asked what new parenting skills they had learned from the iCBT and how satisfied they were with the program.
   Results: Of the 602 participants who filled in the baseline survey, 196 (32.6%) completed the program's 7 themes, and 189 (31.4%) completed the postintervention survey. Most (138/189, 73.0%) of the participants who completed the postintervention survey were satisfied with the program and had learned skills that eased both their anxiety (141/189, 74.6%) and their children's anxiety (157/189, 83.1%). The majority (157/189, 83.1%) reported that they learned how to organize their daily routines better, and just over one-half (100/189, 53.0%) reported that the program improved how they planned each day with their children.
   Conclusions: The single-session iCBT helped parents to face the psychological demands of the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies should determine how the participation rate and adherence can be optimized in digital, universal interventions. This will help to determine what kinds of programs should be developed, including their content and delivery.

AB  - Background: Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as social distancing, school closures and travel restrictions are often implemented to control outbreaks of infectious diseases. For influenza in schools, the Center of Disease Control (CDC) recommends that febrile students remain isolated at home until they have been fever-free for at least one day and a related policy is recommended for SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19). Other authors proposed using a school week of four or fewer days of in-person instruction for all students to reduce transmission. However, there is limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of these interventions.
   Methods: We introduced a mathematical model of school outbreaks that considers both intervention methods. Our model accounts for the school structure and schedule, as well as the time-progression of fever symptoms and viral shedding. The model was validated on outbreaks of seasonal and pandemic influenza and COVID-19 in schools. It was then used to estimate the outbreak curves and the proportion of the population infected (attack rate) under the proposed interventions.
   Results: For influenza, the CDC-recommended one day of post-fever isolation can reduce the attack rate by a median (interquartile range) of 29 (13-59)%. With 2 days of post-fever isolation the attack rate could be reduced by 70 (55-85)%. Alternatively, shortening the school week to 4 and 3 days reduces the attack rate by 73 (64-88)% and 93 (91-97)%, respectively. For COVID-19, application of post-fever isolation policy was found to be less effective and reduced the attack rate by 10 (5-17)% for a 2-day isolation policy and by 14 (5-26)% for 14 days. A 4-day school week would reduce the median attack rate in a COVID-19 outbreak by 57 (52-64)%, while a 3-day school week would reduce it by 81 (79-83)%. In both infections, shortening the school week significantly reduced the duration of outbreaks.
   Conclusions: Shortening the school week could be an important tool for controlling influenza and COVID-19 in schools and similar settings. Additionally, the CDC-recommended post-fever isolation policy for influenza could be enhanced by requiring two days of isolation instead of one.

AB  - Public Policy Relevance Statement Making sense of the COVID-19 pandemic is challenging, due to the unprecedented nature of this event and its multiple personal, social, economic, and political implications. Yet, at the same time, the meanings we assign to the virus and to preventative measures around it have a significant impact on our daily life. Here, we analyze online memes about COVID-19 as a window into social thinking about the pandemic. This analysis helps us understand the range of meanings associated with the pandemic by social media users, the processes by which these meanings are created, their transformation over time, and their contribution to wider social representations and discourses of COVID-19.
   This study examines meaning-making in and through coronavirus memes, as part of broader representations of the pandemic circulating online. It also aims to make a broader conceptual contribution by advancing a theory of mimetic representation that considers memes to be cultural meaning units and, building on social representations theory, proposes objectification, anchoring, and identification as their 3 main constitutive processes. A content analysis that focuses on these processes was conducted on a systematically generated sample of 1,544 memes posted on Reddit's r/CoronavirusMemes between January and May 2020. We found that the pandemic is objectified most often in terms of protective measures (e.g., quarantine, social distancing) and transmission (e.g., coughing, traveling when sick); that it is anchored in popular media themes, followed by geography, politics, and history; and that, in terms of identification, most memes portrayed the self and/or in-group. Although, over time, memes displayed more objectification and less identification, the ones that did make reference to in- and out-groups were more commented on. These results suggest that analyses guided by the theory of mimetic representation can shed light on the dynamic nature of meaning-making processes on social media and the importance of memes in terms of framing wider societal debates as well as creating new identities, online and offline.

AB  - During the 2020 COVID-19 epidemic a variety of social activities migrated online, including religious ceremonies and rituals. One such instance is the case of Santo Daime, a Brazilian rainforest religion that utilizes the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca in its rituals. During the pandemic, multiple Santo Daime rituals involving the consumption of ayahuasca took place online, mediated through Zoom and other online platforms. The phenomenon is notable since the effects of hallucinogens are defined by context (set and setting) and Santo Daime rituals are habitually governed by punctilious regulations aimed at directing the experience of participants. The abrupt move to online space thus augurs significant implications in the context of hallucinogenic rituals. This paper looks at this development and its repercussions for entheogenic rituals, as it asks how do psychedelic rituals change when they move online? Building on the author's previous work on set and setting in the Santo Daime religion, the paper introduces accounts from 12 semi-structured interviews with daimistas participating in online daime rituals, approached through the prism of set and setting, and the study of online religiosity. The analysis points at several key dynamics emerging in the context of virtual rituals. The migration online allowed for the continuation of Santo Daime entheogenic rituals at a time of social distancing, fostered a sense of global brotherhood and opened new possibility for religious participation and learning. Concurrently, online ritual produced an impoverished ritual experience and novel types of challenges including a higher potential for distractions, technical difficulties, and low sensory fidelity. Other novel challenges included social anxiety and an in-built tension between the social and spiritual dimensions of ritual. Finally, some participants were concerned by the cultural context of online rituals: technological mediation, consumerism, commodification, and digital divide. The limitations of digital technology appear amplified by the highly immersive, body oriented, experientially intensified context of the psychedelic experience. This paper contributes to the literature on the extra-pharmacological factors shaping experiences with psychedelics, as well as to the literature on the consequences of the adoption of digital media technologies during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 is a novel type of the coronavirus family with an incompletely described clinical course. Little is known about the psychological aspects, particularly for vulnerable populations including pregnant women. Objectives: To understand the attitude, concerns, and knowledge of the non-infected pregnant women toward the COVID-19 outbreak in order to constitute base data for detailed counseling and to develop targeted messages. Patients and methods: This cross-sectional survey research presented analysis of prospectively collected data yielded at a single tertiary "Coronavirus Pandemic Hospital" referral center for a ten days period following the first confirmed death due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey. Non-infected women with a confirmed pregnancy over 30th gestational week were consecutively included. A patient-reported non-validated questionnaire formed by the expert committee that includes 15 specific questions was used. Non-infected, pregnant women over 30th gestational week who applied to the outpatient clinic were consecutively included. A total of 213 women were enrolled, 37 were excluded: 7 for being in the first trimester, 3 were illiterate, and 27 were Syrian refugees having difficulties in translation. Results: A total of 172 pregnant women were included. Overall, four women refused to participate to the survey (1.9%). The mean age was 27.5 +/- 5.3 years. Median gestational week and parity were 35 +/- 11 weeks and 1 +/- 2, respectively. Pregnant women were observed to trust the authorities (65%) and the healthcare staff (92.4%), and their respect was increased (82.5%) during the outbreak. Majority of the women (87.2%) comply with the self-quarantine rules. Half of the women (52%) reported that they felt vulnerable and predominantly were concerned (80%). Approximately one-third of the women constantly keep thinking that they may get infected (35.5%) or they might get infected during/following the delivery or their baby might get infected after being born (42%). Half of the women (50%) were reported that they either had no idea about or think the breastfeeding is not safe during the outbreak. About 45% of the women were confused or had doubts about if the mode of delivery may be affected by the pandemic. Greater part of the participants does not know if COVID-19 might cause birth defects (76%) or preterm birth (64.5%). Counseling flow keys helping pregnant women to overcome misleads, regarding the COVID-19 outbreak is proposed. Conclusions: Non-infected pregnant women with a viable pregnancy at near term were observed to have positive attitude and compliance toward the COVID-19 outbreak and frontline healthcare staff; increased concern and vulnerability; and restricted knowledge about the pregnancy-related outcomes. While the clinical evidence was growing rapidly, this data may guide obstetricians and midwives to perceive what accurate information should be provided to the pregnant women.

   What is known about the subject?
   People with learning disability are more likely than the general population to develop schizophrenia.
   Personal recovery philosophies are based on positive attitudes and an optimism that recognizes and values people and their strengths and capacity to achieve goals.
   Little is known from previous studies about the illness perceptions of learning disability practitioners who work with people that experience both a learning disability and schizophrenia.
   The illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners about schizophrenia may mediate the potential for social exclusion and limit recovery outcomes.
   What this study/paper adds to existing knowledge?
   The findings show that the illness beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia are pessimistic in terms of the consequences for people with schizophrenia and learning disability and their relatives as well as the chronic course of the illness.
   What are the implications for clinical practice?
   This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and provides guidance about how personal recovery philosophies can be applied to the management of LD and schizophrenia.
   The beliefs of learning disability practitioners and support workers regarding schizophrenia need to be reframed to support better recovery outcomes and social inclusion for this group.
   The findings from this study can inform the development of training in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family/carer interventions, clinical supervision, mentorship and reflection on clinical practice, which could be potentially useful strategies to help facilitate a reframing of beliefs.
   Background and purpose of study: The prevalence of schizophrenia in people with learning disability is 3-4%. This is the first study to investigate the illness perceptions of learning disability (LD) practitioners towards people with schizophrenia. Methods: Learning disability practitioners (n = 210) that work with people with LD and schizophrenia completed a modified version of the Illness Perception Questionnaire Schizophrenia Carers Version (IPQ-SCV). Descriptive and correlational analyses were conducted for all of the IPQ-SCV subscales. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between consequences relative and consequences patient (0.495, P < 0.001), and a negative correlation was found between timeline episodic and timeline chronic (-0.243, P < 0.001) subscales. Discussion: Consistent with previous evidence found regarding negative staff attitudes to schizophrenia recovery outcomes, course and chronicity, the current investigation has extended and confirmed these observations to staff working with individuals with comorbid schizophrenia and learning disability. Implications for practice: This study identifies the nature of LD practitioner perceptions about schizophrenia and contributes to the development of the recovery philosophy in relation to the management of LD and schizophrenia. The findings inform the design of training modules in bio-psycho-social models of schizophrenia, recovery approaches, family intervention, clinical supervision and reflection. These can help LD practitioners to reframe their schizophrenia/LD illness beliefs.

AB  - Though India is no stranger to either epidemics or hate speech, the COVID-19 crisis brought to the surface many of the pre-existing schisms and prejudices that subsequently led to both the Muslim minority community and the Dalit community being cast as miasmic and constant agitators against the central government. In the case of hate speech against the Muslim community, it has led to a peculiar situation wherein the invisible but pervasive Islamophobia that has been plaguing the country from the colonial times has risen it ugly head particularly across regional news channels and social media networks, making the phenomena hyper-visible. The Hindutva(1) politicians from the extreme right parties have been indulging in spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, moulding the image of the Muslim community as not only disease-bearers and super-spreaders of COVID-19 virus but also as being anti-national, as the central government has proclaimed 'a war against the COVID virus' (The Print, 2020, 26 April).
   During the initial spread of the virus throughout the country, there was an increasing tendency to show the Muslim community as intentionally spreading the disease or as being ignorant of current medical practices, with multiple TV channels airing the views that the Tablighi jamaat event (a religious congregation held in March 2020) was marked as a super-spreader event, and with multiple politicians engaging in rumour-mongering and hate-speech against the Muslims, framing the community as a miasmic community that needs to be cleared from India.
   On the other hand, the hate speech against Dalits in India is much more nuanced, indirect and layered. It began as WhatsApp and Facebook messages extolling the caste system and justifying the discriminatory practice of untouchability(2 )using the logic of social distancing and progressed to painting Dalits and Dalit spaces as unhygienic disease-scapes. This consequently led to the denial of livelihoods to thousands of domestic workers and unskilled workers who belonged to lower caste groups as they found themselves without jobs as most middle caste upper caste families and business owners fired their employees without notice. The study involves a hermeneutical analysis of news reports of the spread of COVID from newspapers and electronic media in English as well as interviews with at least 100 members of groups on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that propagate extremely communal and casteist material.

AB  - Data governance has received research attention, but its effect on public attitude has not been sufficiently explored. To analyse the attitude towards public participation in data governance in the context of a tourism platform, we conduct an empirical model that aims to understand the impact of data governance environment and participants' cognitive ability on attitude. Taking tourism sharing platforms as an example, we collected 339 questionnaires for data analysis. Results show that data quality and website design have a positive effect on users' attitude towards data governance through data literacy self-efficacy. Data literacy self-efficacy has a suppression effect between data quality and attitude towards data governance and has the same effect between website design and attitude towards data governance. Data quality and website design have a positive effect on users' attitude towards data governance through platform interaction. Platform interactivity plays a mediating role between data quality and attitude towards data governance and has the same effect between website design and attitude towards data governance. Data policy has a positive effect on users' data literacy self-efficacy but no significant effect on platform interactivity. Moreover, this study provides theoretical and practical implications that can guide the government in policy implementation and platform managers in data governance.

AB  - The illegal use of prescription stimulants has become an established health risk among the college student population. To address this phenomenon, a student-driven campaign informed was developed, implemented, and evaluated on a college campus. The Rethink campaign involved traditional, print, and social media, as well as in-person events. To test the effectiveness of campaign messages, college students (N = 251) at an experimental site (n = 187) completed surveys before and after the campaign. Comparisons were made between pretest and posttest assessments, as well as to a control group (n = 64) of college students not exposed to the campaign. The Rethink campaign resulted in more negative attitudes toward prescription stimulant misuse, as well as decreased perceptions of descriptive norms. Practical implications for intervention designers and researchers are discussed in light of both the campaign's successes and failures.

AB  - Using a pretest-posttest and delayed recontact experimental design with a national sample, this study examines shifts in U.S. public attitudes about Syrian refugees after watching a topical satirical news segment on Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, compared with a CNN news segment. To investigate synergistic effects between satire and news, the design varied whether the news and comedy segments were viewed alone or in sequence (news before comedy or comedy before news). The results show that all four treatments (news only, comedy only, news-comedy, comedy-news) significantly increased support for refugees from pretest to posttest, and these effects were maintained after a 2-week delay. However, the effects were significantly greater in the three comedy conditions relative to news only. Finally, a serial mediation analysis demonstrated that perceived entertainment value is a positive mediator of comedy's persuasive effects and serves as a buffer against negative indirect effects through message discounting and argument quality.

AB  - The intervention of feminist activists and scholars in the last three decades has led not only to far greater sensitization of public attitudes concerning gender but also a series of laws and regulations to promote greater gender justice. However, these effects seem to be more prominent at the higher levels of the bureaucracy, judiciary, higher education and the English-language media than among the popularly mobilized opinion in the regions. This essay examines this disparity in terms of a distinction between the history of the Indian nation-state and the collective consciousness of the people-nation.

AB  - The development of electric vehicles (EVs) and autonomous vehicles (AVs) has made great progress and been expected to play an important role in a future transport system. Some researchers have explored the potential impacts of autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), while few have focused on the public attitude towards AEVs. This paper aims to understand the public acceptance of AEVs through the application of Technology Acceptance Model. Considering the potential environmental benefits of AEVs, this study concentrates on how environmental concern affects AEVs acceptance. Data is collected from an online survey in China and analyzed by a structural model. The results indicate that green perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and environmental concern have a positive relationship with people's intentions to use AEVs. Environmental concern poses a powerful indirect effect on using intention through mediating effects. Implications for improving the public acceptance of AEVs and suggestions for further research are given correspondingly in this study. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: This study evaluated the psychometric properties of the Korean version of the attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) Stigma Questionnaire (ASQ) and the effect of the source of information about mental health on ADHD stigma.
   Methods: The Korean translation of the ASQ was prepared, and 673 participants, 20-64 years of age, completed the questionnaire using an online panel survey in South Korea. The participants also completed questionnaires detailing sociodemographic variables and the source of their mental health knowledge. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was used to explore the internal consistency of the ASQ. Factor analysis using Varimax rotation was conducted to investigate the structure of the ASQ.
   Results: The 26-item ASQ demonstrated excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.940). Factor analysis supported a three-factor structure, including Concerns with Public Attitudes, Negative Self-Image, and Disclosure Concerns. There were no significant differences in the total ASQ scores according to sociodemographic characteristics. Participants who reported the internet as their major source of information about mental health showed higher ASQ scores compared to those who used other sources for mental health information.
   Conclusion: The Korean translation of the ASQ has acceptable psychometric properties among Korean adults. Inaccurate information from the internet could increase the stigma toward ADHD.

AB  - This study intended to test whether attachment to one's own residential place at neighborhood level could represent a coping response for the elderly (consistently with the "docility hypothesis;" Lawton, 1982), when dealing with the demands of unfamiliar environments, in order to balance their reduction of spatial abilities. Specifically, a sequential path was tested, in which neighborhood attachment was expected to play a buffer role between lowered spatial competence and neighborhood satisfaction. The participants (N = 264), senior citizens (over 65-year-old), responded to a questionnaire including the measures of spatial self-efficacy, spatial anxiety, attitude toward wayfinding, residential attachment and residential satisfaction. Results from the mediation analysis showed that a lower perceived spatial self-efficacy is associated to a higher spatial anxiety, and both promote a more negative attitude toward wayfinding tasks in non-familiar places. This leads to a higher attachment to one's own neighborhood, which in turn predicts a higher residential satisfaction. Thus, the "closure" response of becoming more attached to their residential place may be an adaptive strategy of the elderly for compensating the Person-Environment (P-E) mis-fit (Lawton and Nahemow, 1973) when they feel unable (or less able) to cope with the demands of unfamiliar environments.

AB  - Paternal involvement in parent training programs has been associated with greater maintenance of treatment gains, lower attrition rates, and less maternal stress. However, male caregivers are less likely to participate in behavioral parent training (BPT) programs than female caregivers. The present study examined (a) the differences between mothers and fathers in their attitudes toward seeking help for their children, and (b) whether parents' adherence to masculine gender role norms mediated the proposed relationship between parent sex and attitudes toward seeking psychological help for children. Fifty-two parents (women n = 26; men n = 26) completed the Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale (ATSPPHS), Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help Scale-Parent Form (ATSPPHS-P), Conformity to Masculine Norms Inventory (CMNI), and Eyberg Child Behavior Inventory (ECBI). Fathers had significantly poorer attitudes toward seeking mental health services for their children than mothers. Additionally, parents' conformity to masculine gender role norms correlated negatively and significantly with their attitudes toward help-seeking for their children. As expected, parents' conformity to masculine gender role norms mediated the relationship between parent sex and attitudes toward seeking help for children. These findings suggest that, regardless of sex, parents' adherence to masculine gender role norms may lead to negative attitudes toward seeking psychological help for their child.

AB  - Using content analysis, this study investigated the coverage of the Trojan Horse news story aiming to ascertain whether its representation by the British press emphasized 'Islamist extremism' over 'poor school governance'. The sample coverage was extracted from five national newspapers and ranged from 9 June (the date of release of the Ofsted Advice Note) to 26 June 2014. Our analysis shows that the coverage reported evidence of Islamist ideology much more frequently (61.5%) than evidence of poor governance (38.5%). This suggests that the Trojan Horse news story was predominantly represented as a case of Islamist extremism and therefore covered in an unbalanced manner. Such a partial coverage relied on ideological dualisms and negative stereotypes to represent Islam and Muslims, and on the textual strategy of selecting some features (extremism) whilst omitting others (governors' professional misconduct). This bias has arguably diverted attention away from systemic problems within the national school system whilst reinforcing Islamophobic discourses.

AB  - Background Beyond the sweeping physiological effects of COVID-19 infections in 2020 and 2021, the psychosocial impacts of lockdowns, social distancing, and the associated disruptions to daily life have brought on a simultaneous mental health crisis, particularly among many working mothers who are disproportionately balancing childcare, virtual schooling, and employment vulnerability. The aim of this study was to measure the mental health status of working mothers in the United States and associations with the provision of family-friendly employment benefits one year into the pandemic. Methods Cross-sectional data were collected from a sample of working mothers in the U.S. using an online survey of mental health status and the receipt of employer-provided family-friendly benefits. Mental health was measured with the Kessler 6 (K-6) and the Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS). Perceived helpfulness of benefits was assessed through self-reported Likert-scale scores of 0 (not at all helpful) to 4 (extremely helpful) to determine mean helpfulness scores for benefit types. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to determine associations between receipt of employment benefits and serious mental illness (SMI). Results A total of 728 participants met the study criteria, 83.7% were non-Hispanic/Latino white and 61.1% were 35-44 years of age. Among study participants, 54.3% (n = 395) and 21.8% (n = 159) reported psychological distress levels associated with moderate mental illness (MMI) and serious mental illness (SMI), respectively. Not receiving benefits was associated with a 50% increase in odds of SMI (aOR = 1.50, 95% CI [1.03-2.20], p = 0.036). Benefits perceived to be the most helpful for participants were flexible hours/schedule (3.5; SD +/- 0.9), flexible work location (3.3; SD +/- 1.1), and supplemental paid time off (3.1; SD +/- 1.1), with mean scores above very helpful. Conclusion Results suggest employment benefits may help support the mental health of working mothers and provide a call to action to employers and policy stakeholders to develop solutions addressing gaps in workplace benefits and mental health support for working parents, with sustainable reform in mind to mitigate employment benefit inequities exposed by the pandemic.

AB  - Background We are currently witnessing an ongoing drug overdose death epidemic in many nations linked to the distribution of illegally manufactured potent synthetic opioids. While many health policy makers and researchers have focused on the root causes and possible solutions to the current crisis, there has been little focus on the power of advocacy and community action by people who use drugs (PWUDs). Specifically, there has been no research on the role of PWUDs in engaging and influencing mass media opinion. Methods By relying on one of the longest and largest peer-run drug user advocacy groups in the world, the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), newspaper articles, television reports, and magazines that VANDU or its members have been directly involved in will be identified via two data bases (the Canadian Newsstream & Google News). The news articles and videos related to the health of PWUDs and issues affecting PWUDs from 1997 to the end of 2020 will be analyzed qualitatively using Nvivo software. Discussion As our communities are entering another phase of the drug overdose epidemic, acknowledging and partnering with PWUDs could play an integral part in advancing the goals of harm reduction, treatment, and human rights.

AB  - Surveys of Americans' views on the Zika virus allowed tests of overlapping but distinctive models of how culture affects risk responses: (1) a model inspired by the "solution aversion" (SA) hypothesis, which posits that cultural attitudes lower perceived risk when mediated by negative attitudes toward a hazard management option, and (2) the Affect Heuristic-Cultural Cognition Theory (AH-CCT) model, which posits that cultural biases can alter varied risk responses mediated by affect about the risk source or hazard. Dependent variables were personal and U.S. risk perceptions, judged need for U.S. action against Zika, and support for potential or actual Zika management options. Both models were supported, but the SA-based model (using value threat evoked by a management option as the affect mediator) was stronger overall and applied more to need and support judgments, while AH-CCT (using affect aroused by Zika as mediator) applied more to amplifying perceived risk. These results underline the value of parallel testing of models with multiple candidate measures of a limited number of concepts to enhance scientific understanding of factors affecting risk responses.

AB  - Examining the impact of various media sources on knowledge has a long tradition in political communication. Although much of the extant research focuses on the impact of traditional media on factual knowledge, research is expanding to include a variety of media sources and multiple dimensions of knowledge, in addition to understanding processes that better explain these relationships. Using a nationwide, opt-in online survey (n=993), we examine the relationship between partisan media and structural knowledge, which assess how interconnected people see political concepts. Utilizing understanding of the Affordable Care Act as the content area of interest, we examine whether exposure to partisan media has differential effects on attitudinal ambivalence-holding both positive and negative attitudes toward an object-based on the political ideology of the respondent, and whether this impact of ambivalence influenced structural knowledge. Our results show that exposure to attitude-consistent media decreased attitudinal ambivalence. This exposure to attitude-consistent media results in a positive indirect effect on structural knowledge through this decrease in ambivalence. We find the reverse effect for use of attitude-inconsistent media.

AB  - Background Young adults are not considered a risk group, but the public health response to COVID-19 impacts all citizens. We investigated the impact on young adults' and their adherence to containment measures addressing potential gender differences. Methods In April 2020 12 341 students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences were invited to a longitudinal health survey. Survey topics spanned socio-demographic data, students' health status and behavior, COVID-19 specific impact, concerns, information sources, adherence to containment measures, and trust in government bodies. Group comparisons by gender and multivariate ordinal regression models assessing adherence to restrictions of mobility and social contacts were conducted (n=2373). Results Mean age was 26.4 (SD=5.6), 70% were female. 43.5% reported some concern about their own health, 2.7% stated major worries. Women experienced more conflicts (p < 0.000) and, enjoyed time with the family more (p < 0.000). Men felt less locked up (p = 0.001). The most frequented COVID-19 information source was public media (48%) and confidence in government bodies was high (82%) for both genders. Men yielded lower adjusted odds (OR; 95%-CI) of adherence regarding the following measures: social distancing (0.68; 0.53-0.87), non-utilization of public transport (0.74; 0.56-0.97), 5-person limit for social gatherings (0.47; 0.35-0.64) and the stay at home rule (0.64; 0.51-0.82). Conclusion Early in the pandemic a high degree of adherence was observed in this young academic population. Containment measures restricting movement and social contact yielded considerable differences by gender, information source and perceived susceptibility to the virus. More targeted communication may increase adherence regarding mobility restrictions.

AB  - The primary purpose of these studies was to investigate associations between religiosity, political ideology, and attitudes toward immigrants using a mediation path-analytic approach. Respondents in two nationally representative samples of Americans (Studies 1 and 2) completed single items assessing general religiosity, political ideology, and immigrant prejudice. University students (Studies 3 and 4) completed measures of religious fundamentalism (RF), political ideology, and perceived realistic and symbolic threats posed by immigrants. Across the four studies, there were small to medium positive relationships between measures of religiosity and prejudice toward immigrants and consistent evidence that religiosity influences immigrant prejudice through political ideology (i.e., significant indirect relationships). None of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) included zero for total or indirect effects of religiosity on immigrant prejudice. However, when liberal political ideology was included as the mediator, the relationship between religiosity and immigrant prejudice weakened to statistical and practical nonsignificance. These four studies reveal the role political ideology plays in associations between measures of religiosity and attitudes toward immigrants.

AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

AB  - The government of India implemented social distancing interventions to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. However, effects of these interventions on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (R-t) were estimated for 7 periods (Pre-lockdown, Lockdown Phases 1 to 4 and Unlock 1-2) according to nationally implemented interventions with phased relaxation. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID-19 are presented. Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 285.60/10 million people across 7 discrete periods in India. From 18 May to 31 July 2020, the NCT of Delhi had the highest case rate (999/10 million people/day), whereas Madhya Pradesh had the lowest (49/10 million/day). AverageR(t)was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93-2.06) and 1.39 (95% CI 1.38-1.40) for the entirety of India during the period from 22 March 2020 to 17 May 2020 and from 18 May 2020 to 31 July 2020, respectively. Median mobility in India decreased in all contact domains during the period from 22 March 2020 to 17 May 2020, with the lowest being 21% in retail/recreation, except home which increased to 129% compared to the 100% baseline value. Median mobility in the 'Grocery and Pharmacy' returned to levels observed before 22 March 2020 in Unlock 1 and 2, and the enhanced mobility in the Pharmacy sector needs to be investigated. The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic progression in India. The identified daily COVID-19 case rates andR(t)will aid national and state governments in formulating ongoing COVID-19 containment plans. Furthermore, these findings may inform COVID-19 public health policy in developing countries with similar settings to India.

AB  - Background and Purpose: University students are young and are thus at a critical period of adopting healthy behaviors. Their life-style exposes them to a high rate of consuming fast food. In the long run, they are faced with higher chances of obesity and risk of affliction with diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. The present research aims to explore university students' attitude towards fast food consumption based in the Prototype/Willingness model. Materials and methods: The present research followed a qualitative approach and a directed content analysis in 2018-19 among students affiliated with Rafsanjan universities. The participants were selected through purposeful sampling. A semi-structured interview was held with 20 students and it went on until data satiation occurred. The qualitative content analysis was done through Graneheim and Lundman method. Results: Analysis of university students' experience of fast food consumption led to the extraction of 2 categories, 16 sub-categories and 65 final codes. The main theme was attitude for which the following subcategories were extracted: pleasure in consumption, fast preparation, inability to cook, lethargy, low cost, inadequate monitoring, Indulgence, bringing excuses, lack of knowledge, optimism in one's health, consumeristic media, disorganized student life. For the negative attitude category, the following sub-categories were considered: attempts to provide healthy food, hated to fast food

AB  - Although it is well known that families of children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are at risk for increased stress and other problems, little is known about what child characteristics may mediate that risk. To address the impact of child behavior problems on family health, we examined data collected from 136 families raising children with ASD. Children were divided into groups based on parent responses to the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL): low versus high internalizing and low versus high externalizing behavior problems. Family functioning was measured using the Family Impact Questionnaire, Revised (FIQ-R). Results of ANCOVA analyses indicated significant group differences in FIQ-R domains of Negative Attitudes About Parenting, Social Relationships, Sibling Impact, and Impact to Marriage when comparing externalizing behaviors. None of the FIQ-R domains demonstrated group differences when comparing internalizing behaviors. Correlation coefficients indicated moderately strong associations between higher externalizing behaviors and poorer family functioning, with the most significant associations among child behavior and increased negativity in parenting perceptions and poorer social functioning. This study provides information regarding co-occurring behaviors that have the strongest negative association with family functioning and the domains of family functioning most vulnerable to the severity of such behaviors.

AB  - Are Muslims portrayed more negatively than other religious groups? If so, what factors are associated with this negativity? We apply computer-assisted, lexicon-based coding to over 850,000 articles that mention Muslims, Hindus, Jews, or Catholics in 17 national and regional US newspapers over the 20-year period of 1996-2015 and compare them to a representative baseline of articles. We show that the average tone of articles about Muslims is considerably more negative than both this baseline and compared to articles about the other groups. The negative tone is most strongly associated with stories about extremism and events in foreign settings. However, even controlling for a wide range of factors does not eliminate the negativity in stories mentioning Muslims. We discuss the implications of these findings for media objectivity and for public attitudes and policy preferences with respect to Muslims and other social groups.

AB  - Our goal was to address the safety of major gynaecologic cancer surgery without routine preoperative COVID-19 testing in the COVID-19 era. The databases of seven gynaecologic cancer centres were searched in order to identify all consecutive gynaecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery between March 11, 2020 and May 15, 2020 for this retrospective, case-control study. The case group consisted of patients with histopathologically confirmed gynaecologic cancers, and each case was matched with two counterparts who had undergone primary surgery before the COVID-19 pandemic. The case and the control groups were compared in terms of length of hospital stay, admission to the intensive care unit (ICU), intraoperative and postoperative complications. During the study period, 154 women with gynaecologic cancer undergoing major surgery were identified. Although the case group had more co-morbidities compared to the control group (103/154 vs. 178/308, respectively; p = .04), the median length of hospital stays, the rate of ICU admission, intraoperative complication rates and postoperative complication rates were similar in the two groups. Gynaecologic cancer surgery may be performed safely in the COVID-19 era with similar rates of ICU admission, intraoperative and postoperative complications compared to the patients operated before the COVID-19 pandemic.IMPACT STATEMENT What is already known on this subject? Many societies have announced their guidelines about the surgical management of gynaecologic cancer patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, most of them are not evidence-based and mostly on expert opinions. What do the results of this study add? The main findings of this retrospective, case-control study indicate that the short-term (30 day) outcomes of gynaecologic cancer patients undergoing major surgery in the COVID-19 era are similar to those who had been operated before the COVID-19 pandemic. The length of hospital stays, the rates of admission to the ICU, intraoperative and postoperative complications were comparable between women undergoing major gynaecologic cancer surgery in the COVID-19 era and the women who had been operated before the pandemic. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? We can suggest that definitive surgery may be performed for gynaecologic cancer patients in the COVID-19 era if the resources permit and appropriate precautions such as social distancing, isolation and the use of personal protective equipment are taken.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 lockdown period in the United Kingdom that began on March 23, 2020, more than a quarter of a million people with cancer reported worsening mental health. Help to Overcome Problems Effectively (Hope) is a self-management program for people with cancer, designed to provide support for distress, unmet needs, and poor psychological health. In light of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, digital delivery of the Hope Programme has become ever more vital for people with cancer. Previous pre-post studies of the digital Hope Programme have found reduced anxiety and depression and improved well-being for people with cancer. However, evaluation of this evidence has been limited by the lack of a control group in these previous studies.
   Objective: We now present a protocol for a feasibility randomized controlled trial of the digital Hope Programme for people with cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic. Primary outcomes will be recruitment, dropout, and adherence rates, and estimations of sample and effect size. To detect signals of efficacy, secondary outcomes will be participant mental health and well-being.
   Methods: Participants will be recruited by Macmillan Cancer Support (MCS) through their social media networks. The study will employ a feasibility wait-list randomized controlled trial (RCT) design, with people with cancer being randomized to join the digital Hope Programme immediately (intervention group [IG]) or join a 6-week waiting list (wait-list control group [WLCG]) with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants will complete digital measures of depression, anxiety, mental well-being, and confidence in managing their own health. Online questionnaires will be administered preprogram and 6 weeks postprogram.
   Results: All people who had requested access to the Hope Programme from MCS (N=61) will be invited to participate in the trial. Baseline data collection commenced in April 2020, and the Hope Programme began for the IG in May 2020 and for the WLCG in June 2020. Postprogram data collection was completed by the end of August 2020.
   Conclusions: This feasibility study will provide data to inform the design of a future definitive trial. Wider-scale provision of the digital Hope Programme has potential to improve the lives of thousands of people with cancer and reduce the burden on health care providers during these unprecedented times.

AB  - Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) at all levels have an ultimate goal of building strong and positive images for their destinations. However, the projected image from the supply side is not necessarily the mirror of the perceived image from the demand side. This study adopted the content analysis method to evaluate the projected image and perceived image of rural destinations in China to see whether there is any discrepancy between and within the two categories. Comparative analysis of different information sources including web contents and on-site visitor interviews were processed. The evaluation of image congruency demonstrates that official websites focus more on cognitive image elements (knowledge and beliefs of the place). Besides promoting attractions, it provides information on geography background and promotes local culture. Business web content promotes attractions, package tour, and activities which can generate revenue. The perceived image includes more sentiment contents: on-site visitors expressed more negative attitude, but social media comments are relatively positive.

AB  - Background: December 2019 witnessed an outbreak of coronavirus disease. This disease soon intensified its spread as a pandemic engulfing the health and economic status of countries worldwide. The route of transmission of this virus is through droplet spread or contact with secretions or infected surfaces. The health-care professionals were the most vulnerable group for contracting and spreading the infection. The dental professionals who come in close contact with oral secretions during various operative procedures were also at high risk of contracting the infection. Governments across the globe issued a lockdown to curtail the spread of the infection. To render essential and emergency health services, teleconsultation provided a lot of assistance in health management. Methodology: A descriptive cross-sectional study utilizing a validated questionnaire survey was used to assess the perceptions of dental health professionals regarding the utility of teleconsultation during the pandemic. The survey also assessed the drawbacks of teleconsultation and its implications on practice in the near future. 504 dentists answered the questionnaire and descriptive statistical analyses were used to analyze the data. Results: The response rate was 63% (504 out of 800). 90.1% of the dentists felt that teleconsultation was definitely better than traditional care services during the pandemic. Majority (61.15%) of dentists felt that teleconsultation was extremely helpful during the pandemic period to manage patient-related queries and provided the satisfaction of discharging their duties toward the patient. They felt that teleconsultation services could be extended even beyond the pandemic period and could have promising implications in future. Conclusion: Teleconsultation proved to be a feasible alternative to in-person appointments during the pandemic and helped in reducing viral transmission and compliance with social distancing measures. It also holds promise for future implications in routine dental practice. With further improvements in technology and application of artificial intelligence in teleconsultation could improvise remote patient monitoring and diagnosis and treatment planning in the near future and prove us a useful tool.

AB  - The last two decades have seen the development of a body of literature in evolutionary psychology that seeks to attribute negative attitudes to ethnic and racial minorities and other outgroups to an evolved behavioral immune system (BIS). It hypothesizes that disgust sensitivity, which evolved as protection against pathogen threats, also triggers reactions to cues that are not viscerally disgusting, such as people with unfamiliar features, and thus can explain prejudice toward members of these groups. Such an explanation seems to limit the influence of education, public policy, and rhetoric on those attitudes. Our conceptual analysis shows that this is not the case. Existing hypotheses about why the BIS would be triggered even in the absence of visceral disgust elicitors suggest that general unfamiliarity or atypicality act as cues for this hypersensitive threat detection system. This implies that the impact of the BIS must depend on the cultural and societal context in which people learn not only what is disgusting but also what is typical. The social context of personal interaction with mass media representation of and political debate about immigrants consequently needs to be considered as a decisive factor for any effect of the BIS on attitudes and behavior toward ethnic and racial outgroups. The BIS is therefore not a separate or even superordinate explanation of prejudice, compared to those coming from the social sciences. We conclude that it can offer valuable insights into processes of stigmatization and prejudice, once the role of social learning in the developmental unfolding and activation of psychological mechanisms is taken seriously.

AB  - Introduction and AimsThe news media is an important source of information regarding new developments in medicine and public health interventions. Previous research has indicated that in many cases, reporting on new treatments can be inaccurate or sensationalist. This paper presents analysis of Australian print media reporting on two treatment options for heroin dependence (naltrexone and methadone). The aim of this study was to quantitatively compare the volume and content of Australian print media reporting on these two treatments, one of which had a long history of use in Australia, and the other which was comparatively newer.
   Design and MethodsThe study constituted a quantitative content analysis of a sample of 859 Australian newspaper articles, published over a 10-year period (1997-2007). Each article paragraph was coded for positive outcomes/benefits of treatment, as well as negative outcomes associated with treatment.
   ResultsThe analysis revealed that during this period, the Australian print media was significantly more likely to report the potential positive outcomes of naltrexone treatment, compared with the negative outcomes. In contrast, reporting on methadone focused more on the negative outcomes and side effects.
   Discussion and ConclusionsThe relative frequency by which the benefits of naltrexone were mentioned in this sample of news content is somewhat at odds with the extant efficacy and effectiveness research evidence. The findings suggest that reporting on these treatments in the Australian print media has not been balanced. This type of reporting has potential implications for public attitudes, as well as policy decisions. [Matthew-Simmons F, Ritter A.

AB  - The number of multiracial candidates seeking office is growing in an increasingly diverse America. This raises questions about how the media frame candidates with potentially complex racial backgrounds and how voters respond to these frames. We investigate the impact of media frames that emphasize race and gender attributes using survey experiments on Kamala Harris-the first Black woman and first Asian woman vice president. Our findings are mixed. In a survey experiment conducted after her nomination, headlines emphasizing different elements of Harris's race or gender had no impact on public attitudes. In an experiment conducted after Harris was inaugurated, however, headlines that cued her gender only or both her gender and her Black racial background boosted popular support. Taken together, these findings suggest that some types of identity-based cues may matter, but the effects are sensitive to experimental settings and contexts.

AB  - The main purpose of this exploratory research study was to determine urban hotel guest, manager, and staff perspectives on the impacts in terms of costs and benefits of the introduction of service robots in rooms. It was conducted to fill a literature gap on multi-stakeholder perspectives on the use of in-room service robots. Using a variety of data collection methods including a survey and interviews, the perspectives of stakeholder groups were found to be dissimilar. Hotel guests perceived more benefits than expenses while management views were more focused on the costs and technical aspects. Managers and financial officers primarily had a return on investment perspective on hotel robot use. The negative attitudes held by hotel managers toward service robots were related to costs of implementation and a concern that these costs could not be recouped. The technology readiness index, service robot acceptance model, and technology organization environment (TOE) framework were applied to examine guest perceptions and adoption attitudes.

AB  - The extant empirical research examining the effectiveness of statistical and exemplar-based health information is largely inconsistent. Under the premise that the inconsistency may be due to an unacknowledged moderator (O'Keefe, 2002), this study examined a moderating role of outcome-relevant involvement (Johnson & Eagly, 1989) in the effects of statistical and exemplified risk information on risk perception. Consistent with predictions based on elaboration likelihood model (Petty & Cacioppo, 1984), findings from an experiment (N = 237) concerning alcohol consumption risks showed that statistical risk information predicted risk perceptions of individuals with high, rather than low, involvement, while exemplified risk information predicted risk perceptions of those with low, rather than high, involvement. Moreover, statistical risk information contributed to negative attitude toward drinking via increased risk perception only for highly involved individuals, while exemplified risk information influenced the attitude through the same mechanism only for individuals with low involvement. Theoretical and practical implications for health risk communication are discussed.

AB  - The ongoing digitalization in the training sector produces new demands on the media-didactical competence of trainers. We conducted an online survey of 279 trainers in Germany to investigate the relationships among media-didactical competence, media-didactical self-efficacy, attitudes toward the use of digital media and the actual use of digital media in training. Furthermore, we compared trainers who attended a course on digital media with trainers who did not attend such a course. The analysis of the theoretically expected correlations between the variables resulted in not all hypotheses being accepted. The analysis of the group differences showed that the trainers who attended a course on digital media had higher media-didactical competence and media-didactical self-efficacy scores and used digital media more often in training. There was no significant difference in negative attitudes. The implications for the promotion of the media-didactical competence of trainers are discussed.

AB  - The present study aims to examine how subjective age of older Korean Americans would be affected by functional disability and attitudes toward aging. We hypothesized that (a) both functional disability and attitudes toward aging would have a direct effect on subjective age and (b) the effect of functional disability on subjective age would be mediated by attitudes toward aging. Our analyses of the survey data with 208 community-dwelling Korean Americans aged 60 and older (mean age = 69.6, SD = 7.51) showed that the indirect effect of functional disability on subjective age through attitudes toward aging [-.020 (.009)] was significant (bias-corrected 95% confidence interval [-.039, -.006]). The findings suggest that functional disability fosters negative attitudes toward aging, which in turn leads to the feelings of being older than actual age. Our study suggests ways to preserve and promote positive perceptions of age and aging.

AB  - Background: Combination prevention, which includes pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), is essential for achieving the zero HIV infections target in the UK by 2030. It is important to assess attitudes towards PrEP in at-risk populations. This study focuses on the effect of discrimination and HIV conspiracy theorising on attitudes towards PrEP in gay men in the UK. Methods: In total, 244 White British gay men completed a survey that included demographic questions and measures of sexual health screening, hypervigilance, sexual orientation discrimination, quality of contact with healthcare professionals, belief in conspiracy theories and attitudes towards PrEP. Data were analysed using multiple linear regression and mediation analysis. Results: Discrimination was positively correlated with HIV conspiracy beliefs and negatively correlated with PrEP acceptance. Mediation analyses demonstrated that the relationship between discrimination and attitudes towards PrEP was explained by HIV conspiracy theorising. Gay men who had attended a sexual health screening (vs never attended) reported higher belief in HIV conspiracy theories. A further mediation analysis showed that reported poor contact with a healthcare professional was associated with an increased belief in HIV conspiracy theories, which was associated with negative attitudes towards PrEP. Both perceived discrimination and poor contact with a healthcare professional were exacerbated by hypervigilance. Conclusions: HIV conspiracy theorising is an important variable in understanding attitudes towards PrEP among gay men. Its roots are in adverse social experiences (e.g. discrimination, poor contact with healthcare professionals) and its consequences may be the rejection of PrEP. HIV prevention and PrEP campaigns must focus on prejudice reduction and on challenging conspiracy beliefs.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's sociodemographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF).
   Methods: A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 x 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes.
   Results: Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to "national TV news" source than "social media" outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media.
   Conclusions: The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents.

AB  - This study examines the determinants of using (non-)fluoroscopy-guided positioning (FGP) for radiographs, in order to improve the use of non- FGP imaging techniques.
   We focused on knowledge and attitudes of radiographers and radiologists with respect to applying non- FGP in radiography and organizational factors. We analyzed data from an in-depth multiple case study that includes observations and field notes, interviews, documents and images collected from the radiology departments of four hospitals. The unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was used to frame the findings.
   We found that inadequate skills and insufficient knowledge of positioning techniques and negative attitudes towards non- FGP were present. More precisely, staff expressed concerns with respect to the impact on the workload and workflow. Besides facilitating organizational conditions, the social influence of peers and the clinical leadership of RLs were found to be important. Adequate supervision, regular feedback and coaching were identified as important enabling factors for increasing the quality of the applied imaging techniques.
   In the conclusion we state that determinants of using non- FGP are quite complex. Therefore we argue that a holistic approach considering all these aspects is needed to improve imaging practices.

AB  - Genomic Sequencing (GS) to identify high cancer risk will soon enter clinical practice at significant cost to the health system. This study aimed to quantify perceived value of GS to Australian cancer patients and their first-degree relatives participating in a genomic sequencing study, and factors associated with value. Participants were recruited upon consent to the genomics study. Eligible participants (with cancer of likely genetic etiology, or a first-degree relative) completed a questionnaire prior to GS. Willingness to pay was assessed via hypothetical trade-off scenarios of actionable result return rates of 1%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40% or 50%. Of 348 probands and 213 relatives (92% and 93% response rate), 81% would consistently have GS for as little as a 1% actionable return rate. Participants would pay a median of $1,000 for return rates of at least 20% (probands) or 30% (relatives), and $300 for lower return rates. Probands with common cancers and negative attitudes to uncertainty were more likely to have GS; those with higher education were more willing to pay $1,000 and $3,000 for lower return rates. This study found high interest in, but lower willingness to pay for GS in cancer patients and their first-degree relatives, possibly due to inability to pay. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of how individuals in different risk circumstances, trade-off the risks, harms, and benefits of GS.

AB  - Purpose The aims of this research were to investigate the relationship of social support, self-efficacy and cognitive coping with psychological distress, as well as, to determine the mediating role of self-efficacy and cognitive coping between social support and psychological distress in infertile women of Pakistan. Methods This cross-sectional study was conducted to recruit 158 infertile women from six hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A demographic questionnaire, multidimensional scale of perceived social support, infertility self-efficacy scale, coping strategies questionnaire and depression anxiety stress scale were used to assess the study variables. Results The results found that significant other, family and friends support was negatively associated with depression, anxiety and stress, however, no relationship was found between friends support and anxiety. Self-efficacy and active-practical coping had negative, whereas, avoidance-focused coping had positive relationship with depression, anxiety and stress. Active-distractive coping was negatively and religious-focused coping was positively associated with depression. Mediation analyses revealed that self-efficacy mediated the effect of social support on depression, anxiety and stress, but no mediation was found between friends support and anxiety. Moreover, avoidance-focused coping mediated the link between social support and depression, as well as, between significant other support and anxiety. Conclusion Social support, self-efficacy, active-practical coping and active-distractive coping had significant negative associations with psychological distress. Hence, structured programs should be developed to enhance societal acceptance and to reduce the negative attitude of people towards infertility.

KW  - vaccine adverse events
KW  - anti-vaccine movement
AB  - Background and Objectives: Despite the fact that vaccines save many lives worldwide, in many countries, including Poland, the percentage of unvaccinated children is constantly growing. The main reasons for low immunisation coverage include parents' concerns about the safety of vaccines, their fears related to possible adverse events following vaccination, and the increasingly powerful activity of anti-vaccine movements. It is necessary to monitor the public's attitudes to vaccination in order to implement appropriate solutions to prevent a resurgence of epidemics. The aim of the study was to assess Polish parents' opinions about and awareness of immunisation-related issues.
   Methods: The study, based on an online survey, investigated Polish mothers' attitudes towards the use of vaccines, their opinions regarding the sanctions for a failure to vaccinate a child, and the correlations between the result and the socio-demographic characteristics.
   Results: A total of 646 responses were collected, including 593 from mothers from generalinterest groups and 53 from anti-vax groups. Differences were identified in vaccination coverage among children of respondents from general-interest groups and anti-vax groups. The findings show that the respondents from anti-vax groups stopped vaccinating more often due to vaccine adverse events and inadequate response from doctors.
   Conclusion: Most of the respondents are aware of anti-vaccine movements and have a negative attitude to them, but these movements still influence the public. Also, the findings show a correlation between the level of education and a general attitude to immunisation - people with higher education more often have a negative opinion on this matter.

AB  - With epidemics and pandemics like COVID-19, many offline healthcare services have been suspended and shifted to online, where patients and doctors typically communicate by typing texts. The limited communication poses a threat to the service quality of E-health, and also raises higher demand on the language skills of doctors, in which medical terms are a common concern. Traditional studies of offline healthcare mostly hold a negative attitude towards the use of medical terms by doctors. However, should we still advise doctors to avoid using medical terms in E-health? To answer this question, this paper conducts a study combining technical and empirical analyses based on real data. In this paper, a novel unsupervised text-mining method is proposed to automatically identify medical terms with crowd wisdom from large-scale doctor-patient communication texts. Then, a TREC-type experiment is carried out to validate the proposed method in terms of Precision, Recall, and F 1-measure, demonstrating that it can identify accurate and comprehensive medical terms. Based on the identified medical terms, an empirical analysis is conducted to verify the influence of medical terms used by doctors on the service quality of E-health. The analysis results show that for patients with low health literacy, the use of medical terms by doctors would decrease their service quality. However, for patients with high health literacy, the use of medical terms by doctors can significantly increase their service quality, revealing that doctors could improve their service quality in E-health by adjusting their medical term usage according to the health literacy of patients.

AB  - Face masks continue to be a necessity until a large proportion of the population, including children, receive immunizations for COVID-19. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between parental attitudes and beliefs about masks and parent-for-child mask behavior using the Theory of Planned Behavior. We administered a survey in August 2020 to parents of school-aged children residing in the United States and Canada. Measures included sociodemographic variables for the parent and child, attitudes, norms, perceived control over children's mask use, intentions and enforcement of mask wearing among children (also titled "parent-for-child mask behavior"). Data were analyzed using structural equation modelling. We collected data from 866 parents and 43.5% had children with pre-existing conditions (e.g., allergies, anxiety, impulsivity, skin sensitivity, asthma) that made extended mask wearing difficult, as per parent's report. Among the full sample, negative attitudes (beta = -0.20, p =.006), norms (beta = 0.41, p =.002), and perceived control (beta= 0.33, p =.006) predicted intentions. Norms (beta = 0.50, p =.004) and intentions (beta = 0.28, p =.003) also predicted parent-forchild mask use, while attitudes and perceived control did not. Intentions mediated the associations between attitudes, norms, perceived control, respectively, and mask behavior. Subgroup analyses revealed intentions as the key predictor of parent-for-child mask use among children with pre-conditions and norms as the key predictor among children without pre-conditions (i.e. healthy). Future public health messaging should target parental intentions, attitudes, norms, and perceived control about children's masks wearing.

AB  - Objective: Sexual and gender minority people of color (SGM-POC) experience intersectional forms of minority stress, including heterosexism within racial/ethnic minority communities, which can contribute to feelings of conflict between SGM and racial/ethnic identities. Internalized stigma may be a consequence of sexual orientation-based discrimination but has not been tested as a mechanism linking intersectional minority stress to identity conflict among SGM-POC. We hypothesized that the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities and identity conflict would be mediated by internalized stigma among SGM assigned female at birth (SGM-AFAB). Method: Participants were 316 SGM-AFAB who identified as POC. Data were collected as a part of an ongoing longitudinal cohort study of young SGM-AFAB. We tested the longitudinal mediation using data from baseline, 6-month follow-up, and 1-year follow-up assessments. Results: Internalized stigma at 6-month follow-up partially mediated the association between experiences of heterosexism in racial/ethnic minority communities at baseline and identity conflict at 1-year follow-up. Conclusions: For SGM-POC, experiences of heterosexism within their racial/ethnic communities may lead to internalization of those negative attitudes. A consequence of internalizing heterosexist attitudes from one's racial/ethnic group could be a feeling that one's sexual orientation and racial/ethnic identities must remain separate, perhaps to maintain connection to one's racial/ ethnic community. Identifying internalized stigma as a mediating process is critical to better understand identity development for SGM-POC, and has important clinical implications for working with this population.

AB  - Simple Summary Even before the emergence of COVID-19, animal companionship was gaining popularity in Korea as a strategy to reduce loneliness and isolation caused by a rapidly aging population and an increase in one-person households. Many dog owners have experienced the emotional and physical benefits that dog ownership provides during the COVID-19 period. This study examined the relationship between dog attachment, dog walking and loneliness during times of widespread isolation. An online, cross-sectional survey for dog owners was conducted in the fall of 2020. Voluntary participants responded to questionnaires about their relationship with dogs, dog attachment, and dog walking during COVID-19. Our study suggests that dog walking has no direct effect on reducing loneliness but the relationship between dog walking and loneliness might be mediated by attachment. Due to the strict social distancing guidelines during the pandemic, dog walking would not allow opportunities for conversation with other people, but it seems that spending time outside with dogs strengthens the bonds between humans and companion dogs, alleviating loneliness. The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's lives and increased their vulnerability to physical and mental health hazards. While Korea has avoided nationwide lockdown measures since the COVID-19 outbreak, the prolonged restrictions and social isolation measures have resulted in detrimental psychological effects, such as increased anxiety, boredom, and loneliness. The present study investigated dog attachment and changes in dog walking during the COVID-19 pandemic and the effects of dog attachment and dog walking on the loneliness of Korean dog owners. An online, cross-sectional survey was conducted in the fall of 2021 in which 249 dog owners responded to questionnaires that asked questions about dog attachment, their perception of dog walking, and their feelings of loneliness during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most dog owners responded that they spent more time with their dogs and developed a stronger bond with them during the pandemic. Additionally, respondents stated that they walked their dogs more often than they did before COVID-19 and that their dogs aided in reducing loneliness. We found that dog walking directly affected attachment and indirectly influenced the loneliness of dog owners. Further research is required to determine how dog walking impacts positive psychological effects and promote dog walking.

AB  - Aims: This study aimed to (1) assess the non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures that were used by the Jordanian population against COVID-19, and (2) determine the sociodemographic and behavioral predictors of contracting COVID-19 with a focus on the utilization of personal precautionary measures.Methods: A descriptive questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was used in this study. A structured web-based questionnaire was disseminated to the Jordanian community through social media platforms. Participants were asked a series of questions about socio-demographic characteristics, in addition to the knowledge, attitudes, and commitment toward using various personal precautionary measures (e.g., face mask, hand washing, social distancing) against the COVID-19. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, cross-tabulation, and binary logistic regression through SPSS(R).Results: Responses from 7,746 participants were included in our final analyses. Descriptive statistics showed that most participants (82.6%) believed that face mask protects against COVID-19. Around 69.5% of the participants were completely committed to wearing a face mask, while 65% of the participants were completely committed to hand washing. The results of the regression analysis revealed that female gender (AOR = 1.2; 95% CI: 1.07-1.35; p = 0.002), having a family member infected with COVID-19 (AOR = 8.5; 95% Cl: 7.51-9.70; p = 0.001), having a health-related work or study (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.09-1.38; p = 0.001), believing that face masks do not protect against COVID-19 (AOR = 1.3; 95% Cl: 1.12-1.47; p = 0.001), and partial commitment to handwashing (AOR = 1.2; 95% Cl: 1.11-1.75; p = 0.006) were all associated with an increased odds of contracting COVID-19 among the participants.Conclusion: Overall, commitment to non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPI) measures, such as wearing a face mask, hand washing, and physical distancing, was not optimal among Jordanians. This might explain the dramatic increase in the infectivity rate of the COVID-19 virus in the past few months in the country. More sustainable efforts regarding health promotion and strict policies are required to prevent a third wave of hitting the country and to prevent similar infectious threats in the future.

AB  - Social distancing and lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic substantially impacted individuals' daily habits and well-being. Within such a context, digital technology may provide a welcome source of alternative forms of connection and entertainment. Indeed, streaming services showed a remarkable increase in membership subscriptions throughout the period considered. However, excessive involvement in watching TV series has recently become a subject of scholarly concern as it may represent an emerging form of addictive behavior with the features of what has been labeled as "binge-watching" (i.e., watching multiple episodes of TV series in a single session). The current study aimed to assess TV series watching behaviors and related motivations, as well as their relationships with depression, stress and anxiety, in a sample of Italian adults during the COVID-19 lockdown. Specifically, we aimed to explore which patterns of motivations and emotional states influenced either a high but healthy engagement in watching TV series, or promoted problematic and uncontrolled watching behavior under such circumstances. A total of 715 adults (M = 31.70, SD = 10.81; 71.5% female) from all over Italy were recruited (from 1st to 30th April 2020) through advertisements via social media platforms of Italian university communities and other online groups. Two multiple hierarchical regression analyses were performed with non-problematic and problematic TV series watching set as dependent variables. Results showed that people spent more time watching TV series during the pandemic lockdown, especially women who also reported higher levels of anxiety and stress than men. Moreover, both non-problematic (R-2 = 0.56; p < 0.001) and problematic (R-2 = 0.33; p < 0.001) TV series watching behaviors were equally induced by anxiety symptoms and escapism motivation, thereby suggesting that watching TV series during the COVID-19 lockdown probably served as a recovery strategy to face such a stressful situation. Finally, our findings also suggest that enrichment motives may protect from uncontrolled and potentially addictive watching behaviors. These findings, therefore, hold important implications, particularly for avoiding the over-pathologization of excessive involvement in online activities emerging as a result of specific distressing situations.

KW  - Mobile-based banking
KW  - Tejarat bank
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to study the influential factors in changing customers' behaviors from online banking to mobile banking based on Tiller and Tad model.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative method was used. This study is a practical research work by using 400 people, among whom 384 participants were selected based on simple random sampling.
   Findings - The results indicated that the perceived advantage of using mobile banking, the influence of peer groups, source facilitator conditions as well as technology had the highest correlation. Among the influential components on attitude, the highest level belongs to perceived advantage of using mobile bank. Among the effective factors on behavioral control, source facilitator conditions and technology facilitator conditions had the highest correlation.
   Research limitations/implications - It is suggested that the provided services be expanded via mobile banking and more customers be encouraged to use mobile banking services. For instance, the transaction of currency, stock, etc. via mobile banking is suggested. It is recommended that mobile banking software should be designed in a way that the process of mobile banking services is very easy for customers. Bank staff and employees should be trained to be active promoters of mobile banking services not only inside branch locations, but in other places and work environments as informers, messengers and models of using mobile banking.
   Practical implications - It is recommended that bank managers should make use of the mass media such TV, billboard, radio, press, etc., in order to increase public awareness of mobile banking, and try to take effective steps in creating positive attitude in their customers on using mobile banking.
   Social implications - Mobile banking has evolved as a wireless communication interface for producing value by customers in banking transactions. Todays, one of the substantially remarkable modern techniques in providing banking services is the provision of financial and banking services by using smart phones (mobiles). Although the life of using smart phones for banking and financial operations is not too long, significant advancements have been observed in this area within a short time, which could highly promise the extensive development of this modern electronic banking technique in future.
   Originality/value - During the last decade, information technology has had tremendous impacts on banking industry through guiding and introducing new financial products with a specific delivering to its customers, enabling the banks to be able to provide distinguished products and special services to their customers safely and reliably. It is more than 200 years since banks have served their customers through their branch systems. However, with the emergence of various types of technology, the nature of providing financial services has greatly changed, with the increasing growth in electronic commerce.

AB  - Very little is known about public perceptions of journalists outside Europe and the United States. Even less is known about the role of these attitudes in sustaining civic life around the world. Using individual and country-level survey data, this study explores public attitudes of press performance and their relationship with news consumption and civic participation in 22 countries. The study argues that the nature of civic and local participatory behaviors is often intertwined with notions about what is good journalism. Results suggest that public evaluations of press performance influence news use. News consumption is also tightly related to civic participation, even in markedly divergent cultural contexts. Citizens' assessment of journalism practice is also a positive moderator of these relationships. This study builds on international comparative work related to the effects of press freedom and journalism practice on stimulating public life.

AB  - Social distancing, home confinement, economic challenges, and COVID-19-related illness and deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic can significantly affect mental health in youth. One promising approach to reduce anxiety and depression in adolescents is the neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention Training for Awareness, Resilience, and Action (TARA). The objective of this individually randomized waitlist-controlled trial (RCT) was (1) to test the feasibility of TARA, delivered partially over Zoom, and (2) to assess changes in the emotional wellbeing in healthy adolescents between the ages of 14-18 years old during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Twenty-one healthy adolescents were randomized to the TARA intervention or to the waitlist control group in February 2020, just before the start of the pandemic. The TARA group intervention was delivered in person for the first five sessions and remotely over Zoom for the remaining seven sessions due to the pandemic. The participants' acceptability of TARA was assessed weekly using the Child Session Rating Scale (CSRS). The primary outcome was the emotional wellbeing measured using emotional symptoms subscale of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) pre/post-TARA. We also explored weekly changes in TARA participants' wellbeing using the Child Outcome Rating Scale (CORS). Results: The overall session rating in TARA participants improved after the switch to Zoom (Cohen's d = 1.2, p = 0.008). The results of the two-way ANOVA showed no statistically significant difference in the change of the SDQ emotional symptoms during the 12 weeks between the TARA group and waitlist-control group (timepoint x group interaction: F = 0.77, p = 0.38). The exploratory analysis using the CORS in the TARA participants showed a significant improvement in their functioning over the weeks of training. Conclusion: Our results support the feasibility of TARA delivered over Zoom. While our primary outcome did not provide support for the improvement of the emotional wellbeing with TARA compared to a passive control group, our exploratory analysis in the intervention group indicated an improved functioning over the weeks of TARA training. The important general positive impact of this study lies in the possibility of offering a neuroscience-based mindfulness intervention remotely to youth living in remote areas and for all youth during pandemic times.

AB  - Humanitarian interventions (HIs) are a common aspect of US foreign policy. Policy makers acknowledge the importance of public support for interventions, but scholars remain divided about the extent and basis of that support. Using a series of survey experiments, we evaluate attitudes about HIs, assess whether the public supports these interventions for instrumental or moral reasons, and test which aspects of morality are most salient. The findings indicate that interventions addressing humanitarian crises boost public support, with the basis of that support residing primarily in normative contentions that the United States has a moral obligation to protect civilians. This research advances understandings of morality in foreign policy, mediates debates about the determinants of public attitudesincluding when the public makes moral rather than prudent decisions about interventionsand has important policy implications. It suggests a morally motivated public may be more likely to support risky HIs, increasing the likelihood of using force.

AB  - Journalists' own job problems have been found to be detrimental to media recognition of public relations: journalists vent frustration from their worsening job conditions at public relations practitioners. This outlook of occupational psyche casts a shadow over the bright prospect for media recognition of the profession. Journalists' problems operate outside media relations, thus beyond direct attempts of public relations practitioners at media recognition via enhancing professionalism in their practices. There have been, however, only a few qualitative studies on this significant issue, all pointing to journalists' occupational psyche running against media recognition. The purpose of this study is to determine quantitatively whether journalists' own job satisfaction and their envy of public relations practitioners lead to their negative attitude. A survey of 128 Korean off-line journalists was conducted, and its results suggested that occupational psyche has little influence on media attitude-contrary to the findings of previous qualitative studies. For future study, this paper issues a call forcross-country, comparative research on the subject of journalists' occupational psyche. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article explores front-line cruise employees' interaction with LGBT passengers. Covert data were gathered with 70 staff, many of whom were from developing countries where attitudes to LGBT people can be less accepting. Encounters are illuminated using Allport's (1954) intergroup contact theory. Interactions between staff and gay passengers were largely positive, helping normalise homosexuality and diminish negative attitudes. Staff interactions were moderated by factors such as prior knowledge of gay people, their previous service experience on gay charters, gender, the influence of working for gratuities and the sense of fun onboard. The gay cruise provides the context that gives rise to moderating conditions, which then facilitate the mediating processes such as reduced intergroup anxiety and increased cultural learning of gay lifestyles. Suggestions for future research between cruise companies and their employees explore how other variables may positively influence staff service-gay customer interactions. Managerial implications are offered for the cruise sector.

AB  - Introduction. Unfortunately, Covid-19 is quickly transmitted from person to person and due to the unexpected outburst, many of its manifestations remain unknown. Also, due to the ambiguity of virus's behavior, there is a lot of confusion and disagreement about itself, its spreading, and about the precautions that must be taken to prevent the infection. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the level of performance knowledge and attitude towards Covid-19 in the Iranian population. Materials and methods. Our study is descriptive-analytical and cross-sectional. The population under study is Iranian one. Researchers designed a questionnaire based on other studies and distributed it via email, WhatsApp, as well as manually, in south and southeastern Iran. The questionnaire included two sections: demographic characteristics and KAP measurement questions. The demographic variables included age, gender, marital status, education, and occupation. The questionnaire had 41 questions: 5 on general information, 24 on knowledge, 6 on attitude and 6 on practice. Score 2 belonged to the correct answer, the score 0 to incorrect answer and don't know. We evaluated knowledge, attitude and performance scores of individuals according to the demographic characteristics t-test, ANOVA and chi-square test. Data analysis was performed with SPSS21 version. The significance level P < 0.05 was considered in all studies. Results and discussion. In this investigation, we distributed 8,251 questionnaires, out of which 7,802 cases were examined (response rate=94.5%) - 4,350 women and 3,482 men. The mean age of participants was 33.2 +/- 11.5. The main source of information was internet and WhatsApp, followed by television, newspaper and friends and acquaintances. The mean and SD of knowledge was 28.3 +/- 4.1. The sufficient knowledge of participants was 87.1%. This study showed that the average score of awareness has a significant relationship with gender (P=0.001), job (P=0.002) and level of education (P=0.001). The mean and SD of attitude was 20.2 +/- 3.5. Among all participants, 6,998 (89.7%) had a good attitude. There was a significant relationship between positive attitude and gender (P=0.01), level of education (P=0.01) and job (P=0.04). The average score of practice was 8.1 +/- 2.1 and 5,214 (66.8%) had sufficient practice. This study shows a significant relationship practice with age (P=0.01), job (P=0.01) and level of education (P=0.001). Conclusions. An acceptable number of participants had good knowledge and attitude toward Covid-19, but they shown a poor performance in wearing masks and gloves and in avoiding parties and crowded places.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how consumers respond to social media influencers that are created through artificial intelligence (AI) and compares effects to traditional (human) influencers. Design/methodology/approach Across two empirical studies, the authors examine the efficacy of AI social media influencers. With Study 1, the authors establish baseline effects for AI influencers and investigate how social-psychological distance impacts consumer perceptions. The authors also investigate the role of an influencer's agency - being autonomous or externally managed - to test the boundaries of the results and determine the interactive effects between influencer type and influencer agency. Study 2 acts as an extension and validation of Study 1, whereby the authors provide generalisability and overlay the role of need for uniqueness as a moderated mediator. Findings The authors show that there are similarities and differences in the ways in which consumers view AI and human influencers. Importantly, the authors find no difference in terms of intention to follow or personalisation. This suggests that consumers are equally open to follow an AI or human influencer, and they perceive the level of personalisation provided by either influencer type as similar. Furthermore, while an AI influencer is generally perceived as having lower source trust, they are more likely to evoke word-of-mouth intentions. In understanding these effects, the authors show that social distance mediates the relationship between influencer type and the outcomes the authors investigate. Results also show that AI influencers can have a greater effect on consumers who have a high need for uniqueness. Finally, the authors find that a lack of influencer agency has a detrimental effect. Research limitations/implications The studies investigate consumers' general response to AI influencers within the context of Instagram, however, future research might examine consumers' response to posts promoting specific products across a variety of category contexts and within different social media platforms. Practical implications The authors find that in some ways, an AI influencer can be as effective as a human influencer. Indeed, the authors suggest that there may be a spill-over effect from consumer experiences with other AI recommendation systems, meaning that consumers are open to AI influencer recommendations. However, the authors find consistent evidence that AI influencers are trusted less than traditional influencers, hence the authors caution brands from rushing to replace human influencers with their AI counterparts. Originality/value This paper offers novel insight into the increasingly prominent phenomenon of the AI influencer. Specifically, it takes initial steps towards developing understanding as to how consumers respond to AI influencers and contrast these effects with human influencers.

AB  - Objective This study examined the influences of intergenerational relations and marriage on the relationship between financial strain and attitude toward retirement among aging adults in Hong Kong. Background Financial strain is a source of worry among many older adults in Hong Kong. A considerable percentage of retirees and pre-retirees have negative attitudes toward retirement. Method Representative survey data were collected from 767 participants (335 men and 432 women) with 294 participants aged 50 to 64 years; 473, aged 65 years or older). Results Financial strain was negatively associated with attitude toward retirement both directly and indirectly through intergenerational relationship quality. Cohort differences were identified as affectual closeness and intergenerational conflict (two subdomains of intergenerational relationship quality) partially mediated the relationship between financial strain and attitude toward retirement for the younger cohort aged 50 to 64 years, whereas for adults aged >= 65 years, only affectual closeness was a significant partial mediator. Marriage only acted as a moderator for the younger cohort. Conclusion The mediating effect of intergenerational relationship quality and moderating effect of marriage were identified, as well as cohort differences. Implications Tailored programs and policies should be developed for different age groups to enhance intergenerational relations and retirement preparation.

AB  - Background: Social media is being used by various stakeholders among pharmaceutical companies, government agencies, health care organizations, professionals, and news media as a way of engaging audiences to raise disease awareness and ultimately to improve public health. Nevertheless, it is unclear what effects this health information has on laypeople.
   Objective: This study aimed to provide a detailed examination of how promotional health information related to Lynch syndrome impacts laypeople's discussions on a social media platform (Twitter) in terms of topic awareness and attitudes.
   Methods: We used topic modeling and sentiment analysis techniques on Lynch syndrome-related tweets to answer the following research questions (RQs): (1) what are the most discussed topics in Lynch syndrome-related tweets?; (2) how promotional Lynch syndrome-related information on Twitter affects laypeople's discussions?; and (3) what impact do the Lynch syndrome awareness activities in the Colon Cancer Awareness Month and Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day have on laypeople's discussions and their attitudes? In particular, we used a set of keywords to collect Lynch syndrome-related tweets from October 26, 2016 to August 11, 2017 (289 days) through the Twitter public search application programming interface (API). We experimented with two different classification methods to categorize tweets into the following three classes: (1) irrelevant, (2) promotional health information, and (3) laypeople's discussions. We applied a topic modeling method to discover the themes in these Lynch syndrome-related tweets and conducted sentiment analysis on each layperson's tweet to gauge the writer's attitude (ie, positive, negative, and neutral) toward Lynch syndrome. The topic modeling and sentiment analysis results were elaborated to answer the three RQs.
   Results: Of all tweets (N=16,667), 87.38% (14,564/16,667) were related to Lynch syndrome. Of the Lynch syndrome-related tweets, 81.43% (11,860/14,564) were classified as promotional and 18.57% (2704/14,564) were classified as laypeople's discussions. The most discussed themes were treatment (n=4080) and genetic testing (n=3073). We found that the topic distributions in laypeople's discussions were similar to the distributions in promotional Lynch syndrome-related information. Furthermore, most people had a positive attitude when discussing Lynch syndrome. The proportion of negative tweets was 3.51%. Within each topic, treatment (16.67%) and genetic testing (5.60%) had more negative tweets compared with other topics. When comparing monthly trends, laypeople's discussions had a strong correlation with promotional Lynch syndrome-related information on awareness (r=.98, P<.001), while there were moderate correlations on screening (r=.602, P=.05), genetic testing (r=.624, P=.04), treatment (r=.69, P=.02), and risk (r=.66, P=.03). We also discovered that the Colon Cancer Awareness Month (March 2017) and the Lynch Syndrome Awareness Day (March 22, 2017) had significant positive impacts on laypeople's discussions and their attitudes.
   Conclusions: There is evidence that participative social media platforms, namely Twitter, offer unique opportunities to inform cancer communication surveillance and to explore the mechanisms by which these new communication media affect individual health behavior and population health.

Design/methodology/approach Data are drawn from an online survey of the public (N = 961). OLS regression is used to predict global perceptions of legitimacy, as well as department legitimacy and acceptance of force in an experimental vignette that manipulates procedural justice. Findings The binding moral motive is associated with greater global and department legitimacy and acceptance of force. The individualizing moral motive is associated with reduced global legitimacy and acceptance of force, and with department legitimacy when procedural justice is low. Perceptions of legitimacy mediate the effects of the binding moral motive on acceptance of force and of the individualizing moral motive when procedural justice is low. Research limitations/implications This study identifies novel antecedents of police legitimacy and acceptance of force (i.e. binding and individualizing moral motives). Social implications This study provides insight into public attitudes regarding use of force. Originality/value This study is the first to propose and test a link between binding and individualizing moral motives and perceptions of police.

AB  - This essay analyses the French film 120 BPM (Campillo 2017) in relation to its aesthetics and critical reception in the context of scientific advances in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) therapy, as well as revised socio-cultural attitudes towards, and political strategies for dealing with the disease. It argues that the treatment trajectory of the virus has been parallelled by a transition in the way that the disease is both represented and received in media, film, and television. This is because advances in therapy and understanding of the disease now render it much less threatening, and, although AIDS remains a serious public health concern in certain regions, public attitudes towards the virus have correspondingly shifted. Such a refocusing reverberates in the visual style of 120 BPM, particularly its cinematography and framing, which consistently positions the spectator amidst the HIV/AIDS community. Although the film focuses on a period in the 1990s when survival rates were still low and death rates rising, it was paradoxically released at a time of relative optimism regarding the prognosis for HIV/AIDS, and thus presents a more upbeat narrative that achieved widespread critical acclaim.

AB  - Background: The US Preventive Services Task Force updated mammography recommendations in 2009, recommending against routine screening for women ages 40-49 and reducing recommended frequency for women 50+. The recommendation changes were highly controversial and created conflicting recommendations across professional organizations. This study examines overall awareness of the changes, accuracy of knowledge about changes, factors related to both overall awareness and accuracy, sources of knowledge about changes, and attitudes about the new recommendations.
   Method: National telephone survey of 508 women, half aged 40-49 and half 50+, conducted one year after the update (November/December 2010; cooperation rate was 36%). Measures include awareness, accuracy, source of knowledge, interactions with providers, and attitudes about the changes.
   Results: Fewer than half of women were aware of the guideline changes. Younger, more educated, and higher income women were more aware. Of those who were aware, only 12% correctly reported both change in age and frequency. Accuracy was not associated with demographics. The majority learned of changes through the media and the majority had negative attitudes about the changes.
   Conclusions: Despite widespread coverage of the recommendation changes, overall awareness in the relevant population is low. Increasing awareness and addressing attitudes about the changes is necessary to ensure the use of recommendations to impact screening behavior.

AB  - Objective We investigated the relationship between self-concealment-a tendency to hide distressing information-and suicidality, via two mediators: (a) unmet interpersonal needs and (b) help-seeking attitudes.
   Method A sample of young adults (18-25 years) was recruited online to complete a self-report survey questionnaire (n = 245). A parallel multiple mediation model was analyzed using the PROCESS macro (Hayes, 2013, Methodology in the social sciences. Introduction to mediation, moderation, and conditional process analysis: A regression-based approach. New York, NY: Guilford Press) in SPSS.
   Results There was a significant positive relationship between self-concealment and suicidality. This relationship was partially mediated by unmet interpersonal needs. Although self-concealment was associated with more negative attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, these help-seeking attitudes were not significantly related to suicidality.
   Conclusions Our results highlight the importance of interpersonal factors in suicide. Unmet interpersonal needs emerged as a mechanism by which self-concealment contributes to increased suicidality. We review implications for research, clinical practice, and prevention.

AB  - Bisexuality remains a stereotyped sexual identity in which bisexuals face prejudice from both gay/lesbian and heterosexual populations. Some bisexual individuals internalize society's negative attitudes, resulting in an experience of self-stigma. Consequently, many bisexual individuals report a reduced sense of belonging. The current study explored whether self-stigma mediates the association between experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice and a sense of belonging within a bisexual sample (n = 529) while also identifying how experiences of anti-bisexual prejudice vary as a function of participant gender (man, woman, non-binary) and the source of prejudice (gay/lesbian or heterosexual). Self-stigma fully mediated the association between anti-bisexual experiences and a sense of belonging. Women and non-binary individuals reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences than men, and all participants reported more frequent anti-bisexual experiences from heterosexual versus gay/lesbian sources. Efforts to improve a sense of belonging among bisexual individuals should focus on reducing anti-bisexual prejudice and anti-bisexual self-stigma.

AB  - The occurrence of the COVID-19-virus led to drastic short-term measures to reduce its spread and influence. Regulations such as "physical distancing," mentioned as "social distancing," and the closure of public facilities during the lockdown could be perceived as burdensome especially by individuals who feel a strong need for social exchange and belonging. These components such as need to belong and the fear of missing out also play a major role in the development and maintenance of a problematic use of social networks. Researchers have argued recently that an increase of addictive (online) behaviors may be a likely consequence of subjectively experienced restrictions in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. The current study investigates the interplay of perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions and the fear of missing out (FoMO) as well as of symptoms of problematic social-networks use. We hypothesized that perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions mediates the effect of specific predisposing variables related to social needs on the symptom severity of a problematic use. To assess the perceived strain due to COVID-19-related restrictions, we developed a specific questionnaire asking for perceived COVID-19-related strain in several domains of everyday-life. An exploratory factor analysis identified five factors: perceived strain related to restrictions of (1) social contacts, (2) travel, (3) childcare, (4) work, and (5) own health. In a sample of 719 German participants and data collection during the first COVID-19 lockdown (March 30th until April 3rd 2020), a structural equation model was calculated showing that higher levels of need to belong and FoMO increase perceived COVID-19-related strain, which is related to symptoms of a problematic social-networks use. The effect of need to belong on problematic social-networks use is mediated by experienced COVID-19-related strain and FoMO-online. Even if the use of social networks is not pathological per se, it may be associated with suffering for a vulnerable part of users. We conclude that specific needs and fear-associated predisposing variables contribute to experiencing physical distance and other pandemic-related restrictions as more stressful, which may increase problematic social-networks use and potentially other addictive behaviors as well in the context of the COVID-19-related lockdown.

AB  - This two-wave panel study among mothers (N = 508) of children between ages six months and six years investigated a) the possibility of a reciprocal relationship between mothers' attitudes toward television and children's television viewing, and b) the conditional probability of this reciprocal relationship. Two-wave multigroup cross-lagged analyses provided evidence for reciprocal patterns that depend on the level of maternal stress. The findings indicated that mothers' attitudes toward television predicted children's subsequent television viewing among non-stressed mothers, but not among stressed mothers. Children's television viewing predicted mothers' subsequent negative attitudes toward television among stressed mothers, but not among non-stressed mothers. Implications for the role of parents' attitudes regarding children's television viewing are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The paper aims to examine the inconclusive impacts of sanction-related deterrence on employee information security policy (ISP) compliance from the extant literature. It proposes that the disparate findings can be partially explained by two factors: investigating the mediating impact of attitudes on sanction effects instead of directly on behavioral intentions and examining employees with and without previous punishment experiences separately.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper relied upon survey data from 239 employees of a large governmental organization with a robust ISP and security education and training awareness program.
   Findings - The paper provides empirical evidence that the rational estimation of sanction effects impacts the cognitive component of attitudes to develop a positive or negative attitude toward performing the ISP directed behavior. Furthermore, this attitudinal effect (created by sanction threats) will be biased depending on whether the employee has experienced, personally or vicariously, any previous punishment for violating the ISP.
   Research limitations/implications - Because of the chosen research approach (self-reported survey data) and context (single hierarchical organization and a very specific security threat), the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the proposed propositions further in different organizational and threat contexts.
   Practical implications - Organizations should have a thorough understanding of how their employees' perceive sanctions in relationship to their prior experiences before implementing such policies.
   Originality/value - The paper addresses previous research calls for examining possible mediation variables for deterrence effects and impacts of punishment experiences on employee ISP compliance.

AB  - Background: Monitoring and surveillance are a fundamental part of the workplace environment, with employee performance and productivity as the main objects of scrutiny. However, many questions surround the ethical nature of managements' ability to employ advanced digital technologies to monitor employee behaviour and performance while in the workplace. If unaddressed, these concerns have the potential to significantly impact the relationship between the employee and the employer, impacting trust in management resulting in negative attitudes and counterproductive behaviours. Objectives: The goal of this paper is to present a comprehensive review of workplace surveillance whilst outlining some of the emerging issues relating to the use of employee monitoring technologies in the workplace. Methods/Approach: A detailed review of the literature was conducted in order to identify the major issues relating to workplace surveillance. In addition, a number of practitioner-based studies were examined to extract and identify emerging trends and concerns at an industry level. Results: Workplace surveillance is on the rise; however, empirical studies are in short supply. Conclusions: The issue of workplace surveillance is an under-researched area, which requires much attention. There is a distinct need for clear measures and structures that govern the effective and fair use of communication technologies in the workplace.

AB  - Objective: The COVID-19 pandemic is the first pandemic where social media platforms relayed information on a large scale, enabling an "infodemic"of conflicting information which undermined the global response to the pandemic. Understanding how the information circulated and evolved on social media platforms is essential for planning future public health campaigns. This study investigated what types of themes about COVID-19 were most viewed on YouTube during the first 8 months of the pandemic, and how COVID-19 themes progressed over this period.
   Methods: We analyzed top-viewed YouTube COVID-19-related videos in English from December 1, 2019 to August 16, 2020 with an open inductive content analysis. We coded 536 videos associated with 1.1 billion views across the study period. East Asian countries were the first to report the virus, while most of the top-viewed videos in English were from the US. Videos from straight news outlets dominated the top-viewed videos throughout the outbreak, and public health authorities contributed the fewest. Although straight news was the dominant COVID-19 video source with various types of themes, its viewership per video was similar to that for entertainment news and YouTubers after March.
   Results: We found, first, that collective public attention to the COVID-19 pandemic on YouTube peaked around March 2020, before the outbreak peaked, and flattened afterwards despite a spike in worldwide cases. Second, more videos focused on prevention early on, but videos with political themes increased through time. Third, regarding prevention and control measures, masking received much less attention than lockdown and social distancing in the study period.
   Conclusion: Our study suggests that a transition of focus from science to politics on social media intensified the COVID-19 infodemic and may have weakened mitigation measures during the first waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is recommended that authorities should consider co-operating with reputable social media influencers to promote health campaigns and improve health literacy. In addition, given high levels of globalization of social platforms and polarization of users, tailoring communication towards different digital communities is likely to be essential.

AB  - South Africa is faced with water scarcity crisis. In recent years, conservation campaigns have emerged to encourage citizens in developing a social ethic of water conservation essential in creating sustainability of resource use. The conservation campaigns are disseminated using conventional media often with messages couched in English language with the attendant highfalutin jargon which obfuscates and limits reach and effectiveness. To this end, negative attitudes towards water resources persist. Using the parallel mixed methods approach, this paper examines the potency of Folk Theatre in creating awareness about water issues as well as in alleviating and advocating attitudinal and behavioural changes against the backdrop of a worsening water crisis. Based on data on a rural community, Folk Theatre is found to be effective in raising awareness and educating rural folks about water issues and breaking down misconceptions about water conservation. In conclusion, Folk Theatre offers a sustainable alternative approach to communicating water conservation in rural South Africa.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The principality of Liechtenstein had its first COVID-19 case at the beginning of March 2020. After exponential growth, the pandemic's first wave was contained, with the last case being diagnosed 52 days after the initial occurrence.
   AIM: To characterise the COVID-19 pandemic in Liechtenstein.
   METHODS: All patients diagnosed in Liechtenstein were followed up until recovery and again 6-8 weeks after symptom onset. They were contacted every 2 days to record their clinical status until the resolution of their symptoms. The diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on clinical symptoms and molecular testing. Household and close workplace contacts were included in the follow-up, which also comprised antibody testing. In addition, public health measures installed during the pandemic in Liechtenstein are summarised.
   RESULTS: During the first wave, 5% of the population obtained a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. A total of 95 patients (median age 39 years) were diagnosed with COVID-19 (82 who resided in Liechtenstein), resulting in an incidence in Liechtenstein of 0.211%. One patient, aged 94, died (mortality rate 1%). Only 62% of patients could retrospectively identify a potential source of infection. Testing the patients' household and close workplace contacts (n = 170) with antibody tests revealed that 25% of those tested were additional COVID-19 cases, a quarter of whom were asymptomatic. Those households which adhered to strict isolation measures had a significantly lower rate of affected household members than those who didn't follow such measures. The national public health measures never restricted free movement of residents. Masks were only mandatory in healthcare settings The use of home working for the general workforce was promoted. Gatherings were prohibited. Schools, universities, certain public spaces (like sports facilities and playgrounds), childcare facilities, nonessential shops, restaurants and bars were closed. Social distancing, hygienic measures, solidarity and supporting individuals who were at risk were the main pillars of the public health campaigns.
   CONCLUSION: The close collaboration of all relevant stakeholders allowed for the complete workup of all COVID-19 patients nationwide. A multitude of factors (e.g., young age of the patients, low-threshold access to testing, close monitoring of cases, high alertness and adherence to public health measures by the population) led to the early containment of the first wave of the pandemic, with a very low rate of serious outcomes. Antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 revealed a substantial proportion of undiagnosed COVID-19 cases among close contacts of the patients.

AB  - Despite widespread Government nutrition and food consumption advice in Australia, diet-related disease incidence continues to increase. This study examines public attitudes to food, nutrition, and well-being through the dual filters of populist gastronomy (Nigella Lawson) and traditional nutrition science communication with middle class/professional adults residing in a low Socio-economic Index (SEI) area of semi-rural NSW that is characterised by greater than average diet-related morbidity. Using a voluntary participatory research approach, a qualitative study was conducted with six focus groups (n=47) who self-identified as primary food providers. The topics examined were: perceptions of current dietetic or government nutrition advice; the importance of flavour versus health concerns in food choices; immediate gastronomical perceptions of a Nigella Lawson meal; and the effects of narrative on menu planning and consumption. This study demonstrates how the hedonic gastronomic narrative influences and enhances public food understanding and dietary practices. We conclude that current Nutrition Science communication narratives would benefit from a broader gastronomic focus emphasising flavour and pleasure in consumption.

AB  - Objectives: First, to document a broad range of functional outcomes of bilateral implantation for young children through young adults at a postoperative point at which stable outcomes could be expected. Second, to evaluate the relationship between functional outcomes and age at bilateral implantation and time between implants.
   Design: A study-specific questionnaire was administered to parents in an interview 3.5 years or more after sequential (n = 50) or simultaneous (n = 7) implants were received by their child. Median age at bilateral implantation was 4.1 years (range 0.7 to 19.8) and time between implants was 2.7 years (range 0.0 to 16.7).
   Results: On the basis of parent report, 72% of the sequentially implanted children and young adults found it easy/only a bit difficult to adapt to the second implant, and were happily wearing both implants together most of the time by 6 months or before; 26% had not adapted, with both implants not worn most of the time or worn as a parental requirement. Seventy-two percent of sequentially implanted children and young adults had a positive attitude toward the second implant, including 9 whose early postoperative attitude was negative or neutral. The majority of children and young adults preferred bilateral implants (70%) and used the two full time (72%), while around half demonstrated similar performance with each implant alone. The proportion of nonusers or very minimal users of the second implant was just 9%. Eighty-eight percent of parents reported superior performance with bilateral versus a unilateral implant (n = 40), or that only bilateral implants were worn (n = 10) so performance could not be compared. The most commonly identified areas of superiority were localization, less need for repetition, and increased responsiveness. In balancing risks and costs with benefits, most parents (86%) considered the second implant worthwhile. Regarding the relationship between outcomes and demographic factors, the group achieving similar performance with each implant alone was younger at bilateral implantation and had less time between implants, and the group bilaterally implanted before 3.5 years of age (who also had less than 2 years between implants) had a higher proportion of positive outcomes on all functional outcome measures.
   Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate primarily positive functional outcomes for children and young adults receiving bilateral implants at all ages, including when the delay between implants is long. The results are important for evidence-based preoperative counseling, which helps families to make informed decisions and develop appropriate expectations. The results are also important for the development of clinical management practices that support and encourage the minority of recipients who have difficulty adapting to bilateral implants or achieving full-time use.

AB  - Two survey studies, one with a college sample (Study 1, n = 245) and one with a national U.S. adult sample (Study 2, n = 590) examined how media messages can influence attitudes toward Black people in the U.S. A novel contribution is the role of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, or the belief that members of an outgroup are likely to return a favor (positive), or enact retribution for a wrong (negative) as a factor in the relationship between television use and attitudes. Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time.

AB  - The perception of one's body image becomes particularly important in adolescence. Body dissatisfaction has been associated with negative psychological functioning, such as self-esteem and depression. Previous findings showed that the decreased self-esteem due to body dissatisfaction explained the association between negative attitude toward body and psychological well-being in different cultural contexts. The present study examined adolescents from the US (N = 1002) and Korea (N = 3993) and replicated and extended the previous findings regarding body dissatisfaction and associated psychological outcomes. The results showed that body dissatisfaction predicted higher depressed mood and that self-esteem mediated this association for both American and Korean adolescents. Notably, the indirect effect of body dissatisfaction and perceived body image on depressed mood via self-esteem was greater for American adolescents than for Korean adolescents. The implications of the cultural difference in the significance of self-esteem in mediating the body dissatisfaction and depressed mood are discussed.

AB  - Drawing from the tripartite sociocultural model of body image, the researchers examined whether direct messages and modeling from peers, parents, and media were concurrently and prospectively associated with appearance-based rejection sensitivity (appearance-RS) in young adolescents (M-age=12.0years). Appearance-RS was higher among those who concurrently reported more appearance-related teasing and pressure by peers, more parent teasing, and greater acceptance of media appearance ideals. In prospective analyses, greater increases in appearance-RS over 1year were found for adolescents who perceived higher levels of parental appearance-related teasing and negative attitudes about their own appearance. Moderation analyses indicated the positive prospective association between parental negative appearance attitudes and appearance-RS was found in younger but not older participants. Gender did not moderate associations.

AB  - Recent research has noted the persistence of a long continuum of "anti-welfare" discourses that are increasingly embedded in the UK news media, political communication, and popular culture (e.g. Golding and Middleton 1982. Images of Welfare: Press and Public Attitudes to Poverty. Oxford: Mark Robertson; Jensen 2014. "Welfare Commonsense, Poverty Porn and Doxosophy." Sociological Research Online 19 (3): 277-283; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books). Historical distinctions between the "deserving" and "undeserving poor" have been sharpened by successive governments in the service of varying shades of neoliberal governance. While Margaret Thatcher castigated "shirkers" in fostering an ideology of economic self-reliance, both New Labour and the Coalition obsessed over "welfare reform": promoting an ideology of "work" in symbolic opposition to supposed cultures of "worklessness". But, while "scroungerphobia" (Deacon 1978. "The Scrounging Controversy: Public Attitudes Towards the Unemployed in Contemporary Britain." Social Policy and Administration 12 (2): 120-135) is now a widely recognised sociological phenomenon, scholarly attention to the concept has largely been reserved for its manifestation in tabloid newspapers, political rhetoric and, latterly, "poverty porn" television. Even recent work considering the public's contribution to scrounger discourse(s) on social media focuses on mainstream platforms, such as Twitter and newspaper comment threads (e.g. Van Der Bom et al. 2018. "'It's not the Fact They Claim Benefits but Their Useless, Lazy, Drug Taking Lifestyles we Despise': Analysing Audience Responses to Benefits Street Using Live Tweets." Discourse, Context & Media 21: 36-45; Morrison 2019. Scroungers: Moral Panics and Media Myths. London: Zed Books; Paterson 2020). This paper begins to address this oversight, by examining how normative anti-welfare discourses infiltrate everyday communication in more disparate online communities - including niche consumer forums. It draws on previously unpublished findings from an analysis of welfare-related conversations in these and other spaces at the height of a recent moral panic over "scroungers": the period from 2013-2016, when Conservative-led governments strove to legitimise sweeping benefit cuts and punitive "welfare reform".

AB  - Decisional balance in quitting smoking involves positive and negative attitudes toward smoking. This study explored the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking, and examined the mediating role of willingness to quit smoking and the moderating role of social support. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 326 daily male smokers from China in 2016, including the decisional balance of smoking, willingness to quit smoking, social support, planning to quit, and nicotine dependence. The results showed: (1) willingness to quit smoking mediated the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking; (2) the relationship between the decisional balance of smoking and planning to quit smoking was moderated by emotional support rather than instrumental support. Smokers with a higher level of emotional support for quitting smoking were more likely to progress to planning to quit smoking, while this relationship was not found among smokers with a lower level of emotional support. These findings suggested that smokers' willingness to quit smoking would be key to promoting their planning to quit. Meanwhile, the dynamic process of planning to quit smoking was moderated by emotional support from others.

AB  - The results of a survey of U.S. men (N = 285) indicated that participants' gender schemas, hostile sexism, political orientation, and support for women's rights influenced their attitude toward "enlightened manvertising," which refers to advertising that redefines masculinity by promoting both masculine and feminine traits as elements of contemporary manhood. The study uses the advertising self-congruence framework, which in previous research has not been applied to the context of gender and gendered identities. The results show that enlightened manvertising messages resonate with men who self-identify strongly only with masculine traits or who score high in both masculinity and femininity. Support for women's rights was positively associated with attitude toward enlightened manvertising. Men who expressed overtly misogynistic views more likely would have a negative attitude, as were men who identified as more conservative in their political orientation. The overall results suggest a link between men's views on redefining masculinity and their views on women and women's roles in society, with implications for the success of campaigns that attempt to tackle gender identity and equality.

AB  - Many cancers are linked to varying degrees with common lifestyle factors such as smoking, drinking and diet, and are therefore partially preventable. Building on existing risk perception literature, this article uses the case of red meat consumption to examine the effect of people's attitudes and attitude ambivalence on health risk perceptions where there is some uncertainty about the risk. Data was obtained from an opportunity sample of community-dwelling adults (n=167) using an online survey. The survey included information from a recent press release on the cancer risk associated with red meat consumption (probably carcinogenic') as well as measures of attitude to red meat, attitude ambivalence, ambiguity aversion, information evaluation and acceptance of cancer risk. Participants who were more inclined to accept the risk of cancer linked to red meat tended to have a more negative attitude to red meat, higher attitude ambivalence, more favourable evaluation of the information provided, lower ambiguity aversion and lower red meat consumption; they also tended to be of older age. Attitude was a weaker predictor of risk perception among participants who were highly ambivalent. This, coupled with the finding that people with an ambivalent attitude to red meat evaluated the risk information more favourably and were more convinced that red meat can cause cancer, suggests that attitude ambivalence may play a more important role in risk perception than previously thought. These findings are discussed in the context of strategies for dealing with risk when drawing on rational and non-rational logics of handling evidence.

AB  - Based on Bourdieu's cultural capital theory, our study examined the engagement of newly arrived children (NAC) with ICT and e-sports both at home and in school in the context of Hong Kong. Our in-depth case study of a Hong Kong secondary school revealed that the selected NAC typically came from disadvantaged school and immigrant family backgrounds. They had limited access to technology and little parental mediation at home. The results also showed that as these NAC excessively used ICT at home for multiplayer online games, they became active e-sports players with good ICT skills. These students created an e-sports culture in the school, which was supported by their teachers and the principal. Contrary to their parents' conservative and negative attitude towards a career in e-sports or the ICT industry, the principal and teachers viewed e-sports as an alternative way for their students to accumulate capital and provide them with opportunities for upward social mobility. The findings demonstrate the importance of education in bridging the digital divide of NAC and helping them accumulate the digital dimension of cultural capital.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge, attitude and practice of hepatitis B and C patients towards the disease.
   Methods: The cross-sectional, descriptive, questionnaire-based study was conducted at the Rawalpindi Medical University (RMU) and its allied hospitals, Rawalpindi, Pakistan, from October to December 2017, and comprised hepatitis B and C patients aged >= 18 years who were visiting the outpatient department. A structured, close-ended, 30-item questionnaire was used to collect data which was then analysed using SPSS 23.
   Results: Of the 399 patients, 230(57.6%) were women, 103(26%) did not have any formal education, and TV, radio and the internet was the main source of information regarding hepatitis for 138(34.6%) patients. The overall mean age was 42.82 +/- 11.78 years. The sample showed poor knowledge with a mean score of 7.33 +/- 2.03, adequate attitude with a mean of 4.33 +/- 1.19, and poor practice with a mean of 2.97 +/- 1.05. Correlation was statistically significant between knowledge and practice (p<0.01).
   Conclusion: Lack of imperative knowledge of hepatitis in patients was the main reason for negative attitude and poor practices.

AB  - In the article I outline a therapeutic process for people with anorexia nervosa, which concerns viewing one's body image and self-esteem built around one's perceived figure. In the individual psychotherapeutic process presented here, which addresses the perception and evaluation of the body image experienced by patients, I focus on two major aspects: 1) striving for the so-called 'ideal' figure, created and fueled by the media, disconnected from the actual inherited body build, and 2) emotions that accompany the patients in the distorted perception of their body and associated with their interpersonal relationships or intrapsychic problems. Maintaining reference to the so-called 'ideal' figure, to which the patients aspire, I search together with each patient for similarities in their body build with that of their family of origin. As the therapeutic practice shows, this enables the teenage/adult female patients to increasingly accept their body build. However, working with emotions directed towards their own body, mostly consisting of anger, I consider together with the patient whether these emotions could have been transferred from interpersonal relations to body perception and to the negative attitude towards it.

AB  - Purpose: To examine whether videos of controversial police interventions shape individual opinion and, consequently, if attitudes towards use of force are malleable in the short-term. Methodology: A self-administered survey was conducted among 248 undergraduate students as part of a larger project on attitudes towards police use of force. Two groups of respondents were asked general questions about the police: one group was shown fictional videos of controversial police interventions just prior to completing the questionnaire; the other was not. Findings: Results strongly suggest that videos of police interventions have significant effects on reported opinions about use of force: the group that watched the videos was more likely to report that the police frequently use force. Implications: The wide distribution of images by police organizations might have unexpected adverse effects on public attitudes.

AB  - The aim of the study is to analyze the effect of smokers' guilt on regret and the effect of regret on attitudes and repurchase intention towards tobacco smoking. In addition, it is aimed to determine whether attitudes have a mediating effect on the relationship between regret and repurchase intention towards smoking. Face-to-face survey is conducted to collect data with 429 tobacco smokers in Izmir-Turkey by judgment-sampling method. The findings showed that the post-purchase guilt felt by consumers in terms of health, financial and moral guilt resulted in a feeling of regret. Regret was also found to affect repurchase intention due to the mediating effect of attitudes towards smoking. Another finding also displays that, despite the sample of consumers' represent negative attitudes, they could still exhibit repurchase behavior towards tobacco smoking. The contribution of this study is to investigate guilt and regret simultaneously, to reveal their effects on attitudes and, repurchasing intention towards smoking within the context of social marketing.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze parental opinions regarding immunization services and the factors that affect parental decisions regarding the vaccination of their children. We conducted descriptive study with 373 parents. The Parent Information Form and the Public Attitude Toward Vaccination Scale-Health Belief Model developed to evaluate vaccination approaches, were used. Of the parents who participated in the study, 35.9% stated that they found the information on childhood vaccinations unreliable or that they doubted the credibility of the information. In addition, most of the parents (71%) stated that they believed that the high number of immigrant children in the country causes contagious diseases to increase. It is found that there are statistically significant higher scores in the subscales of severity, susceptibility, and health motivation among the parents who disagree with the media statements on anti-vaccination attitudes (p < 0,001). Opinions and approaches of parents toward childhood vaccinations are affected by sociodemographic characteristics. In this study, the educational level of parents was found to be the most important variable affecting the approach of parents toward vaccinations.

AB  - BackgroundFamilies with young children have faced serious challenges during the first lockdown as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to remote working, parents have had to monitor their children's schoolwork and manage their daily lives. When one of the children also has neuro-developmental disorders, this results in an increased burden. We can therefore wonder how these families with one or more young children (under 6 years old) with special needs have experienced and dealt with this lockdown. Aim of the StudyIn this context, the "COVJEUNENFANT" study focused more specifically on the subjective experience, as a parent, of those who cared for children with special needs (i.e., with developmental disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, proven disabilities or chronic health conditions) compared to the general population. We wished to see if the consequences of the health crisis were significantly different from those perceived by respondents in the general population (n = 490) and if the sociodemographic structure of these families differed from those of other respondents. MethodsNinety three French families with at least one child under 6 years old and one with developmental difficulties or a chronic illness, from a cohort of 490 control families, participated in a web-based survey during the first lockdown, from the 28th April 2020 to 29th May 2020. ResultsAfter presenting the participants' sociodemographic characteristics, the results show that these French families (n = 93) are less wealthy than the control population "without special needs" (n = 397), have felt more pressures originating from their environment (families, friends, colleagues, media, social networks horizontal ellipsis ), have suffered from more health issues (other than COVID-19), have taken more measures to protect themselves (social-distancing), and were less likely to feel happy. A significantly larger number of them lamented the lack of free time and voiced a larger need for information regarding children's education. However, their parental role was felt as being more satisfying and their family relations strengthened more than in the general population of participants. ConclusionIt is apparent that urgent prioritisation is needed in order to support and care for these families by continuing to provide care for their children in one way or another, and by ensuring that their need to adapt again does not exceed their own abilities and resources, especially as young children, who have high levels of requirements, are present in the home.

AB  - Globally, vaccine hesitancy is a growing public health problem. It is detrimental to the consolidation of immunization program achievements and elimination of vaccine-targeted diseases. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy in China and explore its contributing factors. A national cross-sectional online survey among Chinese adults (>= 18 years old) was conducted between August 6, 2021 and August 9 via a market research company. We collected sociodemographic information; lifestyle behavior; quality of life; the knowledge, awareness, and behavior of COVID-19; the knowledge, awareness, and behavior of COVID-19 vaccine; willingness of COVID-19 vaccination; accessibility of COVID-19 vaccination services; skepticism about COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccine; doctor and vaccine developer scale; and so on. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to estimate the associations by using logistic regression models. A total of 29,925 residents (48.64% men) were enrolled in our study with mean age of 30.99 years. We found an overall prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy at 8.40% (95% CI, 8.09-8.72) in primary vaccination and 8.39% (95% CI, 8.07-8.70) in booster vaccination. In addition, after adjusting for potential confounders, we found that women, higher educational level, married residents, higher score of health condition, never smoked, increased washing hands, increased wearing mask, increased social distance, lower level of vaccine conspiracy beliefs, disease risks outweigh vaccine risk, higher level of convenient vaccination, and higher level of trust in doctor and developer were more willing to vaccinate than all others (all p < 0.05). Age, sex, educational level, marital status, chronic disease condition, smoking, healthy behaviors, the curability of COVID-19, the channel of accessing information of COVID-19 vaccine, endorsement of vaccine conspiracy beliefs, weigh risks of vaccination against risks of the disease, making a positive influence on the health of others around you, and lower trust in healthcare system may affect the variation of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine (all p < 0.05). The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy was modest in China, even with the slight resulting cascade of changing vaccination rates between the primary and booster vaccination. Urgent action to address vaccine hesitancy is needed in building trust in medical personnel and vaccine producers, promoting the convenience of vaccination services, and spreading reliable information of COVID-19 vaccination via the Internet and other media.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) health crisis is strongly affecting the psychological well-being of the general population. According to a very recent literature, the imposed lockdown and social distancing measures have generated a series of negative outcomes, including fear of the future, anxiety, and somatization symptoms. Few studies have investigated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of parents and children, and still fewer studies have assessed the relationship between the psychological health of parents and children. The present study aimed at understanding the effect of parents' psychological distress and verbal aggression on behavioral and emotional symptoms of children during the COVID-19 lockdown. Using an online survey administered in the first weeks of the lockdown in Italy, we explored the mediating effects of parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms on the relationship between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention in a sample of 878 Italian parents (87.4% mothers; mean(age) = 40.58). Two hypotheses were proposed: (1) parent distress would significantly predict child hyperactivity/inattention, and (2) parent verbal hostility and child emotional symptoms would mediate the association between parent distress and child hyperactivity/inattention. The serial mediated model confirmed both hypotheses, suggesting that higher rates of psychological distress in parents were associated with higher levels of hyperactivity/inattention in children. Parent verbal hostility and child emotional problems were also found to positively mediate this relation. Our results may be used to improve sociopsychological interventions in the general population in the near future. They may also contribute to the clinical definition of therapeutic paths for parents and families.

AB  - Purpose The authors sought to unpack the paradox between increasing demand for probiotics products against inconclusive scientific evidence about the effectiveness. This paper investigated public understanding of the composition and benefits of probiotic products, measured trust in news media and scientists as sources of information about probiotic products and informational and attitudinal predictors of consumer trust in the news media and scientists. Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst a representative sample of 2000 UK consumers. Participants responded to multiple-choice questions and psychometric scales capturing probiotics knowledge, consumption, information seeking behaviour, attitudes to and confidence in the news media and probiotics scientists. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA and hierarchical regression modelling were performed. Findings Information exposure to probiotics content was highest from traditional media followed by online channels. Levels of confidence in probiotics scientists were higher than in the news media, even though these levels were highest amongst current consumers and lowest amongst non-consumers. Conflicting information, health consciousness and trust in nutrition stakeholders were identified as important predictors of trust in news media and scientists. Originality/value This study provides a large-scale nationally representative overview of public attitudes and sentiments related to probiotic products with a focus on attitudes towards the news media and the scientific establishment. The findings suggest a need for better consumer awareness about the state of science around probiotic products, interventions that could enable consumers to discern conflicting evidence or news reports, and critical skills that can render them more resilient to online misinformation.

AB  - News media play a crucial role in the production and reproduction of stereotypes, influencing public opinions regarding different groups and minorities. Thus, acquiring a deeper understanding of media coverage of Muslims and Islam is decisive for understanding the sources of public attitudes towards Muslims. This study aims at displaying how Muslims and Islam are represented in Italian and Spanish media. Focusing on the online version of the two most influential newspapers in each country (El Mundo and El Pais for Spain and Il Corriere della Sera and La Repubblica for Italy) from 2015 to 2020, the results show how Muslims in both countries are mostly framed either related to terrorism or within the general discourse on immigration. In both cases, they are portrayed as "others". The article also presents a novelty, defining and observing two different types of Islamophobia, Banal and Ontological Islamophobia.

Along with testing the basic tenet of the contact hypothesis in a minority-minority context, the mediating effect of intergroup anxiety and the moderating effect of perceived social norms on the contact-attitude association were specified by taking into account the identity processes involved in intergroup interactions. The results indicated, first, that the experience of intergroup anxiety evoked by a negative intergroup encounter was reflected in negative outgroup attitudes only among the weakly identified. Second, negative contact experiences of minority adolescents were found not to be reflected in negative attitudes when their ethnic identification was attenuated, and when they perceived positive norms regarding intergroup attitudes.

AB  - Journalists and readers of celebrity news regularly bash celebrities online, a behavior that is easily accepted among adolescents. This study investigates whether these attitudes of acceptance differ according to the perpetrator of the bashing (media versus public) and the likeability of the involved celebrity (liked versus disliked). Using a vignette study, we examine adolescent girls' attitudes toward media (journalists') and public (readers') bashing of a generally disliked celebrity (Miley Cyrus) and a generally liked celebrity (Selena Gomez). All participants read an identical negative news story (media bashing) and two related negative reader comments (public bashing). Participants were randomly assigned to read this information about either Miley Cyrus or Selena Gomez. Results of a mixed-design ANOVA showed that the girls had less negative attitudes toward media bashing compared with public bashing. Moreover, they more easily accepted the bashing of a disliked celebrity than the bashing of a liked celebrity.

AB  - The link between gaming and negative outcomes has been explored by previous research and has led to the widespread adverse attitude toward gaming (ATG) and gamers, especially from those who are unfamiliar with this activity. By implementing an audit study with gamers and non-gamers as participants (N = 1,280), we found that non-gamer participants rated gamers less as similar to their ideal marriage partners compared to non-gamers, while gamer participants did not differentiate between gamers and non-gamers in the ideal marriage partners similarity rating (IMPSR). The findings also revealed that the difference in IMPSR between gamer and non-gamer participants toward gamers was completely mediated by their ATG. These results imply that non-gamers consider gaming as an undesired characteristic, and this is due to the relatively negative attitude of non-gamers toward gaming. Current study provides a new perspective on exploring the effect of gaming by investigating the social interaction between gamers and non-gamers in real-world and suggests that the unfamiliarity of gaming can lead to the negative ATG, which may, ultimately, place gamers at a disadvantage in the context of mate selection.

AB  - Background: Sexting has recently emerged as a public health and social issue. The present study had two aims: a) to preliminarily test adolescent gender differences on parental practices regarding adolescent online life, parental monitoring, adolescent attitude towards sexting and sexting behaviors; b) to separately test for male and female adolescents a conceptual model in which sexting behaviors are explained by the parental practices and monitoring, with the mediation of adolescent negative attitude towards sexting.
   Methods: Direct and indirect links between the variables in the model were investigated. The study was carried out with 541 participants. Participants were Italian adolescents (60% males; 40% females) aged 14 to 19years (M-age=16,19years, SDage=1,31).
   Results: Results suggested that females sent more multimedia sexts, had a higher perception of risk associated with sexting and reported higher scores for both parental practices regarding adolescent online life and parental monitoring. Rules on Contents, Parental Knowledge, Adolescent Disclosure, and Parental Control resulted to be linked to both sexting attitudes and behaviors for male and female adolescents.
   Conclusions: Findings emphasize the important role that parents play in shaping attitudes and behaviors of both daughters and sons during adolescence.

AB  - This paper presents the examination of a particular theoretical framework that incorporated the moderating role of demographics in a mediated by negative attitudes relationship between values and pro-environmental behaviour. The hypothesised hierarchical impact of Universalism (Un) on pro-environmental purchasing behaviour (PPB) through the mediation of environmental unconcern (EU) was verified, while age was found to moderate the relationship between attitudes and behaviour. Yet, a clear generational effect was indicated as younger consumers (less than 35 years old), who are less inhibited by environmental unconcern, are more likely to get engaged in PPB than their older counterparts are. The verification of this particular theoretical framework revealed nested, not apparent, aspects of the grid of PPB antecedents. It is implied that the overall effort towards PPB should start by inculcating self-transcendence values in young people's minds and continue by acknowledging, understanding and facing their unconcern tendency instead of just reporting some alleged direct motives towards PPB.

AB  - This study examines the role of individuals' media diets in contributing to the growing support for right-wing populist parties. Drawing on social identity theory and the notion of populism as political communication, this study argues that socio-economic status and tabloid news use explain support for right-wing candidates through heightened out-group hostility. Using survey data from the Austrian National Election Study (N = 1161), we present a process model in the structural equation modeling framework, and we compare the direct and indirect effects of attention to tabloid versus broadsheet news on the probability to vote for the Freiheitliche Partei osterreichs. Results show that the link between social status and support for right-wing populism is mediated by attention to tabloid news and anti-immigration attitudes. Implications for democratic norms are discussed in light of the overlap between news media and politicians in their use of populist narratives.

AB  - Three experimental studies investigated whether death-thoughts avoidance as a consequence of mortality salience and need for certainty as a consequence of uncertainty are two different motivational states. The results suggest that although death-thought avoidance and need for certainty are different constructs, they share a great deal of variance (anxiety plays a pivotal mediational role in both). However, whereas the impact of uncertainty on negative attitudes towards an out-group with different worldviews (Arabs) was mediated only by anxiety (measured retrospectively), the effect of mortality salience was mediated by both retrospective anxiety and death-thought accessibility. These findings imply that similar effects that have been obtained by these two manipulations are, at least partly, the result of different processes. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Background: Nodding Syndrome is a debilitating disorder of yet unknown etiology that has affected children and adolescents aged 3 - 18 years in parts of sub Saharan African countries including Uganda, South Sudan, Tanzania and Liberia.
   Objective: To identify stereotypes and negative attitudes held by primary care health workers about nodding syndrome.
   Method: Of one hundred health workers invited by the Uganda Ministry of Health for training on nodding syndrome from the three most affected districts of Pader, Lamwo and Kitgum forty were interviewed using a predesigned tool. Content and thematic analysis was applied.
   Results: There were 22 females. The median age was 33 years (range 23-54 years). The participants included Psychiatric Clinical Officers, Medical Clinical Officers, Laboratory Technicians, Midwives, Registered and Enrolled Nurses. Overall, four broad categories of negative stereotypes were identified; Nodding syndrome is 1) an incurable disease, 2) is associated with evil spirits and curses, 3) is disabling, making the patient a burden to society and 4) is a fatal illness.
   Conclusion: Primary health care workers who lead the care of patients with nodding syndrome have several negative stereotypes that may potentially impact negatively on the quality of care they provide.

AB  - Muslims are consistently the target of dehumanization and hostile policies. Previous research shows that interventions that highlight the hypocrisy wherein people collectively blame entire groups for the heinous acts of individual members of outgroups but not ingroups are effective in reducing animosity towards Muslims. However, these interventions rely on aversive materials (e.g., terrorist acts), which can hinder the scalability of interventions due to individuals' tendency to resist/avoid challenging and aversive stimuli. In three preregistered studies (combined N = 2,635), we developed and tested a nonaversive, hypocrisy-based intervention that highlights the hypocrisy involved in attributing ingroup members' prosocial acts to the entire ingroup (i.e., Christians) but not doing the same for outgroup members (i.e., Muslims). Results indicated that this collective praise intervention reliably reduces dehumanization of Muslims, anti-Muslim policy support, and collective blame of Muslims. We argue that the intervention's use of nonaversive stimuli allows for both practical and scalable applications.

AB  - Background The World Health Organization (WHO) declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020. Previous studies of infectious diseases showed that infectious diseases not only cause physical damage to infected individuals but also damage to the mental health of the public. Therefore this study aims to analyze the factors that affected depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic to provide evidence for COVID-19-related mental health policies and to emphasize the need to prepare for mental health issues related to potential infectious disease outbreaks in the future. Results This study performed the following statistical analyses to analyze the factors that influence depression in the public during the COVID-19 pandemic. First, to confirm the level of depression in the public in each country, the participants' depression was plotted on a Boxplot graph for analysis. Second, to confirm personal and national factors that influence depression in individuals, a multi-level analysis was conducted. As a result, the median Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score for all participants was 6. The median was higher than the overall median for the Philippines, Indonesia, and Paraguay, suggesting a higher level of depression. In personal variables, depression was higher in females than in males, and higher in participants who had experienced discrimination due to COVID-19 than those who had not. In contrast, depression was lower in older participants, those with good subjective health, and those who practiced personal hygiene for prevention. In national variables, depression was higher when the Government Response Stringency Index score was higher, when life expectancy was higher, and when social capital was higher. In contrast, depression was lower when literacy rates were higher. Conclusions Our study reveals that depression was higher in participants living in countries with higher stringency index scores than in participants living in other countries. Maintaining a high level of vigilance for safety cannot be criticized. However, in the current situation, where coexisting with COVID-19 has become inevitable, inflexible and stringent policies not only increase depression in the public, but may also decrease resilience to COVID-19 and compromise preparations for coexistence with COVID-19. Accordingly, when establishing policies such as social distancing and quarantine, each country should consider the context of their own country.

AB  - Panic buying frequently occurs in health pandemics, disturbing both the market and people's lives. The situation is exacerbated by the easy spread of misinformation online. With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers' derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants' attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in closure of schools and playgrounds while requiring social distancing, changes that likely affected youth sports participation. The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the epidemiology of pediatric sports injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: This retrospective cohort study included patients between the ages of 4 and 18 years who presented to orthopaedic clinics within a single children's hospital network with an acute injury sustained during athletic activity between March 20, 2020, and June 3, 2020 (the strictest period of state-level shelter-in-place orders). These patients were compared with those within the same dates in 2018 and 2019. Chi square and Mann-Whitney U tests were used, as appropriate.
   Results: Significantly less sports injuries were seen during the pandemic (n = 257) compared with the same dates in 2018 (n = 483) and 2019 (n = 444) despite more providers available in 2020 (P < 0.001). During the pandemic, patients with sports injuries were younger (median age 11 versus 13 years, P < 0.001) and had less delay in presentation (median 5 versus 11 days, P < 0.001). A higher proportion were White (66.9% versus 47.7%, P < 0.001), privately insured (63.4% versus 48.3%, P < 0.001), and seen at a nonurban location (63.4% versus 50.2%, P < 0.001). Most sports injuries during the pandemic were fractures (83.7%). Although 71.4% of all injuries in the prepandemic period occurred in the context of formal sports, only 15.2% were sustained in a formal athletic context in 2020 (P < 0.001). The frequency of surgical treatment was higher during the pandemic (14.8% versus 7.8%, P = 0.001), mainly because most of these injuries were fractures requiring surgical intervention.
   Conclusions: Fewer sports injuries were seen in the outpatient setting during the COVID-19 pandemic, and most of these injuries were fractures and occurred outside of organized sports settings. Patients were more likely to be White, privately insured, and seen at a nonurban location.

AB  - Nation-wide community quarantines and social distancing are part of the new normal because of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Since extensive and prolonged lockdowns are relatively novel experiences, not much is known about the well-being of individuals in such extreme situations. This research effort investigated the relationship between well-being elements and resiliency of 533 Filipino adults who were placed under the nationwide enhanced community quarantine (ECQ) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants comprised of 376 females (70.56%) and 157 males (29.45%). The median and mode ages of the participants is 23 years, while 25 is the mean age. PERMA Profiler was used to measure participants' well-being elements, while Connor-Davidson Resiliency Scale-10 (CD-RISC-10) was used to measure their resiliency. Collected data were analyzed using the regression model and necessary condition analysis. This study corroborated that all the five pillars of well-being are significant positive correlates of resiliency (p < 0.00) in quarantined adults. The results shown accomplishment (beta = 0.447, p < 0.01) positively predicts resiliency, while negative emotions (beta = -0.171, p < 0.00) negatively predict resiliency. Lastly, the five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions (ceiling envelopment with free disposal hull, CE-FDH p < 0.00) of resiliency. Our results cast a new light on well-being elements as constraints rather than enablers of resiliency. This novel result shows that optimum resiliency is only possible when all the five pillars of well-being are taken care of and when a person is at least minimally contented with their physical health. The present findings underscore the importance of a holistic as against an atomistic approach to maintaining good mental health, which suggests that deficiencies in certain areas of well-being may not be fully addressed by overcompensating on other areas, as all five pillars of well-being are necessary-but-not-sufficient conditions of resiliency. The study ends with the recommendation for the use of necessary condition analysis to study both classical and novel psychological research problems.

AB  - Does social influence exerted through role modeling of collective action impact social change in contexts that are not conducive to collective action, such as long-lasting violent conflicts? We examined this question in two field experiments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We created two versions of an episode of an existing media intervention (a show aiming to promote positive social change), in which fictional characters either planned collective action (role modeling condition), or did not plan action (control condition) to address grievances. In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on intergroup attitudes.

AB  - Throughout history, alcohol policy has been tied to ideas of cultural change. In 2000, the New Labour government proposed deregulatory legislation that was designed, in part, to change British drinking cultures. However, implementation of the subsequent 2003 Licensing Act coincided with developments in alcohol retail and drinking behaviours which created widespread public concern. Government alcohol policy was also criticised by public health advocates who rejected the model of cultural change which underpinned it. Focussing on England and Wales, this article considers how an emphasis on culture-change outcomes undermined the political success of New Labour's alcohol policy; how media responses reinforced problematic ideas around British drinking culture; and how public health policy lobbying on alcohol has exposed a marked political divide over the role of legislation in shaping public attitudes and behaviours.

KW  - BIG-5 PERSONALITY
AB  - This paper explores the impact that increased exposure to China during the two and a half weeks of the Beijing Olympics had on American attitudes towards China. A large N longitudinal survey revealed a significant increase in negative attitudes towards China from the beginning to the end of August 2008. Statistical analysis revealed no dominant explanation for this change, however. Instead, personality (openness), ideology (social dominance orientation and right wing authoritarianism), and media exposure each had a small impact on changing attitudes. Further research (including a follow-up experiment manipulating the valence of media coverage of China) suggested both the possibility of an 'efficiency effect', whereby China's very success in both hosting and competing in the Olympics generated increased American anxiety about China, and a 'cheating effect', whereby stories about underage Chinese gymnasts and deception (e.g. lip synching while another child actually sang during the Opening Ceremonies) diffused broadly through social networks, uniformly and negatively impacting American attitudes towards China.

AB  - This article demonstrates that the Profumo affair, which obsessed Britain for large parts of 1963, was not simply a political scandal, but was also an important cultural event. Focussing on the production of The Keeler Affair, a feature film that figured prominently in contemporary coverage of the scandal but which has been largely overlooked since, the article shows that this film emerged from a situation in which cultural entrepreneurs, many of them associated with the satire boom, sought to exploit the scandal for financial gain. Many Profumo-related cultural products found an audience, and thus formed an integral part of, and helped to shape public attitudes towards, the Profumo affair. However, these products did not go uncontested, and resistance to them, and especially to the idea that Keeler might benefit materially from her role in the scandal, speak to concerns about cultural mediations of sex, politics and humour in early-1960s Britain.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has many consequences for people with Parkinson's disease (PD). Social distancing measures complicate regular care and result in lifestyle changes, which may indirectly cause psychological stress and worsening of PD symptoms.
   Objective: To assess whether the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with increased psychological distress and decreased physical activity in PD, how these changes related to PD motor and non-motor symptom severity, and what frequency and burden of COVID-related stressors were.
   Methods: We sent an online survey to the Personalized Parkinson Project (PPP) cohort (n = 498 PD patients) in the Netherlands. In the survey, we distinguished between COVID-related stressor load, psychological distress, PD symptom severity, and physical activity. We related inter-individual differences to personality factors and clinical factors collected before the pandemic occurred.
   Results: 358 PD patients completed the survey between April 21 and May 25, 2020 (response rate 71.9%). Patients with higher COVID-related stressor load experienced more PD symptoms, and this effect was mediated by the degree of psychological distress. 46.6% of PD patients were less physically active since the COVID-19 pandemic, and reduced physical activity correlated with worse PD symptoms. Symptoms that worsened most were rigidity, fatigue, tremor, pain and concentration. Presence of neuropsychiatric symptoms (anxiety, depression) before the pandemic, as well as cognitive dysfunction and several personality traits predicted increased psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Conclusion: Our findings show how an external stressor (the COVID-19 pandemic) leads to a worsening of PD symptoms by evoking psychological distress as well as lifestyle changes (reduced physical activity).

AB  - Psychological flexibility refers to attending to the present moment and accepting internal experiences in order to effectively adapt behavior in the pursuit of valued goals. Previous research has linked mental health stigma to lower levels of psychological flexibility (i.e., psychological inflexibility or experiential avoidance), resulting in negative attitudes toward those affected by mental health problems. In the current study, 570 individuals participated in an online survey in which they completed measures of depressive symptom severity, psychological inflexibility, and different types of public mental health stigma. Results showed that psychological inflexibility statistically mediated the relationship between depression symptomatology and public stigma toward others with depression, but not the relationship between depression symptomatology and stigma about others receiving treatment for depression. In other words, one's own depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of holding stigmatizing attitudes toward others with depression, and this process worked through increased levels of psychological inflexibility. In contrast, the relationship between people's increased depressive symptoms and stigmatizing attitudes about others receiving mental health treatment was not dependent on their psychological inflexibility level. The findings are discussed within an emerging contextual behavioral science model of stigma.

AB  - Online news consumers have the tendency to select political news that confirms their prior attitudes, which may further fuel polarized divides in society. Despite scholarly attention to drivers of selective exposure, we know too little about how healthiercross-cuttingnews exposure patterns can be stimulated in digital media environments. Study 1 (N = 553) exposed people to news media literacy (NML) interventions using injunctive and descriptive normative language. The findings reveal the conditional effect of such online interventions: Participants with pro-immigration attitudes engaged in more cross-cutting exposure while the intervention was only to a certain extent effective for Democrats, ineffective for Republicans, and even boomeranged for partisans with anti-immigration attitudes. In response to these findings, Study 2 (N = 579) aimed to design interventions that work across issue publics and party affiliation. We show that NML messages tailored on immigration beliefs can be effective across the board. These findings inform the design of more successful NML interventions.

AB  - Having an Anglican affiliation is known to be associated with support for leaving the European Union (EU) in Britain. Religiosity, conceived as strength of religious attachment, has received comparatively little treatment. We investigate religiosity via electoral, household, and attitudinal surveys, distinguishing the effects of "behaving" and "believing." The association between religiosity and EU Referendum vote choice and position is identified before and after inclusion of values, attitudinal, and civic engagement measures. Consistent with established findings, in socio-structural models Anglicans are more likely to support Brexit than religious Nones. More frequent church attendance is associated with being more pro-Remain. The Anglican effect is primarily mediated by anti-immigrant attitudes, authoritarianism, and salience of ethnic identity, suggesting a Christian nationalist aspect to Leave support. The attendance effect is mediated by warmer attitudes toward immigrants, and social capital. Notably, those exhibiting stronger orthodox belief tend to feature a stronger attachment to "Leave," with this partly mediated by authoritarianism. To evaluate the net effect of religion on civic life, we should pay more attention to the cultural content of religious beliefs, and how they structure other values and attitudes.

AB  - Although research on prejudice against gender and sexual minorities has been increasing in recent years, little attention has been paid to predictors for transprejudice and its potential culture-specific correlates in particular. This cross-sectional study addressed these gaps in the literature by exploring the relative contributions of social dominance orientation, authoritarianism, filial piety, and essentialist beliefs of gender to negative attitudes toward transgender people in 371 Chinese participants. Path analyses showed that (a) consistent with previous research, authoritarianism and social dominance orientation made independent contributions to explaining variance in transprejudice; (b) filial piety, as a culture-specific variable, was a unique predictor for transprejudice beyond the effects of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation; and (c) these relations appeared to be mediated by gender essentialism. Our findings suggest that people with higher levels of authoritarianism and social dominance orientation tend to have stronger essentialist beliefs of gender, which may in turn contribute to the development of transprejudice. It also highlights the importance of identifying culture-specific predictors (e.g., filial piety in a Chinese context) when we attempt to understand transprejudice.

AB  - The linguistic frames used to describe new areas of science and technology can have a powerful effect on the way that those technologies are perceived by the general public. As geoengineering continues to attract scholarly and policy interest, a number of frames have emerged in the scientific, political and media discourse. In the current paper, we provide an empirical test of one of the most prevalent framing devices: describing geoengineering technologies by analogy to natural processes. In an online experiment with members of the UK public, participants who read a description of geoengineering technologies as analogous to natural processes were more likely to support geoengineering as a response to climate change. In addition, participants' views about the relationship between geoengineering and nature strongly predicted support for geoengineering. Our findings suggest that communicators should be cautious when using natural analogies to communicate about geoengineering with the general public, as frame choice is likely to influence public attitudes and potentially convey undue positivity.

AB  - Second-generation mindfulness-based interventions (SG-MBIs) align well with positive psychology philosophy and practices, but trials of SG-MBIs have largely focused on ill-being. This study developed a mindfulness-based positive psychology (MBPP) intervention integrating positive psychology with an SG-MBI to enhance well-being. A randomized control trial was performed to compare MBPP with a waitlist condition among 138 Chinese participants. The results showed that MBPP significantly reduced negative emotions for subjective well-being and significantly improved environmental mastery for psychological well-being. Improvements in self-compassion and negative attitudes but not avoidance, mediated changes in well-being. Changes in positive emotions, positive relations, and awareness were associated with the amount of meditation practice. These findings showed that MBPP is promising for improving well-being and that the positive psychology components play important roles. Broadly, the study illustrated that positive psychology and SG-MBIs can be effectively integrated, and it supported the further application of SG-MBIs from the positive psychology perspective.

AB  - This study examined the impact of stigma on subjective recovery from psychosis, and whether self-esteem and internalised stigma (self-directed negative attitudes and thoughts regarding one's mental health issues) mediates the observed associations between stigmatising experiences and outcome. Fifty-nine services-users with schizophrenia or bipolar affective disorder diagnoses completed symptom (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale) and subjective recovery (Process of Recovery Questionnaire) measures, as well as stigma measures (the King Stigma Scale, Internalised Stigma of Mental Illness Scale), and the Self-Esteem Rating Scale. Diagnosis was a persistently significant factor in all analyses, suggesting a negative effect of the term "schizophrenia" on subjective recovery. In a multiple serial mediation analysis, experiences of stigma predicated subjective recovery and this effect was mediated through internalised stigma, which consequently impaired self-esteem. Internalised stigma is an important psychological mechanism in recovery. Interventions aimed at improving self-esteem and recovery feelings for psychosis-spectrum service-users may benefit from taking the role of internalised stigma into account.

KW  - cooperation
KW  - comparative law
AB  - This article gives a background to police cooperation approaches in both Australia and the EU. Cooperation strategies are divided into Australian Federal/European Union strategies and regional (Australian state and territory and EU member states) cooperation strategies. Examples are highlighted where cooperation is hampered by national or state and territory sovereignty interests. Problems are discussed in relation to both entities, such as the different legal regimes, lack of trust, media attention and funding, the importance of the 'personal factor' and education. This article focuses in particular on the role of the practitioner. Practitioners, on the one hand, may overcome the negative attitude of their organisations and develop personal networks which transcend borders. On the other hand, a practitioner can embody the obstructive attitude of the organisation he/she represents. The article concludes by giving recommendations for future legislative and practical responses to the existing problems.

AB  - This research note examines how framing influences attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI). It uses an experiment embedded in a nationally representative online survey to test the effects of text-based frames and visuals on opinion about developing, funding, and banning AI. Participants exposed to a "social progress" frame reported greater support for AI than those exposed to a "Pandora's box" frame. Images (virtual assistants, personal robots, menacing movie AIs, or none) did not influence opinion by themselves but interacted with textual frames to do so. The results extend our understanding of framing effects on public attitudes toward emerging technologies.

KW  - sexual orientation
KW  - obsessive-compulsive symptoms
AB  - Previous research has shown that intrusive thoughts in obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) often focus on emotionally significant aspects of individuals' lives (e.g., values and beliefs). The current study sought to expand our understanding of OC symptoms related to sexual orientation (SO-OC symptoms) by investigating the roles of homophobia (i.e., negative attitudes, affect, and behaviors toward individuals with a same-gender orientation) and disgust propensity and sensitivity. A total of 592 self-identified heterosexual college students were recruited to complete measures of homophobia, disgust propensity and sensitivity, and SO-OC symptoms. Results of separate parallel mediation analyses indicated that the relationships between homophobic affect/attitudes and avoidance/aggression on one hand, and SO-OC symptoms on the other, were partially mediated specifically by disgust sensitivity, after controlling for gender. Theoretical and clinical implications are discussed, including how homophobia can be conceptualized as a disgust response in the treatment of SO-OC symptoms, as well as how other constructs of potential interest (sexual and moral disgust, religiosity, conservative sexual ideology) can be examined in future research.

AB  - Objectives: In the COVID-19 era, extreme measures of social distancing have contained the spread of common viral respiratory infections, which are involved in the pathogenesis of Adenotonsillar Hypertrophy (ATH), and Chronic Otitis Media with Effusion (COME), the two commonest chronic ENT diseases of childhood. This study examines the lockdown effect on the number of procedures performed for these two conditions. Methods: The consecutive charts of 650 and 195 children being operated respectively for ATH and COME during the quarantine (05/2020-02/2021) and unrestrained (05/2019-02/2020) periods were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical treatment of ankyloglossia, performed in 103 patients during the same periods was employed as a control procedure. Results: Adenotonsillectomies and tympanostomies significantly decreased in the lockdown phase by 52% (P < 0.001) and 74% (P < 0.001), respectively, whereas control procedure counts increased by 25%. In terms of seasonal variation, ATH-related surgeries were significantly reduced during the winter season of the pandemic by 73% (P < 0.001), in comparison with the corresponding months of the unrestrained period. School-aged children received significantly fewer operations for ATH (-59%) than preschoolers (-42%), as a result of the lockdown (P = 0.044). Conclusion: When the child's exposure to respiratory pathogens is minimal, as in the case of lockdown, a noticeable decline occurs in the incidence of ATH and COME indicated for surgical treatment. Chronic low-grade inflammation, boosted by repetitive viral infections seems to underlie both conditions. Timely, effective isolation measures might reverse the disease process and keep the child away from the Operating Room.

AB  - It has been over a year since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak of COVID-19 as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and subsequently a global pandemic. The world has experienced a lot of uncertainty since then as we all get used to this new 'normal' with social distancing measures, lockdowns, the emergence of new variants, and an array of hope with the development of vaccines. Having an abstract understanding of vaccine delivery, public perceptions of vaccines, and promoting acceptance of vaccines are critical to tackling the pandemic. The advent of the pandemic has led to the emergence of an 'infodemic' or rampant misinformation surrounding the virus, treatment, and vaccines. This poses a critical threat to global health as it has the potential to lead to a public health crisis by exacerbating disease spread and overwhelming healthcare systems. This 'infodemic' has led to rising vaccine hesitancy which is of paramount concern with the WHO even identifying it as one of the ten main threats to Global health almost 2 years before the approval of COVID-19 vaccines. Pregnant African women are one of the most vulnerable population groups in a region with an already burdened healthcare system. Currently, there isn't ample research in the literature that explores vaccine hesitancy in this subpopulation and the impact of social media misinformation surrounding it. The aim of this paper is to highlight the implications of this 'infodemic' on the pregnant African population and suggest key recommendations for improved healthcare strategies.

KW  - security
KW  - strategic narrative
AB  - A growing body of the International Relations (IR) literature has started to pay attention to the concept of 'strategic narratives', stressing the role played by storylines in affecting public attitudes. However, the analytical differences between concepts like strategic narratives, master narratives, frames, framing and master frames have been rarely investigated through a comprehensive approach. Very different definitions and perspectives have been adopted in the IR scholarly debate and beyond, while few studies have identified how ideologies underlie frames and narratives. This article aims at filling this gap and makes two claims. First, the process of plot formation, their strategic dimension and the levels at which narratives operate are the special features that distinguish strategic narratives from all other concepts. Second, only by unpacking - from an interdisciplinary perspective - the complex relation between ideology and narratives can we understand the proper conceptual boundaries in the narrative literature. In sum, there are four levels of discourse to be considered: frame, strategic narrative, master narrative and ideology.

AB  - Backgroud: Personal characteristics contribute to whether negative attitudes in society are internalized as deteriorating self-stigma. Studies in healthy subjects suggest that resilience is associated with the regulation of amygdala activation by the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but little is known about the factors that contribute to individual stigma resistance in psychiatric patients.
   Methods: We assessed stigma (by measuring association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia by an implicit association test) in 20 patients with schizophrenia and in 16 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The brain activation strengths were measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging during evaluation of schizophrenia-related statements and of control statements.
   Results: Association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia were inversely related to the strength of the activation of the rostro-ventral mPFC. This inverse correlation survived adjustment for global functioning, depression symptom scores, and insight. Activation of the rostro-ventral mPFC was negatively correlated with activation of the amygdala. The association strengths between social inferiority and schizophrenia correlated with the compromised performance in a Stroop task, which is a measure of cognitive regulation.
   Discussion: Our findings suggest that individual stigma resistance is associated with emotion regulation. These findings may help to understand better stigma resistance and thereby aid the development of patient interventions that add to the public anti-stigma work in reducing devastating effects of stigma.

AB  - Introduction: Cambodian law enforcement's limited acceptance of harm reduction has hindered HIV program effectiveness. With funding from the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, FHI 360 supported the Ministry of Interior to implement the Police Community Partnership Initiative (PCPI) in Cambodia's capital Phnom Penh. To guide this, FHI 360 conducted a baseline study examining police and key populations' attitudes and practices towards one another, including fear and occurrence of arrest.
   Methods: Between December 2012 and January 2013, a cross-sectional survey of 199 police post officers, 199 people who use drugs (PWUD) including people who inject drugs (PWID), 199 men who have sex with men (MSM), 200 transgender women (TGW) and 200 female entertainment workers (FEW) was conducted in five Phnom Penh districts. Eligible participants were >= 18 years, members of a key population from selected hotspots or police officers, deputy chiefs or chiefs.
   Results: Key populations' median age was 25 years (IQR: 22-30); 40% had completed only primary school. Police were male (99.5%), with median age 43 years (IQR: 30 to 47), and 45 and 25% high school and university completion rates, respectively. Key populations feared arrest for carrying needles and syringes (67%), condoms (23%) and 19% felt afraid to access health services. Close to 75% of police reported body searching and 58% arresting key populations in the past six months for using drugs (64%), selling or distributing drugs (36%) or being violent (13%). Self-reported arrests (23% PWUD, 6% MSM, 6% TGW, 12% FEW; p<0.05), being verbally threatened (45% PWUD, 21% MSM, 25% TGW, 27% FEW; p<0.001) and body searched (44% PWUD, 28% MSM, 23% TGW, 8% FEW; p<0.001) was significantly higher among PWUD than other key populations. The majority (94%) of police believed arrest was an appropriate solution to reduce HIV and drug use and reported selling sex (88%) and carrying needles and syringes (55%) as valid reasons for arrest.
   Conclusions: Key populations' fear of accessing harm reduction and health services and police's negative attitudes and practices towards key populations present major barriers to HIV prevention efforts in Cambodia. To create an enabling environment and ensure police are allies in the Cambodian HIV response, interventions should tackle underlying negative attitudes among police towards key populations and vice versa.

AB  - We aimed to create an engaging and dynamic intervention for schools that uses videos of direct school peer contact to implement a vicarious contact intervention. Participants were ethnic majority (Italian) and minority (immigrant) high school students (N = 485; age ranging from 14 to 22 years old, M-age = 17.24 years), who were asked to watch and evaluate videos created by peers from their school for a competition for the best video on intercultural friendships. Results revealed that vicarious contact, relative to a control condition where participants were not shown any videos, improved outgroup attitudes, reduced negative outgroup stereotypes, and increased willingness to engage in contact with the outgroup. These effects only emerged when intercultural friendships in the videos were salient. Inclusion of the other in the self, but neither intergroup anxiety nor fear of rejection by the outgroup, significantly mediated the effect of the videos on outcomes. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of the findings.

AB  - To underpin the psychological factors for vaccination intention, we explored the variables related to positive and negative attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Taiwan. The data were collected via an online survey platform with a sample size of 1100 in April 2021. We found that people's interpretations of the origin of the virus were relevant. People who tended to believe that the virus was artificially created felt powerless and were more concerned about the possible side-effects of the vaccines, which was negatively associated with their vaccination intention. The source of vaccine recommendation was found to be relevant to vaccination intention. People's vaccination intention was highest if the vaccines were recommended by health professionals, followed by friends and the government, and then mainstream media and social media. The analysis of the demographic variables showed that men tended to be more receptive to vaccines than women. Our findings should provide insights into developing communication strategies to effectively promote vaccination intentions.

AB  - Traumatic events have been considered significant risk factors for older adults' mental health, but the mediating mechanism and moderating effect of aging attitudes that underlie this relationship have yet been completely investigated. The attitudes of the elderly toward aging can be divided into two closely related but conceptually different dimensions, including positive and negative. Positive aging attitudes refer to optimistic feelings and experiences about aging, whereas negative attitudes toward aging are related to detrimental thoughts and sensations experienced about the increasing age. The purpose of this study is to explore the mediating and moderating roles of these two dimensions of aging attitudes between traumatic events and depression of the elderly in China. Data for this research come from the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS) of 2014. A nationally representative sample consisting of 11,511 Chinese older adults aged 60 and above was obtained through a stratified, multi-stage probability sampling method. The results revealed that the association between traumatic events and depression was mediated and moderated by positive and negative aging attitudes, controlling for gender, age, spouse, educational level, and ethnicity. Significance, implications, and limitations were discussed.

AB  - Introduction. As a result of the revolutionary events and the military conflict in Donbas in 2014, the number of inbound tourists travelling to Ukraine has dropped almost twice - from 24.7 million in 2013 to 12.7 million in 2014. Ukraine has faced a challenge related to the need for reorienting and diversifying of inbound tourism flows and the need to enter new tourism markets. One of the top priorities is the outbound Canadian tourism market. Ukrainian Diaspora, long-standing strong international ties, visa-free entry for Canadian citizens and ratification of the Free Trade Agreement, intense diplomatic relations and the launch of direct flight create the basis for the growth of tourist flows from Canada to Ukraine. It is necessary to conduct professional and thorough research of the Canadian outbound tourism market in order to increase tourist flows, as well as the revenues to the Ukrainian economy from the tourism industry in the context of creating and promoting targeted Ukrainian tourism products for a Canadian tourist.
   Purpose. The purpose of this paper is to examine the Canadian travel market in the context of the target audience consuming the Ukrainian tourism product and to define the recommendations for the "Canada-Ukraine" tourism flow.
   Results. The article analyses the outbound tourism market of Canada as a priority target audience of consumers of the Ukrainian tourism product. The factors of the huge volume of the outbound tourism market of Canada have been presented. The state and growth rates of existing Canada-Ukraine tourist flows have been analysed. The competitive advantages of the Canadian tourism market in comparison with the Ukrainian one have been given, namely: safety, protection of natural resources and ecology, institutional capacity of tourism industry development. The favourable factors for increasing the inflow of tourist flow from Canada to Ukraine, such as numerous Ukrainian Diaspora, positive attitude of Canadians towards Ukraine, visa-free entry for the Canadian citizens to Ukraine; intensification of diplomatic and trade relations, the launch of the direct flight Kyiv-Toronto, have been defined and characterised. The peculiarities of a potential Canadian tourist, who is a representative of the Ukrainian Diaspora, have been analysed. The main channels of popularisation of the Ukrainian tourism product have been researched: the organisation of the Ukrainian community of Canada, the Ukrainian media in Canada. The main tourism exhibitions in Canada, fan trips and press tours for the Canadian tour operators and the Canadian media; hosting the "Days of Ukraine in Canada" in the main places where most of the Ukrainian Diaspora representatives live.
   Conclusions. Recommendations for tourist travel agencies who plan to work with the Canadian consumer of the Ukrainian tourism product have been formulated. The resort and recreational types of tourism should not be the basis of Ukrainian tourist products for the Canadians because of their non-competitiveness in comparison with Canadian tourist products. A trip to Ukraine will be more in demand if tourism products combine Ukrainian and European tourist products ("Ukraine +"). This may be a joint tourism product with neighbouring countries: Ukraine + Poland, Ukraine + Hungary, Ukraine + Romania, Ukraine + Slovakia. When forming a combined tourism product, it is necessary to take into account the availability of convenient logistics (direct flights ideally) and Canadian tourist traffic to the chosen European country/city.

AB  - Cybervictimization has been linked to adverse psychological consequences but little is known about the mechanisms linking cybervictimization to lower well-being. We conducted two studies to examine emotional self efficacy and distinct emotion regulation strategies as potential mediators in the relationship between cybervictimization and lower well-being among German adolescents during the school closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. In Study 1, 107 adolescents (M-age =15.76) reported their cybervictimization frequency, emotional self-efficacy beliefs, and aspects of well-being (i.e., self-esteem, perceived social support, and subjective well-being during the COVID-19 related school closures). Emotional self-efficacy mediated the link between cybervictimization and all well-being measures. Specifically, cybervictimization was related to lower wellbeing through lower self-efficacy for managing negative emotions. For further examination, in Study 2, 205 adolescents (M-age = 15.45) were asked to report their cybervictimization experiences, use of specific emotion regulation strategies (rumination, reappraisal, and suppression), and well-being (i.e., self-esteem and life satisfaction). Cybervictimization was related to lower well-being through more rumination, but not through reappraisal or suppression. Taken together, our findings suggest that cybervictims may have lower emotional self efficacy beliefs and engage in more rumination, a maladaptive emotion regulation strategy. These deficits in adolescents' beliefs and capabilities for effectively managing negative emotions may be accountable for the adverse psychological consequences of cybervictimization. Notably, exploratory analyses suggest that cybervictimization frequency did not increase among adolescents during the lockdown (e.g., homeschooling, social distancing) due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose - Despite evidence that violent daydreaming is a correlate of suicidal ideation, no research has examined the mechanisms underlying this association. The interpersonal theory of suicide may provide insight. This theory postulates that individuals with high suicidal desire experience intractable feelings of perceived burdensomeness (PB) and thwarted belongingness (TB). Violent daydreaming may fuel negative attitudes toward others and oneself and turn attention away from loved ones, thereby increasing feelings that one is a burden on others (PB) and socially disconnected (TB). However, no studies have tested TB and PB as explanatory mechanisms. The purpose of this paper is to examine the relationships between violent daydreaming, PB, TB, suicidal ideation, and depression in two samples (n = 818).
   Design/methodology/approach - Study 1 was comprised of general undergraduates, and Study 2 selected for undergraduates with a history of ideation. Self-report measures were administered and indirect effects analyses were conducted.
   Findings - In both studies, violent daydreaming was associated with increased feelings of PB, TB, and ideation severity. Consistent with the interpersonal theory, TB and PB were significant parallel mediators of the relationship between violent daydreaming and suicidal ideation, beyond sex and age. In contrast to Study 1, results were no longer significant in Study 2 after accounting for depression.
   Originality/value - This was the first study to test TB and PB as mechanisms underlying the relationship between violent daydreaming and suicide risk. Findings highlight the importance of monitoring and addressing violent daydreams and interpersonal functioning throughout treatment to mitigate risk.

AB  - Muslims living in Western countries appear to utilize mental health services at lower rates than the general population despite facing significant mental health challenges. Stigma toward help-seeking may be a barrier to treatment. One model suggests that public stigma, internalized as self-stigma, leads to negative attitudes and less favorable intentions toward seeking psychological help. Cross-cultural differences in this model challenge its applicability for Western Muslims and suggest that it may be moderated by acculturation and enculturation. The first objective of this study is to investigate the applicability of the internalized stigma model (Vogel et al., 2007) in a sample of Muslims. The second objective is to explore whether acculturation and enculturation moderate this model. An online survey that included measures of public and self-stigma of help-seeking, attitudes toward help-seeking, intentions to seek help, and acculturation/enculturation was completed by 238 Canadian Muslim participants. Serial mediation analyses investigated whether public stigma predicts (a) attitudes through self-stigma and (b) intentions toward help-seeking through self-stigma and attitudes. Conditional process modeling examined whether acculturation and enculturation moderated the serial mediation models. Both mediation models were significant. Public stigma was positively associated with self-stigma, self-stigma was negatively associated with attitudes toward help-seeking, and attitudes were positively related to intentions to seek services. Acculturation and enculturation did not moderate the models. The internalized stigma model is applicable to Canadian Muslims. Previous assertions that acculturation or enculturation influence this model were not supported.

AB  - Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is marked by high distress and behavioral and functional impairments due to preoccupation with perceived appearance anomalies. Our aim was to examine parental correlates of offspring's symptoms characteristic of BDD, testing both direct associations and indirect associations via appearance-based rejection sensitivity (appearance-RS). Surveys were completed by 302 Australian adolescents (9-14 years) and their parents. Findings indicated parents' weight and appearance teasing and child-report (but not parent-report) of parental negative attitudes about weight and appearance were uniquely associated with offspring's heightened BDD-like symptoms, and associations were partially indirect via adolescents' appearance-RS. Findings support theory that identifies parents as socializers of children's appearance concerns, and show that BDD-like symptoms may be partly elevated because of the mediating role of appearance-RS. We propose that BDD symptoms could partly emerge as compensatory responses to parents' appearance messages, and the associated bias to expect and perceive rejection based on one's appearance.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance is a global issue that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Therefore, this study aims to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the general Saudi populations toward antibiotics use.
   Design and method: A cross-sectional, anonymous online survey was conducted from January 1 to May 11, 2020, across five major regions of Saudi Arabia. Participants (aged >= 18 years) were invited through social media to complete an online self-structured questionnaire. All data were analyzed by Statistical Package (SPSS v. 25). Descriptive statistics, Pearson's Chi-squared, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and Pearson correlation analyses were conducted.
   Results: Out of 443 participants, the majority (n=309, 69.8%) were females, 294 (64.4%) were married, 176 (39.7%) were 25-34 years of age, 338 (76.3%) were living in the Eastern Province, 313 (70.7%) had college or higher education, 139 (31.4%) were not working, and 163 (36.8%) had a monthly income of USD 8001330. Overall, most participants demonstrated good knowledge and practice (88% and 85.6%, respectively). However, 76.8%had inadequate attitude score levels towards antibiotics use. Of all the respondents, 74.9% knew that not completing a full course of antibiotics may cause antibiotics resistance, 91.33% did not agree that antibiotics should be accessed without a prescription, and 94.04% will not hand over leftover antibiotics to family members. Factors associated with adequate knowledge were female, medical jobs, and higher income (p<0.05).
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed that while most participants were aware of antibiotics use and demonstrated good knowledge, good practices, they had negative attitudes towards antibiotics use.

AB  - Music is not only the art of organized sound but also a compound of social interaction among people, built upon social and environmental foundations. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 outbreak, containment measures such as shelter-in-place, lockdown, social distancing, and self-quarantine have severely impacted the foundation of human society, resulting in a drastic change in our everyday experience. In this paper, the relationships between musical behavior, lifestyle, and psychological states during the shelter-in-place period of the COVID-19 pandemic are investigated. An online survey on musical experience, lifestyle changes, stress level, musical behaviors, media usage, and environmental sound perception was conducted. The survey was conducted in early June 2020. Responses from 620 people in 24 countries were collected, with the large proportion of the responses coming from the U.S. (55.5%) and India (21.4%). Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed causal relationships between lifestyle, stress, and music behaviors. Elements such as stress-level change, work risk, and staying home contribute to changes in musical experiences, such as moderating emotion with music, feeling emotional with music, and being more attentive to music. Stress-level change was correlated with work risk and income change, and people who started living with others due to the outbreak, especially with their children, indicated less change in stress level. People with more stress-level change tended to use music more purposefully for their mental well-being, such as to moderate emotions, to influence mood, and to relax. In addition, people with more stress-level change tend to be more annoyed by neighbors' noise. Housing type was not directly associated with annoyance; however, attention to environmental sounds decreased when the housing type was smaller. Attention to environmental and musical sounds and the emotional responses to them are highly inter-correlated. Multi-group SEM based on musicians showed that the causal relationship structure for professional musicians differs from that of less-experienced musicians. For professional musicians, staying at home was the only component that caused all musical behavior changes; stress did not cause musical behavior changes. Regarding Internet use, listening to music via YouTube and streaming was preferred over TV and radio, especially among less-experienced musicians, while participation in the online music community was preferred by more advanced musicians. This work suggests that social, environmental, and personal factors and limitations influence the changes in our musical behavior, perception of sonic experience, and emotional recognition, and that people actively accommodated the unusual pandemic situations using music and Internet technologies.</p>

AB  - An important first step in seeking counseling may involve obtaining information about mental health concerns and treatment options. Researchers have suggested that some people may avoid such information because it is too threatening due to self-stigma and negative attitudes, but the link to actual help-seeking decisions has not been tested. Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to examine whether self-stigma and attitudes negatively impact decisions to seek information about mental health concerns and counseling. Probit regression models with 370 undergraduates showed that self-stigma negatively predicted decisions to seek both mental health and counseling information, with attitudes toward counseling mediating self-stigma's influence on these decisions. Among individuals experiencing higher levels of distress, the predicted probabilities of seeking mental health information (8.5%) and counseling information (8.4%) for those with high self-stigma were nearly half of those with low self-stigma (17.1% and 15.0%, respectively). This suggests that self-stigma may hinder initial decisions to seek mental health and counseling information, and implies the need for the development of early interventions designed to reduce help-seeking barriers.

AB  - Purpose Tobacco prevention media campaigns are an important tool to address youth tobacco use. We developed a theory-based perceived message effectiveness (PME) Scale to use when vetting messages for campaigns. Methods Participants were a national sample of N=623 US adolescents (ages 13-17 years) recruited from a national probability-based panel. In an online experiment, we randomised adolescents to view tobacco prevention ads. All participants viewed an ad on smoking or vaping from the US Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign and a control video, in a random order. After ad exposure, we assessed PME using nine candidate items and constructs for convergent and criterion validity analyses. We used confirmatory factor analysis and examined information curves to select the scale items. Results A brief PME scale with three items (alpha=0.95) worked equally well for demographically diverse adolescents with different patterns of tobacco use. The Real Cost ads generated higher PME scores than the control videos for both vaping and smoking (convergent validity; p<0.05). Higher PME scores were associated with greater attention, fear, cognitive elaboration and anticipated social interactions (convergent validity; r=0.31-0.66), as well as more negative attitudes toward and lower susceptibility to vaping and smoking (criterion validity; r=-0.14 to -0.37). A single-item PME measure performed similarly to the three-item version. Conclusions The University of North Carolina PME Scale for Youth is a reliable and valid measure of the potential effectiveness of vaping and smoking prevention ads. Employing PME scales during message development and selection may help youth tobacco prevention campaigns deploy more effective ads.

AB  - Research in social psychology has shown that public attitudes towards feminism are mostly based on stereotypical views linking feminism with leftist politics and lesbian orientation. It is claimed that such attitudes are due to the negative and sexualised media construction of feminism. Studies concerned with the media representation of feminism seem to confirm this tendency. While most of this research provides significant insights into the representation of feminism, the findings are often based on a small sample of texts. Also, most of the research was conducted in an Anglo-American setting. This study attempts to address some of the shortcomings of previous work by examining the discourse of feminism in a large corpus of German and British newspaper data. It does so by employing the tools of Corpus Linguistics. By investigating the collocation profiles of the search term feminism, we provide evidence of salient discourse patterns surrounding feminism in two different cultural contexts.

AB  - Background: The efficacy of e-cigarette prevention ads among adolescents has seldom been studied. We examined the impact of ads from the The Real Cost vaping prevention media campaign on what adolescents think and believe about vaping. We also sought to test whether perceived message effectiveness (PME) served as a proxy for ad impact.
   Methods: Participants were 543 U.S. adolescents ages 13-17. In an online experiment, we randomized participants to either: 1) persuasive e-cigarette prevention video ads from the Food and Drug Administration's The Real Cost campaign that was targeted to adolescents or 2) information-only e-cigarette harms control videos (control condition). Participants in each condition viewed 2 videos in a random order. After ad exposure, the survey assessed PME (message and effects perceptions), risk beliefs about vaping, attitudes toward vaping, and intentions to vape.
   Results: The FDA's The Real Cost ads led to higher beliefs about the harms of vaping (p < .001), more negative attitudes toward vaping (p < .001), and lower intentions to vape (p < .05) compared to the control videos. The Real Cost ads also scored higher on both message perceptions (p < .001) and effects perceptions (p < .001) compared to control videos. Effects perceptions were associated with all three outcomes (all ps < 0.001, adjusting for both types of PME and covariates), but message perceptions did not offer additional predictive value.
   Conclusions: Exposure to The Real Cost vaping prevention ads gave adolescents a more negative view of vaping and lowered their intentions to vape compared to control videos. Effects perceptions may be superior to message perceptions as a proxy for e-cigarette prevention ad impact.

AB  - Introduction. - Lack of parental care and high parental control have systematically been linked to depression. Dysfunctional schemas explain this relationship.
   Objective. - We propose that a retrospective evaluation of unsupportive parental socialization of emotion should predict depression in adulthood and that this relationship should be mediated by negative attitudes toward sadness.
   Method. - One hundred and forty undergraduate students (mean age of 22) completed a questionnaire for assessing the socialization of emotion (QSE), another for evaluating types of attitudes toward sadness (QAFET), and the Brief Symptom Inventory Depression scale (BSI-D).
   Results. - Results show that four attitudes toward sadness, namely perception of sadness as a complaint, anger against the self if sad, fear of being rejected if sad and fear of where sadness might lead, each partially mediate the relationship between unsupportive parental socialization of emotion and adult depression.
   Conclusion. - Our findings have both theoretical and practical implications. On the one hand, we demonstrated that unsupportive parental socialization of emotion and some attitudes toward sadness both predict depression. On the other hand, our results justify a closer look at parental socialization of emotion and attitudes toward sadness when clinically investigating depression. (c) 2012 Elsevier Masson SAS.

TI  - Comparison of Estimated Effectiveness of Case-Based and Population-Based Interventions on COVID-19 Containment in Taiwan
T2  - JAMA INTERNAL MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - IMPORTANCE Taiwan is one of the few countries with initial success in COVID-19 control without strict lockdown or school closure. The reasons remain to be fully elucidated.
   OBJECTIVE To compare and evaluate the effectiveness of case-based (including contact tracing and quarantine) and population-based (including social distancing and facial masking) interventions for COVID-19 in Taiwan.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This comparative effectiveness study used a stochastic branching process model using COVID-19 epidemic data from Taiwan, an island nation of 23.6 million people, with no locally acquired cases of COVID-19 reported for 253 days between April and December 2020.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Effective reproduction number of COVID-19 cases (the number of secondary cases generated by 1 primary case) and the probability of outbreak extinction (0 new cases within 20 generations). For model development and calibration, an estimation of the incubation period (interval from exposure to symptom onset), serial interval (time between symptom onset in an infector-infectee pair), and the statistical distribution of the number of any subsequent infections generated by 1 primary case was calculated.
   RESULTS This study analyzed data from 158 confirmed COVID-19 cases (median age, 45 years; interquartile range, 25-55 years; 84 men [53%]). An estimated 55% (95% credible interval [CrI], 41%-68%) of transmission events occurred during the presymptomatic stage. In our estimated analysis, case detection, contact tracing, and 14-day quarantine of close contacts (regardless of symptoms) was estimated to decrease the reproduction number from the counterfactual value of 2.50 to 1.53 (95% CrI, 1.50-1.57), which would not be sufficient for epidemic control, which requires a value of less than 1. In our estimated analysis, voluntary population-based interventions, if used alone, were estimated to have reduced the reproduction number to 1.30 (95% CrI, 1.03-1.58). Combined case-based and population-based interventions were estimated to reduce the reproduction number to below unity (0.85; 95% CrI, 0.78-0.89). Results were similar for additional analyses with influenza data and sensitivity analyses.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this comparative effectiveness research study, the combination of case-based and population-based interventions (with wide adherence) may explain the success of COVID-19 control in Taiwan in 2020. Either category of interventions alone would have been insufficient, even in a country with an effective public health system and comprehensive contact tracing program. Mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic requires the collaborative effort of public health professionals and the general public.

AB  - Technologies offered and used on the Internet play a significant part in the lives of children; nevertheless, little research has been done on how children view and use machine translation (MT). According to recent literature, there are various benefits to using MT in teaching/learning foreign languages, such as more fluent writing, more effective communication, and fewer errors. Nevertheless, the use of MT in classroom settings is often viewed as problematic by language teachers. Despite the fact that a vast number of students have used MT for various purposes or have tried experimenting with MT for certain academic or entertainment purposes, they seem to have mixed feelings about it. The present qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews and aims to capture a snapshot of Lithuanian children's perceptions and awareness of MT technologies. The results of the interviews reveal that children mostly find out about MT as a result of their own efforts and employ MT tools for a variety of purposes; however, at school no systematic guidance and/or support in terms of MT use is provided and children tend to perceive that their teachers generally hold negative attitudes towards MT.

AB  - The purpose of this matched case-control study was to investigate the social correlates of primary infertility among females aged 35 years or less. The study was conducted in the Clinics of Samarkand Medical Institute, Uzbekistan, among 120 infertile and 120 healthy women matched by age, residential area, and occupation from January to June 2009. Data were collected by face-to-face interviews using a structured questionnaire. Median duration of infertility was 10.0 months (interquartile range = 6.0-13.0). The rate of remarriage was 3.5 times higher among infertile women compared with healthy subjects. Insufficient family income, poor quality of life, life stress, and discontentment with daily routines as well as 'bad' relationships with family members (husband, mother-and father-in-law) were significant correlates of female infertility. Infertile women were more likely to underestimate the importance of sexual intimacy, and a negative attitude to sex. Female infertility is associated with various social correlates leading to higher remarriage rates and to further complicating the problem of infertility. Thus, a correction of women's basic attitudes and their relationships to their surrounding social habitat should be an essential component of any program of infertility management.

AB  - After the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and its spread across the world, countries have adopted containment measures to stop its transmission, limit fatalities, and relieve hospitals from straining and overwhelming conditions imposed by the virus. Many countries implemented social distancing and lockdown strategies that negatively impacted their economies and the psychological wellbeing of their citizens, even though they contributed to saving lives. Recently approved and available, COVID-19 vaccines can provide a really viable and sustainable option for controlling the pandemic. However, their uptake represents a global challenge due to vaccine hesitancy and logistic-organizational hurdles that have made its distribution stagnant in several developed countries despite several appeals by the media, policy- and decision-makers, and community leaders. Vaccine distribution is also a concern in developing countries, where there is a scarcity of doses. The objective of the present study was to set up a metric to assess vaccination uptake and identify national socio-economic factors influencing this indicator. We conducted a cross-country study. We first estimated the vaccination uptake rate across countries by fitting a logistic model to reported daily case numbers. Using the uptake rate, we estimated the vaccine roll-out index. Next, we used Random Forest, an "off-the-shelf" machine learning algorithm, to study the association between vaccination uptake rate and socio-economic factors. We found that the mean vaccine roll-out index is 0.016 (standard deviation 0.016), with a range between 0.0001 (Haiti) and 0.0829 (Mongolia). The top four factors associated with the vaccine roll-out index are the median per capita income, human development index, percentage of individuals who have used the internet in the last three months, and health expenditure per capita. The still-ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on the disparity in vaccine adoption across low- and high-income countries, which represents a global public health challenge. We must pave the way for universal access to vaccines and other approved treatments, regardless of demographic structures and underlying health conditions. Income disparity remains, instead, an important cause of vaccine inequity, which restricts the functioning of the global vaccine allocation framework and, thus, the ending of the pandemic. Stronger mechanisms are needed to foster countries' political willingness to promote vaccine and drug access equity in a globalized society where future pandemics and other global health crises can be anticipated.

AB  - Information and communication technologies enable migrants to maintain bonds with multiple communities. Little is known about the association between migrants' connections to their country of origin and different integration practices in online and offline communities in the receiving society. We draw on a survey conducted amongst migrants in Iceland (N = 2,139) and conduct three regression analyses to identify determinants of migrants' use of media and social media from their country of origin. Contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of reactive transnationalism (i.e., migrants seeking out connections to their places of origin due to dissatisfaction with life in the receiving society) as a response to negative attitudes towards the receiving society. We identify distinct patterns of online and offline integration: Migrants with frequent contact with their countries of origin are less integrated locally in terms of offline activities. However, they are more integrated in digital communities of the receiving society, and use receiving-country media more frequently, thus following a strategy of digital biculturalism.

AB  - Background The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world is unprecedented, posing greater threats to vulnerable healthcare systems, especially in developing countries. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of dental healthcare providers in Nigeria about the disease and evaluate their responses to the preventive measures necessitated by COVID-19. Methods This was an online self-administered questionnaire-based study conducted among dentists practicing in Nigeria. A message containing the link to the survey was sent widely via social medial platforms and electronic mails to dentists practicing in Nigeria. The data collection was done between the 2(nd) of June and 3rd of July 2020. Results A total of 314 responses was recorded. Fever was the most specified generalized symptom (97.5%), while the use of masks (100%), hand hygiene (99.7%), social distancing (97.7%) and surface cleaning (99.4%) were the most commonly employed general preventive methods. The main identified risk of transmission in the clinic was aerosol generating procedures (98.7%). Conclusion The general knowledge of dental personnel in our study population appears to be adequate on the common clinical features of COVID-19 but less adequate regarding the less common features. The COVID-19 pandemic has also modified some aspects of dental service delivery but more needs to be done in this regard. Preventive measures against the transmission of COVID-19 in dental practice settings include proper utilization of teledentistry, clinical triage, preprocedural 1% hydrogen peroxide oral rinses, and the use of appropriate Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) which should always be encouraged.

AB  - Objectives: To report changes in clinical and surgical volume impacting a Pediatric Otolaryngology division one year prior to and following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to five other pediatric surgical subspecialties. Methods: The number of clinical visits and surgical cases per month for six pediatric surgical specialties (Otolaryngology, Orthopedic Surgery, Urology, Neurosurgery, Plastic Surgery, and General Surgery) for 12 months prior to the pandemic and 12 months following the onset of the pandemic was collected. Poisson regression analysis was performed for the number of visits and cases per season adjusting for specialty, season, staffing changes, and the pandemic to determine adjusted rate ratios (aRR) post-pandemic for the surgical fields compared to Otolaryngology. Results: A percentage decrease in median visits per paired month (-15.63%, IQR = -23.01, -1.66) and operative cases (-19.86%, IQR = -29.39, -10.17) was seen for Pediatric Otolaryngology. Regression analysis showed a significant negative effect on the number of visits (aRR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.70-0.77) and cases (aRR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.60-0.71) due to the pandemic. While many of the other specialties had predicted reductions in volume (notably Orthopedics), they all experienced significant predicted increases in productivity following the pandemic compared to Otolaryngology. Conclusions: These findings suggest that Pediatric Otolaryngology is particularly vulnerable to this change in clinical pattern, which could be due to a decline in community infections from mask wearing and social distancing, and may result in a longer-term volume deficit when compared to other pediatric surgical subspecialties.

AB  - Narratives about Africa as dark, depraved, and diseased justified the exploitation of African land and people. Today, these narratives may still have a hold on people's fears about disease. We test this in three (pre-COVID-19) experiments (N = 1,803). Across studies, we find that participants report greater worry about a pandemic originating in Africa (vs. elsewhere). In turn, they report greater support for travel bans and for loosening abortion restrictions. We then document these narratives in an archival study of newspaper articles of the 2015-2016 Zika pandemic (N = 1,475). We find that articles were more negative-for example, they included more death-related words-if they mentioned Africa. Finally, we replicate the experimental results within the COVID-19 context, using a representative sample (N = 1,200). Taken together, the studies make clear that reactions to pandemics are biased, and in a way consistent with historical narratives about race and Africa.

AB  - Aim To test (1) if there was a change in self-reported lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine use by birth cohort and (2) if the extent of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was associated with the proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem. Design Observational study using seven waves of repeated cross-sectional nationally representative household surveys between 2001 and 2019. Setting Australia. Participants Participants were from three birth cohorts: 1951-60 (age 68-77 at the 2019 survey; n = 29 458; 55% female), 1961-1970 (age 58-67; n = 29 859; 57% female) and 1971-1980 (age 48-57; n = 28 758; 59% female). Data were weighted to align the sample to the Australian population. Measurements Past year meth/amphetamine use; under-reporting of lifetime meth/amphetamine use in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum (operationalised as the difference between self-reported lifetime prevalence in 2001 and that of each subsequent year); proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum. Under-reporting was regressed on the proportion of people holding negative attitude towards meth/amphetamine. Survey year and birth cohort were adjusted for. Findings Between 2001 and 2019, the lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine decreased from 6.1% (95% CI = 5.3-6.9) to 1.7% (95% CI = 1.2-2.2) in the 1951-1960 birth cohort (p < 0.001), from 13.0% (95% CI = 12.0-14.1) to 4.4% (95% CI = 3.7-5.2) in the 1961-1970 birth cohort (p < 0.001) and from 21.4% (95% CI = 19.9-22.9) to 11.2% (95% CI = 10.0-12.4) in the 1971-1980 birth cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion who nominated meth/amphetamine as a 'drug problem' increased significantly in all three cohorts (all p < 0.001) and the degree of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was significantly associated with proportion of people who nominated meth/amphetamine as the 'drug problem' (b = 0.09, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001). Conclusion In Australia, the actual prevalence of lifetime meth/amphetamine use may be two- to fourfold higher than that estimated in the most recent national household surveys (2019). The level of under-reporting is strongly associated with increasing negative attitudes towards methylamphetamine and d-amphetamine use over the same period.

AB  - Despite the release of his birth certificate, some Americans express continued skepticism over whether Barack Obama was born in the United States. This study examined two possible causes of birther beliefs: that Republicans and conservatives, whose ideological beliefs and policy preferences led to disapproval of the president, might be particularly prone to accepting birther beliefs, and that negative attitudes toward Blacks led some Americans to disapprove of the President and accept foreign birthplace claims. A nationally representative survey of Americans showed that birther sentiments were predominant among conservatives/Republicans and individuals holding anti-Black attitudes. These relations were mediated by disapproval of the president. Hence, it appears that birther beliefs were motivated both by politically-grounded disapproval and racially-driven disapproval of the president. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Negative attitudes towards food are influenced by two factors, neophobia and often related disgust. Neophobia is the tendency to avoid new foods, while food disgust is the refusal of food that is considered potentially harmful to health. The study presented here aims to analyze the correlation between these two attitudes and the possible mediation operated by the perception of vulnerability to diseases, in order to understand if and how this contributes to the disgust towards certain unfamiliar foods. The study was developed through the administration of an anonymous questionnaire to a sample of 487 Italian citizens participating on a voluntary basis. Three tools were used: Food Neophobia Scale, Perceived Vulnerability to Disease, and Food Disgust Scale. The results showed a strong positive correlation between food disgust and food neophobia. Furthermore, through the application of structural mediation models, it has been shown that between food neophobia and food disgust, there is a mediation effect determined by perceived infectivity. The research aims to make a significant contribution to the understanding of the relationship between food disgust and some individual and psychological characteristics of people, demonstrating that the fear of disease transmission affects their food choices.

AB  - Background: The knowledge, risk perception and behavior of the general population is likely to have an important role in managing the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Awareness of a threat is an important condition for protective action and this needs to be evaluated for appropriate planning.
   Objective: To determine the knowledge, risk perception and behavioral response of COVID-19 among the general population attending Children's hospital, Lahore.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a structured questionnaire and participants were selected through non-probability convenience sampling technique
   Results: A total of 385 participants were interviewed from 24th April till 30th April 2020. The mean age was 38,0 15.43 years and male to female ratio was 1,9:1, Of this 302/385 (78.5%) considered it a real infection and those having higher education believed more as compared to illiterate (p=0.002). Almost one third (n=142, 37%) considered it as a biological weapon developed by some country or terrorist organization. Touching (81.8%) was perceived as a major mode of spread followed by hand shake (74.2%), close physical contact (63.8%) and sneezing (60.2%). The major source of information was television (52.9%) although 51% considered doctors as the most reliable source. Majority considered it to be a serious infection (67.5%) and the perception of acquiring infection and getting serious or dying was higher among old age people (p=0.019). Major reason of anxiety was financial concerns (33,8%) followed by fear of death of a family member (25.5%). The majority was engaged in preventive behaviors like washing hands (90.5%) and wearing face mask (86.2%). The perception of acquiring infection had strong positive correlation with social distancing and wearing mask. 67,8% participants considered lock down essential and 61.1% were satisfied with government's efforts.
   Conclusion: The general public attending Children's Hospital had fair knowledge of COVID-19 but there were certain myths, misconceptions and fears attached to the disease. Financial concerns and death of a family member were the major causes of anxiety, Based on this data, the government needs to intensify awareness campaigns to not only encourage preventive measure but to remove myths and alleviate fears related to COVID-19.

AB  - Assessing the risk for animal cruelty is imperative, yet understudied and problematic due to the sensitivity of the topic. Early prevention is critical, yet very little research examines cruelty when it first appears in childhood. The aim of this study was to explore children's attitudes towards types of animal cruelty, to investigate potential demographic differences, and to examine potential associations between acceptance of cruelty and cognitive and affective factors that place children 'at-risk' for cruelty perpetration. Questionnaire data was collected from 1127 children in schools. The results indicate that cruelty attitudes are predicted by some demographic variables such as urban living, being male, younger age and not having pets, but depend on the type of animal cruelty. Acceptance of cruelty predicted low compassion and low reported humane behaviour towards animals. Acceptance of cruelty was predicted by negative attitudes towards animals, lower beliefs in animal minds and low attachment to pets, signifying the importance of targeting such variables in future prevention programmes. This study is an original contribution to research into childhood animal cruelty in the general population, with implications for designing and implementing early prevention programmes that tackle problematic attitudes to cruelty.

AB  - Aim: To detect the psychological changes in doctors working in pediatrics, gynaecology, medicine and surgery during corona pandemic (COVID-19)
   Study design; cross sectional study.
   Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted from January 2020 to April 2020 in Gujrat.
   Methods: Total 240 doctors working in pediatrics, gynaecology, medicine or surgery were selected for study who had worked in the environment and area of the corona patients or area of suspected corona patients or in any outpatient area where an unknown but suspected corona patient can land. All doctors who left working during corona virus pandemic were excluded from the study. Doctors included in the study were asked specific questions to assess the changes in mental health and behavior due to corona virus infection (COVID-19) in the world. Later on accompanying individuals like family members or colleagues of that doctor were also inquired about the change in behavior of that doctor before and after the eruption of the corona virus infection.
   Results: Total 240 doctors working in pediatrics, gynaecology, medicine or surgery were included from January 2020 to April 2020. Out of 240 doctors, 98(40.8%) were female doctors whereas 142(59.2%) were male doctors (TABLE I). Many risk factors causing changes in mental health and behavior in doctors were detected including duty in hospital during corona crises, Social distance, Personnel protective equipment (PPE) use, fear of transmission of corona infection to their family members, both electronic & social media and discussion in community. One doctor might be affected by multiple risk factors as well. Many unwanted changes in mental health and behavior in doctors were observed including changes in sleep, changes in appetite, anger, difficulty in concentrating, fatigue and low energy, physical complaints like stomachaches etc not responding to normal treatment, feeling of hopelessness and increased sensitivity (TABLE III).
   Conclusions: Many unwanted changes were noted in the mental health and behavior of the doctors working on front line for corona pandemic (COVID-19). These unwanted changes can be prevented by controlling the avoidable risk factors. Self safety is necessary at each and every level especially in danger zones. After taking proper safety measures, doctors can perform all types of duties for our beloved country Pakistan and humanity. Timely intervention, provision of necessary equipment, counseling and motivation of the doctors can prevent the unwanted changes in the mental health and behavior of doctors.

AB  - Due to their racialized identity and immigrant status, African immigrants face increased risk for social exclusion and other negative outcomes. Research indicates that discrimination, social and economic disadvantage increase risk for substance use among Black populations in the United States. While emerging studies on African immigrants have explored consequences of social exclusion on psychological health, little is known about how these conditions impact substance use patterns. This study examined the effects of social exclusion on alcohol and/or other drug use, and non-medical use of prescription drugs among African immigrants, and explored whether perceived discrimination mediated this relationship. Data were collected between 2019 and 2020 from a cross-sectional survey examining experiences of first and second-generation African immigrants across the United States (N = 597). The majority of the sample identified as female (71%) and Black (82%). Structural equation modeling was conducted with probit regression paths to examine the direct and indirect effects of three dimensions of social exclusion (sociocultural, economic, and structural) on alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs, with perceived discrimination as the mediator. Increased sociocultural and structural exclusion significantly increased the likelihood of alcohol and/or other drug use and non-medical use of prescription drugs through the perceived discrimination pathway. Structural exclusion also had direct effects on substance use. Findings highlight the importance of examining social stressors when exploring risk for substance use, and point to the need for prevention efforts that reduce negative attitudes and promote inclusivity of this marginalized population.

AB  - Issue addressed News reports linking mental illness to violent crime are among the most stigmatising portrayals. These portrayals can perpetuate stereotypes of dangerousness, negatively influencing public attitudes and having a harmful impact on people with lived experience of mental illness. With the aim of improving the quality of news portrayals and mitigating harm, best-practice guidelines for media reporting on mental illness, violence and crime have been developed. To increase understanding of the guidelines' content, a 1-hour workshop based on the main principles was developed for journalism students. Methods In this study, the workshop was piloted with a pre and 3-week follow-up evaluation with a cohort of journalism students (n = 29). Results Three weeks after the workshop, there were significant improvements in attitudes towards severe mental illness, knowledge of best-practice reporting, intentions and confidence to report consistently with the best-practice guidelines and performance on an editing task designed to assess adherence to the guidelines. Belief in dangerousness/unpredictability reduced markedly, demonstrating that the workshop effectively addressed misinformation about people with severe mental illness being a risk to the public. Conclusions This pilot trial provides promising initial results and provides a basis for wider implementation and evaluation of media training on this topic. So what Improved understanding of best-practice media guidelines, as generated through this workshop, has potential to reduce stigmatising news reporting on people with mental illness, and consequently reduce public stigma.

KW  - PERCEPTION
KW  - COUNTRY
AB  - This study aimed to investigate through free word association the perception of Brazilian consumers regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. One thousand individuals answered the questionnaire via an online platform. Most cited terms (hygiene-8%, fear-8%, caution-5%) and categories (negative attitudes and feeling-72% and sanitization-60%) were related to overall COVID-19 infection rather than their specific infection through the food. The perception of the possibility of risk of this type of cross-contamination was greater for male participants, within the food field, with high income (>10 minimum wages), and from the midwest region. Nonetheless, there are still doubts regarding this possibility, especially for participants with low income (<= 10 minimum wages), females, higher education (>= secondary school), who exercise professional activity outside the food sector and from most regions of Brazil. Practical applications Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered 2 years ago, the emergence of new variants such as Omicron has increased infection and mortality rates worldwide. A possible way of COVID-19 infection is cross-contamination through food handling and contact surfaces if preventive measures are not applied. In this context, understanding the consumer perception from a continental-size country such as Brazil, with a wide variety of socioeconomic profiles, is crucial to minimize the severe impacts of the pandemic. Our study demonstrates the need to disseminate scientific information in different media to reduce misinformation, especially social media because most Brazilian consumers had doubts and uncertainties about the possibility of COVID-19 infection from cross-contamination through food.

AB  - There is little quantitative research regarding the causes and expression of prejudice and discrimination against Middle-Eastern Australians. We report two studies, one from the perspective of new settlers and a second from the perspective of host communities. The first found that Middle-Eastern Australians reported more discrimination compared with non-Middle-Eastern Australians. More discrimination was reported by Middle-Eastern males compared with females on dealings with the police, disrespect, name-calling, and distrust. The second study, focusing on attitudes of other Australians, found that they were more likely to perceive that Middle-Eastern Australians would be discriminated against compared with their own social group. When the non-Middle-Eastern Australians in the survey were asked for reasons why Australians from the Middle East were discriminated against, the most prevalent themes were (a) perceived conflict with 'Australian values', (b) fear of Muslims, (c) fear of terrorism, (d) negative media and (e) fear of difference. The overall finding that there are strong levels of public acknowledgment of the higher discriminatory burden endured by Middle-Eastern Australians is seen as a positive in terms of (1) community action to address that burden through (2) counteracting the socially negative attitudes that underpin discrimination in some Australian communities.

AB  - Background: The attitude towards vaccination is a major determinant of vaccination behavior; this also includes parents' attitudes towards the immunization of their child. Negative attitudes have been associated with vaccine hesitancy and outbreaks of infectious diseases throughout the globe. This study aimed to assess how and why attitudes become more pro-vaccine or vaccine-skeptical over time, and which sources are especially influential in this process.
   Methods: Prospective cohort study with measurements at time of recruitment during pregnancy and at +3, +6 and +14 months after childbirth with cross-sectional control groups. In total, 351 women entered the longitudinal analyses, while 204, 215 and 173 women were recruited in the cross-sectional control groups, respectively. Inclusion criteria were: (i) being at least 18 years of age, (ii) pregnant, (iii) primigravida, and (iv) living in Germany.
   Results: During pregnancy mothers reported rather positive prior experiences with vaccinations. However, their judgment turned significantly more negative after the first vaccination experience with their child. Mixed-effects models showed that these changes were significantly related to increased risk perceptions and concerns about vaccination, which then had a negative impact on the vaccination attitude. In contrast, gaining more vaccine-related knowledge over time positively influenced attitude formation.
   Conclusions: During the first year of their child's life maternal attitudes towards vaccination are formed and guide future decisions whether to vaccinate or not vaccinate a child. Strategies should be implemented that improve mothers' experiences when their newborn is vaccinated to prevent the development of vaccine hesitancy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Adolescent mothers are at increased risk of mistreating their children. Intervening before they become pregnant would be an ideal primary prevention strategy. Our goal was to determine whether psychopathology, exposure to maltreatment, preparedness for child-bearing, substance use disorders (SUDs), IQ, race, and socioeconomic status were associated with the potential for child abuse in nonpregnant adolescent girls.
   Method: The Child Abuse Potential Inventory (CAPI) was administered to 195 nonpregnant girls (aged 15 to 16 years; 54% African American) recruited from the community. Psychiatric diagnoses from a structured interview were used to form 4 groups: conduct disorder (CD), internalizing disorders (INTs; that is, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, or both), CD + INTs, or no disorder. Exposure to maltreatment was assessed with the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, and the Childbearing Attitudes Questionnaire measured maternal readiness.
   Results: CAPI scores were positively correlated with all types of psychopathology, previous exposure to maltreatment, and negative attitudes toward child-bearing. IQ, SUDs, and demographic factors were not associated. Factors associated with child abuse potential interacted in complex ways, but the abuse potential of CD girls was high, regardless of other potentially protective factors.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates that adolescent girls who have CD or INT are at higher risk of perpetrating physical child abuse when they have children. However, the core features of CD may put this group at a particularly high risk, even in the context of possible protective factors. Treatment providers should consider pre-pregnant counselling about healthy mothering behaviours to girls with CD.

AB  - Research has indicated that many video games and virtual worlds are populated by unrealistic, hypersexualized representations of women, but the effects of using these representations remain understudied. Objectification theory suggests that women's exposure to sexualized media representations leads to self-objectification. Further, we anticipated this process would lead to increases in rape myth acceptance (RMA). Two experiments (Study 1, N = 87; Study 2, N = 81) examined the effects of avatar features on women's experiences of self-objectification. In both studies, college women exposed to sexualized avatars experienced higher levels of self-objectification after the virtual experience than those exposed to nonsexualized avatars. Furthermore, in Study 2, self-objectification mediated the relationship between controlling a sexualized avatar and subsequent levels of RMA.

TI  - Gamers on Gaming: A Research Note Comparing Behaviors and Beliefs of Gamers, Video Game Players, and Non-Players

KW  - MEDIA
AB  - Research often conflates video game players and "gamers," defining gamers by time spent playing or by type of game played. Such operationalization may be a matter of convention or, more problematically, based on stereotypical beliefs about gamers. With a survey of nearly 900 young adults, this study compared self-identified gamers to other video game players and people who do not play video games. There were behavioral differences in terms of time played, but few attitudinal differences across the groups with regards perceptions of media violence. Non-players, compared to players and gamers, tended to hold more negative attitudes about video games and their effects. Non-players also tended to be more socially engaged and have more social support, but gamers were not socially isolated. Notably, hours played did not consistently correlate with beliefs and behaviors. Results demonstrate the importance of recognizing the theoretical, empirical, and practical distinctions among hours played, gamer stereotypes, and gamer identity.

AB  - Cancer is the second leading cause of death in Serbia, and at least 14,000-16,000 patients experience moderate-to-severe cancer pain every year. Cancer pain relief has been impeded by inadequate availability of opioid analgesics and barriers to their accessibility. In 2006, a Serbian oncologist was selected as an International Pain Policy Fellow. The fellow identified barriers to opioid availability in Serbia and implemented an action plan to address the unavailability of oral morphine, attitudinal and knowledge barriers about opioids, and barriers in the national opioid control policy, in collaboration with the government, local partners, and international experts, including those from the World Health Organization. Collaborative efforts resulted in availability of immediate-release oral morphine, registration of controlled-release hydromorphone, and reimbursement of oral methadone for cancer pain; numerous educational activities aimed at changing inadequate knowledge and negative attitudes toward opioids; recognition of opioids as essential medicines for palliative care in a new National Palliative Care Strategy; and recognition of the medical use of opioids as psychoactive-controlled substances for the relief of pain included in a new national law on psychoactive-controlled substances, and the development of recommendations for updating regulations on prescribing and dispensing opioids. An increase in opioid consumption at the institutional and national levels also was observed. This article outlines a multifaceted approach to improving access to strong opioids for cancer pain management and palliative care in a middle-income country and offers a potential road map to success.

AB  - The objective of the study was to demonstrate attitudes towards wind energy facilities in the area of the Korsze Commune. The results of the study were processed using structure indices calculated from the respondents' answers, which were analyzed in terms of social and economic factors. The study revealed that both the NIMBY syndrome and the lack of civic engagement influence attitudes towards renewable energy technologies in rural areas. The NIMBY ("not in my backyard") term describes negative public attitudes towards proposed development projects. However, some trends towards more pronounced attitudes can be observed, depending on socioeconomic conditions. The research results imply that the measures taken to promote renewable energy technologies should be designed differently depending on the socioeconomic situation of the targeted audience. Young people might be reached via social media appropriate to their age, and through campaigns promoting local investments. For older people, traditional ways of communication can be used, but the information transmitted should include specific benefits for the whole society as well as for individual households. The conducted research revealed that, despite the fact that many authors deny the occurrence of NIMBY syndrome in relation to the wind energy, the NIMBY problem has occurred in the Korsze Commune. The biggest challenge in the survey was the unwillingness of the residents to participate in it, which only confirms the lack of social involvement.

AB  - Background and Aim: The COVID pandemic and countrywide lockdown has had significant impact on patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with delay in diagnosis, difficulty in access to healthcare and unavailability of drugs. We conducted a telephonic survey to assess this impact.
   Methods: Out of 350, 302 participated in the survey. Demographic data, disease severity at the time of survey, extent of disease, details of therapy, and adherence were noted. A validated questionnaire addressing information source, perception of COVID-19 situation, contact with healthcare, adherence to standard precautions was administered telephonically.
   Results: Out of 350 contacted patients, 302 (86.28%) patients participated in the survey. Median age of cohort was 39 years. Ulcerative colitis (UC) constituted 79%, 16% Crohn's disease (CD), and 5% IBD-unclassified. At the time of survey, 86.98% patients with UC were in clinical remission and 75.75% of CD patients were generally well. A total of 115 (38%) cases were nonadherent to therapy due to unavailability of medicines (66.38%), financial constraints (25.21%) inability to reach healthcare facility (3.6%). Disease flare was seen in 14.2% correlated well with nonadherence. Existing drug therapy was switched to alternative drug in 70 (23.17%) cases due to unavailability (74%). Social media (52.3%) and television (40.4%) were the common sources of information about the pandemic. Telemedicine platforms (WhatsApp and telephone) were used by 180 (59.6%) patients for consultation with good acceptance (81.6%). 87 (28.8%) patients failed to contact healthcare. Apprehension regarding severe COVID infection was noted in 80% while 29% thought that IBD therapy could increase infection risk. Adherence to wearing mask, hand washing, and social distancing was 100%.
   Conclusion: Pandemic resulted in disruption of healthcare visits and medication supply. Majority were concerned about increased risk of COVID-19 infection and adhered to standard precautions. Mobile phone-based formats for patient care may be an alternative due to patient acceptance and convenience.

AB  - Introduction. The information provided about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) affects whether it is viewed favorably or unfavorably.
   Objectives. The objective of this study was to determine the means by which each source of information about ODT influenced attitudes of children.
   Material and Methods. Ten secondary schools from the south-east of Spain were stratified geographically. We performed a random selection of pupils from the first 4 years of compulsory secondary range, education (age 11-15 years). A validated self-administered questionnaire about attitudes toward ODT was completed anonymously.
   Results. The adolescents had received information about ODT through several sources. The most frequent sources were television (86%), films (59%), and magazines (56%). Positive information from information sources was associated with more favorable attitudes toward ODT (P < .05); those who received negative information had more unfavorable attitudes (P < .05).
   Conclusions. Most information about ODT that reaches our children is through audiovisual means. Attitudes were more favorable among adolescents who have received positive information through the mass media, with more negative attitudes among those who received negative information.

AB  - A case is made for a political economy of moral panics and moral regulation. After a brief discussion of the political economy of alcohol regulation, the focus shifts to the culture-of-fear thesis. Four writers (Glassner, Altheide, Furedi and Bauman) are interrogated for what they have to say about the culture of fear. Examined are its definition and manifestations; its historical genesis; its key agents and their motivations; how the culture of fear is constructed and disseminated; and its implications for governmental action and public attitudes. Six propositions are identified as constituting a consensus about the political economy of the culture of fear: (1) a safer society produces paradoxically more fear; (2) this fear is different from previous types of fear; (3) fear is symbolically constructed; (4) the media and popular culture are vital to sustaining fear; (5) fear distorts and misrecognizes social realities; (6) fear generates hostility to outsiders. Such a perspective revisits the original project of radical criminology. It is argued that moral panics and moral regulation analysis should be informed by the adherence of political economy to the importance of historical change, seeing society as a totality, insisting on morality as a focus and position, and through a sustained commitment to praxis.

   The present study aimed to understand how key risk factors of older adult suicide interact to ultimately lead to death by suicide using data collected post-mortem.
   Method
   A psychological autopsy was used to gather detailed information about psychiatric diagnosis, medical problems, social isolation, and negative attitudes expressed by the individual during the six months prior to their death. Interviews with next-of-kin, medical and psychiatric records, and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale for Geriatrics were used. Subjects included 32 older adults who died by suicide and 45 older adults who died by natural causes.
   Results
   Hopelessness, depression, and negative health attitudes were strongly correlated with suicide. Older age was associated with social isolation, suggesting an indirect relationship with suicide via hopelessness, depression, and negative health attitudes. Physical illness did not increase risk. Multivariate analyses suggested that hopelessness fully mediated the effects of social isolation, negative health attitudes, and depression on suicide.
   Conclusions
   Psychological factors played the largest role in suicide deaths compared to social isolation and physical illness. Suicide interventions aimed at older adults should ensure hopelessness, depression, and negative health attitudes are primary targets.

AB  - Implicit negative attitudes towards other races are important in certain kinds of prejudicial social behaviour. Emotional mechanisms are thought to be involved in mediating implicit "outgroup" bias but there is little evidence concerning the underlying neurobiology. The aim of the present study was to examine the role of noradrenergic mechanisms in the generation of implicit racial attitudes.
   Healthy volunteers (n = 36) of white ethnic origin, received a single oral dose of the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist, propranolol (40 mg), in a randomised, double-blind, parallel group, placebo-controlled, design. Participants completed an explicit measure of prejudice and the racial implicit association test (IAT), 1-2 h after propranolol administration.
   Relative to placebo, propranolol significantly lowered heart rate and abolished implicit racial bias, without affecting the measure of explicit racial prejudice. Propranolol did not affect subjective mood.
   Our results indicate that beta-adrenoceptors play a role in the expression of implicit racial attitudes suggesting that noradrenaline-related emotional mechanisms may mediate negative racial bias. Our findings may also have practical importance given that propranolol is a widely used drug. However, further studies will be needed to examine whether a similar effect can be demonstrated in the course of clinical treatment.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to unprecedented mitigation efforts that disrupted the daily lives of millions. Beyond the general health repercussions of the pandemic itself, these measures also present a challenge to the world's mental health and health care systems. Considering that traditional survey methods are time-consuming and expensive, we need timely and proactive data sources to respond to the rapidly evolving effects of health policy on our population's mental health. Many people in the United States now use social media platforms such as Twitter to express the most minute details of their daily lives and social relations. This behavior is expected to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic, rendering social media data a rich field to understand personal well-being.
   Objective: This study aims to answer three research questions: (1) What themes emerge from a corpus of US tweets about COVID-19? (2) To what extent did social media use increase during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic? and (3) Does sentiment change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic?
   Methods: We analyzed 86,581,237 public domain English language US tweets collected from an open-access public repository in three steps. First, we characterized the evolution of hashtags over time using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modeling. Second, we increased the granularity of this analysis by downloading Twitter timelines of a large cohort of individuals (n=354,738) in 20 major US cities to assess changes in social media use. Finally, using this timeline data, we examined collective shifts in public mood in relation to evolving pandemic news cycles by analyzing the average daily sentiment of all timeline tweets with the Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner (VADER) tool.
   Results: LDA topics generated in the early months of the data set corresponded to major COVID-19-specific events. However, as state and municipal governments began issuing stay-at-home orders, latent themes shifted toward US-related lifestyle changes rather than global pandemic-related events. Social media volume also increased significantly, peaking during stay-at-home mandates. Finally, VADER sentiment analysis scores of user timelines were initially high and stable but decreased significantly, and continuously, by late March.
   Conclusions: Our findings underscore the negative effects of the pandemic on overall population sentiment. Increased use rates suggest that, for some, social media may be a coping mechanism to combat feelings of isolation related to long-term social distancing. However, in light of the documented negative effect of heavy social media use on mental health, social media may further exacerbate negative feelings in the long-term for many individuals. Thus, considering the overburdened US mental health care structure, these findings have important implications for ongoing mitigation efforts.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic imposed extreme living conditions of social distancing, which triggered negative mental health problems and created challenges in seeking mental health support. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) have been found to enhance wellbeing and mental health by reducing stress and anxiety and improving emotion regulation. Preliminary evidence suggests that online, synchronous MBIs may produce beneficial effects similar to face-to-face programs. However, the effectiveness of such online-MBIs to support mental health in highly stressful times, such as a global pandemic, requires further study. To this end, we investigated the effect of an online 8-week Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) program on aspects of mental health during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants (N=92) who expressed interest in discounted online-MBSR programs were recruited for the study. The division into experimental and control groups was based on actual enrollment to the courses. Those who enrolled in a program were assigned to the experimental condition and those who decided not to enroll served as controls. Participants were assessed pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1-month post-intervention for levels of mindfulness, perceived stress, anxiety, emotion regulation, and intolerance of uncertainty. Differences between the groups were tested using the general linear mixed effects model (GLMM) and Individual Growth Curve Models (IGCM) in intent to treat analysis. The findings indicated that, relative to the control group, MBSR improved mindfulness abilities (p <0.001), decreased anxiety (p <0.001), and stress (p <0.001) and increased emotion regulation (p <0.001). These effects were found to persist 1 month after the end of the program, despite the increased governmental public-health restrictions due to COVID-19 at that time. The ability to tolerate uncertainty, a central characteristic of the pandemic, was not found to be affected by the program. A mediation analysis revealed that the effect of the intervention on mental health improvement was partially mediated by the improvement in emotion regulation. Overall, the findings provide positive evidence for the feasibility of an online-MBSR program to support the mental health of individuals from the general population through the mediation of emotion regulation in challenging times, such as a global pandemic.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions of the Digital Twin (a three-dimensional digital representation of an anatomical body) on a mobile health application, and the potential mechanisms that are important for behaviour change, with a focus on health and weight management. An explorative and participant-led approach was taken using semi-structured online interviews to explore the experiences of people, in this case non-users and users wanting to independently manage their health. An opportunity sample of forty participants from the United Kingdom (20 who had not used digitally assistive technology and 20 who had) were recruited from social media platforms (22 females and 18 males; mean age was 30). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two main themes were elicited: Initiators of behaviour change (i.e., autonomous choices, social influences, and personalisation) and Barriers to behaviour change (i.e., adverse reactions, weight management norms and negative attitudes). Overall, it was suggested that the Digital Twin should be representative of a user's personalised health information and BMI. These results can inform an intervention designed to use the Digital Twin to initiate and maintain lifestyle behaviour change. It can also develop our understanding of how such technology can be applied as a tool for health management.

AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an 'everyday life' context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

AB  - In this study, we set out to explain anti-Muslim attitudes in the Netherlands. Although the presence and immigration of Muslims have become widely discussed, there is little systematic evidence about the determinants underlying anti-Muslim attitudes. Using data from the Social and Cultural Developments in the Netherlands (SOCON) survey (2005, 2006), containing a more detailed measurement of anti-Muslim attitudes, we tested two contradictory mechanisms, derived from ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory. Results from hierarchical structural equation modelling indicate that the relative outgroup size induces both intergroup friendship contact as well as perceptions of ethnic threat. However, only the latter turned out to affect anti-Muslim attitudes directly. Moreover, our findings revealed that contact with colleagues belonging to ethnic minority groups reduces negative attitudes towards Muslims and mediates the effect of individual-level determinants on anti-Muslim attitudes. The complementary nature of both ethnic competition theory and intergroup contact theory is illustrated by negative correlation between both mediating mechanisms, as well as the support for a curvilinear relationship between outgroup size and perceived ethnic threat.

AB  - The (purely) relative definition of poverty remains influential as an evaluative yardstick for various government policies. Left-wing social policy scholars and anti-poverty campaigners' strong commitment to it contrasts sharply with public attitudes. Regression models using British Social Attitudes data found that ideological orientation was the most consistently powerful predictor of how people define poverty. Evidence suggests anti-poverty organisations' campaign failures might be due to ideological opposition or to the conceptual weakness of purely relative poverty rather than (as campaigners have claimed) ineffective campaign tactics or the influence of the mass media. Conservative politicians have little to fear in opposing the Marxist concept.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Conservation decisions should be evaluated for how they meet conservation goals at multiple spatial extents. Conservation easements are land use decisions resulting from a combination of social and environmental conditions. An emerging area of research is the evaluation of spatial distribution of easements and their spatial correlates. We tested the relative influence of interacting social and environmental variables on the spatial distribution of conservation easements by ownership category and conservation status. For the Appalachian region of the United States, an area with a long history of human occupation and complex land uses including public-private conservation, we found that settlement, economic, topographic, and environmental data associated with spatial distribution of easements (N = 4813). Compared to random locations, easements were more likely to be found in lower elevations, in areas of greater agricultural productivity, farther from public protected areas, and nearer other human features. Analysis of ownership and conservation status revealed sources of variation, with important differences between local and state government ownerships relative to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and among U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) GAP program status levels. NGOs were more likely to have easements nearer protected areas, and higher conservation status, while local governments held easements closer to settlement, and on lands of greater agricultural potential. Logistic interactions revealed environmental variables having effects modified by social correlates, and the strongest predictors overall were social (distance to urban area, median household income, housing density, distance to land trust office). Spatial distribution of conservation lands may be affected by geographic area of influence of conservation groups, suggesting that multi-scale conservation planning strategies may be necessary to satisfy local and regional needs for reserve networks. Our results support previous findings and provide an ecoregion-scale view that conservation easements may provide, at local scales, conservation functions on productive, more developable lands. Conservation easements may complement functions of public protected areas but more research should examine relative landscape-level ecological functions of both forms of protection.

AB  - Background Recommendations for promoting mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic include maintaining social contact, through virtual rather than physical contact, moderating substance/alcohol use, and limiting news and media exposure. We seek to understand if these pandemic-related behaviors impact subsequent mental health. Methods Daily online survey data were collected on adults during May/June 2020. Measures were of daily physical and virtual (online) contact with others; substance and media use; and indices of psychological striving, struggling and COVID-related worry. Using random-intercept cross-lagged panel analysis, dynamic within-person cross-lagged effects were separated from more static individual differences. Results In total, 1148 participants completed daily surveys [657 (57.2%) females, 484 (42.1%) males; mean age 40.6 (s.d. 12.4) years]. Daily increases in news consumed increased COVID-related worrying the next day [cross-lagged estimate = 0.034 (95% CI 0.018-0.049), FDR-adjusted p = 0.00005] and vice versa [0.03 (0.012-0.048), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0017]. Increased media consumption also exacerbated subsequent psychological struggling [0.064 (0.03-0.098), FDR-adjusted p = 0.0005]. There were no significant cross-lagged effects of daily changes in social distancing or virtual contact on later mental health. Conclusions We delineate a cycle wherein a daily increase in media consumption results in a subsequent increase in COVID-related worries, which in turn increases daily media consumption. Moreover, the adverse impact of news extended to broader measures of psychological struggling. A similar dynamic did not unfold between the daily amount of physical or virtual contact and subsequent mental health. Findings are consistent with current recommendations to moderate news and media consumption in order to promote mental health.

AB  - This 1-year follow-up study investigated the direct and indirect effects of past, anticipated, and actual experiences of inter-group interactions on the development of national identity and attitudes towards the national majority among ethnic re-migrants (N= 141) from Russia to Finland. According to the results, the quality of past inter-group contact in the pre-migration stage (T1) did not directly affect national identification and out-group attitudes in the post-migration stage (T2). Instead, the effect of contact quality at T1 on national identification and out-group attitudes at T2 was indirect via perceived discrimination and out-group rejection at T2. In addition, there were two indirect pathways from out-group attitudes at T1 to national identification and out-group attitudes at T2, via pleasant contact experiences (further associated with positive out-group attitudes) and via perceived discrimination (further associated with negative attitudes and lower national identification) in the post-migration stage. Anticipated discrimination only had a direct effect on out-group attitudes in the post-migration stage. The results highlight the role of past and anticipated inter-group relations in the formation of post-migration inter-group interactions, which, in turn, are decisive for the formation of national identification and out-group attitudes of re-migrants.

AB  - Background: Dually diagnosed clients are described as one of the most challenging treatment populations, often leading to staff frustration, helplessness and negative attitudes. As yet it is unclear whether dual diagnosis (DD)-specific competency and therapeutic optimism among staff are related to client outcomes. Methods: The study used a 3-month follow-up design involving 124 DD clients starting treatment at 6 UK addiction services. Practitioners (n = 46) treating these clients were assessed regarding their DD specialisation levels. Cox regression analyses were performed to examine predictors of clients' 3-month retention rates. Results: Staff reported a median of 7 years work experience with DD clients, and 80% had received co-morbidity-specific training. Practitioners provided high average ratings on both the DD competency and the therapeutic optimism scale. Nevertheless, 78% of the sample indicated additional support needs in dealing with this client group. Higher levels of DD competencies among staff predicted better client retention. Conclusion: The increased provision of support packages for practitioners is vital for improving competency levels in dealing with DD clients, which in turn may lead to improved client outcomes.

AB  - High-choice media environments allow people to cocoon themselves with like-minded messages (confirmation bias), which could shape both individual attitudes and perceived prevalence of opinions. This study builds on motivated cognition and spiral of silence theory to disentangle how browsing political messages (both selective exposure as viewing full articles and incidental exposure as encountering leads only) shapes perceived public opinion and subsequently attitudes. Participants (N?=?115) browsed online articles on controversial topics; related attitudes and public opinion perceptions were captured before and after. Multi-level modeling demonstrated a confirmation bias. Both selective and incidental exposure affected attitudes per message stance, with stronger impacts for selective exposure. Opinion climate perceptions mediated selective exposure impacts on attitudes.

This paper examines how individual-level climate perceptions correspond to a country's contribution to climate change and its ability to develop climate policies. Data from the European Social Survey Round 8 (23 European countries, n = 44,387) was used to explore how national-level factors (affluence as per capita GDP, carbon emissions as per capita CO2 emissions, and democracy as electoral democracy index) are related to individual-level climate perceptions (climate concern, perceived climate responsibility, climate policy support, and personal climate action). The analysis shows that the studied individual-level perceptions are all linked, and that perceived climate responsibility is a factor that helps in understanding how individual-level climate views are connected. Further, national-level affluence and democracy are connected to stronger individual-level perceptions both directly and through mediating their connections. Our results suggest that achieving ambitious climate policy targets in Europe could benefit from focusing on the role of perceived climate responsibility in boosting policy support and action. Moreover, the connection between national-level (democratic and economic) factors and public climate perceptions emphasises the need to place climate policies in a wider context.

AB  - Over half of refugees are school-aged children. In host communities, children's attitudes and behaviours are important for the integration of refugee children. This study examines the empathy-attitudes-action model in middle childhood (N = 94, 8 to 11 years old). In both the experimental and control conditions, children were introduced to a (fictional) refugee and told that he or she would be moving to their school. The experimental condition also listened to a storybook about the child's refugee experience. Empathy, outgroup attitudes, and prosocial behaviour toward the incoming child, and refugees as a group, were measured. Although mediation was not supported, the storybook condition reported more empathy and helping intentions, and attitudes predicted helping intentions but not giving to refugees. Results highlight how host-society children can welcome refugees.

AB  - Research on the effects of workplace bullying has concentrated on direct negative attitudinal employee responses, typically ignoring the cognitive mechanisms underlying this link. We integrate social exchange and attribution theories to propose and test a model wherein the link between workplace bullying and job and life satisfaction is explained by a breach of the psychological contract, i.e., employee beliefs that the organization failed to meet its commitments towards them. In two studies, we tested our hypotheses with experimental data from 69 business students and field data from 275 employees in France and Greece, respectively. Results from our experimental study revealed that bullying causes psychological contract breach. Study 2 replicated the findings in a field setting and found that psychological contract breach mediated the main effect of workplace bullying on job and life satisfaction. Interestingly, our results from moderated mediation analysis of Study 2 also showed that the effects of bullying are strongest for older women. We discuss theoretical and practical implications for literatures on workplace bullying and the psychological contract. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study is to assess the use of MinecraftEdu in classroom practice analyzing the outcomes and attitudes of all members of the educational community through a quasi-experimental approach. The research presents three dimensions oriented to assessing the use of this application in a didactic unit "History and Architecture" compared through statistical inference (t-student) to a control group that develops the same unit with slides and traditional expositional methods. The second dimension values the attitudes of teachers, students and parents regarding the implementation of video games in formal education using descriptive analysis and nonparametric statistical inference through the Jonckheere-Terpstra test and the Kruskal-Wallis test, which allows each group ranks to be compared. The third dimension analyzes interactions in a virtual learning environment related to the implementation of MinecraftEdu. Although there are no significant improvements regarding academic outcomes and some parents hold negative attitudes, it is noteworthy that the majority of the sample considered that MinecraftEdu is fun, enhances creativity, develops discovery and is a good application for creating and exploring immersive historical environments.

AB  - AIM
   To evaluate the effect of educational intervention on individuals' knowledge of and attitudes toward forensic mental health.
   METHODS
   We conducted a questionnaire regarding attitudes toward various ideas about forensic mental health. The respondents attended a 1-h seminar regarding forensic mental health after answering the questionnaire. On completion of the seminar, the respondents answered another questionnaire containing many of the same questions as contained in the pre-seminar questionnaire.
   RESULTS
   A total of 86 individuals attended the seminar, and 78 responded to the questionnaire. Only 13 (18.8%) participants were supportive of the concept of criminal responsibility initially, and there was a statistically significant increase in those who became more supportive after the seminar, with 22 (33%) being supportive after the seminar (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that participants who were skeptical about forensic mental systems and those with fewer opportunities to see media reports regarding psychiatry were likely to become supportive of criminal responsibility after the intervention.
   CONCLUSION
   These results suggest that public attitudes toward criminal responsibility and mental health can be influenced via educational interventions.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread worldwide and become an emerging life-threatening pandemic disease since 2019. This study aimed to evaluate the basic knowledge, awareness, personal hygiene and healthy practices regarding COVID-19 during its outbreak among the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip. It is a cross-sectional survey carried out between July and August 2020 and included 458 participants, aged 18 years or older, belonging to the five Gaza Strip governorates, Palestine, with a variety of socio-economic status. Sociodemographic data and data on COVID-19 knowledge, awareness, personal hygiene and healthy practices were collected via email and social media applications (WhatsApp and Facebook) from the study participants. Statistical analyses were performed using Vr 22 of the SPSS software. Overall, the mean +/- SD age of the participants was 26.5 +/- 4.2 years. Our findings showed that most of the Gazan adults had very good knowledge regarding COVID-19 in terms of host sources, causative agents, incubation period, symptoms, transmission, treatment and prevention. Additionally, most of the participants had a high level of personal hygiene and healthy practices during the COVID-19 outbreak, where personal hygiene and healthy practices against COVID-19 was 77.4%. Furthermore, a higher educational level did not affect the quality of personal hygiene and healthy practice behaviours during the COVID-19 outbreak. Although most of the Gazans had good knowledge regarding the healthy practices, a significant percentage of the population did not practice the hygiene protocol. Despite the majority of the Gazan population having very good knowledge regarding COVID-19 and a high level of personal hygiene and healthy practices during the COVID-19 outbreak, a small proportion require education about avoiding physical contact and maintaining social distancing with others during the pandemic.

AB  - Research has frequently found that students use their information and communication technologies-such as smartphones and laptops-for non-academic uses in the classroom. These uses include sending messages as well as checking email and social media accounts. This study aimed to examine students' in-class information and communication technology use, their motivations for it, and perceptions of it, as well as their attitudes toward restriction and integration of information and communication technologies in the classroom. It was found that students most frequently engage in non-academic information and communication technology use when they feel that they would not miss any new class content, or when they feel disengaged. Students perceived that their non-academic information and communication technology use had costs, especially distraction. However, students also reported negative attitudes toward policies that would restrict their information and communication technology use in the classroom but had positive perceptions of attempts to integrate information and communication technology use. We propose that information and communication technology integration can be an effective method of increasing student engagement-and therefore decreasing non-academic information and communication technology use.

AB  - The purpose of this qualitative study is to provide an in-depth understanding and description of the disease experiences of COVID-19 patients. The participants were 16 patients discharged from hospitals after receiving treatment for COVID-19 in isolation. Data collection was conducted through individual in-depth interviews until data saturation, and the interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data were analyzed using Colaizzi's phenomenological method. The participants were quarantined after their COVID-19 diagnosis was confirmed, and they experienced desperate and uncertain times during treatment. The participants expressed shock and dissatisfaction due to an excessive invasion of privacy during the quarantine process and in the quarantine system. As confirmed COVID-19 cases, the participants experienced social stigma and feelings of guilt, negative attitudes from others and society, and negative influences from social networking services and the media. The participants also experienced mental and physical difficulties due to COVID-19 symptoms. However, they rediscovered meaningful relationships through the support of their family and friends in the midst of adversity. It is necessary to provide an integrated psychosocial rehabilitation program to reduce social stigma and improve the resilience of COVID-19 patients.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the association between psychosocial determinants of unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) and unprotected insertive anal intercourse (UIAI). Data from 417 HIV positive men who have sex with men (MSM) in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study from April 1999 to March 2012 were analyzed and adjusted odds were calculated. It was found that 66% (n = 277) and 72% (n = 299) reported any UIAI or URAI over follow-up, respectively. Cumulative cART-years (median = 5.30 years) was associated with 33 and 47% increases in UIAI and URAI, respectively. Not having reduced concern about HIV transmission (UIAI: OR 0.37, p-value = 0.0004; URAI: OR 0.57, p-value = 0.04), increased safe sex fatigue (UIAI: OR 2.32, 95% p-value = 0.0002; URAI: OR 1.94, p-value = 0.003), and sexual sensation seeking (UIAI: OR 1.76, p-value = 0.002; URAI: OR 1.56, p-value = 0.02) were associated with UIAI and URAI. Serosorting was associated with UIAI (OR 6.11, p-value < 0.0001) and URAI (OR 6.80, p-value < 0.0001). Findings suggest that negative attitudes about HIV transmission are sustained among older men who have sex with men.

AB  - Cross-national studies examining human rights outcomes have seldom considered the role of the news media. This is unfortunate, as a large body of work in media studies suggests that the news industry effectively educates citizens, shapes public attitudes, and stimulates political action. I juxtapose these two literatures in a cross-national context to examine the print medias impact on a states human rights performance. First, examining micro-level evidence from the World Values Survey, I show that an individuals level of media consumption, including newspaper readership, is positively associated with participation in human rights organizations. Next, I present macro-level evidence regarding the aggregate effect of a societys newspaper readership on its human rights record. Analyzing an unbalanced dataset with a maximum of 459 observations across 138 countries covering four waves during the 19802000 period, I use ordered probit regression to examine the relationship between a states newspaper readership and its Amnesty International rating. I find that newspaper readership exerts strong, positive effects on a states human rights practices net of other standard predictors and temporal/regional controls. Moreover, the effect of readership is robust to a number of alternative specifications that address concerns with ceiling effects, measurement bias, influential observations, sample composition, mediation, endogeneity, and the impact of alternative forms of media consumption (i.e., the Internet and television).

AB  - One of the major achievements of Braj Kachru's (1991) liberation linguistics' is that it has squarely placed Outer Circle varieties such as Indian English, Nigerian English and Singaporean English on a par with Inner Circle varieties such as American English and British English - in the face of negative attitudes, ranging from amused condescension to racist stereotyping' (Bruthiaux, 2003: 160). Following in Kachru's footsteps, many scholars have demonstrated that these Outer Circle Englishes are legitimate varieties of English, with distinct characteristics and with growing numbers of native speakers (e.g. Deterding, 2007; Jowitt, 1991; Sailaja, 2009). Indeed these Outer Circle English varieties are increasingly used, in respective countries, not only as the major or default medium of communication but also in the context of important domains such as education, media, government, literature and popular culture. The Kachruvian perspective has also given rise to the egalitarian' view that Inner Circle English speakers are no longer the only ones who can lay claim to the ownership of English. Outer Circle English speakers are now thought to be as much custodians of English as Inner Circle English speakers are.

AB  - In recent years, there has been remarkable change in societal acceptance of lesbians and gay men. This meta-analysis explored whether this positive shift has reduced the gender difference in these attitudes. We tested Kite and Whitley's (1996) gender belief system model and replicated their finding that heterosexual men held more negative attitudes toward gay people (g. = 0.37, k= 245, N=98,295), gay behavior (g. =0.22, k= 68, N=98,734), and gay civil rights (g. =0.16, k= 80, N=89,187). We also found that heterosexual men were more likely to report engaging in anti-gay behavior (g. = 0.53, k=7, N= 2,509), endorsing gay stereotypes (g. = 0.17, k=17,N= 6,936), and wanting to avoid contact with gay men (g. = 0.49, k=7, N= 2,178). However, heterosexual women reported a stronger desire to avoid contact with lesbians than did heterosexual men (g. = -0.36, k= 5, N=1,339). For the most part, gender differences remained stable over time; the exceptions were attitudes toward same-gender sexual behavior and attitudes toward lesbian and gay civil rights, which showed small increases. Gender differences in anti-gay prejudice were mediated by gender differences in traditional gender-role beliefs. Moderator variables included participant group, type of measure, and target group.

AB  - This study compared the newsgathering goals of gatekeepers with public attitudes regarding the coverage of Africa by CNN International (CNNI). A critical discourse analysis was based on interviews with CNNI news producers and executives, and 6 focus groups of Ugandan viewers that were conducted in 2004 and 2008. Results show not only dissonance, but also a disconnection between CNNI news producers and Ugandan viewers' perceptions of the network and of their 2 major local stations. The network was the main source of international news in 2004 in Uganda but its appeal diminished by 2008. Viewers considered its coverage largely biased and ill-motivated towards Africa. CNNI was regarded more favorably than local television (UBC and WBS) news in quality and depth of news content in 2004 than in 2008. This love-hate relationship for CNNI and the other local television networks is discussed in detail.

AB  - Volunteers are extensively involved in monitoring and controlling invasive species. Most research has examined volunteer activity in groups organized "top-down", but we examined a local community-based group removing lionfish in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) with a specific focus on the use of social media by the group. Indo-Pacific lionfish (Pterois miles, P. lunulate and P. russelii) are invasive in the Western Atlantic Ocean and can impact the composition and function of coral reef communities. In response, resource managers and scientists have organized programs using divers and snorkelers to remove lionfish. In the volunteer-led BVI program, participants searched for and culled lionfish in their spare time and used a public Facebook group to record their activity. We compiled all lionfish-related posts from 2012 to 2014 (n = 654). Lionfish were reported at 147 sites, and 1451 lionfish were culled from 117 sites, but activity was concentrated at 35 established dive/snorkeling sites. We also performed SCUBA surveys (n = 27 sites). Survey results were consistent with Facebook reports in suggesting that culling made lionfish wary but did not consistently reduce lionfish abundance or size-distributions. Most removals were conducted by a core group of locals whereas a much larger group of locals and visitors, some of whom apparently participated after seeing the Facebook page, contributed mainly by reporting the location of sightings. Those removing lionfish frequently followed-up on posted sightings, suggesting that social networking facilitated information sharing by guiding the selection of hunting sites. Posts were also used by participants to encourage one another and share negative attitudes about lionfish. Community-based groups are challenged by limited resources, however social-media networks may facilitate communication among participants in ways that help motivate, coordinate and direct group activity.

AB  - Background
   Patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) are disproportionately vulnerable to COVID-19 and its complications due to the older age and significant burden of comorbid conditions. Data about the impact of COVID-19 on the ESKD population in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is scarce, and this study aims to bridge this gap.
   Method
   This is a retrospective cohort study that included ESKD patients who were receiving either in-center hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for at least three months and were hospitalized due to COVID-19 at King Abdulaziz Medical City in Riyadh (KAMC) between March 2020 and March 2021. Of note, the in-center hemodialysis means that the patients come to the dialysis center three times per week to receive their dialysis sessions, as home hemodialysis is not available at our center. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to explore the association of clinical characteristics and laboratory parameters with ICU admission and mortality.
   Results
   A total of 104 patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was 62.6 (SD=17.4) years, 101 (97%) were on HD, predominantly through a central venous catheter (72%), and 53 patients (51%) were male. Patients with COVID-19 were either asymptomatic (42%) or had mild symptoms (37%), mainly cough and fever. At the time of admission, 37 patients (36%) had extrapulmonary symptoms, and 13 patients (12%) had altered mental status. Normal chest X-ray (48%), followed by bilateral lung infiltrates (24%), and unilateral lung infiltrate (11%) were the most common radiological findings. We did not observe any thromboembolic events. Twenty patients (19%) required ICU admission and 19 patients (18%) died during hospitalization. Predictors for in-hospital mortality were: 1) the need for inotropes (adjusted OR: 53.01, p=0.006), 2) age (adjusted OR: 1.07, p=0.019), and 3) C-reactive protein (CRP) level on admission (adjusted OR: 1.02, p=0.04). We did not find any strong predictor for ICU admission.
   Conclusion
   Our study demonstrated that COVID-19 carries significant mortality and morbidity in the ESKD population. Age, inotropic support requirement and elevated CRP on admission predicted mortality in our population. The high rate of adverse outcomes of COVID-19 among ESRD patients calls for strict implementation of preventive measures, including vaccination, social distancing, and universal masking at the level of both the healthcare providers and patients. Further studies are needed to assess the association of COVID-19 and hypercoagulability ESKD population.

AB  - Background. The COVID-19 pandemic has imposed radical behavioral and social changes in the general population, significantly impacting the lives of individuals affected by disabilities. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of COVID-19 on non-institutionalized subjects with sensorineural disabilities during the first COVID-19 wave in Italy. Methods. A 39-item online national survey was disseminated from 1 April 2020 to 31 June 2020 via social media throughout Italy to communities of individuals with proven severe sensorineural disabilities, affiliated to five national patient associations. The survey collected extensive information on the socio-demographic profile, health, everyday activities, and lifestyle of individuals with hearing and visual disabilities. Results. One hundred and sixty-three respondents with hearing (66.9%) and visual (33.1%) disabilities returned a usable questionnaire. The mean age of interviewees was 38.4 +/- 20.2 years and 56.3% of them were females. Despite the vast majority of respondents (77.9%) perceiving their health status as unchanged (68.8% of interviewees with hearing deficits vs. 96.3% of those with visual impairments), about half the interviewees reported sleep disorders during lock-down, more likely those with visual deficits. Remote services were seemingly more effective for business than school activities. Furthermore, although just 18.8% of respondents rated remote rehabilitation care unsatisfactory, only 12.8% of interviewees felt supported by health and social services during the COVID-19 emergency. The vast majority of respondents were concerned about the future and the risk of SARS-CoV-2 contagion, particularly individuals with hearing impairments. Among the various risk mitigation measures, facemasks caused the greatest discomfort due to communication barriers, particularly among interviewees affected by hearing disabilities (92.2% vs. 45.7%). The most common request (46.5%) of respondents to reduce the inconveniences of the COVID-19 emergency country lock-down was improving the access to and delivery of health and social services for individuals with sensorineural disabilities (19.3%), followed by the use of transparent masks (17.5%). Conclusions. Although health protection measures such as face masks and social distancing play a key role in preventing and controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the unmet needs of disabled individuals should be carefully considered, especially those affected by sensory disabilities. Tailored access to health and social services for individuals affected by sensorineural disabilities should be implemented. Additional actions should include the use of to face masks to reduce communication barriers linked to hearing-impairment, as well as the improvement of remote services, especially distance learning at school.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Neurosurgical education in the US has changed significantly as a consequence of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Institutional social distancing requirements have resulted in many neurosurgical programs utilizing video conferencing for educational activities. However, it is unclear how or if these practices should continue after the pandemic. The objective of this study was to characterize virtual education in neurosurgery and understand how it should be utilized after COVID-19.
   METHODS A 24-question, 3-part online survey was administered anonymously to all 117 US neurosurgical residency programs from May 15, 2020, to June 15, 2020. Questions pertained to the current use of virtual conferencing, preferences over traditional conferences, and future inclinations. The Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree, 3 = neutral, 5 = strongly agree) was used. Comparisons were calculated using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Statistical significance was set at 0.05.
   RESULTS One-hundred eight responses were recorded. Overall, 38 respondents (35.2%) were attendings and 70 (64.8%) were trainees. Forty-one respondents (38.0%) indicated attending 5-6 conferences per week and 70 (64.8%) attend national virtual conferences. When considering different conference types, there was no overall preference (scores < 3) for virtual conferences over traditional conferences. In regard to future use, respondents strongly agreed that they would continue the practice at some capacity after the pandemic (median score 5). Overall, respondents agreed that virtual conferences would partially replace traditional conferences (median score 4), whereas they strongly disagreed with the complete replacement of traditional conferences (median score 1). The most common choices for the partial replacement of tradition conferences were case conferences (59/108, 55%) and board preparation (64/108, 59%). Lastly, there was a significant difference in scores for continued use of virtual conferencing in those who attend nationally sponsored conferences (median score 5, n = 70) and those who do not (median score 4, n = 38; U = 1762.50, z = 2.97, r = 0.29, p = 0.003).
   CONCLUSIONS Virtual conferences will likely remain an integral part of neurosurgical education after the COVID-19 pandemic has abated. Across the country, residents and faculty report a preference for continued use of virtual conferencing, especially virtual case conferences and board preparation. Some traditional conferences may even be replaced with virtual conferences, in particular those that are more didactic. Furthermore, nationally sponsored virtual conferences have a positive effect on the preferences for continued use of virtual conferences. https:// thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2020.9.FOCUS20672

AB  - European colonial powers invaded and then dominated a large part of the African continent from the sixteenth to the twentieth century. The influence of colonialism did not cease after independence as it still impregnates the cultures and identities of both formerly colonising and formerly colonised peoples. The question of how inhabitants of formerly colonised and formerly colonising countries represent the colonial past is a key issue in understanding this lasting influence. Social representations of European colonial action were investigated among young people (N = 1134) in three European countries and six African countries. Social representations of the colonial past were structured around two main dimensions across African and European samples: Exploitation and Development. Social representations of colonialism denoted by Exploitation were more strongly endorsed by the European compared to the African subsample, whereas those denoted by Development were more strongly endorsed by the African compared to the European subsample. However, while African participants considered colonialism less negatively than Europeans, they also had higher expectations concerning Europeans' collective guilt feeling and willingness to offer reparations. By contrast, European participants' social representations of colonialism were more negative but they were less likely to believe that present-day European peoples and governments are accountable for the misdeeds of colonialism in the past. Finally, national identification mediated the association between the Exploitation dimension of colonialism and both group-based emotions and support for reparation in the African, but not the European, subsample.

AB  - Objectives: Previous research supports that subjective views on aging (VoA), such as older subjective age (SA) and negative attitudes toward own aging (ATOA), go along with negative outcomes. A differentiated treatment of health and disease as antecedents of VoA is largely lacking. Therefore, our objective was to estimate the relationship between generally framed physical, affective, and cognitive health as well as specific diseases and VoA, operationalized both as SA and ATOA.
   Methods: Data were drawn from the ActiFE Ulm study for which a representative sample of community-dwelling older people (65-90 years) was recruited at baseline. Follow-ups were conducted 7.7 years (median) after recruitment (N = 526). Health- and disease-related data at baseline, based on established assessment procedures for epidemiological studies, were regressed on VoA (1-item SA indicator, 5-item ATOA scale) measures at follow-up.
   Results: Reported severity of affective health problems such as depression was the strongest general risk factor for both older SA and negative ATOA. Also, some but not all major diseases considered were associated with VoA. Notably, back pain predicted negative ATOA, while cancer was associated with older SA. Rheumatism was linked with more negative ATOA along with higher SA. Throughout analyses, explained variance in ATOA was considerably higher than in SA.
   Discussion: Affective health problems, such as depression, should be regarded as a major correlate of subjective aging views. Interestingly, diseases do not have to be life-threatening to be associated with older SA or negative ATOA.

AB  - Although licensed since 2006, US HPV vaccination rates remain suboptimal. Since mothers are decision-makers for young adults' vaccination, assessing ongoing knowledge deficits and misunderstanding among parents is important for determining the content and mode of interventions to reach parents. Guided by the social-ecological model and health belief model, 30 interviews with vaccine accepting mothers in the U.S. Midwest were conducted from January through June 2020. Researchers examined ecological determinants of acceptance, perceptions of vaccination barriers, and perceived cues to action for empowering other mothers to vaccinate their children. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Results found vaccine accepting mothers exhibited ongoing misconceptions and negative attitudes toward HPV vaccine. Physicians, peers and the media were identified as primary pro-HPV vaccine sources, yet hesitancy and misinformation occurred with each source. Trust in provider recommendation was the primary source for decision-making, yet trust was still lacking. While mothers looked to the media for HPV information, the media were identified as the main source of confusion and distrust. Results show that parents who accept the HPV vaccine can still be hesitant. Thus, mothers who have vaccinated their children for HPV may still need attitudinal and educational training prior to establishing them as role models in interventions for empowering other parents to vaccinate their children. Results showing that the media sow confusion and hesitancy also call for more attention to social media policies to guard against misinformation about the HPV vaccine.

AB  - How is it that the Swedish populist nationalist party the Sweden Democrats receives its strongest support from the established working class, in spite of the high degree of class voting and left-right mobilization which is known to characterize Swedish politics? Based on surveys from the SOM (Society, Opinion, Media) Institute as well as the Swedish National Elections Studies, this article shows that this is not a result of increasing anti-immigrant attitudes in the working class or of decreasing left-right polarization among voters. Rather, we present the argument that the weakening alignment between the working class and the Social Democratic Party and the weakened left-right polarization between the main parties have created a structure which has left room for a realignment between large parts of the working class and the Sweden Democrats along the alternative underlying ideological dimension of authoritarianism/libertarianism.

AB  - The success or failure of environmental management goals can be partially attributed to the support for such goals from the public. Despite this, environmental management is still dominated by a natural science approach with little input from disciplines that are concerned with the relationship between humans and the natural environment such as environmental psychology. Within the marine and freshwater environments, this is particularly concerning given the cultural and aesthetic significance of these environments to the public, coupled with the services delivered by freshwater and marine ecosystems, and the vulnerability of aquatic ecosystems to human-driven environmental perturbations. This paper documents nine case studies which use environmental psychology methods to support a range of aquatic management goals. Examples include understanding the drivers of public attitudes towards ecologically important but uncharismatic river species, impacts of marine litter on human well-being, efficacy of small-scale governance of tropical marine fisheries and the role of media in shaping attitudes towards. These case studies illustrate how environmental psychology and natural sciences can be used together to apply an interdisciplinary approach to the management of aquatic environments. Such an approach that actively takes into account the range of issues surrounding aquatic environment management is more likely to result in successful outcomes, from both human and environmental perspectives. Furthermore, the results illustrate that better understanding the societal importance of aquatic ecosystems can reduce conflict between social needs and ecological objectives, and help improve the governance of aquatic ecosystems. Thus, this paper concludes that an effective relationship between academics and practitioners requires fully utilising the skills, knowledge and experience from both sectors. (c) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Previous studies show that radical right parties in Europe receive relatively low levels of supports from Christian voters, despite that Christian value is highlighted in the European radical right agenda. However, the mechanism remains largely untested. The study investigates the factors underlying Christians voting or not voting for populist radical right parties across Europe, using Round 8 European Social Survey data. It is shown that there is no general relationship between Christian religiosity and radical right voting across European countries. In most countries, Christians are neither more nor less likely to vote for the radical right parties compared to the non-religious. When Christians are underrepresented in radical right supporters, it can hardly be explained by tolerance towards immigrants, pro-social values or social capital presumed to be fostered by Christian religion and church engagement. In some other cases, where Christians are more likely to vote for radical right parties, it is likely to be driven by anti-immigrant attitudes, authoritarian values and moral conservative values. In addition, Christians could have been more mobilizable for radical right parties due to their authoritarian and moral conservative values, which have not been fully capitalized. The study suggests that Christian religiosity does not serve as an "antidote" to the radical right. Tolerance towards immigrants, pro-social values or social capital are rarely the mechanisms driving European Christians away from supporting radical right parties.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has led to worldwide implementation of unprecedented restrictions to control its rapid spread and mitigate its impact. The Spanish government has enforced social distancing, quarantine, and home confinement measures. Such restrictions on activities of daily life and separation from loved ones may lead to social isolation and loneliness with health-related consequences among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and their caregivers. Additionally, inadequate access to health care and social support services may aggravate chronic conditions. Home-based technological interventions have emerged for combating social isolation and loneliness, while simultaneously preventing the risk of virus exposure.
   Objective: The aim of this cohort study is to explore, analyze, and determine the impact of social isolation on (1) cognition, quality of life, mood, technophilia, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and on the caregiver burden; (2) access to and utilization of health and social care services; and (3) cognitive, social, and entertainment-related uses of information and communication technologies.
   Methods: This study will be conducted in Malaga (Andalucia, Spain). In total 200 dyads, consisting of a person with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia and his/her informal caregiver, will be contacted by telephone. Potential respondents will be participants of the following clinical trials: support, monitoring, and reminder technology for mild dementia (n=100) and television-based assistive integrated service to support European adults living with mild dementia or mild cognitive impairment (n=100).
   Results: As of May 2021, a total of 153 participants have been enrolled and assessed during COVID-19 confinement, of whom 67 have been assessed at 6 months of enrollment. Changes in the mean values of the variables will be analyzed relative to baseline findings of previous studies with those during and after confinement, using repeated-measures analysis of variance or the nonparametric Friedman test, as appropriate. The performance of multivariate analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to introduce potential covariates will also be considered. Values of 95% CI will be used.
   Conclusions: If our hypothesis is accepted, these findings will demonstrate the negative impact of social isolation owing to COVID-19 confinement on cognition, quality of life, mood, and perceived stress among community-dwelling older adults with mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia, the impact on technophilia, caregiver burden, the access to and utilization of health and social care services, and the cognitive, social, and entertainment-related use of information and communication technologies during and after COVID-19 confinement.

TI  - Trends in US Pediatric Hospital Admissions in 2020 Compared With the Decade Before the COVID-19 Pandemic
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA  - English
AB  - IMPORTANCE In early 2020, the United States declared a public health emergency in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and implemented a variety of social distancing measures. The association between the COVID-19 pandemic and the number of pediatric admissions is unclear.
   OBJECTIVE To determine the changes in patterns of pediatric admissions in 2020 compared with the prior decade.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This cross-sectional study included 49 US hospitals contributing to the Pediatric Health Information Systems database. Inpatient admissions were transformed into time-series data, and ensemble forecasting models were generated to analyze admissions across a range of diagnoses in 2020 compared with previous years. The setting was inpatient admissions. All patients discharged between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2020, from an inpatient hospital encounter were included.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Number of hospital admissions by primary diagnosis for each encounter.
   RESULTS Of 5 424 688 inpatient encounters among 3 372 839 patients (median [interquartile range] age, 5.1 [0.7-13.3] years; 2 823 748 [52.1%] boys; 3 171 224 [58.5%] White individuals) at 49 hospitals, 213 571 (3.9%) were between January 1, 2020, and June 30, 2020. There was a decrease in the number of admissions beginning in March 2020 compared with the period from 2010 to 2019. At the nadir, admissions in April 2020 were reduced 45.4% compared with prior years (23 798 in April 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of 43 550 [42 110-43 946] in April 2010-2019). Inflation-adjusted hospital charges decreased 27.7% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with prior years ($4 327 580 511 in 2020 compared with a median [interquartile range] of $5 983 142 102 [$5 762 690 022-$6 324 978 456] in 2010-2019). Seasonal patterns were evident between 2010 and 2019 for a variety of common pediatric conditions, including asthma, atrial septal defects, bronchiolitis, diabetic ketoacidosis, Kawasaki syndrome, mental health admissions, and trauma. Ensemble models were able to discern seasonal patterns in admission diagnoses and accurately predicted admission rates from July 2019 until December 2019 but not from January 2020 to June 2020. All diagnoses except for birth decreased below the model 95% CIs between January 2020 and June 2020.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this cross-sectional study, pediatric admissions to US hospitals decreased in 2020 across an array of pediatric conditions. Although some conditions may have decreased in incidence, others may represent unmet needs in pediatric care during the COVID-19 pandemic.

TI  - Public Approval, Policy Issues, and Partisanship in the American Presidency: Examining the 2019-2020 Trump Impeachment and Acquittal
T2  - PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE & POLITICS
LA  - English
KW  - MEDIA
AB  - Although much of the United States undoubtedly was aware of the impeachment hearings and trial for President Donald Trump in 2019-2020, the extent to which information about those events influenced the public remains unknown. Building on scholarship about public opinion and democratic governance, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap through a unique survey. We asked half of our sample to answer three factual questions pertaining to Trump's first impeachment trial. We ran a quasi-experiment on the other half, trying to influence their view of the trial by informing them of the same three facts that we asked the first group. The quasi-experiment demonstrates that support for acquittal was largely static and that partisanship strongly influences whether the public accepts the veracity and importance of political information. Consequently, civic knowledge today appears to have a limited-perhaps even nonexistent-effect on public attitudes about American politics.

AB  - Background: Sending emergency messages via mobile phone text messaging can be a promising communication tool to rapidly disseminate information and promote preventive behavior among the public during epidemic outbreaks. The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
   Objective: This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading and obtaining information via emergency alert SMS text messages and their effects on the individual's practice of preventive behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea.
   Methods: A cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data.
   Results: Overall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (beta=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (beta=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (beta=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant.
   Conclusions: Our findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdown meant a greatly reduced social and economic activity. Sound is of major importance to people's perception of the environment, and some remarked that the soundscape was changing for the better. But are these anecdotal reports based in truth? Has traffic noise from cars and airplanes really gone down, so that more birdsong can be heard? Have socially distanced people quietened down? This article presents a case study of the human perception of environmental sounds in an urban neighborhood in the Basque Country between 15 March and 25 May 2020. The social restrictions imposed through national legislation divided the 69-day period into three phases. We collected observations, field audio recordings, photography, and diary notes on 50 days. Experts in soundscape and architecture were presented with the recordings, in randomized order, and made two separate perceptual analyses. One group (N = 11) rated the recordings for pleasantness and eventfulness using an adapted version of the Swedish Soundscape Quality Protocol, and a partly overlapping group (N = 12) annotated perceived sound events with free-form semantic labels. The labels were systematically classified into a four-level Taxonomy of Sound Sources, allowing an estimation of the relative amounts of Natural, Human, and Technological sounds. Loudness and three descriptors developed for bioacoustics were extracted computationally. Analysis showed that Eventfulness, Acoustic Complexity, and Acoustic Richness increased significantly over the time period, while the amount of Technological sounds decreased. These observations were interpreted as reflecting changes in people's outdoor activities and behavior over the whole 69-day period, evidenced in an increased presence of Human sounds of voices and walking, and a significant shift from motorized vehicles toward personal mobility devices, again evidenced by perceived sounds. Quantitative results provided a backdrop against which qualitative analyses of diary notes and observations were interpreted in relation to the restrictions and the architectural specifics of the site. An integrated analysis of all sources pointed at the temporary suspension of human outdoor activity as the main reason for such a change. In the third phase, the progressive return of street life and the usage of personal mobility vehicles seemed to be responsible for a clear increase in Eventfulness and Loudness even in the context of an overall decrease of Technological sounds. Indoor human activity shared through open windows and an increased presence of birdsong emerge as a novel characteristic element of the local urban soundscape. We discuss how such changes in the acoustic environment of the site, in acoustic measurements and as perceived by humans, point toward the soundscape being a crucial component of a comprehensive urban design strategy that aims to improve health and quality of life for increasingly large and dense populations in the future.

AB  - Background: Since the outbreak of COVID-19 were announced in Wuhan, China, the virus has spread in most countries. After one year of restrictive measures applied by governments, it is unclear how this prolonged social distancing has affected the mental health of individuals in Libya. Therefore, the present study aims to assess the levels of perceived stress, depression, sleep disturbance, and self-efficacy associated with the pandemic in Libya and their association with the demographic factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted between October 10 and November 10, 2020 in 21 cities in Libya using an online survey. The survey collected socio-demographic variables and other important psychological variables using valid scales: namely, the Perceived Stress scale, the PROMIS Depression scale, the PROMIS Sleep Disturbance scale, and self-efficacy 6-item scale. Additionally, data were collected regarding eating and smoking habits, housing and living situations, and the preparedness of the public to manage the upcoming waves of the pandemic.
   Results: The questionnaire was accessed 746 times, and a total of 683 completed questionnaires were analyzed (response rate of 91.6%), with ages ranging from 18 to 94 years (Mean +/- SD = 27.09 +/- 10.57). Among the respondents, 58.4% were females and 77% were from the age group 18-29 years. The perceived stress, depression, and sleep disturbance symptoms were high in overall population. For stress, 52.7 and 17.1% of respondents reported moderate and high stress, and for sleep quality 28.8 and 8.1% reported moderate and high sleep disturbance, respectively. For depression, the overall median score was 20 (out of 40). The perceived stress, depression, and sleep disturbance were more prevalent among females and the younger age groups (18-29 years old). The overall self-efficacy median total score was 6.67 (out of 10), with a significantly higher median total score for males than females (7 vs. 6.33, p = 0.001). About 14.5% of the respondents were regular cigarette smokers, and most of them (79.8%) described their smoking habits during the previous month as more than typical. In addition, the reported eating habits of almost half of the respondents (43%) had changed, with about one-third (29.6%) reporting that their eating habits had become less healthy during the pandemic.
   Conclusion: The findings of this research suggest increased levels of stress, depression, and sleep disturbances as well as COVID-19-related fear during the pandemic, especially among young females. This alarming finding urgently calls for safe and low-barrier interventions to help mentally burdened individuals. This study makes a significant contribution in providing essential data on the psychological and social impacts on the Libyan population due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Simple Summary Wolf management is often controversial, because this carnivore is viewed by some as a major threat for livestock, while others perceive it as a flagship for environmental conservation. Attitudes towards the wolf can be influenced by how the media portrays this canid, and media analysis can therefore be a useful tool for understanding and managing conflicts over wolf management. My aim was to study wolf media coverage in a newspaper in northern Spain, how it varied over the period 2006-2017, and in two different socio-ecological settings. Most documents focused on the conflictive relationship between the wolf and livestock, particularly in the south of the study area, where the carnivore is protected and has recolonised new localities, causing increasing damage to livestock. In the north, where wolves have been present for a long time and are a game species, wolf media coverage was more diverse and addressed other topics such as wolf conservation or hunting more frequently. In conclusion, this study suggests that the media often portrays the wolf as a risk for livestock and thus for human livelihood in northern Spain, which could have a significant influence on public attitudes towards the species and potentially compromise coexistence between wolves and humans.
   Abstract People's attitudes towards large carnivores, and thus public support for their conservation, can be influenced by how these species are framed in the media. Therefore, assessing media coverage of large carnivores is of particular interest for their coexistence with humans. I used content analysis to assess how the grey wolf was portrayed in a newspaper in northern Spain, how wolf media coverage varied over time (2006-2017), and in two different socio-ecological settings. Most documents addressed the conflictive relationship between the wolf and livestock (60%; n = 902). Moreover, coverage of this relationship increased over the study period in the south of the study area, where the wolf is strictly protected, has recolonised new localities, and damage to livestock has increased. Overall, other topics, such as wolf conservation or hunting, appeared much less frequently in the media, but predominated in the north of the study area, where the wolf is more abundant and huntable. Conflictive issues like wolf-livestock interactions are generally attractive for audiences, but drawing attention to this issue may compromise the management of conflicts associated with wolves. Ideally, the media should promote potential wolf conservation values if coexistence between wolves and humans is sought.

AB  - Plain language summary Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication affecting up to 1 in 6 pregnant women worldwide. Whilst the condition usually resolves soon after delivery, women are at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In this study, we asked women living in Chengdu, a city in western China, about what they knew about their risk of diabetes and how they felt about participating in interventions after birth to prevent T2DM. After listening to the views of 20 women, we concluded that in this setting most women are happy to attend T2DM screening programs after birth, and would be willing to consider participating in interventions and research after birth to prevent T2DM. The interventions most preferred were those that aimed at lifestyle changes, and many women said would like to receive this information through their smartphone, for example through an app or social media channel. Women were reluctant to take medications to prevent T2DM. The main factors that influenced how women felt towards interventions to prevent T2DM were: (1) their experiences with the health system during pregnancy; (2) whether the home environment was supportive to make changes to diet and lifestyle; (3) any experiences of T2DM in family members; (4) their knowledge of diabetes and perception of risk; (5) concerns about personal and baby health; (6) feelings and emotions in the postnatal period, and (7) lifestyle constraints making it difficult to make dietary changes.
   Background Gestational diabetes (GDM) is a global problem affecting millions of pregnant women, including in mainland China. These women are at high risk of Type II diabetes (T2DM). Cost-effective and clinically effective interventions are needed. We aimed to explore Chinese women's perspectives, concerns and motivations towards participation in early postpartum interventions and/or research to prevent the development of T2DM after a GDM-affected pregnancy. Methods We conducted a qualitative study in two hospitals in Chengdu, Southwest China. Face-to-face semi-structured interviews were conducted with 20 women with recent experience of GDM: 16 postpartum women and 4 pregnant women. Women were asked about their attitudes towards postpartum screening for type 2 diabetes, lifestyle interventions, mHealth delivered interventions and pharmacologic interventions (specifically metformin). An inductive approach to analysis was used. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and coded using NVivo 12 Pro. Results Most women held positive attitudes towards participating in T2DM screening, and were willing to participate in postpartum interventions to prevent T2DM through lifestyle change or mHealth interventions. Women were less likely to agree to pharmacological intervention, unless they had family members with diabetes or needed medication themselves during pregnancy. We identified seven domains influencing women's attitudes towards future interventions: (1) experiences with the health system during pregnancy; (2) living in an enabling environment; (3) the experience of T2DM in family members; (4) knowledge of diabetes and perception of risk; (5) concerns about personal and baby health; (6) feelings and emotions, and (7) lifestyle constraints. Those with more severe GDM, an enabling environment and health knowledge, and with experience of T2DM in family members expressed more favourable views of postpartum interventions and research participation to prevent T2DM after GDM. Those who perceived themselves as having mild GDM and those with time/lifestyle constraints were less likely to participate. Conclusions Women with experiences of GDM in Chengdu are generally willing to participate in early postpartum interventions and/or research to reduce their risk of T2DM, with a preference for non-drug, mHealth based interventions, integrating lifestyle change strategies, blood glucose monitoring, postpartum recovery and mental health.

AB  - Background: Physician-rating websites combine public reporting with social networking and offer an attractive means by which users can provide feedback on their physician and obtain information about other patients' satisfaction and experiences. However, research on how users evaluate information on these portals is still scarce and only little knowledge is available about the potential influence of physician reviews on a patient's choice.
   Objective: Starting from the perspective of prospective patients, this paper sets out to explore how certain characteristics of physician reviews affect the evaluation of the review and users' attitudes toward the rated physician. We propose a model that relates review style and review number to constructs of review acceptance and check it with a Web-based experiment.
   Methods: We employed a randomized 2x2 between-subject, factorial experiment manipulating the style of a physician review (factual vs emotional) and the number of reviews for a certain physician (low vs high) to test our hypotheses. A total of 168 participants were presented with a Web-based questionnaire containing a short description of a dentist search scenario and the manipulated reviews for a fictitious dental physician. To investigate the proposed hypotheses, we carried out moderated regression analyses and a moderated mediation analysis using the PROCESS macro 2.11 for SPSS version 22.
   Results: Our analyses indicated that a higher number of reviews resulted in a more positive attitude toward the rated physician. The results of the regression model for attitude toward the physician suggest a positive main effect of the number of reviews (mean [low] 3.73, standard error [SE] 0.13, mean [high] 4.15, SE 0.13). We also observed an interaction effect with the style of the review-if the physician received only a few reviews, fact-oriented reviews (mean 4.09, SE 0.19) induced a more favorable attitude toward the physician compared to emotional reviews (mean 3.44, SE 0.19), but there was no such effect when the physician received many reviews. Furthermore, we found that review style also affected the perceived expertise of the reviewer. Fact-oriented reviews (mean 3.90, SE 0.13) lead to a higher perception of reviewer expertise compared to emotional reviews (mean 3.19, SE 0.13). However, this did not transfer to the attitude toward the physician. A similar effect of review style and number on the perceived credibility of the review was observed. While no differences between emotional and factual style were found if the physician received many reviews, a low number of reviews received lead to a significant difference in the perceived credibility, indicating that emotional reviews were rated less positively (mean 3.52, SE 0.18) compared to fact-oriented reviews (mean 4.15, SE 0.17). Our analyses also showed that perceived credibility of the review fully mediated the observed interaction effect on attitude toward the physician.
   Conclusions: Physician-rating websites are an interesting new source of information about the quality of health care from the patient's perspective. This paper makes a unique contribution to an understudied area of research by providing some insights into how people evaluate online reviews of individual doctors. Information attributes, such as review style and review number, have an impact on the evaluation of the review and on the patient's attitude toward the rated doctor. Further research is necessary to improve our understanding of the influence of such rating sites on the patient's choice of a physician.

AB  - Social psychological research on nostalgia has mainly considered this emotion at the individual level rather than the group level. The current paper proposes that group-based nostalgia for the nation (i.e., national nostalgia) is likely to be related to a positive in-group orientation and a negative out-group orientation, because it fosters an exclusionary and essentialist sense of national identity that is based on ancestry and common descent (i.e., ethnic national identity). This prediction was tested in three survey studies. Study 1 was conducted among a broad sample of the native Dutch population, and demonstrated that national (and not personal) nostalgia is positively related to national in-group identification and out-group prejudice. Study 2 replicated the findings of Study 1 among a nationally representative sample of the native Dutch population, and provided support for the mediation by ethnic national identity. Study 3 replicated the findings of Study 2 and additionally demonstrated that national nostalgia positively predicts tendencies to protect national ingroup identity, via a stronger sense of ethnic national identity. These findings demonstrate the potential of group-based nostalgia to have positive and negative consequences for group dynamics at the same time. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When companies say one thing and do another in a corporate social responsibility context, they run the risk of corporate hypocrisy. Apart from the negative attitudes within customers, the purpose of our study was to explore what consequence corporate hypocrisy would cause on employees. This study investigated the possible link between corporate hypocrisy and employees' counterproductive work behaviors with a moderated mediation model. Based on social identity theory, our research found that the influence of corporate hypocrisy on organization-directed counterproductive work behaviors was partially mediated by organizational identification, while the first stage of mediation is moderated by the levels of employees' perceived importance of corporate social responsibility. Data from 259 employees in China, collected across three time periods, suggest that corporate hypocrisy will lead to a decrease of organizational identification, triggering CWB against the company. The indirect effect of corporate hypocrisy on CWB-O via organizational identification is enhanced when employees' perceived importance of corporate social responsibility is high. Our findings provide contributions to both corporate running and theoretical research.

AB  - Based on role congruity theory, we investigated how gender bias may influence public attitudes toward the vaccine in Turkey. Using a between-subjects design, we tested whether an emphasis on the female versus the male scientist as the vaccine's inventor in a news story influenced attitudes about the BioNTech vaccine and vaccination intentions. Partly confirming role congruity theory, three-way interaction results from 665 participants demonstrated that among male participants with a stronger belief in traditional gender roles (compared to males with lower belief), the presence of the female inventor, either by herself or together with the male inventor, decreased the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine and reduced intentions to be vaccinated by the BioNTech vaccine. We did not observe such differences for women. These findings highlight how gender bias may influence individuals' information processing and decision making in a way that may have negative consequences for public health.

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 has caused a worldwide pandemic. Control measures differ among countries and have a varying degree of effectiveness, which requires assessment. To evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Guangzhou by 3 periods according to interventions: January 7 to 22 (no intervention), January 23 to February 23 (implemented intensive interventions), and February 24 to May 17 (the normalization mode of COVID-19 prevention and control). We collected the information of 745 COVID-19 patients and their close contacts as well as control measures in Guangzhou from January 7 to May 17, 2020. We estimated the epidemiological characteristics, disease spectrum of COVID-19 cases, key time-to-event intervals, and effective reproduction number over the 3 periods. The basic reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 was also calculated over period 1. Approximately 45.8%, 49.8%, and 4.4% of cases from close contacts were asymptomatic, symptomatic, and severe, respectively. The median incubation period was 5.3 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 1.5-18.4 days) and the median serial interval fitted with gamma distribution was 5.1 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 0.8-15.9 days). The estimated median of onset-to-quarantined time in Period 1 to 3 were 7.5, 3.4, and 2.9 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.1-14.2, 3.9-14.7, and 6.0-20.0 days) respectively and the median of onset-to-confirmation time in period 1 to 3 were 8.9, 4.9 and 2.4 days (the percentiles of 2.5-97.5, 2.6-16.6, 0.9-14.6, and 0.5-11.8 days). In period 1, the reproduction number was 0.9 (95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.4) and fluctuated below 1.0 before January 22 except for January 14. The effective reproduction number gradually decreased in the period 2 with the lowest point of 0.1 on February 20, then increased again since March 27 and reach a spike of 1.8 on April 12. The number decreased to below 1.0 after April 17 and decreased further to <0.2 after May 7 in the period 3. Under prospective dynamic observation, close contacts turned into infected cases could provide a spectrum of COVID-19 cases from real-world settings. The lockdown of Wuhan and closed-loop management of people arriving Guangzhou were effective in halting the spread of the COVID-19 cases to Guangzhou. The spread of COVID-19 was successfully controlled in Guangzhou by social distancing, wearing a face mask, handwashing, disinfection in key places, mass testing, extensive contact tracing, and strict quarantine of close contacts.

AB  - Due to close contact with death, medical students may question their own and their patients' dying process, especially with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the increase in deaths. This situation provokes fear and negative attitudes towards dealing with patients and their environment. This study aimed to assess the level of fear of death and associated factors in medical students at a Peruvian university. A cross-sectional analytical study was conducted during March 2021 in human medicine students from the first to the seventh year. A validated survey including the Collet-Lester fear-of-death scale was applied. Factors associated with the fear-of-death score were evaluated by calculating linear regression coefficients (beta). A total of 284 students were included. The median age was 22 years, and 58.1% were female. The mean Collet-Lester scale score was 2.79, and it was higher in the dimensions related to the death of others. Adjusted analysis showed that the score on this scale was lower in students aged 24-40 years compared to 17-21 years (beta: -0.25; 95% CI: -0.46 to -0.04) and those who had no religious beliefs (beta: -0.29; 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.04). In conclusion, fear of death was lower than reported in other investigations despite the COVID-19 situation, being much lower among older students and those without religious beliefs.

AB  - This study extends the logic of prior studies showing phonetic convergence between interlocutors to the structural domain. We ask whether listeners' adaptation of the syntactic forms they produce depends on their perceptions about their interlocutor's social proximity and linguistic competence, using structural priming as a measure of convergence. Two experiments compared structural priming in dialogues between native British English speakers and (i) other native British English speakers, (ii) native speakers of North American English, and (iii) non-native speakers of English, to assess to what extent interlocutor characteristics influence structural convergence in dialogue. Our findings suggest that rates of structural convergence depend both on a speaker's pre-existing structural biases for particular verbs, and their perception of (linguistic or social) similarity to their interlocutor. This suggests that low-level mechanisms underlying structural convergence may be mediated by beliefs about how interlocutors are socially situated with respect to each other.

AB  - This study mainly examines the different effects and mechanisms of news feed advertising (vs. traditional display advertising) on advertising attitude and brand attitude by using an observational experiment that categorized participants based on their past experiences. By analyzing the video advertising of the "Li Ning" brand, three conclusion were drawn. First, compared with traditional display advertising, news feed advertising led to more positive advertising attitude and brand attitude. Second, generation and transmission mechanism of attitudes were applicable to the interpretation rules of the classical information processing process model, which showed that the information processing process of the news feed advertising and the traditional display advertising were consistent. Third, consumer's brand experience did not affect the direct effects of "attention" on "memory," but affected the mediate role of "interpretation," which showed that news feed advertising may have a stronger "drainage" effect when promoting new products and developing new markets. However, if the consumer's experience is not enhanced, the brand attitude triggered by news feed advertising will still not be stable. These findings are conducive to further understanding the effect of news feed advertising on advertising attitude and brand attitude.

AB  - Effective public engagement with complex technologies requires a nuanced understanding of how different audiences make sense of and communicate disruptive technologies with immense social implications. Using latent class analysis (LCA) on nationally-representative survey data (N = 2,700), we examine public attitudes on different aspects of AI, and segment the U.S. population based on their AI-related risk and benefit perceptions. Our analysis reveals five segments: the negative, perceiving risks outweighing benefits; the ambivalent, seeing high risks and benefits; the tepid, perceiving slightly more benefits than risks; the ambiguous, perceiving moderate risks and benefits; and the indifferent, perceiving low risks and benefits. For societal debates surrounding a deeply disruptive issue like AI, our findings suggest potential opportunities for engagement by soliciting input from individuals in segments with varying levels of support for AI, as well as a way to widen representation of voices and ensure responsible innovation of AI.

AB  - The availability of vaccines does not mean that people will be willing to get vaccinated. For example, different conspiracy beliefs on the adverse effects of vaccines may lead people to avoid collective health measures. This paper explores the role played by antecedents of COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, such as the role of political ideology and the endorsement of moral purity values, and the consequences of COVID-related conspiracy beliefs in terms of the acceptance of a COVID vaccine (when available) via structural equation modelling (SEM). A sample of 590 Italian participants filled in a questionnaire implemented using the Qualtrics.com platform, during the first Italian lockdown in April-May 2020. Results showed that endorsing purity values predicted stronger negative attitude towards COVID-vaccines. Moreover, conspiracy beliefs negatively predicted general attitudes toward vaccines. Faith in science negatively predicted general and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs, with those believing more in science also less endorsing general and COVID-related conspiracy beliefs. The attitudes towards the vaccines mediated the relationship between COVID-related conspiracy beliefs and attitudes towards COVID vaccine.

AB  - A pioneer of women in advertising and television media, Paula Green (1927-2015) is arguably best remembered for her copy for the Avis "We Try Harder" campaign that revolutionized Madison Avenue in the 1960s. While Green certainly flourished at Doyle Dane Bernbach, by the end of the decade, she had reached the highest position available to her at the agency. It was at this point she decided to establish her own firm, Green Dolmatch. As its president, creative director, and co-owner, Green was no longer beholden to the corporate mainstream. Consequently, as this article will argue, over the course of the 1970s, she selected projects that showcased women's concerns, deploying high-profile radio, television, and print campaigns to convey personal and political cause-driven social messages. Ultimately, Green's feminist media campaigns became watersheds in the industry, helping to transform public attitudes towards women's issues and the way the American media handles activist causes today.

AB  - Introduction
   The evidence is mixed on the HIV knowledge, attitude, and practices of youth in Iran. The aim of the current study was to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Iranian youth towards HIV through a national survey.
   Materials and Methods
   Through a cross-sectional study with multistage cluster sampling, we administered a pilot-tested standard questionnaire to assess the levels of HIV knowledge, attitudes and practices of individuals aged 15-29 years old. Participants were recruited from 13 provinces in Iran and consisted of 2456 men and 2412 women.
   Results
   Only 37.3% of the participants had a high knowledge score. Most participants knew the main routes of HIV transmission; however, misconceptions existed about the transmission of HIV through mosquito bites across all age groups (31.7% correct response). Positive levels of attitude wereobserved among 20.7% of the participants. Most participants believed that people living with HIV (PLHIV) should be supported (88.3%) while only 46.3% were ready to share a table with them. Among those aged 19-29 years old, the main source of HIV information was mass media (69.1%), only 13.1% had ever tested for HIV, around 20.8% had ever had extramarital sex (31.7% male vs. 9.6% female), 1.8% ever injected drugs (2.9% male vs. and 0.7% female). Among sexually active subjects in this age group, only 21.8% (26.1% male vs. 7.1% female) were consistent condom users.
   Conclusions
   The findings showed that Iranian youth and young adults have relatively insufficient overall knowledge and negative attitudes about HIV and PLHIV. Novel strategies involving schools and youth's networks could be employed to deliver a culturally sensitive sexual health program.

AB  - Assessment in learning is always of interest to practitioners, academics and researchers, and is always evolving with new implications. Alternative forms of assessment such as e-portfolios have gained recognition in documenting students' learning, as it is synchronous with both product and process. Vast amount of literature narrates the relative advantages of e-portfolios across disciplines, institutions, and applications. In Malaysia, such alternative assessment practices are less explored so far in teacher education. In this study, 55 pre-service TESOL teachers from Universiti Sains Malaysia (USM) are required to create and maintain a personal e-portfolio. The aim of the study is to ascertain the future teachers' practices with e-portfolios in their learning and to determine if these practices lead to teaching competencies. In addition, the study also aims to identify the benefits and challenges of using an eportfolio as a tool for learning and self-assessment. Findings indicate that participants are appreciative of e-portfolios, as their performance and achievements are traced over time. It is also found that e-portfolios function as a monitoring tool, which helps the teachers recognize their learning and identify their strengths and weaknesses. Challenges are also noted, which include validity and reliability, interrupted Internet connection, negative attitudes participants, time constraints, workload and ethical issues. In terms of teacher competencies, it is found that six competencies emerge from the teachers' practices of e-portfolios - (1) developing understanding of an effective teacher's role; (2) developing teaching approaches/activities; (3) improving linguistic abilities; (4) comprehending content knowledge; (5) gaining la skills and; (6) the realization of the need to change mindsets.

AB  - Influencing and framing debates on Twitter provides power to shape public opinion. Bots have become essential tools of 'computational propaganda' on social media such as Twitter, often contributing to a large fraction of the tweets regarding political events such as elections. Although analyses have been conducted regarding the first impeachment of former president Donald Trump, they have been focused on either a manual examination of relatively few tweets to emphasize rhetoric, or the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) of a much larger corpus with respect to common metrics such as sentiment. In this paper, we complement existing analyses by examining the role of bots in the first impeachment with respect to three questions as follows. (Q1) Are bots actively involved in the debate? (Q2) Do bots target one political affiliation more than another? (Q3) Which sources are used by bots to support their arguments? Our methods start with collecting over 13M tweets on six key dates, from October 6th 2019 to January 21st 2020. We used machine learning to evaluate the sentiment of the tweets (via BERT) and whether it originates from a bot. We then examined these sentiments with respect to a balanced sample of Democrats and Republicans directly relevant to the impeachment, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, senator Mitch McConnell, and (then former Vice President) Joe Biden. The content of posts from bots was further analyzed with respect to the sources used (with bias ratings from AllSides and Ad Fontes) and themes. Our first finding is that bots have played a significant role in contributing to the overall negative tone of the debate (Q1). Bots were targeting Democrats more than Republicans (Q2), as evidenced both by a difference in ratio (bots had more negative -to-positive tweets on Democrats than Republicans) and in composition (use of derogatory nicknames). Finally, the sources provided by bots were almost twice as likely to be from the right than the left, with a noticeable use of hyper-partisan right and most extreme right sources (Q3). Bots were thus purposely used to promote a misleading version of events. Overall, this suggests an intentional use of bots as part of a strategy, thus providing further confirmation that computational propaganda is involved in defining political events in the United States. As any empirical analysis, our work has several limitations. For example, Trump's rhetoric on Twitter has previously been characterized by an overly negative tone, thus tweets detected as negative may be echoing his message rather than acting against him. Previous works show that this possibility is limited, and its existence would only strengthen our conclusions. As our analysis is based on NLP, we focus on processing a large volume of tweets rather than manually reading all of them, thus future studies may complement our approach by using qualitative methods to assess the specific arguments used by bots.

AB  - Background: Racial disparities in unintended pregnancy and contraceptive use in the United States are not mediated by access to family planning services alone. Rather, a history of medical mistrust underlies Black Americans' adoption of new medical technologies, inclusive of contraception. Efforts to develop hormonal male contraceptives need to incorporate Black Americans' experiences and perspectives so that new contraceptives enable their reproductive goals and promote gender equity.
   Study Design: Working with our community-based partner, Healthy African American Families in Los Angeles, California, we conducted six 60-minute focus group discussions with 39 Black men over age 18, in ongoing heterosexual relationships, to explore attitudes towards and willingness to use hormonal male contraceptives.
   Results: Just over one-third (35%) of respondents reported willingness to use or rely on hormonal male contraceptives. The majority held negative attitudes about hormonal male contraceptives, citing concerns about side effects and safety. Several respondents expressed mistrust of the medical community and medical research, noting that hormonal male contraceptives could be used against Black communities; several expressed unwillingness to trial hormonal male contraceptives without years of testing. However, all groups described scenarios where they would use them despite stated concerns.
   Conclusions: Black men's hypothetical willingness to use hormonal male contraceptives is limited by medical mistrust, which may be overcome by their concerns about the unreliability of current options or the contraceptive behaviors of female partners. Nevertheless, addressing Black Americans' history of medical mistreatment and exploitation will be essential for hormonal male contraceptives to positively contribute to Black men's reproductive options and agency.

AB  - Individual actions to avoid, benefit from, or cope with climate change impacts partly shape adaptation; much research on adaptation has focused at the systems level, overlooking drivers of individual responses. Theoretical frameworks and empirical studies of environmental behavior identify a complex web of cognitive, affective, and evaluative factors that motivate stewardship. We explore the relationship between knowledge of, and adaptation to, widespread, climate-induced tree mortality to understand the cognitive (i.e., knowledge and learning), affective (i.e., attitudes and place attachment), and evaluative (i.e., use values) factors that influence how individuals respond to climate-change impacts. From 43 semistructured interviews with forest managers and users in a temperate forest, we identified distinct responses to local, climate-induced environmental changes that we then categorized as either behavioral or psychological adaptations. Interviewees developed a depth of knowledge about the dieback through a combination of direct, place-based experiences and indirect, mediated learning through social interactions. Knowing that the dieback was associated with climate change led to different adaptive responses among the interviewees, although knowledge alone did not explain this variation. Forest users reported psychological adaptations to process negative attitudes; these adaptations were spurred by knowledge of the causes, losses of intangible values, and impacts to a species to which they held attachment. Behavioral adaptations exclusive to a high level of knowledge included actions such as using the forests to educate others or changing transportation behaviors to reduce personal energy consumption. Managers integrated awareness of the dieback and its dynamics across spatial scales into current management objectives. Our findings suggest that adaptive management may occur from the bottom up, as individual managers implement new practices in advance of policies. As knowledge of climate-change impacts in local environments increases, resource users may benefit from programs and educational interventions that facilitate coping strategies.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has created unique challenges for recruitment of adults and children into clinical research. The sudden onset of stay-at-home orders and social distancing enacted in much of the United States created sudden barriers for researchers to recruit participants in-person. Recognizing the critical need to understand the impact of COVID-19 on children and families in real time, studies required an alternative approach. The present study sought to develop methods and establish the feasibility of utilizing Facebook's targeted advertising to enroll schoolaged children and their parents for a study examining the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on families. This study used an 8 week pay-per-click advertisement approach via Facebook for research recruitment. Parents of children age 8 to 17 were invited and asked to include their child. Standardized measures were included for parents and children. Zip code targeting was used to increase diversity in participants. The ad campaign reached 213,120, yielding 3563 clicks, 684 parent participants, 494 child participants and a 26% conversion rate over eight weeks. The cost-per-click was $0.64, and cost-per-participant was $3.30 and $4.60 for parents and children, respectively. This nationwide study successfully used social media to recruit a robust nationwide sample of parent-child dyads during the COVID-19 pandemic. Social media recruitment mitigated typical time and engagement barriers for participants while also circumventing social and physical distancing orders due to the pandemic which allowed for real time assessment of the pandemic's effects on families. Future consideration should be given.to social media as a research recruitment methodology.

AB  - What accounts for the widespread support for Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential race? This experiment demonstrates that the changing racial demographics of America contribute to Trump's success as a presidential candidate among White Americans whose race/ethnicity is central to their identity. Reminding White Americans high in ethnic identification that non-White racial groups will outnumber Whites in the United States by 2042 caused them to become more concerned about the declining status and influence of White Americans as a group (i.e., experience group status threat), and caused them to report increased support for Trump and anti-immigrant policies, as well as greater opposition to political correctness. Increased group status threat mediated the effects of the racial shift condition on candidate support, anti-immigrant policy support, and opposition to political correctness. Among Whites low in ethnic identification, in contrast, the racial shift condition had no effect on group status threat or support for anti-immigrant policies, but did cause decreased positivity toward Trump and decreased opposition to political correctness. Group status threat did not mediate these effects. Reminders of the changing racial demographics had comparable effects for Democrats and Republicans. Results illustrate the importance of changing racial demographics and White ethnic identification in voter preferences and how social psychological theory can illuminate voter preferences.

AB  - Introduction Nurses represent an important link in mediating between the potential donors and their relatives'consent to organ and tissue transplantation.The message of the Health Department to potential donors about the importance of organ donation was supported by the Serbian Orthodox Church, the army and other institutions through media campaigns. Nurses could contribute to this action by their personal example.
   Objective The aim of this study was identification and bivariate analysis of nurse attitude about organ donation, their knowledge about the importance of transplantation as treatment methods, as well as the connection between work experience and education level with the formation of attitudes and new skills.
   Methods In this cross-sectional study, 291 nurses from the Clinical Center of Serbia, Belgrade, filled in the questionnaire on the effect of correlation between the length of the service and level of education on knowledge and attitudes toward organ transplantation and organ donation.
   Results Out of 291 respondents, 67.4% have completed the nursing school and 32.6% have higher education. The majority (63.9%) of respondents knew that the EEG was the most valid method for determining brain death. The question regarding the possibility of buying organs was answered correctly by 68.7% of respondents. A large majority (91%) would accept organ transplant, if needed, but only 32.0% would be organ donors, and only 0.3% owned a donor card. In contrast, one third of nurses were already blood donors.
   Conclusion In case of necessary transplantation, nurses would accept someone else's organ, though they do not possess donor cards, but just few would donate their organs. It is possible that prejudice arises from ignorance and distrust in the health policy of the Republic of Serbia. However, besides negative attitude, nurses have expressed interest in learning and professional development in the area of transplantation.

AB  - In developing countries, there is a large gap in the compensations of locals and expatriates, which is related to negative attitudes of locals. A multilevel study was conducted in China on the influence of low compensation parity in MNC operations. Findings show that the negative effects of low compensation parity on outcome variables, namely, evaluation of and knowledge sharing with expatriates, as well as job satisfaction and intention to quit, were fully mediated by distributive justice based on a comparison with expatriates. Personal pro-disparity norm regarding low compensation parity played a buffering role and was related to a weaker relationship between compensation parity and comparative distributive justice. Organizational pro-disparity norm showed a similar cross-level buffering effect. Trust climate was related to a weaker relationship between compensation parity and comparative distributive justice, and fully mediated the moderating effect of organizational pro-disparity norm. The findings have important theoretical and managerial implications for mitigating the negative influence of low compensation parity in multinational firms, and point to some important topics for future research on the social integration of locals and expatriates.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how healthy eating involvement (HEI) impacts the evaluations of branded food advergames.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper invokes the elaboration likelihood model and reactance theory to explain the effects of different levels of brand integration within a food advergame on individuals with different reported levels of HEI. Undergraduate students were assigned (non-random) to play one of three different advergames with varying levels of brand integration. Furthermore, participant's health involvement was measured and incorporated as a moderating variable on brand and advergame attitudes. Regression analyses were used to analyze the data.
   Findings - The results showed significant interaction effects between HEI levels and level of brand advergame integration. Individuals with higher levels of HEI showed more negative attitudes toward the brand and game when integration was high. However, lower levels of brand advergame integration resulted in positive effects among lower HEI individuals.
   Research limitations/implications - Limitations of this research are that gamer experience was not measured prior to game play. Also, that no control of advergame playing time was conducted. However, a manipulation check was conducted. Future research should examine the impact of healthy advergames on individual's reactions and information processing.
   Practical implications - Editors and creators of advergames must be more aware of the impact that branded items have within a gaming situation. Individuals may not always positively evaluate the brand integrated within a fun online environment. Furthermore, better consumer targeting will likely lead to higher message acceptance based upon individuals levels of self-congruency with that message.
   Originality/value - This study provides needed examination of contextual and individual level variables in responses to advergaming content.

AB  - YouTube, a popular online site for user-generated content, is emerging as a powerful source of peer modeling of smoking. Previous research suggests that in counteracting such influence, health messages may inadvertently increase the perceived prevalence of drug use (a descriptive norm) without reducing its acceptability (injunctive norm). This research tested the ability of health messages to reduce the social acceptability of peer smoking on YouTube despite enhancing its perceived prevalence. In an online experiment with 999 adolescents, participants were randomly assigned to view one of two videos: (a) a mosaic displaying a variety of YouTube videos of adolescents smoking followed by a message about the mortality risk to those smokers, or (b) a control video on a health topic unrelated to smoking. Although exposure to the adolescent YouTube smokers increased perceived prevalence among some participants, it simultaneously increased beliefs about smoking's adverse health outcomes and negative attitudes toward smoking, effects that were associated with reductions in injunctive norms of social acceptability. Interventions that communicate the severity and scope of health risks associated with smoking may undercut the descriptive normative effects of peer modeling of smoking on social media sites such as YouTube.

AB  - European integration has been progressing even as support for Eurosceptic parties has been rising. Post-functionalist literature focuses on how public attitudes affect the progress of European integration (bottom-up), but the mechanism through which European integration affects domestic politics (top-down) is underexplored. Extreme parties on either the left or right are known to adopt a Polity-Eurosceptic agenda in order to realign the main domestic political cleavage and turn themselves into the new mainstream. We aim to contribute to this literature by arguing that the timing and type of EU events matter. Specifically, the vote for such Eurosceptified Pariah Parties increase with integration events that have a potential for high media profile, signal reduced state autonomy, and occur in proximity to national elections. Furthermore, we argue that even if mainstream parties may counter Eurosceptified Pariah Parties' claims, the net effect is to ratchet-up electoral support for the latter. We support this argument by employing a mixed-method design using both a natural experiment approach (UESD for Spain's 1993 election) and a model-based approach (all parties in 1979-2017 and a new event database). Results are robust to the usual confounders, and the exclusion of different classes of events and opportunistically-timed elections.

AB  - One of the major problems regarding consumer acceptance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) is the possibility that their transgenes could have adverse effects on the environment and/or human health. Genome editing, represented by the CRISPR/Cas9 system, can efficiently achieve transgene-free gene modifications and is anticipated to generate a wide spectrum of plants. However, the public attitude against GMOs suggests that people will initially be unlikely to accept these plants. We herein explored the bottlenecks of consumer acceptance of transgene-free food crops developed by genome editing and made some recommendations. People should not pursue a zero-risk bias regarding such crops. Developers are encouraged to produce cultivars with a trait that would satisfy consumer needs. Moreover, they should carefully investigate off-target mutations in resultant plants and initially refrain from agricultural use of multiplex genome editing for better risk-benefit communication. The government must consider their regulatory status and establish appropriate regulations if necessary. The government also should foster communication between the public and developers. If people are informed of the benefits of genome editing-mediated plant breeding and trust in the relevant regulations, and if careful risk-benefit communication and sincere considerations for the right to know approach are guaranteed, then such transgene-free crops could gradually be integrated into society.

AB  - The literature on South-South Development Cooperation (SSDC) has grown exponentially in the past few years. One focus of analysis has been how domestic institutions and agendas shape the approaches to development cooperation of different Southern partners. However, few analysts to date have commented on how the 'ordinary' general public of these countries might perceive or assess their country's role in international development. Through a study based on interviews and media analysis, this paper attempts to tease out the slim evidence currently available on 'public' attitudes in India, concentrating, for reasons explained, exclusively on elites and 'middle classes'. It argues that, while some domestic criticism will certainly accompany the growing visibility of Indian development cooperation, the attractive blend of discursive positioning and material benefits may provide the Indian government with broad support for its growing investment and profile in international development, or at least offset a degree of criticism. At present there appears to be little public discussion about whether and how India's external role relates to domestic poverty, or the nature of growth and 'development' that India is helping to stimulate in partner countries. The paper also discusses ` boundary making' with China through the public construction of Indian development cooperation.

AB  - Objective: Risk assessment and response is important for understanding human behavior. The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political "Left" diverge from those on the "Right"). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Method: Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Results: Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Conclusions: Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived "common ground," between the political "Right" and "Left." Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology.

TI  - Adherence to COVID-19 policy measures: Behavioral insights from The Netherlands and Belgium
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background Since the start of the global COVID-19 pandemic, countries have been mirroring each other's policies to mitigate the spread of the virus. Whether current measures alone will lead to behavioral change such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a facemask is not well understood. The objective of this study is to better understand individual variation in behavioral responses to COVID-19 by exploring the influence of beliefs, motivations and policy measures on public health behaviors. We do so by comparing The Netherlands and Flanders, the Dutch speaking part of Belgium.
   Methods and findings Our final sample included 2,637 respondents from The Netherlands and 1,678 from Flanders. The data was nationally representative along three dimensions: age, gender, and household income in both countries. Our key outcome variables of interest were beliefs about policy effectiveness; stated reasons for complying with public rules; and changes in behavior. For control variables, we included a number of measures of how severe the respondent believed Covid-19 to be and a number of negative side effects that the person may have experienced: loneliness, boredom, anxiety, and conflicts with friends and neighbors. Finally, we controlled for socio-demographic factors: age, gender, income (categorical), education (categorical) and the presence of Covid-19 risk factors (diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, allergies). The dependent variable for each of the estimation models is dichotomous, so we used Probit models to predict the probability of engaging in a given behavior. We found that motivations, beliefs about the effectiveness of measures, and pre-pandemic behavior play an important role. The Dutch were more likely to wash their hands than the Flemish (15.4%, p<0.01), visit family (15.5%, p < .01), run errands (12.0%, p<0.05) or go to large closed spaces such as a shopping mall (21.2%, p<0.01). The Dutch were significantly less likely to wear a mask (87.6%, p<0.01). We also found that beliefs about the virus, psychological effects of the virus, as well as pre-pandemic behavior play a role in adherence to recommendations.
   Conclusions Our results suggest that policymakers should consider behavioral motivations specific to their country in their COVID-19 strategies. In addition, the belief that a policy is effective significantly increased the probability of the behavior, so policy measures should be accompanied by public health campaigns to increase adherence.

AB  - In three experiments, we explored the impact of a self-affirmation treatment oil sexual prejudice (i.e, negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians) Studies 1 and 2 found that participants who were affirmed by valuing relationships with family and friends were significantly more prejudiced than participants who were affirmed by valuing other self-relevant characteristics Relative to a non-affirmed control, the family/friends affirmation did not actually increase prejudice, however. other affirmations decreased bias Study 3 replicated the finding that prejudice was higher among participants who affirmed to family/friends compared to those who affirmed to other values, and showed a mediator of the effect the endorsement of traditional family values That is, affirming to family/friends was associated with support for family Values, which was positively associated with prejudice These findings add to a growing body of evidence demonstrating the potential for self-affirmation to reduce bias, but establish that the type of value afffirmed is an important consideration Specifically, familial-based affirmations may undermine reduction of sexual prejudice because they remind individuals of values that many people see as being in conflict with expressing tolerant attitudes toward gays and lesbians (C), 2009 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.

AB  - Undergraduate psychology students have been largely excluded from interprofessional education (IPE) initiatives. In contrast to many health professions, undergraduate psychology students do not engage in work placements as part of their degree, and many enter careers outside the health care context. However, the collaborative skills gained through an IPE experience may well be beneficial to students who work in this wider context. This research examines whether undergraduate psychology students' views of IPE vary according to their planned career directions, and if so, whether the perceived relevance of IPE mediates the relationships. A sample of 188 Australian university undergraduate psychology students completed an online questionnaire following completion of a first-year IPE health sciences program. Path analysis indicated that psychology students' attitudes towards IPE are associated with both professional identification and practitioner orientation, fully mediated through the perceived relevance of IPE to future career and study plans. Stronger professional identification and practitioner orientation were associated with greater perceived relevance and more positive and less negative attitudes towards IPE. Placing a stronger emphasis on the generalizability of IP skills taught may increase students' awareness of the relevance outside of the health context, reducing disengagement of students planning alternative careers.

   Loyalty programs are pervasive across service industries. However, the examination of cross-customer effects represents a critical gap in the loyalty literature. To address this gap, this research conducts two between-subjects experimental design studies to examine traditional versus endowed loyalty status earner attitudinal loyalty intention toward the company, switching intentions and perceived unfairness.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Study 1 conducts a 2 (self: earned vs endowed) x 2 (others: earned vs endowed) between-subjects experimental design on the direct effects of attitudinal loyalty intention toward the company and switching intentions. Study 2 builds upon these findings by examining the mediation effect of perceived unfairness on the attitudinal loyalty intention toward the company and switching intentions.
   Findings
   Results from Study 1 find that cross-customer comparisons exist, and traditional loyalty members have negative attitudinal loyalty intention toward the company and switching intentions when comparing their rewards to endowed earner rewards. Study 2 examines an airline context and finds that unfairness mediates the relationship.
   Originality/value
   The research builds upon the literature surrounding cross-customer comparisons, loyalty programs, equity theory and endowed status and discusses the unintended negative consequences related to endowed loyalty rewards on other customer intentions that have critical managerial implications.

AB  - This article empirically investigates the impact of national socio-economic contextual factors on public opinion on globalisation. It also examines the mediating impact ... of these factors on the relationship between citizens' education, occupation and public opinion on globalisation. Using Eurobarometer data, this article demonstrates that national levels of unemployment, FDI and trade balances, as well as the proportion of the national population with tertiary education attainment, influence citizens' opinions on globalisation. They also show that national levels of unemployment, trade and FDI balances, net migration and the proportion of the national population with tertiary education arbitrate the relationship between individuals' education, occupation and public attitudes towards globalisation. The article then discusses the implications of these findings.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has been declared an international public health emergency, and it may have long-lasting effects on people's mental health. There is a need to identify effective health behaviors to mitigate the negative mental health impact of COVID-19.
   Objective: The objectives of this study were to (1) examine the regional differences in mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress, in light of the state-level prevalence of COVID-19 cases; (2) estimate the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and health behavior engagement (ie, physical activity, mindfulness meditation); and (3) explore the mediating effect of health behavior engagement on the associations between mental health and COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was distributed to a sample of US adult paying subscribers to the Calm app (data were collected from April 22 to June 3, 2020). The survey assessed COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; health behavior engagement; and mental health (ie, perceived stress, posttraumatic stress disorder, and anxiety and depression). Statistical analyses were performed using R software. Differences in COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress and mental health by location were assessed using t tests and chi-square tests. Logistic and ordinary least squares models were used to regress mental health and health behavior on COVID-19-related worry, attention to news, and stress; moreover, causal mediation analysis was used to estimate the significance of the mediation effects.
   Results: The median age of the respondents (N=8392) was 47 years (SD 13.8). Participants in the Mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania) reported higher levels of stress, more severe depression symptoms, greater worry about COVID-19, paying more attention to COVID-19-related news, and more stress related to social distancing recommendations than participants living in other regions. The association between worry about COVID-19 and perceived stress was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001), strength of meditation habit (P<.001), and stopping meditation (P=.046). The association between worry about COVID-19 and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms was significantly mediated by changes in physical activity (P<.001) and strength of meditation habit (P<.001).
   Conclusions: Our findings describe the mental health impact of COVID-19 and outline how continued participation in health behaviors such as physical activity and mindfulness meditation reduce worsening of mental health due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These data have important implications for public health agencies and health organizations to promote the maintenance of health habits to reduce the residual mental health burden of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Introduction Mental health disorders are common during pregnancy and the postnatal period and can have serious adverse effects on women and their children. The consequences for global mental health due to COVID-19 are likely to be significant and may have a long-term impact on the global burden of disease. Besides physical vulnerability, pregnant women are at increased risk of mental health problems such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder due to the consequences of social distancing. It can result in altered healthcare routines, less support from the family and friends, and in some cases, partners not being allowed to be present during prenatal visits, labour and delivery. Higher than expected, rates of perinatal anxiety and depression have been already reported during the pandemic. Pregnant women may also feel insecure and worried about the effects of COVID-19 on their unborn child if they get infected during pregnancy. Today, young urban women are used to using internet services frequently and efficiently. Therefore, providing mental health support to pregnant women via internet may be effective in ameliorating their anxiety/depression, reducing the risk of serious mental health disorders, and lead to improved maternal and perinatal outcomes.
   Overarching aim Our aim is to explore the effectiveness of a web-based psychosocial peer-to-peer support intervention in reducing the risk and severity of perinatal mental health disorders and preventing adverse pregnancy outcomes among pregnant women living in metropolitan urban settings.
   Methods and analysis We plan to conduct a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial, Mental health of Urban Mothers trial. Pregnant women living in large metropolitan cities will be recruited using internet-based application through non-profit organisations' websites. The women who consent will be randomised to receive a web-based peer-to-peer support intervention or usual care. Data will be analysed to identify the effects of intervention on Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Score and Generalised Anxiety Disorder 7 scores as well as pregnancy outcomes. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic on maternal stress will be assesed using Impact Event Scale-R. Any differences in outcomes between cities will be addressed in subgroup analyses.
   Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted according to the principles of Good Clinical Practice and will follow the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. The study protocol has been approved by the ethical review board of Chinese University of Hong Kong (IRB number 2019-8170) and Shanghai Center for Women's and Children's Health (international review board (IRB) number 2020-F001-12). The results will be disseminated at national and international scientific conferences, published in peer-reviewed medical journals and spread to the public through social media, news outlets and podcasts.

AB  - The media and scientific literature are increasingly reporting an escalation of large carnivore attacks on humans in North America and Europe. Although rare compared to human fatalities by other wildlife, the media often overplay large carnivore attacks on humans, causing increased fear and negative attitudes towards coexisting with and conserving these species. Although large carnivore populations are generally increasing in developed countries, increased numbers are not solely responsible for the observed rise in the number of attacks by large carnivores. Here we show that an increasing number of people are involved in outdoor activities and, when doing so, some people engage in risk-enhancing behaviour that can increase the probability of a risky encounter and a potential attack. About half of the well-documented reported attacks have involved risk-enhancing human behaviours, the most common of which is leaving children unattended. Our study provides unique insight into the causes, and as a result the prevention, of large carnivore attacks on people. Prevention and information that can encourage appropriate human behaviour when sharing the landscape with large carnivores are of paramount importance to reduce both potentially fatal human-carnivore encounters and their consequences to large carnivores.

AB  - Background: The current COVID-19 pandemic is associated with extensive individual and societal challenges, including challenges to both physical and mental health. To date, the development of mental health problems such as depressive symptoms accompanying population-based federal distancing measures is largely unknown, and opportunities for rapid, effective, and valid monitoring are currently a relevant matter of investigation.
   Objective: In this study, we aim to investigate, first, the temporal progression of depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic and, second, the consistency of the results from tweets and survey-based self-reports of depressive symptoms within the same time period.
   Methods: Based on a cross-sectional population survey of 9011 German adolescents and adults (n=4659, 51.7% female; age groups from 15 to 50 years and older) and a sample of 88,900 tweets (n=74,587, 83.9% female; age groups from 10 to 50 years and older), we investigated five depressive symptoms (eg, depressed mood and energy loss) using items from the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) before, during, and after relaxation of the first German social contact ban from January to July 2020.
   Results: On average, feelings of worthlessness were the least frequently reported symptom (survey: n=1011, 13.9%; Twitter: n=5103, 5.7%) and fatigue or loss of energy was the most frequently reported depressive symptom (survey: n=4472, 51.6%; Twitter: n=31,005, 34.9%) among both the survey and Twitter respondents. Young adult women and people living in federal districts with high COVID-19 infection rates were at an increased risk for depressive symptoms. The comparison of the survey and Twitter data before and after the first contact ban showed that German adolescents and adults had a significant decrease in feelings of fatigue and energy loss over time. The temporal progression of depressive symptoms showed high correspondence between both data sources (p=0.76-0.93; P<.001), except for diminished interest and depressed mood, which showed a steady increase even after the relaxation of the contact ban among the Twitter respondents but not among the survey respondents.
   Conclusions: Overall, the results indicate relatively small differences in depressive symptoms associated with social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic and highlight the need to differentiate between positive (eg, energy level) and negative (eg, depressed mood) associations and variations over time. The results also underscore previous suggestions of Twitter data's potential to help identify hot spots of declining and improving public mental health and thereby help provide early intervention measures, especially for young and middle-aged adults. Further efforts are needed to investigate the long-term consequences of recurring lockdown phases and to address the limitations of social media data such as Twitter data to establish real-time public mental surveillance approaches.

AB  - Introduction: In sub-Saharan Africa, a paucity of data exists in respect of the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of patients on maintenance haemodialysis (MHD) regarding the dietary adaptations they should make. Methods: In a descriptive, cross-sectional study, conducted in 2017, questionnaires were administered during structured interviews with 75 participants in five MHD-units in Bloemfontein to assess socio-demographics and KAP regarding the 'renal' diet. Results: The median age was 50.5 years; 70.7% of participants were male. Overall, 49.4% scored low (< 50%) on knowledge regarding restricted foods, food content of restricted minerals, and phosphate binders; 60.0% reported negative attitudes towards the diet, and 61.4% reported poor adherence practices. Participants with tertiary education (28.0%) had significantly higher knowledge scores than participants with only primary school education (6.7%) (95% CI 3.9%; 73.5%), or those who had only partially completed secondary school (17.3%) (95% CI 6.3%; 64.0%). Only 21.0% reported having received written, and 30.7% verbal, nutrition education in their home language, while 24.0% reported never receiving nutrition education in either their home or second language. Having received nutrition education in a home language and/or second language was associated with significantly higher knowledge scores (95% CI 3.7%; 49.5%). Most (77.3%) reported zero to one consultation with a dietitian per MHD year (NKF-K/DOQI recommends at least three/MHD year). Conclusion: This population on MHD presented with poor KAP regarding the 'renal' diet, and inadequate involvement of dietitians in their treatment. Receiving nutritional education in a first or second language significantly increased knowledge of, and insight into, the required dietary adaptations.

AB  - Objectives: It is textbook knowledge that individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) show large neurocognitive deficits. However, these patients display a number of additional impairments (e.g., lack of drive and motivation) that may contribute to poor test results. The impact of these secondary mediators has not been explored systematically. Based on prior findings that low performance motivation, a negative attitude toward cognitive assessment, and momentary symptoms compromise neuropsychological test results in depression, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, we examined the possibility that impaired test results in AUD partially represent an epiphenomenon. Methods: Fifteen patients with AUD and 20 matched nonclinical individuals underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. The neurocognitive assessment was flanked by the Momentary Influences, Attitudes and Motivation Impact on Cognitive Performance Scale (MIAMI), which captures momentary influences affecting performance. Results: Patients with AUD performed worse than nonclinical controls on most test parameters. Group differences achieved a very large effect size for parameters tapping speed and accuracy. Patients with AUD showed deviant scores, particularly on the post version of the MIAMI (retrospective assessment of symptoms and influences during testing) and the total scores. For accuracy, the MIAMI scores represented a partial mediator. For speed, significant group effect sizes were rendered nonsignificant when the MIAMI was taken into account. Conclusion: Like other psychiatric patients, patients with AUD show marked neurocognitive impairments that seem to be aggravated by, for example, distraction and lack of effort. This tentatively suggests that performance only partly reflects cortical impairments in areas hosting neurocognitive faculties. Contextual factors deserve greater attention in patients with addiction. The cross-sectional design of our study limits conclusions relating to causality.

AB  - Background: The present research compares smiling and emotion expression generally to other indicators of negative intra- and interpersonal reactions to ostracism, and in particular negative reactions towards the ostracizers.
   Methods: A total of N=143 participants (n=55 in Experiment 1 and n=88 in Experiment 2) were ostracized from a web-conference by two other individuals. Facial expressions of participants during the exclusion period were coded using EMFACS and compared to selfreported reactions to ostracism and the sources of the ostracism.
   Results: Ostracized individuals showed significant levels of both Duchenne (genuine) and non-Duchenne (social) smiling, despite finding ostracism highly aversive, reporting more negative attitudes towards the ostracizing confederates, and (in Experiment 2) higher levels of negative affect. Experiment 2 showed evidence of a self-regulation and display management function of smiling during ostracism in that participants who exhibited more Duchenne smiling during their exclusion also reported higher levels of positive emotion after the ostracism, and were also rated by a group of judges as experiencing more amusement at their exclusion.
   Conclusion: The web conferencing paradigm used in this study provides an ecologically valid method to study the management of expressive behavior during aversive interpersonal experiences, adding to the existing evidence of facial display management during other types of distressing experience.

AB  - Facebook and many other social media companies act on information markets with various player groups, which are differentiated by the kind of payment, one group paying with money (normally, advertisers) and the other group paying with their personal data or their attention (i.e., Facebook's users being simultaneously the advertisers' potential customers). In order to minimize users' problems with (rather annoying) ads on digital services, some providers offer user settings for the optimization of advertising. We analyzed the information behavior of Facebook users concerning ad settings with the help of an online survey (N = 1,021). Only about 40% of participating Facebook users know about personalization of settings of their advertising preferences. More than 20% of the users who work with Facebook's advertising optimization are satisfied since the changes, but 35% are unsatisfied, and another 32% have a generally negative attitude towards online advertising. To describe customers' disregard or ignorance of settings we introduce the term "settings blindness." Especially the users' gender and their educational background influence the information behavior concerning advertisement settings. The results have practical implications for Facebook users (namely, setting their own preferences for ads and thus seeing only personally customized ads), for Facebook and other social media companies (producing less annoying ads leading to a better customer loyalty and maybe more trust in the service), and for advertisers on social media (improving the correct addressing of the target groups).

AB  - The aim of the article is to contribute to an understanding of the attitudes of post-communist Europe's inhabitants towards gambling, and of their opinions concerning which activities can be regarded as gambling. The Attitudes Towards Gambling Scale (ATGS-8) questionnaire was used in the survey, ensuring the international comparability of the results. For the subsequent in-depth analysis of attitudes we mainly used multidimensional statistical methods. The survey, conducted in 2017, had 1092 respondents. The least negative attitudes to gambling were found in the younger age groups, while the attitudes of senior citizens were the most negative. Concerning participation in gambling, 68.4% of the respondents had taken part in at least one of the range of gambling activities offered as choices. Participation in gambling is an important factor influencing the overall attitude of the respondents to gambling. Of equal importance was the range of intensity in their perceptions of which games can be considered to be gambling, with four similarly perceived types of gambling identified. The research shows that gambling is perceived negatively by the population of the Czech Republic. The explanation may be found in the substantial media coverage of gambling related to changes in the legislation and the tightening of restrictions.

TI  - Results of a national mass media campaign in India to warn against the dangers of smokeless tobacco consumption
T2  - TOBACCO CONTROL
LA  - English
AB  - Objective Smokeless tobacco consumption in India is a significant source of morbidity and mortality. In order to educate smokeless tobacco users about the health harms of smokeless tobacco and to denormalise tobacco usage and encourage quitting, a national television and radio mass media campaign targeted at smokeless tobacco users was aired for 6 weeks during November and December 2009.
   Methods The campaign was evaluated with a nationally representative household survey of smokeless tobacco users (n = 2898). The effect of campaign awareness was assessed with logistic regression analysis.
   Results The campaign affected smokeless tobacco users as intended: 63% of smokeless-only users and 72% of dual users (ie, those who consumed both smoking and smokeless forms) recalled the campaign advertisement, primarily through television delivery. The vast majority (over 70%) of those aware of the campaign said that it made them stop and think, was relevant to their lives and provided new information. 75% of smokeless-only users and 77% of dual users said that it made them feel concerned about their habit. Campaign awareness was associated with better knowledge, more negative attitudes towards smokeless tobacco and greater cessation-oriented intentions and behaviours among smokeless tobacco users.
   Conclusions Social marketing campaigns that utilise mass media are feasible and efficacious interventions for tobacco control in India. Implications for future mass media tobacco control programming in India are discussed.

AB  - Recent and forthcoming technological innovations highlight recycled paper products as a consumer market with promising potential. This study presents the examination of the recycled paper products purchasing behavior (RPPPB), as well as some of the factors that were assumed to affect these specific pro-environmental consumers' choices. Instead of the impact of the customary positive environmental attitudes, this study focused on those negative attitudes, namely Environmental Unconcern, that might be found able to inhibit RPPB. In addition, an effort was made to examine the role of an objective environmental knowledge scale, namely the Eco-literacy scale. A survey among 224 consumers residing in the Municipality of Thessaloniki, Greece was conducted. Multiple regression indicated that just Environmental Knowledge and not the Eco-literacy scale is a predictor of RPPPB. Further, SEM analysis though verified the theoretical assumption that knowledge moderates the relationship between attitudes and behavior. It was concluded that the negative direct relationship between environmental unconcern and the recycled paper products' purchasing behavior strengthens in the group of knowledgeable consumers. Implications are provided for all stakeholders that engage in the recycled paper products market.

AB  - Objective: Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is increasing, and current studies should address issues such as stigmas and casual attitudes that may be amenable to intervention. Thus, we aimed to investigate the effects of education on the attitudes of medical students toward CSA survivors.
   Method: We divided medical students into 2 groups: preclinical and clinical medical students. We compare the attitudes of nonmedical students with the attitudes of medical students with respect to survivors of CSA. All participants were asked to complete a questionnaire about stigmatization.
   Results: There were 572 students in our study, 347 of whom were enrolled in medical school. Of the 347 medical students, 151 were from the preclinical group, and 196 were from the clinical practice group. The remainder of the participants (n = 225) were in other fields of university. Of the medical students, 68.3% responded negatively about "asking a survivor of abuse to supervise their child for a few hours," whereas 62.7% of the nonmedical students responded negatively. When asked, "What would you think if your child wanted to marry a survivor of sexual abuse?", 72.9% of the medical students and 59.1% of the nonmedical students displayed negative attitudes toward that idea. Our research also found that significantly more preclinical students than clinical students would not want to be in a companionship/friendship with a CSA survivor at work (P = .015) or in their neighborhoods (P = .034).
   Conclusion: Both medical and nonmedical students seem to have negative thoughts about sexual abuse survivors, particularly when the issue involves their own children and/or social situations. Thus, the medical professionals must be careful and should avoid over interpretations of findings on childhood abuse studies that may lead to stigmatization.

AB  - In our current political moment, discrimination against minority racial and religious groups routinely makes headlines. Though some press coverage of these occurrences acknowledges parallels and links between racial and religious prejudices, these intersections remain undertheorized in legal and historical scholarship. Because scholars typically study race and religion separately, they have overlooked the legal significance of how race and religion coexist in both perpetrators and victims of discrimination. By contrast, this Article demonstrates that the intersection of racial and religious identities has meaningfully influenced legal and political efforts to achieve equality.
   Drawing from extensive archival research, this Article unearths forgotten yet formative connections between racial and religious antidiscrimination efforts, at the local through federal levels, from the 1930s through the 1950s. To examine these links, this account centers on the Domestic Relations Court of the City of New York, an unusually influential and high-profile trial court. In the 1930s, the Domestic Relations Court welcomed the most diverse bench ever assembled in the United States by that time (including women and men; blacks and whites; and Protestants, Catholics, and Jews), a development celebrated as bolstering American democracy and countering Nazi bigotry abroad. Several judges held leadership positions in the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Jewish Congress, pathbreaking civil rights organizations with legal arms headquartered in New York City.
   The city's family court served as a testing ground for identity-related legal arguments that later rose to the national level because of its judges' views and the fact that it merged two antidiscrimination focal points: public institutions' treatment of children and the application of fair employment practices. Longstanding policies required the court to match probation officers to juvenile delinquents by race and religion, an approach one prominent commenter argued should be eliminated in order to promote "racial and religious democracy." By the 1940s, a coalition of black and Jewish judges regarded both types of identity matching as unlawful segregation. These judges successfully fought against their white Christian colleagues to end race matching, but their challenge to religion matching proved more difficult, both legally and politically. While the opponents of religion matching perceived the practice to be discriminatory and a violation of the separation of church and state, its supporters saw it as a lawful and beneficial protection for religious identity.
   Foreshadowing, connecting, and continuing through canonical Supreme Court Establishment Clause and civil rights cases-such as McCollum v. Board of Education and Brown v. Board of Education-the family court judges and their allies both anticipated and influenced doctrine and norms that remain with us today. This history complicates and raises important questions about ongoing issues ranging from the significance of judges' racial and religious backgrounds to the scope of religious groups' involvement in child welfare services and penal contexts. This Article also calls for additional studies that free racial civil rights and First Amendment religion scholarship from their current silos in order to better understand the concurrent development of these crucial and contested areas of law.

AB  - The 2007-2008 French National Travel Survey (FNTS) included questions about the trip experience for a random subsample of the respondents' daily travel, offering a rare opportunity to examine a national profile of attitudes toward travel. This study analyzes the self-reported (mental and/or physical) fatigue associated with the selected trip, and its (un)pleasantness. Only 8 % of trips were tiring, and fewer than 4 % were unpleasant, indicating that travel is by no means universally distasteful. We present a bivariate probit model of the mental and physical fatigue associated with the trip, and binary logit models of whether the trip was pleasant (yes/no) or unpleasant (yes/no). For the most part, socioeconomic variables and indicators of trip length, distance, purpose, and mode have logical relationships to fatigue and pleasantness. However, 11 variables out of 31 common to both sets of models have impacts on fatigue that are opposite to those on un/pleasantness, pointing to conditions under which a trip can be fatiguing but pleasant, or conversely. Accordingly, a key contribution of the research is to demonstrate the value of jointly considering both constructs in order to more comprehensively capture the overall attitudes toward the travelling activity. It is also of interest that activities conducted during the trip appear in both sets of models. In particular, the results suggest that although listening to the radio/music decreases the tendency to rate the trip as mentally fatiguing, it tends to be seen as ameliorating the disutility of a tedious trip more than increasing the pleasantness of the trip. Among the policy-relevant findings, we note the especially negative attitudes towards multimodal trips and trips mainly involving driving cars.

AB  - Background: Health is an important aspect of individuals' lives as they age. The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of sociodemographic factors, diagnosed chronic health conditions, and current depression with attitudes to aging in midlife.
   Methods: A cross-sectional baseline analysis was conducted on the first 300 participants from the Canterbury Health, Ageing and Life Course study in New Zealand, a stratified randomized community longitudinal study of adults recruited between 49 and 51 years. Attitudes were measured using the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ) and analyzed with a range of prevalent diagnosed chronic conditions, current depression, and sociodemographic variables.
   Results: Individuals perceived their physical aging more negatively after a diagnosis of hypertension, arthritis or asthma. Diagnosed lifetime depression and anxiety, and current depression, showed strong relationships with attitudes to aging across domains. After controlling for sociodemographic factors and current depression, individuals with diagnosed hypertension, arthritis, asthma, lifetime depression or anxiety continued to report significantly more negative attitudes to aging. Current depression showed the strongest associations with attitudes to aging and mediated relationships of health on attitudes to aging.
   Conclusions: Physical and mental health are related to attitudes to aging. Most chronic conditions examined are significantly associated with attitudes toward aging in the physical change domain. Diagnosed lifetime depression and anxiety, and current depression, are negatively related across attitudinal domains. Individuals can feel positive about aging while experiencing poorer health, but this is more difficult in the presence of low mood.

AB  - Generalized real estate market value was evaluated by the Surveying and Mapping Authority of the Republic of Slovenia in 2010. Evaluations were made for all real estate in Slovenia and communicated to the real estate owners; this caused much controversy Later, owners corrected or changed 1,153,909 pieces of real estate data. The distrust of generalized real estate market value was intensified by the media's negative attitude towards it, expressed in the majority of articles. When the period for making changes and corrigenda expired, an impression was established of a satisfactory and precise valuation of real estate. Even the banks started using generalized real estate market value as referential information in smaller real estate transactions for the banks' mortgage lending needs. Nevertheless, the professional public has expressed concerns about the appropriateness of using generalized market value for purposes other than imposing taxes, since some specific characteristics of real estate (e.g. the view) are ignored. Furthermore, the information about generalized market value is conveyed with a time delay - it can thus be not only obsolete but also misleading in unstable market conditions.
   This article discusses perceptions of generalized market value. It is based on research that was conducted among professionals and the general public in Slovenia. The results show that professionals and the general public have adopted generalized market value relatively well. Furthermore, 60% of the professional public thinks that generalized market value could also be used for other purposes (not only for imposing taxes).

AB  - Media portrayals of sex offenders are often negative, suggesting that public attitudes share a one-dimensional portrait. But past scholarship has regularly relied on a single newspaper or combined national-regional newspapers when investigating the media framing of sex offenders, which has possibly masked the disparate discourse of sex crimes across geographies and outlets. Our qualitative content analysis of sex crime depictions in articles published between 2012-2016 from six daily newspaper outlets of major metropolitan areas demonstrates that the media framing of sex offenders is varied and multidimensional. Our analysis indicates four salient sex offender frames: the monstrous sex offender, the psychotic sex offender, the sex offender versus the victim, and the humanized sex offender. Each frame is constructed by distinctive scripts, or a sequence of events and actions to describe sex offenders and their offenses. As parts of the interpretative repertoire, sex offender frames and scripts are connected to specific policy initiatives from a conservative to a progressive orientation.

AB  - Despite reported effectiveness, weight loss surgery (WLS) still remains one of the least preferred options for outpatient providers, especially in Germany. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of stigma and knowledge on recommendation of WLS and referral to a surgeon by general practitioners (GPs) and internists.
   The sample consists of 201 GPs and internists from Germany. The questionnaire included questions on the perceived effectiveness of WLS, the frequency of recommendations of WLS, and the frequency of referral to WLS. Stigma, as well as knowledge was also assessed in this context. Linear and logistic regression models were conducted. A mediation analysis was carried out within post hoc analysis.
   Knowledge (b = 0.258, p < 0.001) and stigma towards surgery (b = -0.129, p = 0.013) were related to the frequency of recommendation of WLS. Additionally, respondents, who were more likely to express negative attitudes towards WLS, were less likely to recommend WLS and thus refer patients to WLS (b = -0.107, p < 0.05). Furthermore, respondents with more expertise on WLS were more likely to recommend and thus refer patients to WLS (b = 0.026, p < 0.05).
   This study showed that stigma plays a role when it comes to defining treatment pathways for patients with obesity. The question remains how this might influence the patients and their decision regarding their treatment selection. Interventions are required to make treatment decisions by physicians or patients independent of social pressure due to stigma.

AB  - Guided by the attribution theory and sensation seeking (SS), this study found that a news article featuring an athlete celebrity endorser's drug scandal resulting from a controllable cause (e.g., taking performance-enhancing substance) generated stronger punitive opinions, stronger attribution of the scandal to the athlete, and lower sympathy for the athlete. When a news article presented the drug scandal as due to an uncontrollable cause (e.g., taking a medication to relieve a health problem), low sensation seekers had more negative attitudes and were more in favor of punishment than high sensation seekers. Attributions and sympathy were found to be mediators of the interaction effects of controllable versus uncontrollable messages and SS on punitive opinions. This study contributes to research on the attribution theory and SS in the sports communication context and provides practical implications for sports marketers and public relations professionals.

AB  - Background Twenty miles per hour (20mph) speed limits (equivalent to roughly 30kmh) have become part of public health policies to reduce urban road collisions and casualties, especially in Western countries. Public opinion plays a crucial role in opposition to and acceptance of policies that are advocated for improving public health. Twenty miles per hour speed limit policies were implemented in Edinburgh and Belfast from 2016 to 2018. In this paper, we extract public opinion and sentiments expressed about the new 20mph speed limits in those cities using publicly available Twitter data. Methods We analysed public sentiments from Twitter data and classified the public comments in plain English into the categories 'positive', 'neutral', and 'negative'. We also explored the frequency and sources of the tweets. Results The total volume of tweets was higher for Edinburgh than for Belfast, but the volume of tweets followed a similar pattern, peaking around 2016, which is when the schemes were implemented. Overall, the tone of the tweets was positive or neutral towards the implementation of the speed limit policies. This finding was surprising as there is a perception among policymakers that there would have been public backlash against these sorts of policy changes. The commonly used hashtags focused largely on road safety and other potential benefits, for example to air pollution. Conclusions Overall, public attitudes towards the policies were positive, thus policymakers should be less anxious about potential public backlash when considering the scale-up of 20mph speed restrictions.

TI  - Framing Russia in the Estonian, German, and Bulgarian Online Media: Coverage of Two Concrete Events
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
LA  - English
KW  - Social constructionism
KW  - news portal
KW  - journalism
AB  - The article provides a short theoretical discussion of framing in news and its role in the construction of reality. They present their approach to frame analysis by showcasing the coverage of two concrete events (the explosion in Arkhangelsk Oblast on August 8, 2019; the Eastern Economic Forum, that took place in Vladivostok on 4-6 September 2019) in Russia by the Estonian, German, and Bulgarian online media, with an emphasis on the Estonian news portals. The analysis rests on the assumption that individual members of society base their actions on the meanings that different events have to them; thus, an analysis of media constructions can explain people's attitudes to specific social phenomena. Journalists play a crucial role in the formation of public attitudes towards the events that take place outside the country borders.
   Journalistic framing is based on the choices journalists make guided by their professional standards. It is demonstrated that the journalists working for the news portals under discussion generally use a rather narrow scope of frames in picturing Russia. On the one hand, these frames indicate limited access to information, while on the other hand, the use of frames by the journalists indicates their intention to attract the readership's attention, the need to present the reality in a simplified and easily understandable form, etc.
   The authors concluded that their findings indicate certain trends in framing Russia in the traditional EU online media, and argue for the necessity to pay more attention to the selection of information in online media newsrooms.

AB  - Objective: The global health crisis in the form of COVID-19 has forced people to shift their routine activities into a remote environment with the help of technology. The outbreak of the COVID-19 has caused several organizations to be shut down and forced them to initiate work from home employing technology. Now more than ever, it's important for people and institutions to understand the impact of excessive use of mobile phone technology and electronic gadgets on human health, cognition, and behavior. It is important to understand their perspective and how individuals are coping with this challenge in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. The investigation is an effort to answer the research question: whether dependency on technology during lockdown has more effects on human health in comparison to normal times.
   Methods: The study included participants from India (n = 122). A questionnaire was framed and the mode of conducting the survey chosen was online to maintain social distancing during the time of the Pandemic. The gathered data was statistically analysed employing RStudio and multiple regression techniques.
   Results: The statistical analysis confirms that lockdown scenarios have led to an increase in the usage of mobile phone technology which has been confirmed by around 90% of participants. Moreover, 95% of the participants perceive an increased risk of developing certain health problems due to excessive usage of mobile phones and technology. It has been evaluated that participants under the age group 15-30 years are highly affected (45.9%) during lockdown due to excessive dependence on technology. And, amongst different professions, participants involved in online teaching-learning are the most affected (42.6%).
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that dependency on technology during lockdown has more health effects as compared to normal times. So, it is suggested that as more waves of pandemics are being predicted, strategies should be planned to decrease the psychological and physiological effects of the overuse of technology during lockdown due to pandemics. As the lockdown situation unfolds, people and organization functioning styles should be rolled back to the limited dependency on technology.

AB  - This study examines to what extent study design decisions influence the perceived efficacy of consensus messaging, using medicinal cannabis as the context. We find that researchers' decisions about study design matter. A modified Solomon Group Design was used in which participants were either assigned to a group that had a pretest (within-subjects design) or a posttest only group (between-subjects design). Furthermore, participants were exposed to one of three messages-one of two consensus messages or a control message-attributed to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. A consensus message describing a percent (97%) of agreeing scientists was more effective at shifting public attitudes than a consensus message citing substantial evidence, but this was only true in the between-subject comparisons. Participants tested before and after exposure to a message demonstrated pre-sensitization effects that undermined the goals of the messages. Our results identify these nuances to the effectiveness of scientific consensus messaging, while serving to reinforce the importance of study design.

AB  - This article examines why an aboveground pink economy has emerged in mainland China, where equal rights for gay people are repressed and public attitudes toward homosexuality are overwhelmingly negative. Drawing on interviews, supplemented with a minimal amount of media data, this article demonstrates that in China there was a group of gay people wishing to fulfill needs mainstream businesses disregard and that such consumer needs necessitate China's pink sector. More importantly, the state set the stage for the nascent sector to emerge: Government policies triggered a surge in funding resources and technology infrastructure upgrades that laid the material foundations for pink entrepreneurship. Despite being born in an institutional void, pink ventures employed legitimizing strategies to hedge against risk and uncertainty, thereby consolidating this new market. China's pink economy developed independently of the influence of the gay movement and even expanded, as never before, at the low ebb of the movement. This research gives credence to the notion that an aboveground pink economy could precede political rights but, unlike American scholarship, questions a similar causal relationship between the two in the Chinese context.

AB  - This study examined White individuals' ability to recall non-White criminal perpetrators, specifically Middle Eastern-looking men, as portrayed in news stories. Considering social identity theory and the Arab/Muslim/Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype, White participants were expected to correctly identify White European-looking men and misidentify Middle Eastern-looking men as the perpetrators in news stories. A 2 (race/ethnicity of the perpetrator: White European- or Middle Eastern-looking) x 2 (story type: violent or nonviolent) experiment revealed that correct recall of the perpetrator for Middle Eastern-looking men was lower than that of White European-looking men. However, White individuals were not significantly more likely to incorrectly recall Middle Eastern-looking men than White European-looking men as perpetrators. Regardless of condition, more negative attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims predicted the incorrect recall of both Middle Eastern- and White European-looking men as perpetrators. These results are explained in light of their contradiction of existing theory. Also, a new measure of attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims is recommended.

AB  - In times of crisis, citizens' support for democracy can depend on how well they think their democracy can address that crisis compared to authoritarian alternatives. Mexico is in the midst of just such a crisis, as its war on drug trafficking organisations has brought an unprecedented rise in violence and, in some areas, posed a direct challenge to the state's capacity to govern. At the same time, its subnational political landscape ranges from vibrant, multi-party states to those with continued connections to a dominant one-party past. We leverage these variations in subnational political context and levels of drug-related violence to examine how the subnational political context mediates the relationship between a crisis and support for non-democratic alternatives. When faced with a violent shock to the system, public attitudes towards democracy depend in part on one's experiences with non-democratic alternatives and whether these authoritarian options appear to solve the crisis at hand more effectively.

AB  - Background In Germany, two events regarding organ donation in 2012 happened: media reported about allocation scandals and regulations concerning regular public information were implemented. Public mistrust as a result of the scandals was repeatedly utilized to explain the current decrease in donation rates.
   Methods To test for public attitudes towards organ donation, a comprehensive survey with 55 sets of closed questions was conducted twice (2008/09 and 2014/15) with students of medicine and economics (total n = 1403) at the University of Gottingen. Statistical analysis involved a multivariate regression using R 3.2 and focused on potential pre/post-shifts in willingness and on social or attitudinal factors linked with reluctance to donate.
   Results The survey revealed that donation willingness increased (58-75%); in 2014 twice as many held a donor card (24-52%). The majority in both periods agreed that there is a problem of fair allocation (64-74%). Only a small minority considered transplantation well regulated pre-(15%) and post-scandal (11%; p < 0.05 sig.). Analysis of attitudes for reluctance identified non-acceptance of the brain death criterion and sharing a holistic conception of the body linking the human body to personal identity.
   Conclusions Reluctance to donate seems to be linked to deeper cultural attitudes.

AB  - Successful community reentry and the criminological impact of incarceration may depend in part on the attitudes (and consequent reactions) that prisoners encounter after release. Theories of social stigma suggest that such attitudes depend, in turn, on the levels of familiarity with the stigmatized group (the normalization thesis) as well as on the credibility and trust they accord to sanctioning agents (the legitimation thesis). To assess these two hypotheses, we present the first multivariate analysis of public attitudes toward ex-offenders. Data from a four-state, random-digit telephone survey of more than 2,000 individuals indicate that, net of controls, personal familiarity with ex-offenders may soften attitudes, whereas confidence in the courts may harden them. As expected, non-Hispanic Whites, conservatives, and southern residents hold more negative views of ex-offenders. Our findings lend indirect support to concerns that incarceration is becoming "normalized", and we suggest strategies for reducing the stigma of incarceration.

AB  - Digitally tampered images or fake images when propagated across the Web and social media, have the power to mislead, emotionally distress and influence public attitudes and behavior. Copy-Move tampering is one of the most commonly used attacks for damaging the semantics of an image. Keypoint-based methodologies are one of the effective ways of identifying a copy-move attack on an image. Existing key-point based methodologies fails to obtain a sufficient number of points on the small-smooth tampered region. Thus, for obtaining a good number of features this paper presents Hybrid Feature Detection (HFD) methodology employing Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor. Further, hierarchical clustering optimization and an improved mismatch elimination model is presented for detecting and demarking tampered segments. Experiments are conducted on standard datasets such as Dataset (D0, D1-2 and D3), GRIP, MICC-F600 and MICC-F8Multi. Better results are achieved from the proposed HFD methodology when compared with existing state-of-art tampering detection methodologies in terms of Recall, F1-score, Precision and False Positive Rate (FPR).

AB  - Research suggests that modernization is an important driver of liberalization in the field of gay and lesbian rights. Surprisingly, it has often been assumed-but not empirically examined-that a culture of tolerance mediates the relationship between socioeconomic modernization and liberal legislation. This article closes this gap by analyzing the seventy-three countries that took part in the fifth and sixth waves of the World Values Survey. As government responsiveness to public attitudes is structurally enforced by means of electoral accountability in democracies, but not in autocracies, we, in addition, distinguish between these regime types in an analysis of moderated mediation. We show that tolerant attitudes toward homosexuals do, indeed, mediate the influence of modernization on gay and lesbian rights policies in democracies, but not in autocracies. The result is confirmed by extensive robustness checks, including an instrumental variables approach to account for a potential reverse causality between tolerance and rights. The study does not only underline the relevance of cultural aspects of modernization, but also points to the crucial importance of regime type for a translation of public opinion into policy.

AB  - Despite the accumulating evidence on the positive and negative outcomes of Facebook use, how people perceive themselves to be subject to these outcomes as well as the consequences and mechanisms of these perceptions are underexplored. According to optimistic bias, Facebook users may perceive that bad things are more likely to happen to others than to themselves, while good things are more likely to happen to them than to others. The findings from an online survey among Facebook users indicate that the negative psychological and social outcomes of using Facebook were perceived to be more likely to happen to other Facebook users than to themselves, p<0.001. These self-other discrepant perceptions toward negative social events (e.g., Facebook cyberbullying and scams) significantly mediated one's willingness to support Internet regulation, Sobel z=2.49, p=0.01. For positive outcomes of Facebook use, the direction of optimistic bias was reversed, t(235) = -5.52, p<0.01, indicating that people minimized the likelihoods of experiencing positive events from Facebook while assessing that other Facebook users are prone to encounter those positive events. This reversal pattern emerged among those with negative attitudes toward, and low involvement with, Facebook. These findings demonstrate important and novel self-other discrepant perceptions concerning the risks and benefits of Facebook use.

AB  - Is bad economic news a self-fulfilling prophecy? This paper examines the local employment effects of exposure to pessimistic economic news. By combining detailed data on newspaper subscriptions with a tabulation of negative newspaper stories, the flow of such news across the United States during the 2008 recession is reconstructed at county and quarterly levels. The resulting data set is used to estimate the causal impact of such news on unemployment, hiring, and separation rates. Exposure to pessimistic news is found to suppress hiring and total employment during the early stages of the recession by up to 40% compared to prerecession levels; such news can account for some 7% of the total reduction in employment between 2007 and 2010. Content analysis of the articles in question rules out the possibility that this relationship is driven by reverse causation, that is, newspapers merely reporting poor economic performance. Further analysis of Google search data suggests that the effect is mediated by changes in public attitude caused by exposure to negative news. These findings imply that labor market outcomes can differ due to arbitrary differences in the dispersal of economic information. Bearings on economic theory, including the notions of "sunspots" and "animal spirits," are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates media effects on stereotypic attitudes toward immigrants in a political campaign that dealt with the naturalization of immigrants. By combining a content analysis of the campaign coverage with a 2-wave panel survey, the study found that negative news portrayals of immigrants increased stereotypic attitudes in the public in the course of the campaign. Additionally, the frequent exposure to positive news portrayals of immigrants reduced the activation of negative outgroup attitudes. However, these findings are contingent on people's issue-specific knowledge. Only people with low to moderate knowledge were influenced by negative and positive news stories about immigrants in the campaign. Well-informed people were resistant to the effects of positive and news portrayals of immigrants.

AB  - This article uses visitor research to explore public attitudes to the British Museum and perceptions of its relationship to the history of the British Empire. Firstly, it provides an analysis of direct messages received by the Museum over a twelve month period via letters, emails and comments on social media platforms. Secondly, it draws on short interviews undertaken with visitors upon arrival at the Museum before entry. Thirdly, it draws on formative and summative evaluation for two recent British Museum special exhibitions that explicitly addressed imperial and colonial histories, ?Indigenous Australia: Enduring Civilization? (23 April ? 2 August 2015) and South Africa: The Art of a Nation? (27 October 2016?26 February 2017). Finally, it draws on focus groups (April 2018) held to explore perceptions of the Museum held by culturally active non-visitors. Collectively this insight highlights the Museum?s vast potential to inform contemporary debates about empire by developing new approaches to displaying and interpreting its collection.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 forced the implementation of restrictive measures in Spain, such as lockdown, home confinement, social distancing, and isolation. It is necessary to study whether limited access to basic services and decreased family and social support could have deleterious effects on cognition, quality of life, and mental health in vulnerable older people.
   Objective: This study aims to explore the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on cognition in older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia as the main outcome and the quality of life, perceived health status, and depression as secondary outcomes and to analyze the association of living alone and a change in living arrangements with those outcomes and other variables related with the use of technology and health services. Likewise, this study aims to analyze the association of high and low technophilia with those variables, to explore the access and use of health care and social support services, and, finally, to explore the informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses of information and communications technologies (ICTs) during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Methods: This cohort study was conducted in Malaga (Spain). In total, 151 participants with mild cognitive impairment or mild dementia, from the SMART4MD (n=75, 49.7%) and TV-AssistDem (n=76, 50.3%) randomized clinical trials, were interviewed by telephone between May 11 and June 26, 2020. All participants had undergone 1-3 assessments (in 6-month intervals) on cognition, quality of life, and mood prior to the COVID-19 breakout.
   Results: The outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, and mood of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Perceived stress was reported as moderate during the outbreak. After correction for multiple comparisons, living alone, a change in living arrangements, and technophilia were not associated with negative mental health outcomes. However, being alone was nominally associated with self-perceived fear and depression, and higher technophilia with better quality of life, less boredom, perceived stress and depression, and also less calmness. Overall, health care and social support service access and utilization were high. The most used ICTs during the COVID-19 outbreak were the television for informative, cognitive, and entertainment-related uses and the smartphone for socialization.
   Conclusions: Our findings show that the first months of the outbreak did not significantly impact the cognition, quality of life, perceived health status, and depression of our study population when making comparisons with baseline assessments prior to the outbreak. Living alone and low technophilia require further research to establish whether they are risk factors of mental health problems during lockdowns in vulnerable populations. Moreover, although ICTs have proven to be useful for informative-, cognitive-, entertainment-, and socialization-related uses during the pandemic, more evidence is needed to support these interventions.

AB  - Background: During the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), internet hospitals in China were engaged with epidemic prevention and control, offering epidemic-related online services and medical support to the public.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to explore the role of internet hospitals during the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreak in China.
   Methods: Online epidemic-related consultations from multicenter internet hospitals in China during the COVID-19 epidemic were collected. The counselees were described and classified into seven type groups. Symptoms were recorded and compared with reported patients with COVID-19. Hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were detected within each counselees' group to evaluate the social panic of the epidemic along with the consequent medical-seeking behaviors. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for an offline visit were compared. Risk factors affecting the counselees' tendency of hypochondriacal suspicion and offline visit motivation were explored by logistic regression models. The epidemic prevention and control measures based on internet hospitals were listed, and the corresponding effects were discussed.
   Results: A total of 4913 consultations were enrolled for analysis with the median age of the counselees at 28 years (IQR 22-33 years). There were 104 (2.12%) healthy counselees, 147 (2.99%) hypochondriacal counselees, 34 (0.69%) exposed counselees, 853 (17.36%) mildly suspicious counselees, 42 (0.85%) moderately suspicious counselees, 3550 (72.26%) highly suspicious counselees, and 183 (3.72%) severely suspicious counselees. A total of 94.20% (n=4628) of counselees had epidemic-related symptoms with a distribution similar to those of COVID-19. The hypochondriacal suspicion (n=2167, 44.11%) was common. The counselees' motivation and the doctors' recommendation for offline visits were inconsistent (P<.001) with a Cohen kappa score of 0.039, indicating improper medical-seeking behaviors. Adult counselees (odds ratio [OR]=1.816, P<.001) with epidemiological exposure (OR 7.568, P<.001), shortness of breath (OR 1.440, P=.001), diarrhea (OR 1.272, P=.04), and unrelated symptoms (OR 1.509, P<.001) were more likely to have hypochondriacal suspicion. Counselees with severe illnesses (OR 2.303, P<.001), fever (OR 1.660, P<.001), epidemiological exposure history (OR 1.440, P=.01), and hypochondriacal suspicion (OR 4.826, P<.001) were more likely to attempt an offline visit. Reattending counselees (OR 0.545, P=.002) were less motivated to go to the offline clinic.
   Conclusions: Internet hospitals can serve different types of epidemic counselees, offer essential medical supports to the public during the COVID-19 outbreak, reduce the social panic, promote social distancing, enhance the public's ability of self-protection, correct improper medical-seeking behaviors, reduce the chance of nosocomial cross-infection, and facilitate epidemiological screening, thus, playing an important role on preventing and controlling COVID-19.

AB  - Posting countermessages is commonly used as a strategy to combat false rumors spreading online. The effectiveness of countermessage exposure has been investigated in past studies, but little is known about its repercussions. The aim of this study was to contribute to the understanding of rumor control by investigating the factors impacting the effectiveness of countermessage exposure. A total of 164 participants were asked to judge the believability of rumor and factual tweets before and after countermessage exposure in a web-based experiment. Two forms of countermessage were compared to examine the effects of countermessages on belief change in the target tweets. One was subjective countermessages based on personal experiences, and the other was objective countermessages based on evidence. The results showed that objective countermessages reduced belief in rumor tweets, whereas subjective countermessages strengthened false beliefs. In addition, the half of the participants who were exposed to objective countermessages randomly mixed with subjective countermessages formed negative attitudes not only toward the rumor tweets but also toward the factual tweets. The results also showed gender differences in response to countermessage exposure; women tended to be more susceptible to countermessages and changed their beliefs regarding the target tweets negatively after the exposure. We discuss the practical implications of the results associated with the adverse effects of countermessage exposure.

AB  - A widespread public preference for harsher sentencing (punitiveness) has been documented in a range of national and international studies. The present study examines the relative predictive power of a set of factors most commonly linked with punitiveness. This study is based on the responses given in the largest Australian survey to date of public attitudes to punishment (N = 6005). A combined hierarchical multiple regression model comprising demographic variables, media usage variables, and crime salience variables accounted for a significant 30% of variance in scores for punitiveness. The three variables that emerged as the strongest predictors of punitive attitudes were: perceptions of crime levels; education; and reliance on tabloid/commercial media for news and information. The results have direct implications for how we understand the persistent public preference for punishment and what might be required to ameliorate or respond to that preference.

AB  - With global attention currently focused on the challenge of providing Education for All (UNESCO 2000), we must ensure that the language of teaching and learning remains a topic on the agenda towards making sure that the education being provided is effective. This is therefore a critical time to review medium of instruction debates, and to reassess what empirical evidence exists to guide policymaking that is both appropriate and achievable. Contributing to this endeavour, this paper argues for the approximate replication of two key studies. The first is Afolayan (1976), a widely-cited study conducted in Ife, Nigeria to test the effectiveness of teaching children in the mother tongue for six years of primary education. We argue that the frequency with which the success of this study is cited, without due attention paid to the details of its methodological procedure, may actually be detrimental to the success of other experiments, thus necessitating the careful replication of the original study. The second study is Siegel (1997b), one of the few studies that have been conducted to evaluate the impact of initial education in an English-based pidgin on the subsequent learning of English. We argue that there is an urgent need for replication of one of the few available studies of pidgins and creoles in education, given the prevalence of negative attitudes towards this category of languages.

AB  - Building on research from organizational sociology and the contact hypothesis, we incorporated community characteristics to examine how coworker citizenship dissimilarity influences employees' attitudes towards immigrants. We also proposed that the nature of this relationship would depend on national pride. Results from a national survey (N = 559) indicated living with more immigrants in one's neighborhood corresponded in heightened citizenship dissimilarity at the workplace. It, in turn, corresponded in employees holding more favorable views of immigrants. This effect was the most pronounced for people with high levels of national pride because of the presumably increased opportunities to dispel their previously held negative stereotypes about out-group members.

AB  - This research investigates situations in which frontline employees deliberately restrict customers' access to touch products on display (active interpersonal haptic blocking), and how this understudied form of sensory blocking may increase customers' downstream purchasing. While previous research examines the benefits of increased product touch, we temporarily block touch for specific products in display areas and then investigate the subsequent impact on customer behavior. Through four studies, including a retail field experiment, we find that when an employee asks a customer not to touch a product on display, this initiates a serial mediation process which: (1) engenders feelings of psychological reactance that result in (2) increased compensatory touching of subsequently encountered products to counterbalance a loss of sensory freedom, and (3) increased spending and purchasing once the customer leaves the reactance-inducing encounter. Effects are moderated by socioeconomic status (SES) and need for touch (NFT) whereby psychological reactance was significantly stronger for high SES customers with a moderate or high NFT when actively blocked. Results also demonstrate that active interpersonal haptic blocking does not result in more negative attitudes toward retailers, thus retailers might consider implementing this counterintuitive practice to encourage downstream sales.

AB  - The role of rural women's in agricultural activities is substantial in Pakistan in general and in the Punjab province in particular. Their contribution in the agriculture and livestock is underestimated. In this milieu, this study was planned with the objective to determine the problems faced by rural women during agricultural activities. District Nankana Sahib was selected as case study. Multistage sampling technique was used for this study. At the first stage, out of three Tehsils, two Tehsils were selected randomly. Then from two selected Tehsils, six villages were selected. Finally at the third stage, 120 respondents (rural women) were selected by using convenient sampling. The data thus collected were analyzed and interpreted by using appropriate statistical package to draw the conclusions. The results revealed that that majority of the working women were participating in diverse agricultural activities including sowing, harvesting and picking. Majority of the working women were doing work to increase their family income but they were facing many problems in looking after their children and household chores. Negative attitude of the landlord is found to be one of the main problems. It is suggested that negative stereotype image of working women in rural areas should be changed with the help of mass media.

AB  - Scientists and laypeople agree on high ability as a defining feature of giftedness. Yet their views on gifted people's socioemotional characteristics diverge. Most studies find the gifted to be similar or slightly superior to average-ability persons in these domains ("harmony hypothesis"). However, subjective conceptions and media representations, most of which have focused on gifted children and youth, stress the socioemotional downsides of giftedness ("disharmony hypothesis"), affecting highly able individuals and those around them, thus hampering individual development. To date, most studies on gifted stereotypes have examined selective samples, mostly teachers. The present study is the first to provide representative data on conceptions of gifted individuals in general. A brief survey of 1029 German adults assessed quality and prevalence of stereotypes about gifted individuals, without an explicit focus on children and/or adolescents. Latent class analysis (LCA) revealed two conceptions of giftedness, with twice as many "disharmonious" than "harmonious" raters. Male gender, single parenthood, unemployment, higher income or negative attitudes toward the gifted predicted disharmonious ratings. However, effects were small, suggesting future studies look deeper into the processes of stereotype formation and maintenance.

AB  - Involving male partners of pregnant women accessing PMTCT programs has the potential to improve health outcomes for women and children. This study explored community members' (men and women) and healthcare workers' perceptions of male involvement in the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in Khayelitsha, South Africa. Two focus group discussions were held with 25 men of unknown HIV status and one focus group discussion held with 12 HIV-positive women in the community. In depth interviews were conducted with four HIV-positive couples and five service providers purposely sampled from the community and a health facility, respectively. Both men and women interviewed in this study were receptive towards male involvement in PMTCT. However, men were reluctant to engage with health services due to stigma and negative attitudes from nurses. This study also found HIV testing, disclosure and direct health worker engagement with men increases male involvement in PMTCT. Using men in the media and community to reach out to fellow men with prevention messages tailored to suit specific audiences may reduce perceptions of antenatal care as being a woman's domain.

AB  - Background Although iodine nutrition status is improving globally, the progress is not uniform throughout the world due to several factors. Among these, poor knowledge, negative attitude and improper practice of iodized salt are the main risk factors for poor iodine nutrition in Ethiopia. This study was aimed to assess the effect of nutrition education intervention on knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of iodine deficiency and iodized salt utilization. Methods A cluster randomized controlled trial was carried out among 652 women of reproductive age group in southwest Ethiopia. A total of 24 clusters were selected and randomized in to an intervention and control villages. Women in the intervention village received iodine nutrition related education for 6 months; while those in the control village did not receive any education. Baseline and endline data were collected from both groups. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) was used to determine the effect of intervention. Results A total of 647 (99.2%) participants were successfully involved in the study. In the intervention group the median attendance was 10 out of 12 sessions. Women in the intervention group had shown statistically significant change in knowledge, attitude and practice scores as compared to control one. In multivariable GEE linear model, after adjusting for other background characteristics, the mean difference (95% CI) scores were 8.81 (8.46, 9.16) for knowledge, 3.35 (3.17, 3.54) for attitude and 2.90 (2.74, 3.05) for practice in the intervention arm. Conclusions Well designed and community-based iodine nutrition education is an effective strategy to improve the KAP of iodine deficiency disorders and iodized salt utilization.

AB  - The introduction of sustainable practices is consideted a win-win strategy for low-income countries because of its potential to simultaneously improve food security and address environmental issues. Despite the numerous studies that focus on the adoption of technological innovations, little work has been done on the socio-psychological behaviour of farmers with regard to sustainable practices. This study investigates smallholder farmers' intentions towards two practices: minimum tillage and row planting. The decomposed theory of planned behaviour is used as a theoretical framework to analyse the intentions. The findings reveal that attitudes and normative issues positively explain farmers' intentions to adopt both practices. Perceived control also has a positive significant effect on the intention to apply minimum tillage. When the intention is formed, farmers are expected to carry out their intention when opportunities arise. Moreover, perceived usefulness, social capital, and perceived ease of operation are also significant predictors of farmers' attitudes. Furthermore, social capital and training are factors that positively affect the normative issue, which in turn also positively mediates the relationship between training, social capital and intention. Finally, it is shown that neither the perceived resources nor information from the media significantly affect farmers' intentions. This paper thus confirms that social capital, personal efficacy, training and perceived usefulness play significant roles in the decision to adopt sustainable practices. In addition, willingness to adopt seems to be limited by negative attitudes and by weak normative issues. Therefore, to improve adoption of sustainable practices by smallholder farmers, attention should be given to socio-psychological issues. This could lead to improvements in farm productivity and enhance the livelihoods of smallholders. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Video games often contain sexist content that may be connected to negative consequences for female video game players, such as internalizing negative attitudes and beliefs about women. However, aspects of feminist identification may prevent such negative outcomes from occurring. The present study investigated the relationships among time spent playing video games, internalized misogyny, and the synthesis dimension of feminist identity, which is characterized by embracing the positive aspects of being a woman and incorporating feminine attributes into one's own unique personality. A total of 319 U.S. female video game players completed measures of media usage, internalized misogyny, and feminist identity. The authors tested a moderation model in which gaming predicted internalized misogyny and synthesis moderated this relationship. Gaming was positively associated with internalized misogyny at lower, but not higher, levels of synthesis. Thus, those who value the positive aspects of womanhood and have thoughtful and realistic perceptions of gender may be resistant to internalizing some harmful beliefs about women perpetuated in games. The present study provides evidence for the potential negative influence of cumulative video game exposure for some women and the protective effect of feminist identity synthesis. Counselors and activists should do work aimed at critically evaluating and challenging gendered messages in video games and affirming women's gender identities and feminine attributes. Game developers must consider the impact of their content on players and strive to create female characters that are agentic, complex, and competent. Conversely, gamers should avoid supporting games with depthless depictions of women.

AB  - Background: Mexico's local and national authorities initiated an intense public health response during the early stages of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic. In this study we analyzed the epidemiological patterns of the pandemic during April-December 2009 in Mexico and evaluated the impact of nonmedical interventions, school cycles, and demographic factors on influenza transmission.
   Methods and Findings: We used influenza surveillance data compiled by the Mexican Institute for Social Security, representing 40% of the population, to study patterns in influenza-like illness (ILIs) hospitalizations, deaths, and case-fatality rate by pandemic wave and geographical region. We also estimated the reproduction number (R) on the basis of the growth rate of daily cases, and used a transmission model to evaluate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies initiated during the spring pandemic wave. A total of 117,626 ILI cases were identified during April-December 2009, of which 30.6% were tested for influenza, and 23.3% were positive for the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic virus. A three-wave pandemic profile was identified, with an initial wave in April-May (Mexico City area), a second wave in June-July (southeastern states), and a geographically widespread third wave in August-December. The median age of laboratory confirmed ILI cases was similar to 18 years overall and increased to similar to 31 years during autumn (p<0.0001). The case-fatality ratio among ILI cases was 1.2% overall, and highest (5.5%) among people over 60 years. The regional R estimates were 1.8-2.1, 1.6-1.9, and 1.2-1.3 for the spring, summer, and fall waves, respectively. We estimate that the 18-day period of mandatory school closures and other social distancing measures implemented in the greater Mexico City area was associated with a 29%-37% reduction in influenza transmission in spring 2009. In addition, an increase in R was observed in late May and early June in the southeast states, after mandatory school suspension resumed and before summer vacation started. State-specific fall pandemic waves began 2-5 weeks after school reopened for the fall term, coinciding with an age shift in influenza cases.
   Conclusions: We documented three spatially heterogeneous waves of the 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic virus in Mexico, which were characterized by a relatively young age distribution of cases. Our study highlights the importance of school cycles on the transmission dynamics of this pandemic influenza strain and suggests that school closure and other mitigation measures could be useful to mitigate future influenza pandemics.

AB  - Communication for all hazards including widespread public health emergencies is a massive task. The crucial element is to reach and cover maximum people in a timely manner. This article is based on a systematic content analysis of videos on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on National Television by Indian Public Service Broadcaster and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A total of 36 videos were telecasted on National Television channel Doordarshan from 3 March to 21 April 2020 in between programme breaks.
   The article analyses the presentation characteristics of these videos with respect to timing, duration, language, characters, format and key message content of communication videos on COVID-19. The article deliberates about the manner in which the chronology of the communication messages synced with the external events of the trajectory of the pandemic and thereby information-need of the community in India. All the messages which evolved in these videos (real and animated) were built on each other and depicted an information hierarchy (e.g., washing hands to social distancing) which could be viewed as an empowering tool for the community.
   The videos were analysed based on the nine constructs of conceptual model of emergency risk communication given bySeeger et al. (2018). The key preventive messages in these videos focused on generating awareness, which was the fundamental necessity in view of the new type of pandemic like COVID-19. The summated scores show that 36 videos were appropriate up to 79 per cent times for the nine constructs, indicating the effectiveness of the messages in communicating the intended message as per the assessed construct. Limitations of the messages were primarily related to the inability to design communication messages with respect to specific understanding, needs and culture of the community.

TI  - The Reception of Immigrants and Refugees in Western Countries: The Challenges of Our Time
T2  - JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES
LA  - English
AB  - In a rapidly changing world, the challenges of migration, as well as its potential benefits, are hotly debated. Recent years have seen new challenges as a result of unprecedented levels of migration, instability following the Global Financial Crisis, economic and security concerns surrounding immigration, and negative portrayals of immigrants by some Western leaders. These developments make it all the more important to understand the psychological processes underpinning attitudes toward immigrants and refugees, support for particular immigration policies and responses to changing policies, the role of portrayals of immigrants in the media, and the consequences of immigration attitudes and policies. This special issue brings together researchers interested in the topic of immigration from a psychological perspective, with a focus on understanding the reception of immigrants and refugees in Western countries. In this introductory article, we outline the background to this special issue and briefly describe each article included.

AB  - Background: Associations between HIV-related stigma and reduced antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence are widely established, yet the mechanisms accounting for this relationship are underexplored. There has been less attention to HIV-related stigma and its associations with ART initiation and current ART use. We examined pathways from HIV-related stigma to ART initiation, current ART use, and ART adherence among women living with HIV in Canada.
   Methods: We used baseline survey data from a national cohort of women living with HIV in Canada (n = 1425). Structural equation modeling using weighted least squares estimation methods was conducted to test the direct effects of HIV-related stigma dimensions (personalized, negative self-image, and public attitudes) on ART initiation, current ART use, and 90% ART adherence, and indirect effects through depression and HIV disclosure concerns, adjusting for sociodemographic factors.
   Results: In the final model, the direct paths from personalized stigma to ART initiation (beta = -0.104, P < 0.05) and current ART use (beta = -0.142, P < 0.01), and negative self-image to ART initiation (beta = -0.113, P < 0.01) were significant, accounting for the mediation effects of depression and HIV disclosure concerns. Depression mediated the pathways from personalized stigma to ART adherence, and negative self-image to current ART use and ART adherence. Final model fit indices suggest that the model fit the data well [chi(2)(25) = 90.251, P < 0.001; comparative fit index = 0.945; root-mean-square error of approximation = 0.044].
   Conclusions: HIV-related stigma is associated with reduced likelihood of ART initiation and current ART use, and suboptimal ART adherence. To optimize the benefit of ART among women living with HIV, interventions should reduce HIV-related stigma and address depression.

AB  - Introduction: Substantial distribution of information, education, and communication related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the most cost-effective means to deliver desirable behavioral changes to stop/diminish the spread of the disease.
   Material and methods: In the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula. Collected data was processed with SPSS version 22.0 statistical software, and descriptive method of data analysis was used. A total of 363 participants were included from March to June 2020, using stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique.
   Results: The findings revealed that, major source of information used by university students on HIV/AIDS was radio (52.3%), followed by television (47.1%). From the study subjects, 60.3%, 39.4%, and 31.9% of them labeled currently available information sources as group specific, fear arousing, and boring, respectively. Students from College of Medicine and Health Sciences showed a better understanding of the virus. Moreover, a small number of the study subjects, i.e., 66 (18.2%), had a negative attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS.
   Conclusions: Most participants had fair knowledge about definition, transmission, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. However, knowledge by itself could not guarantee a change in behavior, as students were involved in different risky activities. In nearly all the cases, academic years of the participants and their field of study had an influence on the magnitude of behavioral changes delivered.

AB  - To ascertain why children with end-stage retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) become blind, and to explore the impact of blindness on families.
   Mixed quantitative and qualitative methods.
   Tertiary-care eye hospital in India.
   Children with end-stage ROP and their carers.
   Cases presenting between June 2009 and July 2016 were identified from medical records and data extracted. Carers were contacted for missing information, if required. Data were analyzed to explore where failure had occurred in the process of screening and treatment. A subset of carers were selected for in-depth interviews to explore the impact of having a blind child. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and analyzed using a thematic framework.
   Parental perceptions.
   66 children were included: median age 4.3 y (range 3 mo-6 y), 58% boys. 74% were blind due to 'screening failure', which was associated with lower maternal education (P=0.03). Of the 17 case of treatment failure (24.6%), majority (12, 70%) had aggressive posterior ROP. A subset of carers of 18 children (50% boys) were interviewed, mostly mothers. Most reported impoverishment as a result of having a blind child, and many reported lack of access to special education, negative attitudes of others and concerns about the future.
   Screening for retinopathy of prematurity needs to be expanded and counselling improved. Access to special education and rehabilitation need to be improved.

AB  - This study examined whether attitudinal and emotional responses to broadcasts of images of terrorist events differ according to ethnic group (Jewish and Arab Israelis) and outgroup affiliation during an intense wave of terrorism that occurred in Israel during 2015. Participants were 118 Jewish and 110 Arab-Israelis adults randomly allocated to a terrorism or criminal violence television broadcast. State anxiety, state anger, stereotypes, and negative attitudes toward an adversary were examined prior and subsequent to the media exposure. Findings showed significant increases in anxiety, anger, stereotypes, and negative adversary perceptions in the terrorism exposure group compared to only anxiety increases in the criminal violence exposure. In the terrorism exposure group, Jewish participants showed greater increases in negative adversary perceptions of the Palestinians than Arab Israeli participants, but both groups showed similar significant increases in levels of anxiety and anger. Exposure to broadcasts of terrorism increased willingness to negotiate with the adversary among the Arab participants, but not among the Jewish participants. In the terrorism exposure group, both Jewish and Arab Israelis with high affiliation with the Palestinian cause showed less increases in stereotypes than those with low affiliation. Findings emphasize the role of ethnicity and outgroup affiliation in responses to media exposure to terrorism images.

AB  - Although new Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections have remained stable or decreased for most U.S. groups at risk for HIV, incidence among Latinx increased by 6% and among Latinx individuals, immigrants are disproportionately infected. One driver of these infections is low rates of HIV testing. While research shows the chilling effect that restrictive immigration laws can have on immigrants' health care utilization, few studies have examined the influence of perceived immigration context and healthcare utilization immigration law concerns on following a public health recommendation such as HIV testing. The purpose of the study is to test an exploratory model of immigration-related variables and their impact on U.S. Latinx immigrants' yearly HIV testing. U.S.-Latinx immigrants (N = 169) completed a cross-sectional survey assessing perceived enforcement of immigration laws, perceptions of law enforcement attitudes toward Latinx and immigrants, fear of deportation, concerns with the consequences of immigration laws for health care utilization, and yearly HIV testing. Path analysis findings indicated that perceived enforcement of immigration laws was related to perceived negative attitudes from law enforcement toward Latinx and immigrants which was associated with fear of deportation. Fear of deportation was associated with concerns with the implications of immigration laws for accessing publicly funded healthcare services and these concerns were negatively related to yearly HIV testing and mediated the association between fear of deportation and yearly HIV testing. Findings point to the need of developing and implementing individual- and policy-level interventions to increase HIV testing among Latinx immigrants in a restrictive immigration law environment.

AB  - Background Many women internalize negative attitudes regarding body shape and size because of the societal standards for women's ideal body shapes and sizes. Internalized weight stigma is related to poorer physical and psychological health. A growing body of research has documented the links between other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., HIV-stigma) and poor sleep quality; however, little research examines the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep or the mechanisms that explain this relationship. Internalized weight stigma may be associated with poor sleep through increases in psychological distress. This study hypothesized that the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep would be mediated by higher levels of depression and anxiety. Methods About 257 women were recruited via social media, word of mouth, and an undergraduate participant pool. Participants completed an online survey assessing various aspects of weight stigma and health through self-report questionnaires. Most women were non-Hispanic White (86.8%) and had a mean age of 31.40. Results The indirect effects of internalized weight stigma on poorer global sleep quality and daily disturbances through depression and anxiety were significant. In contrast, depressive symptoms but not anxiety explained the links between internalized weight stigma and perceived sleep quality and neither depressive symptoms nor anxiety explained the link between internalized weight stigma and sleep efficiency. Conclusions Internalized weight stigma is linked to poorer sleep quality, and these links may be explained by psychological well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which internalized weight stigma is associated with sleep quality can inform the psychological interventions employed.

AB  - Research suggests that plurisexual individuals face ongoing decisions about whether and how accurately to present their sexual orientation to others, in part because of stereotypes and negative attitudes specific to plurisexuality. This study tested a within-person model of theoretical predictors and outcomes of self-presentational accuracy in a sample of 165 cisgender plurisexual women. Participants completed online surveys to report on situations involving self-presentation decisions as they occurred over a 14-day period. Participants also completed nightly surveys assessing facets of well-being. Self-presentational accuracy varied substantially from day to day. Several contextual and relational factors, including acceptance and rejection cues, interaction partners' sexual orientation, and interpersonal closeness, predicted self-presentational accuracy, both directly and through the mediator of anticipated acceptance. Self-presentational accuracy predicted daily life satisfaction, positive affect, and negative affect through the mediator of social support. Finally, exploratory analyses underscored the relevance of goals related to authenticity, closeness, privacy, communication, educating others, and safety in self-presentation decisions. Discussion highlights the importance of context in identity management decisions among plurisexual women and the impact of these decisions on day-to-day well-being.

AB  - The rise of peer-to-peer platforms has represented one of the major economic and societal developments observed in the last decade. We investigated whether people engage in racial discrimination in the sharing economy, and how such discrimination might be explained and mitigated. Using a set of carefully controlled experiments (N = 1,599), including a pre-registered study on a nationally representative sample, we find causal evidence for racial discrimination. When an identical apartment is presented with a racial out-group (vs. in-group) host, people report more negative attitudes toward the apartment, lower intentions to rent it, and are 25% less likely to choose the apartment over a standard hotel room in an incentivized choice. Reduced self-congruence with apartments owned by out-group hosts mediates these effects. Left-leaning liberals rated the out-group host as more trustworthy than the in-group host in non-committing judgments and hypothetical choice, but showed the same in-group preference as right-leaning conservatives when making a real choice. Thus, people may overstate their moral and political aspirations when doing so is cost-free. However, even in incentivized choice, racial discrimination disappeared when the apartment was presented with an explicit trust cue, as a visible top-rating by other consumers (5/5 stars).

AB  - Aim To examine a mediated moderation of the effects of micro-break activity and psychological detachment on the relationship between job stress and work engagement among hospital nurses. Background Nursing burnout, compassion fatigue and job stress have been relatively constant issues in nursing for at least the past decade-and the pervasiveness of the COVID-19 pandemic is intensifying them, which may lead to new challenges to work engagement. Methods We tested our model using a time-lagged design to collect data from supervisor-subordinate dyads in seven public hospitals located in southern China, and 263 nurses and 58 head nurses in this survey. Confirmatory factor analysis, Pearson's correlation and hierarchical multiple regression were carried out. Results The results showed that the adverse impact of job stress on work engagement disappeared when nurses engaged in high levels of micro-break activity. Moreover, the moderating role of micro-break activity was mediated by psychological detachment. Conclusions Micro-break activity and psychological detachment play joint roles in helping nurses to cope with job stress. Implications for Nursing Management Nurse managers should change their negative attitude toward micro-break activity (if it exists) and help nurses find opportunities for detachment under high-pressure environment.

AB  - Objectives The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is regarded as the biggest global health crisis in recent decades. The changes in major life domains due to infection control strategies resemble the functional impairment consequential to emotional distress and place many people at greater risk of psychiatric conditions. Meanwhile, the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing have widely increased the usage of smartphone to receive COVID-19-related information in the past year. However, the excessive use of smartphones has deleterious consequences. The current study investigated general anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-induced anxiety, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSPU) severity.
   Methods Adults aged 18-75 years were recruited by stratified, probability sampling from a database representative of the population. Among 1080 Hong Kong Chinese (age 18-75 years), a cross-sectional web-based survey was conducted between July 23 and August 25, 2020 (the period of the third wave outbreak of COVID-19 in Hong Kong). Participants were assessed with the measures, including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7, and Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the associations among general anxiety symptoms, COVID19-induced anxiety, and severity of PSPU by the Amos 22.0 software.
   Results Using established cut-off scores, our results found that prevalence of at least moderate anxiety level in around 22% of participants. Using SEM, both general anxiety symptoms and COVID-19-induced anxiety were associated with PSPU severity. Moreover, COVID-19 anxiety partially mediated relations between predisposing general anxiety with PSPU severity.
   Conclusion This study provides initial data on the mental health status of people affected by COVID-19. It also investigated the relations between COVID-19-induced anxiety and PSPU severity as a coping mechanism.

AB  - Background: Self-esteem refers to a person's positive and negative attitudes towards the self, and metacognition is an upper system providing awareness and direction of events and mental functions. Coping refers to the specific and psychological efforts used to deal with stressful events or the negative effects of the agents of these. The aim of this study was to evaluate self-esteem, metacognition status and coping attitudes in patients with cancer, which is known to have severely destructive psychological effects.
   Materials and Methods: Fifty adult cancer patients who were followed up in the medical oncology clinic between July 2018 and June 2019 and 50 age- and gender-matched healthy controls as control group were included in this study. All the participants were applied with a sociodemographic data form, the Rosenberg self-esteem scale, the Metacognition Assessment Scale, and the Copying Orientation to Problems Experienced (COPE) inventory, and their results were compared between the groups.
   Results: The groups comprised 50% females with a median age of 58 (33-82) years. The values related to the degree of participation in discussions, problem-focused coping, active coping, planning, and state of emotional vulnerability were low in the cancer patient group compared to the control group (P < 0.005 for all). The sustaining of their self-image, feeling threatened in interpersonal relationships, and degree of daydreaming were higher, and in the metacognition tests, the positive beliefs related to anxiety, uncontrolled or dangerous negative thoughts, nonfunctional coping, religious coping, joking, reckless behavior, substance use, denial, and mental disengagement scores were higher (P < 0.05 for all).
   Conclusion: Self-esteem was lower in cancer patients and upper level cognitive functions and problem-focused coping were determined to be worse compared to healthy controls. In the light of these results, psychosocial support given to cancer patients in this respect could contribute to quality of life and social conformity.

AB  - The study examined factors that affect parental intention-to-vaccinate adolescent daughters with HPV vaccine in Mysore district, India. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1609 parents of adolescent girls attending schools in Mysore District between February 2010 and October 2011. A validated questionnaire was used to assess parental attitudes, beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer, HPV vaccine and vaccination in general. Structural equation modeling was used to estimate parameters and assess whether a model based on the integrative behavior theory would fit the current data. More than two-thirds (78.0%) of parents would accept vaccinating their daughters with HPV vaccine. Intention to HPV vaccination significantly increased with increase in the perception of parents about the benefits (standardized regression coefficient (beta) = 0.39) or sources of information about HPV vaccine (beta = 0.24), but intention decreased significantly with an increase in the perception about barriers to HPV vaccination beta = -0.44). The effect of beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (beta = 0.20), and beliefs about benefits (beta = 0.20) or barriers (beta = -0.25) to vaccination in general on intention to HPV vaccination were significantly mediated by parental attitudes and source of information about the vaccine. Geographical location significantly moderated the awareness about HPV on beliefs about severity of HPV infection or cervical cancer (beta = 0.33), and the effect of religion on norms related to HPV vaccination (beta = 0.19). Fit of the model to the data was acceptable. This study identified modifiable parental attitudes about HPV vaccine and beliefs related with HPV infection, cervical cancer and vaccination, which predicted parental intention-to-vaccinate their daughters with HPV vaccine in India. Health education interventions tailored to counter parental negative attitudes and beliefs about HPV vaccine and vaccination in general would be important for the community to promote HPV vaccination.

AB  - The use of nine items of personal protective equipment (PPE) during pesticide spray preparation and spraying was studied among farmers of Moghan Plain region, Iran, along with factors affecting PPE use behavior. Face-to-face interviews with the farmers based on a structured questionnaire were conducted. Low levels of PPE use were reported by almost half of the farmers (48.3%), while 30.5% showed moderate levels and 21.2% showed high levels of PPE use. Long-sleeved shirt was the most common item used by farmers, followed by simple face mask, boots, gloves, hat, wipes for covering face and mouth, trousers, and coveralls. Farmers who were satisfied by farming, farmers with off-farm income, and married farmers used PPE items more frequently. PPE use behavior also showed a positive association with the number of literate members of the household, farmers' knowledge of pesticide hazards, and use of information sources. Distance of village to agricultural offices and extension service centers showed a negative association with PPE use. Structure equation modeling (SEM) revealed that PPE use was increased with i) negative attitudes of farmers towards pesticides, ii) high levels of knowledge about pesticide hazards, iii) frequent contact with information sources, and iv) past poisoning experience during pesticide handling. Based on the model, the most effective variable on PPE use behavior was farmers' attitudes towards pesticides followed by knowledge of pesticide hazards, poisoning experience, and information sources. These four variables explained 85% of the variance in farmers' behavior in PPE use. The study brings new information on the mediating role of farmers' attitudes towards pesticides, knowledge of pesticide hazards, poisoning experience, and information sources in the use of PPE. Education of farmers on the hazards of pesticides is crucial for changing wrong behaviors in PPE use. Moreover, close contacts of the extension experts with pesticides retailers could increase farmers' safety in pesticide use. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Generational changes in lifestyle expectations, working environments and the feminisation of the medical workforce have seen an increased demand in postgraduate less than full-time training (LTFT). Despite this, concerns remain regarding access to, and information about, flexible training for surgeons. This study aimed to assess the opinions and experiences of LTFT for surgical trainees.
   Design: Prospective, questionnaire-based cross-sectional study.
   Setting/participants: An electronic, self-administered questionnaire was distributed in the UK and Republic of Ireland through mailing lists via the Association of Surgeons in Training and British Orthopedic Trainee Association.
   Results: Overall, 876 completed responses were received, representing all grades of trainee across all 10 surgical specialties. Median age was 33 years and 63.4% were female. Of those who had undertaken LTFT, 92.5% (148/160) were female. Most worked 60% of a full-time post (86/160, 53.8%). The reasons for either choosing or considering LTFT were childrearing (82.7%), caring for a dependent (12.6%) and sporting commitments (6.8%). Males were less likely to list childrearing than females (64.9% vs 87.6%; p<0.0001). Only 38% (60/160) found the application process easy and 53.8% (86/160) experienced undermining behaviour from workplace staff as a result of undertaking LTFT. Of all respondents, an additional 53.7% (385/716) would consider LTFT in future; 27.5% of which were male (106/385). Overall, only 9.9% of all respondents rated current LTFT information as adequate. Common sources of information were other trainees (47.3%), educational supervisors (20.6%) and local postgraduate school website (19.5%).
   Conclusions: Over half of surgical trainees working LTFT have experienced undermining behaviour as a result of their LTFT. Despite a reported need for LTFT in both genders, this remains difficult to organise, access to useful information is poor and negative attitudes among staff remain. Recommendations are made to provide improved support and information for those wishing to pursue LTFT.

AB  - Introduction People with cancer are at higher risk of serious illness and death from COVID-19 infection. We investigated COVID-19 vaccine uptake among patients with solid organ and blood cancers and explored factors related to hesitancy. Methods Cross-sectional online survey of adults with a history of cancer at three health services across metropolitan and regional Victoria. Vaccine hesitancy was measured by the validated Oxford COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy scale. Results There were 1073 respondents: 56% female; median age 62 years (range 23 - 91). Commonest tumor types included breast 29%, gastrointestinal 19%, hematological 15%, genitourinary 15%, and lung 8%. Thirty-six percent had metastatic disease, and 54% were receiving active anticancer treatment. Eighty-four percent of respondents indicated positive intent toward COVID-19 vaccination, 10% were undecided, and 6% indicated negative attitudes. At least one vaccine dose had been received by 65% of respondents, leaving 35% unvaccinated. Fifty-eight percent of unvaccinated patients answered that they would "definitely" or "probably" take a vaccine. Higher vaccine uptake was significantly associated with older age, male gender, English as first language, longer time since cancer diagnosis, and not being on current anticancer treatment. Concerns regarding vaccine side effects, particularly thrombosis, and the desire for clear medical advice were prominent among unvaccinated respondents. Conclusion Despite being eligible for COVID-19 vaccination since March 2021, a substantial minority of patients with cancer remained unvaccinated as of August 2021. Targeted communication and educational resources addressing vaccine safety in the context of cancer are key to promoting vaccine uptake in this vulnerable population.

AB  - Current research supports the idea that attitudes toward animals, including their rights and treatment, relate to other social and ideological views. In this study, I explored whether attitudes toward animals relate to wider ideological beliefs and important social identities in Serbia. I conducted two surveys to identify these relationships. In the first study, a sample (n = 321) from the general population completed a questionnaire asking about their attitudes toward animals, their acceptance of authority and societal order (right-wing authoritarianism), their preference for social hierarchy (social dominance orientation), and the importance of their social identities (gender, ethnicity, religion). I found that participants who were less supportive of animal rights also endorsed authoritarianism and relations of social dominance between groups to a larger extent. Furthermore, those who identified more strongly with gender, ethnicity, and religion also expressed more negative attitudes toward animals. In the second study, I surveyed undergraduate students in Serbia (n = 207) to determine the role of ethnic attachment as an ideological basis for attitudes toward animals. Perceptions of vegetarianism as an alternative lifestyle and a threat to the local traditions mediated the effects of ethnic attachment on both attitudes toward animals and meat consumption. However, this was true only for participants who prioritized group needs over individual needs (collectivists). In contrast, those with individualist views were more likely to endorse discrimination on the basis of species, regardless of their ethnocentrism. The findings show that attitudes toward animals correlated with endorsement of social hierarchies and with valuing the superiority of the ethnic ingroup. Attitudes toward animals thus relate to wider ideological views, in particular perceiving vegetarianism as a threat to the traditional values. I also discuss the implications of the findings for the study of human-animal relations.

AB  - First, this study tests for media effects on support for EU enlargement in a natural setting, while including actual media content in the analysis. Second, the moderation by anti-immigrant attitudes of media effects is tested, as it is argued that perceptions of 'others' influences how new information on enlargement is received. The study draws on a two-wave panel survey and a media content analysis in 21 countries. The results suggest there is a media effect, although not from individual exposure but from the information environment. In addition, individuals with stronger anti-immigrant attitudes are more strongly affected by a negative information environment.

AB  - We explore the conditions under which individuals are attentive to positive and negative battlefield information when forming beliefs about a conflict's success or failure. We use three experiments to explore the impact of visual and textual battlefield cues on individuals' emotional states and attitudes toward the war in Afghanistan. We find that both visual and textual information convey information about failure that influences public attitudes and emotions toward war. In keeping with rational expectations theory, but contrary to widespread beliefs within the journalistic and policymaking communities, textual cues and images of battlefield failure have similar effects on emotions and attitudes. The consistency of multiple war cues, however, greatly affects peoples' reactions. Simply put, in war the content of information matters, not its delivery style.

AB  - BackgroundHigh rate of teenage pregnancy in Nigeria is potentially an indication of poor access to and utilization of contraceptives among this age group. This paper presents findings from in-depth exploration of perceived barriers to utilization of contraceptive services by adolescents.MethodsA qualitative study was conducted in six communities in Ebonyi state, southeast Nigeria. Eighty-one in-depth interviews and six focus group discussions were conducted. Respondents comprised policy makers, community leaders, health service providers and parents of adolescents. Pre-tested interview guides were used to collect information on perceived barriers to utilization of contraceptive services by adolescents. All interviews were audio recorded and transcribed in English. Data was analysed using thematic framework approach, and the socio-ecological model was adapted for data synthesis.ResultsIndividual level factors that limit access to contraceptives for adolescents include lack of awareness and poor knowledge, fear of side effects, low self-esteem, and inability to afford cost of services. Interpersonal (family-related) barriers to access include poor parent-child communication of sexual and reproductive health matters and negative attitude of parents towards to sexuality education for adolescents. Health systems barriers to accessing contraceptives for adolescents include lack of privacy and confidentiality, stock-out of contraceptive commodities, judgmental attitude of health workers, insufficient staff that are skilled in adolescent sexual and reproductive health. Gendered cultural norms, societal shaming and religious intolerance also preclude adolescents from accessing and using contraceptive services. Wider societal factors such as negative peer and media influence, absence of sexuality education in schools, lack of social networks in communities; and macro level factors such as poor economic conditions were also perceived to limit access to contraceptives for adolescents.ConclusionUtilization of contraception is constrained by an interplay of factors acting at various levels. Addressing these barriers could contribute to improved access to contraceptive services for adolescents, as well as reduction in unwanted teenage pregnancy.

AB  - Due to the coronavirus outbreak, people around the world are facing various challenges in maintaining their well-being, which can be compromised due to risk of illness and harsh measures of social distancing. As proposed by the Self-Determination Theory, basic psychological needs are essential nutrients of well-being. The aim of this study was to examine the role of basic psychological needs in well-being during the pandemic. A sequential mediation model was examined, that links positive and negative affectivity to well-being (satisfaction with life and general distress) through satisfaction and frustration of the basic psychological needs (for autonomy, competence, and relatedness). The study involved 965 participants (M-age = 29; 57% females) from Serbia. The Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Frustration scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 21, and The Serbian Inventory of Affect based on the Panas-X were used. All the tested models were statistically significant. Controlling for age, gender, having children, health, employment, and marital status, direct effects in all models were highly significant, explaining up to 59% of criteria variance. The proportion of the explained variance was even higher when accounting for indirect effects. Sequential mediation models revealed that the indirect relationships between positive and negative affectivity and satisfaction with life and general distress were serially mediated by autonomy satisfaction, competence frustration, relatedness satisfaction, and relatedness frustration. This study raised an important question on how the disposition to experience more positive or negative emotions affects the change in subjective well-being. These results, coherent with the Self-Determination Theory postulates, add to the understanding of human functioning in the times of extraordinary circumstances during a pandemic, by suggesting that satisfaction and frustration of basic psychological needs might have a key role in obtaining optimal well-being.

AB  - The article discusses the historical growth and development of the Muslim population and its contemporary situation in Finland. Finland was annexed as a grand duchy by the Russian Empire in 1809, which led to the presence of Muslim military personnel on Finnish territory and later enabled the settlement of Tatar Muslims from central parts of Russia. These Tatars were for a long time the only organized Muslim community in Finland. They maintained their cultural and linguistic traditions, while being very much at home in their Finnish civic identity. During the 1980s and especially since the 1990s Finland has received many Muslim immigrants, including international students, spouses, refugees, and asylum seekers. The article addresses several complexities in Muslim organizations' ethnic, national, and sectarian varieties, and takes on board the change in official policies towards Muslims over the years. It also examines the media debates and public attitudes to Islam. The historical Tatar minority's role has in many respects been important for more recent Muslim immigrants, and though little remarked in public debate, remains very important in seeking a relationship between Islam and north-western Europe.

AB  - Beliefs form a major component of public attitudes, and attitudes have a role in determining how people behave as consumers and as citizens. Their behavior in turn affects the commercial viability and even the sustainability of animal industries. Beliefs are subjective facts, that is, matters that individuals consider to be true. The process of informing the community necessarily involves changing beliefs and, to this extent, persuasion. Education strategies relating to welfare issues depend on the target group and the desired outcome. Target groups include farmers, post-farm gatekeepers including transport drivers and abattoir workers, carers of companion animals, legislators and regulators, retailers, and the general community. These target groups may not be homogeneous, but each nevertheless has identifiable needs for knowledge and skills relevant to welfare. The approach that is likely to be most effective is to provide appropriately targeted dispassionate and factual information to the community. In this way, when debates about animal welfare occur, all the stakeholders-including animal-rights groups, retailers, farmers, legislators, and regulators who are involved in the debate are more likely to produce good outcomes if discussion is based on a shared understanding of what current practices are and what science can reveal about welfare. Given that the mass media are the preferred source of information, the use of science-based media coverage and informed ethical debate is likely to have the best effect, albeit over a fairly long time frame.

AB  - Moral foundations research suggests that liberals care about moral values related to individual rights such as harm and fairness, while conservatives care about those foundations in addition to caring more about group rights such as loyalty, authority, and purity. However, the question remains about how conservatives and liberals differ in relation to group-level moral principles. We used two versions of the moral foundations questionnaire with the target group being either abstract or specific ingroups or outgroups. Across three studies, we observed that liberals showed more endorsement of Individualizing foundations (Harm and Fairness foundations) with an outgroup target, while conservatives showed more endorsement of Binding foundations (Loyalty, Authority, and Purity foundations) with an ingroup target. This general pattern was found when the framed, target-group was abstract (i.e., 'ingroups' and 'outgroups' in Study 1) and when target groups were specified about a general British-ingroup and an immigrant-outgroup (Studies 2 and 3). In Studies 2 and 3, both Individualizing-Ingroup Preference and Binding-Ingroup Preference scores predicted more Attitude Bias and more Negative Attitude Bias toward immigrants (Studies 2 and 3), more Implicit Bias (Study 3), and more Perceived Threat from immigrants (Studies 2 and 3). We also demonstrated that increasing liberalism was associated with less Attitude Bias and less Negative Bias toward immigrants (Studies 2 and 3), less Implicit Bias (Study 3), and less Perceived Threat from immigrants (Studies 2 and 3). Outgroup-individualizing foundations and Ingroup-Binding foundations showed different patterns of mediation of these effects.

AB  - Background Children at earlier stages tend to be more susceptible towards different types of tobacco messages. These are able to influence attitudes and behaviours around smoking. This study examined how these messages are able to influence 5- and 6-year olds' attitudes about smokers and their smoking intentions.
   Methods Researchers worked one-on-one with 5- and 6-year olds (n = 398) in Brazil. Children could attribute positive and negative characteristics to two different persons in photos as smoker/ non-smoker. Children could indicate the attribute as of a smoker, a non-smoker, both or none. Children were asked also about their smoking intentions. Analysis considered parental smoking, sex, age, cigarette and alcohol brand logos, children's location and media characters from cartoons. We conducted a path analysis for a multivariate model of children's attitudes and intentions about smoking.
   Results Overall, children had negative attitudes about smokers (M = 4.58, SD = 4.08) and a total of 32 (8.0%) of them reported intentions to smoke. The resulting multivariate model indicates that parental smoking is a source for a positive image of smokers, while being 6 years old, living in rural areas, being aware of alcohol brands and recognizing educational cartoons tended to be negatively correlated to children's attitudes. Further, 6 year olds were found to be less likely to have smoking intentions, while attitude about smokers was positively related with intentions, One's attitudes served as a mediator for all of the variables in the model towards smoking intentions. The path models differed for each sex.
   Conclusion Shaped by social and environmental influences, very young children have opinions about smokers. In turn, these attitudes significantly predict children's smoking intentions. To corroborate this research, we recommend that longitudinal designs be employed to help model why Brazilian children become smokers.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Relative risk for the brain disorder schizophrenia is more than doubled in ethnic minorities, an effect that is evident across countries and linked to socially relevant cues such as skin color, making ethnic minority status a well-established social environmental risk factor. Pathoepidemiological models propose a role for chronic social stress and perceived discrimination for mental health risk in ethnic minorities, but the neurobiology is unexplored.
   OBJECTIVE To study neural social stress processing, using functional magnetic resonance imaging, and associations with perceived discrimination in ethnic minority individuals.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional design in a university setting using 3 validated paradigms to challenge neural social stress processing and, to probe for specificity, emotional and cognitive brain functions. Healthy participants included those with German lineage (n = 40) and those of ethnic minority (n = 40) from different ethnic backgrounds matched for sociodemographic, psychological, and task performance characteristics. Control comparisons examined stress processing with matched ethnic background of investigators (23 Turkish vs 23 German participants) and basic emotional and cognitive tasks (24 Turkish vs 24 German participants).
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Blood oxygenation level-dependent response, functional connectivity, and psychological and physiological measures.
   RESULTS There were significant increases in heart rate (P < .001), subjective emotional response (self-related emotions, P < .001; subjective anxiety, P = .006), and salivary cortisol level (P = .004) during functional magnetic resonance imaging stress induction. Ethnic minority individuals had significantly higher perceived chronic stress levels (P = .02) as well as increased activation (family-wise error-corrected [FWE] P = .005, region of interest corrected) and increased functional connectivity (P-FWE = .01, region of interest corrected) of perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). The effects were specific to stress and not explained by a social distance effect. Ethnic minority individuals had significant correlations between perceived group discrimination and activation in perigenual ACC (P-FWE = .001, region of interest corrected) and ventral striatum (P-FWE = .02, whole brain corrected) and mediation of the relationship between perceived discrimination and perigenual ACC-dorsal ACC connectivity by chronic stress (P < .05).
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Epidemiologists proposed a causal role of social-evaluative stress, but the neural processes that could mediate this susceptibility effect were unknown. Our data demonstrate the potential of investigating associations from epidemiology with neuroimaging, suggest brain effects of social marginalization, and highlight a neural system in which environmental and genetic risk factors for mental illness may converge.

AB  - Objective: Initiatives to reduce neighborhood-based health disparities require access to meaningful, timely, and local information regarding health behavior and its determinants. We examined the validity of Twitter as a source of information for neighborhood-level analysis of dietary choices and attitudes.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed the "healthiness" quotient and sentiment in food-related tweets at the census tract level, and associated them with neighborhood characteristics and health outcomes. We analyzed keywords driving the differences in food healthiness between the most and least-affluent tracts, and qualitatively analyzed contents of a random sample of tweets.
   Results: Significant, albeit weak, correlations existed between healthiness and sentiment in food-related tweets and tract-level measures of affluence, disadvantage, race, age, U.S. density, and mortality from conditions associated with obesity. Analyses of keywords driving the differences in food healthiness revealed foods high in saturated fat (eg, pizza, bacon, fries) were mentioned more frequently in less-affluent tracts. Food-related discussion referred to activities (eating, drinking, cooking), locations where food was consumed, and positive (affection, cravings, enjoyment) and negative attitudes (dislike, personal struggles, complaints).
   Discussion: Tweet-based healthiness scores largely correlated with offline phenomena in the expected directions. Social media offer less resource-intensive data collection methods than traditional surveys do. Twitter may assist in informing local health programs that focus on drivers of food consumption and could inform interventions focused on attitudes and the food environment.
   Conclusions: Twitter provided weak but significant signals concerning food-related behavior and attitudes at the neighborhood level, suggesting its potential usefulness for informing local health disparity reduction efforts.

AB  - Healthier meat products have a major economic potential and are attracting considerable research and media attention to meet the growing and complex consumer demand. Whether this potential will be realized and at what speed is contingent on consumers' acceptance of these novel foods. This study uses a cross-cultural context to co-create new healthier meat products, while mapping the conditions leading to consumers' product acceptance (vs. rejection). Results from online focus groups conducted in Denmark, Spain and the United Kingdom show that consumers generally have a negative attitude toward healthier meat products due to unfamiliarity and perception of over-processing. Nevertheless, partial meat-substitution with plant-based ingredients together with fat and salt reduction show specific conditions under which consumers' acceptance would be possible. This is further related to product-specific factors: ingredients and base meat, and marketing-related factors: labelling and packaging. Finally, implications and recommendations for the manufacturing and marketing of new healthier meat products are provided.

AB  - The potential of games in empowering underrepresented groups is a central theme in the field of media studies. However, to ensure that everyone can benefit from them, it is necessary to ensure that they are inclusive and accessible. In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05).

AB  - A 41-year-old man was admitted to the hepatobiliary surgery department of West China Hospital for right upper abdominal pain lasting for more than three months. The local hospital's abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed an unclear low density shadow in the right and lateral lobes of the liver and nodules on the abdominal wall. A histologic analysis of an ultrasound guided percutaneous hepatic biopsy revealed it was hepatic sarcomatoid carcinoma (HSC). This stage IV highly aggressive liver cancer patient received chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and thermotherapy at the same time. An important result of this treatment was the rapid relief of pain and symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and decreased appetite. His quality of life improved quite a lot. Clinicians and patients usually have negative attitudes when they face stage IV cancer, especially in cases like this one. Through multimodal anti-tumor treatment, the patient felt much better and became more cooperative, which gave both the clinicians and the patient more confidence in the treatment and produced a better than expected outcome. We summarize the treatment of this rare case in order to share the experience and affirm confidence in both patients and clinicians in treating this condition.

AB  - With the development of clean coal technology, modern coal-fired power plants have achieved the similar emission standards as gas power plants. However, due to the impressions of high pollution and high emission in traditional coal-fired power plants, such projects are often opposed by local residents, which hinder the promotion of this technology. This manuscript aims to investigate public attitudes toward these projects and to analyze the influencing mechanisms of the factors of public support. The conceptual model was built with sense of place, trust and environmental attitude as the independent variables, benefit and cost perceptions as the mediating variables and public support as the dependent variable. The model was tested and modified by structural equation modelling. The results revealed that sense of place had a slight indirect impact (-0.043) on public support through benefit perception, whereas trust had a direct impact (0.332) on public support and indirect impacts (0.298) through benefit and cost perceptions. Environmental attitude had indirect impacts on public support through benefit perception (0.180) and cost perception (-0.115). In addition, policy suggestions on decision-making, project publicity and compensation strategy are proposed to enhance public support for similar projects.

AB  - Previous studies have down that erroneous Conspiracy Theory (CT) beliefs develop more strongly in people who have underlying conspiratorial reasoning styles and psychopathological traits and particularly when they are faced with stressful external events (Swami et al., 2013; van Prooijen, 2018). In this study, we test this proposition by examining the individual differences associated with the development of COVID-19-related CT beliefs during the pandemic. A total of 660 adults completed a survey that captured COVID-related CT beliefs and broader conspiracy beliefs, education, perceived stress and attitudes towards government responses. The results showed that COVID-19 related CT beliefs were: strongly related to broader CT beliefs, higher in those with lower levels of education; and, positively (although weakly) correlated with more negative attitudes towards government responses. However, no relationship was found between COVID-19 beliefs and self-reported stress. These findings hold implications for why some people are more likely to be resistant to public health interventions relating to COVID-19. The findings encourage more detailed exploration of the causes and sources of CTs and, in particular, the role of social media use and other information sources in the development and perpetuation of health-related CT beliefs.

AB  - Public attitudes towards welfare policy are often explained by political values and perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients. This article addresses how the impact of values and perceptions varies depending on the contextual information that citizens have available when forming welfare opinions. It is argued that whenever citizens face deservingness-relevant cues in public debate or the media, a psychological 'deservingness heuristic' is triggered prompting individuals spontaneously to think about welfare policy in terms of who deserves help. This is an automatic process, equally influential among the least and the most politically sophisticated. Moreover, when clear deservingness cues are present, the impact of values on opinions vanishes. These arguments are supported by data from two novel experimental studies embedded in separate nationwide opinion surveys. The findings revise conventional wisdom of how values and heuristics influence public opinion and have major implications for understanding dynamics in aggregate welfare opinion and attempts from political elites to manipulate public opinion.

AB  - Sexual prejudice refers to negative attitudes towards individuals based on their sexual orientation. Scholars have shown an interest in identifying the factors that may increase the probability of prejudice against sexual minorities. The current study investigates in particular the main and interactive effects of the participants' social dominance orientation (SDO) and gender role orientation on their attitudes toward gay men and lesbians in a Turkish sample. It examines whether the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes would be stronger among individuals with high adherence to traditional gender roles. A total of 250 heterosexual university students filled out a questionnaire consisting of items designed to measure their SDO, gender role orientation and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. The results overall revealed that SDO, femininity (among females) and masculinity (among males) are positively related to prejudiced attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Supporting expectations, SDO and femininity interact in predicting sexual prejudice. However, masculinity does not interact with participants' SDO. The supplementary analyses also revealed that the effect of SDO on prejudiced attitudes was stronger among female participants with high femininity scores and among male participants with lower femininity scores. These findings indicate that a general preference for group inequality and endorsement of traditional gender role predispose individuals to be prejudiced against gay men and lesbians. Thus, the present study supplements the related literature by examining the interactive effects of SDO and gender role orientation in Turkey, a non-Western cultural context. It also provides important implications for researchers and practitioners in terms of developing strategies to reduce prejudice against sexual minorities.

AB  - Background: Pandemic restrictions have changed how patients approach symptomatic kidney stones. We used a mixed-methods digital ethnographic approach to evaluate social media discussions about patient concerns and preferences for urolithiasis care during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed kidney stone-related discussions on a large social media platform using qualitative analysis and natural language processing-based sentiment analysis. Posts were mined for demographic details, treatments pursued, and health care encounters. Pre-COVID-19 (January 1, 2020-February 29, 2020) and COVID-19 (March 1, 2020-June 1, 2020) posts were extracted from the popular online Reddit discussion board, "r/KidneyStones," which is dedicated to discussions related to urolithiasis.
   Results: We extracted n = 649 posts (250 pre-COVID-19, 399 COVID-19); 150 from each cohort underwent thematic analysis and data extraction. Quantitative sentiment analysis was performed on 418 posts (179 pre-COVID-19, 239 COVID-19) that described stone-related decision making before intervention. Notable discussion themes during COVID-19 focused on barriers to care and concerns about stone management. Discussants exhibited more negative and anxious tones during COVID-19, based on sentiment analysis (p < 0.01). Patient preferences shifted away from in-person visits and procedures (p < 0.001). Mean reported stone size among those visiting emergency room (ER) increased from 5.1 to 10.5 mm (p < 0.001). The proportion of discussants preferring conservative management with stones >= 10 mm increased (12.5% pre-COVID-19 vs 26% during COVID-19, p = 0.002). Opioid mentions increased from 9% to 27% of posts (p < 0.001) and were most associated with conservative management discussions.
   Conclusions: Online discussion forums provide contemporaneous insight into patients' experiences during a time when traditional patient-centered research methodologies are limited due to social distancing. During the pandemic, patients with symptomatic kidney stones expressed anxiety regarding outpatient encounters and reluctance toward procedural intervention. Patients opted instead for at-home conservative treatment beyond clinical guidelines and reserved ER visits for larger stones, potentially causing self-harm. Opioid discussions proliferated, an alarming consequence of the pandemic.

AB  - Background In December 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease (later named as COVID-19) was identified in Wuhan, China and, later on, detected in other parts of China. Our aim is to evaluate the effectiveness of the evolution of interventions and self-protection measures, estimate the risk of partial lifting control measures and predict the epidemic trend of the virus in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province based on the published data and a novel mathematical model. Methods A novel COVID-19 transmission dynamic model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China is proposed. COVID-19 daily data of the mainland of China excluding Hubei province, including the cumulative confirmed cases, the cumulative deaths, newly confirmed cases and the cumulative recovered cases between 20 January and 3 March 2020, were archived from the National Health Commission of China (NHCC). We parameterize the model by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method and estimate the control reproduction number (R-c), as well as the effective daily reproduction ratio-R-e(t), of the disease transmission in the mainland of China excluding Hubei province. Results The estimation outcomes indicate thatR(c)is 3.36 (95%CI: 3.20-3.64) andR(e)(t) has dropped below 1 since 31 January 2020, which implies that the containment strategies implemented by the Chinese government in the mainland of China are indeed effective and magnificently suppressed COVID-19 transmission. Moreover, our results show that relieving personal protection too early may lead to a prolonged disease transmission period and more people would be infected, and may even cause a second wave of epidemic or outbreaks. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we prove that the contact rate should be kept at least less than 30% of the normal level by April, 2020. Conclusions To ensure the pandemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated restrict interventions and self-protection measures, including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, keeping social distance, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April. If all the above conditions are met, the outbreak is expected to be ended by April in the mainland of China apart from Hubei province.

AB  - Background: During the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, engagement in preventive behaviors and getting tested for the virus play a crucial role in protecting people from contracting the new coronavirus.
   Objective: This study aims to examine how internet use, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics are associated with engagement in preventative behaviors and testing during the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted on Amazon Mechanical Turk from April 10, 2020, to April 14, 2020. Participants' internet use (in terms of the extent of receiving information pertaining to COVID-19), risk awareness (whether any immediate family members, close friends or relatives, or people in local communities tested positive for COVID-19), demographics (sex, age, ethnicity, income, education level, marital status, and employment status), as well as their engagement in preventative behaviors and testing were assessed.
   Results: Our data included 979 valid responses from the United States. Participants who received more COVID-19-related health information online reported more frequent effort to engage in all types of preventive behaviors: wearing a facemask in public (odds ratio [OR] 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79, P<.001), washing hands (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.35-1.85, P<.001), covering nose and mouth when sneezing and coughing (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.52-2.10, P<.001), keeping social distance with others (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.21-1.65, P<.001), staying home (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.20-1.62, P<.001), avoiding using public transportation (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.32-1.88, P<.001), and cleaning frequently used surfaces (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.34-1.79,P<.001). Compared with participants who did not have positive cases in their social circles, those who had immediate family members (OR 1.48, 95% CI 8.28-26.44, P<.001) or close friends and relatives (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.58-4.03,P<.001) who tested positive were more likely to get tested. Participants' sex, age, ethnicity, marital status, and employment status were also associated with preventive behaviors and testing.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed that the extent of receiving COVID-19-related information online, risk awareness, and demographic characteristics including sex, ethnicity, age, marital status, and employment status are key factors associated with US residents' engagement in various preventive behaviors and testing for COVID-19.

KW  - POWER
AB  - Energy infrastructures co-evolve with and are enacted and acted upon by not only technical but also regulatory and institutional factors, as well as sociocultural contexts. As solar energy plants require access to land and the electric grid, the recent uptick in solar energy infrastructure features interplay with local specificities. This article thus examines the uptake of solar energy in Portugal at both the national and local scales. The purpose is to contribute to a timely debate on critical renewabilities and to provide valuable insights for the future rollout of solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity in Portugal. The study demonstrates that solar energy policy measures not only show some start-stop aspects of the utility-scale solar PV roll-out, but have also tended to favour large companies, rather than community or individual operators. Three case studies point to a range of public attitudes regarding solar PV roll-out and its underlying drivers that are locally influenced by land use and sociocultural contexts, apparently more so than by concerns of low-carbon energy transitions. A key point for future solar energy transitions is, therefore, that local communities' concerns should be understood and approached cross-sectorally. Furthermore, the intersection of energy transitions and justice must be considered from a multi-scalar, multi-sited and cross-sectoral perspective.

AB  - Bisexual women experience high rates of sexual victimization, receive more negative social reactions from others upon disclosing experiences of sexual assault, and report greater hazardous alcohol use compared to heterosexual and lesbian women. The current study examined how experienced and internalized binegativity and bisexual identity affirmation relate to these disparities among a sample of 130 bisexual women who disclosed their sexual assault experience to at least 1 person. A moderated-mediation model was tested, which specified that experienced binegativity would indirectly relate to increased alcohol use via the impact of negative social reactions to assault disclosure, and that this indirect effect would be moderated by internalized binegativity and identity affirmation. Results indicated greater experienced binegativity predicted greater negative reactions to sexual assault disclosure, which predicted increased hazardous alcohol use. This indirect effect was qualified by internalized binegativity, such that negative social reactions to disclosure predicted hazardous alcohol use only in the context of higher internalized binegativity. Bisexual identity affirmation did not moderate the link between reactions to disclosure and drinking. Findings identify experienced and internalized antibisexual stigma as important targets for intervention efforts and highlight the need for campaigns that reduce binegativity at the individual and population level.
   Public Significance Statement Bisexual women with histories of sexual assault who encounter negative stereotypes of bisexuality may be more likely to receive unsupportive responses from others when they disclose sexual assault. These unsupportive responses in turn may contribute to increased risk for hazardous alcohol use especially for women who have internalized negative attitudes toward bisexuality to a greater extent. Results highlight the need to reduce antibisexual stereotypes and attitudes in efforts to prevent the detrimental impact of unsupportive responses on alcohol use and to improve bisexual women's wellbeing.

AB  - Background: In Uganda, perinatal mortality is 38 per 1000 pregnancies. One-third of these deaths are due to birth asphyxia. Adequate fetal heart rate (FHR) monitoring during labor may detect birth asphyxia but little is known about monitoring practices in low resource settings. Objective: To explore FHR monitoring practices among health workers at a public hospital in Northern Uganda. Methods: A sequential explanatory mixed methods study was conducted by reviewing 251 maternal records and conducting 11 interviews and two focus group discussions with health workers complemented by observations of 42 women in labor until delivery. Quantitative data were summarized using frequencies and percentages. Content analysis was used for qualitative data. Results: FHR was assessed in 235/251 (93.6%) of records at admission. Health workers documented the FHR at least once in 175/228 (76.8%) of cases during the first stage of labor compared to observed 17/25 (68.0%) cases. Median intervals between FHR monitoring were 30 (IQR 30-120) minutes in patients' records versus 139 (IQR 87-662) minutes according to observations. Observations suggested no monitoring of FHR during the second stage of labor but records indicated monitoring in 3.2% of cases. Reported barriers to adequate FHR monitoring were inadequate number of staff and monitoring devices, institutional challenges such as few beds, documentation problems and perceived non-compliant women not reporting for repeated checks during the first stage of labor. Health workers demonstrated knowledge of national FHR monitoring guidelines and acknowledged that practice was different. Conclusions: When compared to national and international guidelines, FHR monitoring is sub-optimal in the studied setting. Approximately one in four women was not monitored during the first stage of labor. Barriers to appropriate FHR monitoring included shortage of staff and devices, institutional challenges and mother's negative attitudes. These barriers need to be addressed in order to reduce neonatal mortality.

AB  - Since early 2020, the Covid-19 (CoronaVIrus Disease-19) pandemic has affected our world in multiple ways. What we know and how we know it has shifted on a global scale. How we move throughout the world has been restricted and locked down. How we see one another has changed the cultural narrative in numerous countries throughout the world. As we seek to rid ourselves of the novel coronavirus infecting our everyday, three significant paradigm shifts have mutated our realities and imaginaries in which we dwell. With millions dead or sickened by the evolving Covid-19 virus (According to the World Health Organization, "Globally, as of 8:32 pm CET, 9 February 2022, there have been 399,600,607 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 5,757,562 deaths, reported to WHO. As of 7 February 2022, a total of 10,095,615,243 vaccine doses have been administered." Source: https://covid19.who.int; Accessed Feb 9, 2022.), we are a different world now than we were. As guest editors for this Special Issue, (In)Visible Mutations of the (Mis)Information Imaginary: Knowledge, Movement, and Cultural Discourse in the Wake of Covid-19, we pay tribute to the millions affected by these changes by offering this collection of scholarship as a critical path forward. We examine three primary areas in which life, law, and legality have mutated with results that demand our immediate attention. The first section of contributing articles, Knowledge, engages with the dissemination of knowledge and (mis)information as either fact or fiction in lexicons and media outlets throughout the world. The second section, Movement, focuses on aspects of motion and its restriction in terms of bodies, legislation, access, and the threat of viral contamination across borders and within communities. The third section, Cultural Discourse, considers the (in)visibility of viral spread ranging from masks that cover the face to the separation of bodies through social distancing to the politicization of religion and vaccination. What once were normative cultural positionalities of space and politics have been volatized by institutionalized risk reduction and the confrontation of the unknown in the tenuous unforeseeable realm we now globally inhabit: L'idee se fait jour qu'il s'agit au moins autant d'une syndemie que d'une pandemie. Alors que la pandemie est une epidemie qui touche une partie importante de la population mondiale, une syndemie caracterise un entrelacement de maladie, de facteurs biologiques et environnementaux qui, par leur synergie, aggravent les consequences de ces maladies sur la population. Ost F (De quoi le Covid est-il le nom ? Academie Royale de Belgique, Bruxelles, 2021, p. 6). We hope that this Special Issue helps to contribute as a vital source of critical engagement with the effects of the new pandemic lexicon and re-emerging, yet irrevocably mutated public and private spaces and relationships to each another.

AB  - Sexual objectification is related to various negative attitudes and outcomes, including rape proclivity and reduced moral concern for the objectified, which suggests that objectification has implications for aggression. Our study examined the relationship between objectification and general aggressive behaviour in adolescents, including gang-affiliated youth. We hypothesized that (1) objectification would correlate with aggression towards girls, (2) gang affiliation would correlate with objectification and aggression towards girls, and (3) objectification and gang affiliation would interact such that strongly affiliated participants who objectified girls would be most aggressive towards them. We also hypothesized that sexual objectification would be a significant predictor of aggression above and beyond other factors, such as trait aggression. As predicted, objectification correlated with aggression towards girls and with gang affiliation, which also correlated with aggression. In addition, objectification predicted aggression towards girls, after controlling for other relevant factors. Further, we found an objectificationxgang affiliation interaction, which differed from our original predictions. Among participants low in gang affiliation, objectification of girls predicted levels of aggression towards them. Among those high in gang affiliation, however, objectification did not predict aggression. We discussed the implications of our findings for general aggression.

AB  - Using data from 28 European countries, this study examines factors influencing public attitude towards the use of AI/Robot. Its multilevel SEM analysis finds that several factors at the individual level including Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy predict public Acceptance of AI/Robot. Although country-level factors such as economic development, government effectiveness and innovation do not directly influence public acceptance of AI/Robot, they do have significant effects on Perceived threat of general job loss due to AI/Robot, and Digital technology efficacy. Findings indicate that these nationally macro variables influence people's perceptions of AI and robotics technologies and their confidence in their digital skills. This research enriches the application of the Technology Acceptance Model by using predictive variables at two levels: individual and country. Furthermore, at the individual level, this study uses two variables (e.g. Perceived threat of job loss and Digital technology efficacy) that are unconventional to TAM, thus contributing to this theoretical model.

AB  - The world has witnessed recently a global outbreak of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). This pandemic has affected many countries and has resulted in worldwide health concerns, thus governments are attempting to reduce its spread and impact on different aspects of life such as health, economics, education, and politics by making emergent decisions and policies (e.g., lockdown and social distancing). These new regulations influenced people's daily life and cast significant burdens, concerns, and disparities on various population groups. Taking the wrong actions and enforcing bad decisions by some countries result in increasing the contagion rate and more catastrophic results. People start to post their opinions and feelings about their government's decisions on different social media networks, and the data received through these platforms present a very useful source of information that affects how governments perceive and cope with the current the pandemic. Jordan was one of the top affected countries. In this paper, we proposed a decision support system based on the sentiment analysis mechanism by combining support vector machines with a whale optimization algorithm for automatically tuning the hyperparameters and performing feature weighting. The work is based on a hybrid evolutionary approach that aims to perform sentiment analysis combined with a decision support system to study people's posts on Facebook to investigate their attitudes and feelings toward the government's decisions during the pandemic. The government regulations were divided into two periods: the first and latter regulations. Studying public sentiments during these periods allows decision-makers in the government to sense people's feelings, alert them in case of possible threats, and help in making proactive actions if needed to better handle the current pandemic situation. Five different versions were generated for each of the two collected datasets. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed Whale Optimization Algorithm & Support Vector Machines (WOA-SVM) against other metaheuristic algorithms and standard classification models as WOA-SVM has achieved 78.78% in terms of accuracy and 84.64% in term of f-measure, while other standard classification models such as NB, k-NN, J84, and SVM achieved an accuracy of 69.25%, 69.78%, 70.17%, and 69.29%, respectively, with 64.15%, 62.90%, 60.51%, and 59.09% F-measure. Moreover, when comparing our proposed WOA-SVM approach with other metaheuristic algorithms, which are GA-SVM, PSO-SVM, and MVO-SVM, WOA-SVM proved to outperform the other approaches with results of 78.78% in terms of accuracy and 84.64% in terms of F-measure. Further, we investigate and analyze the most relevant features and their effect to improve the decision support system of government decisions.

KW  - mathematical modelling
AB  - Background: Classic compartmental models such as the susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed (SEIR) model all have the weakness of assuming a homogenous population, where everyone has an equal chance of getting infected and dying. Since it was identified in Hubei, China, in December 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread around the world and been declared a pandemic. Based on data from Hubei, infection and death distributions vary with age. To control the spread of the disease, various preventive and control measures such as community quarantine and social distancing have been widely used.
   Objective: Our aim is to develop a model where age is a factor, considering the study area's age stratification. Additionally, we want to account for the effects of quarantine on the SEIR model.
   Methods: We use the age-stratified COVID-19 infection and death distributions from Hubei, China (more than 44,672 infections as of February 11, 2020) as an estimate or proxy for a study area's infection and mortality probabilities for each age group. We then apply these probabilities to the actual age-stratified population of Quezon City, Philippines, to predict infectious individuals and deaths at peak. Testing with different countries shows the predicted number of infectious individuals skewing with the country's median age and age stratification, as expected. We added a Q parameter to the SEIR model to include the effects of quarantine (Q-SEIR).
   Results: The projections from the age-stratified probabilities give much lower predicted incidences of infection than the Q-SEIR model. As expected, quarantine tends to delay the peaks for both the exposed and infectious groups, and to "flatten" the curve or lower the predicted values for each compartment. These two estimates were used as a range to inform the local government's planning and response to the COVID-19 threat.
   Conclusions: Age stratification combined with a quarantine-modified model has good qualitative agreement with observations on infections and death rates. That younger populations will have lower death rates due to COVID-19 is a fair expectation for a disease where most fatalities are among older adults.

AB  - Introduction: Several sociodemographic variables, including ethnic inequality, have been identified as potentially influencing the uptake of COVID-19 vaccinations. To develop herd immunity against COVID-19, at least 70-85% of the population must be vaccinated. As the situation with COVID-19 changes, the public's perception keeps fluctuating. We designed a survey to determine the prevalence of vaccinated individuals and the rate of infectivity post-vaccination. We also aimed to study the clinical manifestations and infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus post-vaccination.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from May 10, 2021 to July 10, 2021 across India through a pre-tested validated semi-structured self-administered electronic questionnaire, to the study subjects with objectives explained and the confidentiality of the data and results had been assured. The questionnaires were prepared using Google forms and the link was sent across social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, and various social platforms where people are actively engaged following the restrictions and protocols of social distancing. General demographic data, followed by their lifestyle and comorbid conditions, and data on their vaccination, infectivity, and side effects were collected.
   Results: We included 2334 participants in the study, of which the majority of the study participants were in the age group of 25-34 years (38.6%). 1729 were vaccinated individuals of which 80.7% had received Covishield and 17.8% had received Covaxin. Around 61.1% have received both doses among 1729 vaccinated individuals and 38.9% had received only one dose of vaccine. The majority of the fully vaccinated individuals had a gap of 4-5 weeks for the second dose (37.1%) followed by 5-6 weeks (11.2%). Post-vaccination 50.8% had experienced muscle pain, 46% had experienced fatigue, 36.5% weakness, and 12.3% back pain. Among vaccinated 26% turned out to be COVID-19 positive and 44.5% non-vaccinated got infected. The odds of infection among non -vaccinated individuals was 2.27 times higher than vaccinated individuals. Individuals who encountered the viral antigen for the second time experienced either through vaccination or infection demonstrated exaggerated inflammatory response which is explained by the antibody-dependent enhancement phenomenon without life-threatening complications.
   Conclusion: Although more than 50% of the vaccinated individuals experienced some form of musculoskeletal side effects, we noted a high acceptance rate (74%) of vaccination among the participants. The vaccinated individuals were two times safer from infection compared to the non-vaccinated individuals.

AB  - The study of mass communication is based on the assumption that the media plays a significant role in spreading messages about various aspects of life to the public. The frequency of published news is an indicator of the various levels of a problem. The more attention paid by a newspaper to the community, the more valuable it is in reporting problems. Currently, news related to the COVID-19 outbreak is most popular. The media has been reporting not only on health but also on social and economic issues during the pandemic. The questions of this research are (1) what social issues were reported in the online news media during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, and (2) what economic issues were reported in the online news media during the same period. This study aims to identify the content of news when conveying COVID-19 pandemic information based on the frequency of appearance and news content based on social and economic issues in online news. This is a descriptive quantitative study using a content analysis approach to obtain primary data from 6,376 online news articles published by Antara News from 28 February to 8 April 2020. The NVivo 12 tool was used to analyse the data by dividing the types of COVID-19 issues related to social and economic issues in the news (in the form of text, images, videos and graphics) as an analysis unit. The results showed that Antara News used text, photos, videos and graphics 1,847 times for social issues and 2,701 times for economic issues related to COVID-19. The social issues involved 20 themes. Some of the important ones included regulations, social funds and charities, the humanities, the availability of infrastructure facilities, education, instruction and appeal, and culture and religion. Meanwhile, the economic issues involved 52 themes. Some of the important ones included exchange rates; transportation; the oil, natural gas and electricity industries; social funds and charities; regulation and policy; agriculture; and the tourism industry. The topics are related to social distancing, social restrictions, social actions, culture, other problems associated with the social sector (a decline in community purchasing power, consumption and dismissal) and the real and massive impact on economic growth. COVID-19 is not only a global health crisis but also a major labour market and economic crisis that has had a significant impact on society. In conclusion, a broader study is recommended using several publication periods and online media.

AB  - Background: The use of remote interpretation of data has risen in neuro-ophthalmology to increase efficiency and maintain social distancing due to the coronavirus disease-19 pandemic. The purpose of this study is to characterize the use and efficiency of remote interpretation of visual fields (VFs) in an academic center and to determine how often the VF interpretation was consistent with the patient's clinical history and imaging at the time of the consult. Methods: This is a retrospective study at a single academic center that enrolled all patients receiving a remote interpretation of VF from January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012. Data were collected regarding the referring department, indication for the VF, interpretation of the VF and comparison with any prior VFs, any associated interventions with the VF, and available follow-up VFs. The main outcome measures included 1) characterizing the use of remote VF interpretations and 2) how many remote VF interpretation results were consistent with the referring diagnosis based on the patient's clinical history and imaging. Results: One hundred eighty patients received remote interpretation of VFs. The most frequent referring departments were endocrinology (79; 44%), neurology (51; 28%), and neurosurgery (43; 24%). The VF indications included parasellar lesion (107; 59%), seizure disorder (26; 14%), meningioma (19; 11%), vascular lesion (11; 6%), and others (17; 9%). There were 78 patients (43%) that had an intervention before the VF, whereas 49 (27%) were preoperative VFs. Eighty-seven (48%) of the VFs were interpreted as abnormal. Of all the 180 remote interpretation of VFs, 156 (87%) had VF interpretations that were consistent with the clinical question posed by the referring provider based on clinical history and imaging. Among the other 24 remote VF interpretations (13% of total remote VF interpretations), there was no clear interpretation because of either additional unexpected VF defects (n = 5, 21%), VF defect mismatch (n = 6, 25%), or unreliable VFs (n = 13, 54%). The median wait time for patients receiving remote VF interpretations was 1 day. Conclusions: Remote interpretation of VFs was most often requested by endocrinology, neurology, and neurosurgery and could be performed very quickly. The most common indications were parasellar lesions, and just less than half of patients receiving remote VF interpretations had a prior intervention. A majority of remote VF interpretations were able to answer the clinical question, given the patient's clinical history and imaging. Remote interpretation of VFs may thus offer referring departments a more efficient method of obtaining VF interpretations than in-office neuro-ophthalmology examinations.

AB  - Objectives: Adolescent suicide, a major cause of adolescent death, is affected by various factors, including attitudes toward suicide. This study investigated the association between parenting style and adolescents' attitudes toward suicide and the mediating role of attitude toward suicide between parenting style and suicidal ideation.
   Methods: We surveyed 1,071 adolescents from eight middle schools in Incheon, Korea. The survey included sociodemographic information, attitudes toward suicide, perception of parenting style, depression severity, and suicidality.
   Results: Students in the authoritarian parenting group had a more permissive attitude toward suicide compared with the democratic and permissive parenting groups. These students considered that suicide is justified in certain situations and that choosing suicide is an individual's right. They also had a negative attitude toward talking about suicide or intervening in others' suicide. This association remained statistically significant after adjusting for the impact of confounding factors that could affect attitudes toward suicide, except for suicidal processes and preparedness to prevent suicide. In the mediation analysis, we observed that some factors of the attitudes toward suicide mediated between authoritarian parenting attitudes and suicidal ideation, namely, suicide as a right, preventability, suicide as normal/common, preparedness to prevent suicide, and resignation.
   Conclusion: This study revealed the significant impact of parenting style on children's attitudes toward suicide. Educating parents about the appropriate parenting attitudes-sympathetic and rational-can help prevent youth suicide.

AB  - Media reports can modify people's knowledge of emerging infectious diseases, and thus changing the public attitudes and behaviors. However, how the media reports affect the development of COVID-19 epidemic is a key public health issue. Here the Pearson correlation and cross-correlation analyses are conducted to find the statistically significant correlations between the number of new hospital notifications for COVID-19 and the number of daily news items for twelve major websites in China from January 11th to February 6th 2020. To examine the implication for transmission dynamics of these correlations, we proposed a novel model, which embeds the function of individual behaviour change (media impact) into the intensity of infection. The nonlinear least squares estimation is used to identify the best-fit parameter values in the model from the observed data. To determine impact of key parameters with media impact and control measures for the later outcome of the outbreak, we also carried out the uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. These findings confirm the importance of the responses of individuals to the media reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating epidemic COVID-19, the media publicity should be focused on how to guide people's behavioral changes by experts, and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease.

AB  - Decommissioning of Nuclear Power Plants (NPPs) is now a pertinent energy-related matter since most of the nuclear reactors built during nuclear renaissance will soon reach the end of their operational life. Drawing on the theoretical framework based on elements of the Value-Belief-Norm theory, psychometric paradigm, deliberative theories of democracy and in the levels of participation as defined by Arnstein's ladder, this is the first large-scale study addressing the question of who is willing to participate in decommissioning-related decision-making procedures. Data for this study were collected via a large public opinion survey (N = 1028) in Belgium in 2015, and were analyzed using Structural Equations Modelling (SEM) as a method. Results show that interest on the topic of decommissioning as well as radiological risk perception have direct effects on participation intention. Furthermore, we found that low trust in the nuclear industry, being ideologically leftist, having more negative attitudes towards nuclear energy, and living in the vicinity of a nuclear installation influences participation intention indirectly, through interest and risk perception. Based on these findings we point out to some challenges that can appear in decision-making processes and some recommendations on how to prevent or solve them.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic led to the implementation of worldwide restrictive measures to reduce social contact and viral spread. These measures have been reported to have a negative effect on physical activity (PA). Studies of PA during the pandemic have primarily used self-reported data. The single academic study that used tracked data did not report on demographics.
   Objective: This study aimed to explore patterns of smartphone-tracked activity before, during, and immediately after lockdown in the United Kingdom, and examine differences by sociodemographic characteristics and prior levels of PA.
   Methods: Tracked longitudinal weekly minutes of PA were captured using the BetterPoints smartphone app between January and June 2020. Data were plotted by week, demographics, and activity levels at baseline. Nonparametric tests of difference were used to assess mean and median weekly minutes of activity at significant points before and during the lockdown, and as the lockdown was eased. Changes over time by demographics (age, gender, Index of Multiple Deprivation, baseline activity levels) were examined using generalized estimating equations (GEEs).
   Results: There were 5395 users with a mean age of 41 years (SD 12) and 61% (n=3274) were female. At baseline, 26% (n=1422) of users were inactive, 23% (n=1240) were fairly active, and 51% (n=2733) were active. There was a relatively even spread across deprivation deciles (31% [n=1693] in the least deprived deciles and 23% in the most [n=1261]). We found significant changes in PA from the week before the first case of COVID-19 was announced (baseline) to the week that social distancing restrictions were relaxed (Friedman test: chi(2)(2) =2331, P<.001). By the first full week of lockdown, the median change in PA was 57 minutes less than baseline. This represents a 37% reduction in weekly minutes of PA. Overall, 63% of people decreased their level of activity between baseline and the first week of COVID-19 restrictions. Younger people showed more PA before lockdown but the least PA after lockdown. In contrast, those aged >65 years appeared to remain more active throughout and increased their activity levels as soon as lockdown was eased. Levels of PA among those classed as active at baseline showed a larger drop compared with those considered to be fairly active or inactive. Socioeconomic group and gender did not appear to be associated with changes in PA.
   Conclusions: Our tracked PA data suggests a significant drop in PA during the United Kingdom's COVID-19 lockdown. Significant differences by age group and prior PA levels suggests that the government's response to COVID-19 needs to be sensitive to these individual differences and the government should react accordingly. Specifically, it should consider the impact on younger age groups, encourage everyone to increase their PA, and not assume that people will recover prior levels of PA on their own.

AB  - This study investigates the prevalence of source-specific information avoidance among German consumers and predictors of information-avoidance behavior in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Guided by the Risk Information Seeking and Processing Model (RISP), we propose that the perceived social norms, information insufficiency, risk perception, affective risk response, and attitudes toward seeking predict information avoidance. We supplement the RISP model by considering information overload as the vast volume and the incredulous quality of information in the COVID-19 pandemic challenge individuals' information acquisition and processing. Using a stratified demographic sample of news consumers of a federal German state (N = 1,000), we empirically examined the proposed model, answered the research question, and tested our hypotheses using structural equation modeling. The results reveal information avoidance among one-third of the respondents. They avoided online sources, including online-mediated interpersonal sources, more often than interpersonal sources and traditional mass media. Information avoidance was linked to more negative attitudes toward seeking and negative affective risk responses, more pronounced descriptive and injunctive avoidance norms, and perceived information overload. Attitudes and information overload were the most influential predictors of avoidance. In contrast, risk perception and information insufficiency were not associated with information avoidance. This study provides insights into theory development, contributes to the information behavior literature, and identifies barriers to communication during health crises.

AB  - Purpose - The paper attempts to gain a better understanding of the reasons for advertisers to use nudity in European advertising campaigns and, more precisely, whether a print ad that uses nudity is more or less effective than an ad without nudity in the Czech Republic, Spain, and France.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment carried out in three European countries (Czech Republic, Spain, France) exposes young consumers to an experimental magazine containing an advertisement that shows either a woman's face or her topless body.
   Findings - Nationality does not appear to influence preferences for advertisements with or without nudity. Although differences emerge among the three countries in attitudes toward the ad (Aad), they are independent of the ad type and consistently reflect the same trends within each country. Gender influences Aad, and women adopt more negative Aad when they see nudity compared with when they do not, in contrast with men, regardless of their country.
   Research limitations/implications - Attitudes toward advertising in general vary significantly among European countries, even for seemingly homogeneous targets. Specific adaptations likely are needed not just with regard to nudity but more generally in terms of the content of ads.
   Practical implications - Advertisers that question the relevance of nudity in their advertising campaigns should take great care to define their target market by gender even more so than in terms of the European country in which the advertising will appear.
   Originality/value - Women adopt more negative attitudes toward advertisements that use sexy female models than do men, and this effect is independent of nationality in a European context.

AB  - The objective of this chapter is to present an overview of how menstruation, a normal bodily function, was and is perceived in various ethnic groups and cultures in the world, from ancient mythology, historical, or traditional practices to contemporary belief systems. Mythical tales about menstruation abound in the legends and prehistory of ancient cultures. These tales characterize menstrual blood variously as sacred, a gift from the gods, or a punishment for sin, but it is almost always magical and powerful. In contrast, most world religions view menstruation, with varying degrees of severity, as a major problem, a sign of impurity and uncleanliness, and therefore, menstruating women are isolated, prohibited from polluting the holy places, and shunned. Many of these myths and cultural misperceptions persist to the present day, reflected in a wide range of negative attitudes toward menstruation, which can have serious and direct implications for reproductive health. In view of the increasingly globalized nature of current clinical practice, it is crucial that health care providers are familiar with existing cultural and social views and attitudes toward the menstrual function. The ultimate goal is to be able to provide women culturally sensitive and medically appropriate therapies for their menstrual disorders. This biocultural approach to menstruation management is desirable in contemporary medical practice. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Aim The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly infected people worldwide, leading to a massive public reaction. Peoples' knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 are the most important for the control and prevention of the infectious disease pandemic. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices (KAP) toward the COVID-19 among Bangladeshi residents during the lockdown situation. Subjects and methods An online-based cross-sectional survey was conducted among 1765 Bangladeshi adults through the social media networks of the authors. Results The respondents were older than 18 years, with an average age of 24.88 years (SD 6.30). Approximately 15% of our participants received online training. The mean knowledge score was 14.49 (SD 1.8, range 0-17), and the overall correct response rate on this knowledge test was 85%. Approximately 67.2% scored well (above the mean 4.5, range 1-5) regarding the practices. To avoid the infection, 96.6% wore masks outside the home, and 98.7% washed their hands with soap when they came back. COVID-19 knowledge score was significantly associated with a lower odds of (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.79-0.92) negative attitudes. Again, the awareness score was associated with a lower likelihood of (OR 0.94, 95% CI 0.87-0.98) poor practices. Conclusion Online health education programs focusing on young people, housewives, and people with less education may potentially improve the attitudes and practices to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the long term in such a low-resource setting.

AB  - Our study aimed to determine how age-and disease-related difficulties were associated with attitudes and beliefs about driving self-regulation in men and women in the baby boomer and older generations. Three hundred and ninety-nine men (n =204) and women (n=195) aged between 48 and 91 years participated in a cross-sectional study of Australian drivers. Demographic characteristics and measures of driving confidence, driving difficulty and driving self-regulation; perceptions of visual, physical and cognitive capacity; and attitudes and beliefs about driving were obtained. Driving self-regulation in men and women was explained by different mechanisms. For men, self-report of visual and cognitive difficulties and poor driving confidence predicted driving self-regulation. For women, negative attitudes toward driving mediated the associations found between health-related difficulties and driving self-regulation. Barriers to driving self-regulation were not associated with the driving self-regulatory practices of men or women. Regardless of generation, women reported poorer driving confidence, greater driving difficulty and more driving self-regulation than men. We concluded that age-and disease-related difficulties are related to increasing driving self-regulation in mature men and women. These results indicate that different pathways are needed in models of driving self-regulation for men and women regardless of generational cohort. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Stigma may mediate some of the observed disparity in HIV infection rates between black and white men who have sex with men (MSM).
   Methods: We used data from the General Social Survey to describe race-specific trends in the US population's attitude toward homosexuality, reporting of male same-sex sexual behavior, and behaviors that might mediate the relationship between stigma and HIV transmission among MSM.
   Results: The proportion of blacks who indicated that homosexuality was "always wrong'' was 72.3% in 2008, largely unchanged since the 1970s. In contrast, among white respondents, this figure declined from 70.8% in 1973 to 51.6% in 2008 with most change occurring since the early 1990s. Participants who knew a gay person were less likely to have negative attitudes toward homosexuality (relative risk, 0.60; 95% confidence interval, 0.52 to 0.69). Among MSM, twice as many black MSM reported that homosexuality is "always wrong'' compared with white MSM (57.1% versus 26.8%, P = 0.003). MSM with unfavorable attitudes toward homosexuality were less likely to report ever testing for HIV compared with MSM with more favorable attitudes (relative risk, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.31 to 0.78).
   Conclusions: US attitudes toward homosexuality are characterized by persistent racial differences, which may help explain disparities in HIV infection rates between black and white MSM.

AB  - Background: Stigmatization and discrimination toward lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people are regularly reported. Both, in urban and in rural areas, LBGT individuals experience marginalization and detachment from the community. The media plays a major role in providing information related to LGBT people and HIV-AIDS since stigmatization and discrimination toward LBGT people are largely caused by inadequate knowledge related to HIV and AIDS transmission. The study aimed to examine the relationship of accessibility to media and the midwifery students' attitudes toward LBGT.
   Methods: The study employed a descriptive analytic method with a cross sectional approach. A total of 120 postgraduate midwifery students in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, who agreed to be involved in the study were recruited as participants.
   Results: The vast majority of respondents (92.5%) lived in urban boarding homes and had no difficulty accessing media and obtaining reliable information related to LGBT people. Respondents expressed negative attitudes toward LGBT people; the data shows 28% unwilling to be in close proximity to LGBT people; and 90% agreed that parents should keep their children away from LGBT people because they are considered to be very dangerous. Although respondents' access to media information is relatively good, their attitudes toward LGBT people are distorted based on their roles as health providers and as a family member. When it comes to their children, respondents perceived that it is important to protect their children from LGBT people for safety reasons; whilst in the working place, the vast majority of respondents agreed that LGBT people should not be discriminated.
   Conclusion: The misconception towards LGBT people highlights the urgent need for providing correct health education for lay people and health providers. Inconsistence and ambiguous attitudes toward LGBT people provides excellent evidence that the existing knowledge is not sufficient. With the role of media as a double edged-sword, there is a need for government and health providers to accurately and continuously provide health education for the general population in order to reduce stigmatization and discrimination toward LGBT people.

AB  - The Shanghai New Year's Eve stampede on 31 December 2014, caused 36 deaths and 47 other injuries, generating attention from around the world. This research aims to explore crowd aggregation from the perspective of Sina Weibo check-in data and evaluate the potential of crowd detection based on social media data. We develop a framework using Weibo check-in data in three dimensions: the aggregation level of check-in data, the topic changes in posts and the sentiment fluctuations of citizens. The results show that the numbers of check-ins in all of Shanghai on New Years' Eve is twice that of other days and that Moran's I reaches a peak on this date, implying a spatial autocorrelation mode. Additionally, the results of topic modeling indicate that 72.4% of the posts were related to the stampede, reflecting public attitudes and views on this incident from multiple angles. Moreover, sentiment analysis based on Weibo posts illustrates that the proportion of negative posts increased both when the stampede occurred (40.95%) and a few hours afterwards (44.33%). This study demonstrates the potential of using geotagged social media data to analyze population spatiotemporal activities, especially in emergencies.

AB  - This study examines the use of the term 'radical Islam' as a framing device from two perspectives. First, a content analysis of The New York Times and Washington Post suggested that 'radical Islam' is a recent addition to the public lexicon and is rapidly rising in use. The term is more recently associated with negatively charged language and linked to terrorism. Second, an experiment showed that reading about a perpetrator associated with 'radical Islam' (as opposed to 'terrorism') led to an increase in Islamophobia among all participants - indicated through fear of Muslims and Islam. An interaction effect emerged such that self-identified conservatives did not differentiate between 'radical Islam' and 'terrorism' when determining culpability, but self-identified liberals did. These results indicate that the US news media has increasingly linked 'radical Islam' with terrorism and other negative ideas, while some sectors of the American public struggle to disentangle the two concepts.

While studies have shown empirical support for such a relationship in various policy domains, empirical evidence also indicates that the public is relatively unaware of policy outputs. This raises a puzzle: Why do policy outputs influence public attitudes if the public knows little about them? Methods This study seeks to address this paradox by examining the conditioning role of media coverage. We rely on data derived from the Policy Agendas Project in the United States, allowing us to analyze the relationship between policy outcomes, public preferences, and newspaper content across a long span of time (1972-2007). Results Our results indicate that public policy preferences respond to policy outputs, and that this relationship is strengthened by greater media attention to a policy area. Importantly, our findings also indicate that without media attention to a policy area, there is no direct effect of policy outputs on public demand for policy. Conclusions Media coverage appears to be a key factor for public responsiveness to occur. In the absence of policy coverage by the media, public responsiveness to policy outputs is greatly reduced.

AB  - BackgroundWe compared knowledge about and attitudes toward epilepsy and the issuing of driver's licenses to people with epilepsy among non-medical students before and after media controversies.
   MethodsThe survey was performed in 2012 and 2014 using a structured questionnaire. Participants were non-medical students who attended a lecture on neurological diseases in children. The proportion of positive answers to each question in 2012 was compared with that in 2014. In addition, questions regarding attitudes toward driver's licenses were compared according to knowledge about car accidents linked to people with epilepsy.
   ResultsMore participants were familiar with epilepsy and had a favorable attitude toward epilepsy in 2014 than in 2012. In contrast, the proportion of participants who knew of car accidents linked to people with epilepsy was reduced in 2014 compared with 2012. The proportion of participants who did not think that severe punishment should be given to people with epilepsy if they caused a car accident decreased in 2014 among those without knowledge of car accidents.
   ConclusionsFamiliarity with and attitudes toward epilepsy were improved in 2014, whereas the decrease in proportion of positive answers on punishment among participants unfamiliar with car accidents suggests a latent worsening of public attitudes.

AB  - Feminists have frequently accused media outlets of not giving them enough coverage and/or portraying them negatively. Conversely, conservative women have argued that media suffer from liberal biases. While some studies have addressed the larger question of media and ideological prejudices, none have examined how media report women's activism in comparative terms. Since feminist and conservative women's organizations vie with one another over who represents women's interests, how media portray them has implications for how well they achieve this goal. Using data gathered from four major national newspapers, this study analyzes how print journalists depict feminist and conservative women's activism over a 14-year span. In so doing, it provides information about frequency of media coverage, as well as how advocates are labeled, on which issues they are getting visibility, and whether or not media present feminist and conservative women's organizations as being in direct conflict with each other. Implications for understanding women's political efforts, broadly speaking, are also explored.

AB  - Background:
   Mass media depictions of people with mental illness have a strong influence on public attitudes, to the extent that changes in these depictions can reduce public stigmatization of people with such illness. Journalists' mental health may influence their depiction of those with mental illness, but little is known about this.
   Aims:
   To investigate mental illness among journalists in five key areas: (1) journalists' mental health status; (2) journalists' personal attitudes towards mental illness; (3) attitudes and support journalists expect or have experienced from colleagues when they have a mental health problem; (4) effect of journalism's professional culture on the course of mental illness; and (5) effect of journalism's professional culture on mass media depictions of people with mental illness.
   Methods:
   We performed a systematic screening of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library regarding the study aims.
   Results:
   We identified 19, 12, seven and four studies for aims 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. No articles were found for aim 5.
   Conclusions:
   The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among journalists is higher than that among the general population. Journalists have positive personal attitudes towards mental illness, but there are perceived workplace disincentives to disclose mental health problems.

AB  - The harmfulness of anti-Semitic beliefs is widely discussed in current political and legal debates (e.g., Cutler v. Dorn). At the same time, empirical studies of the psychological consequences of such beliefs are scarce. The present research is an attempt to explore the structure of contemporary anti-Semitic beliefs in Polandand to evaluate their predictive role in discriminatory intentions and behavior targeting Jews. Another aim was to determine dispositional, situational, and identity correlates of different forms of anti-Semitic beliefs and behavior. Study 1, performed on a nation-wide representative sample of Polish adults (N=979), suggests a three-factorial structure of anti-Semitic beliefs, consisting of: (1) belief in Jewish conspiracy, (2) traditional religious anti-Judaic beliefs, and (3) secondary anti-Semitic beliefs, focusing on Holocaust commemoration. Of these three beliefs, belief in Jewish conspiracy was the closest antecedent of anti-Semitic behavioral intentions. Study 2 (N=600 Internet users in Poland) confirmed the three-factor structure of anti-Semitic beliefs and proved that these beliefs explain actual behavior toward Jews in monetary donations. Both studies show that anti-Semitic beliefs are related to authoritarian personality characteristics, victimhood-based social identity, and relative deprivation.

TI  - Psychological Responses to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic in Renal Transplant Recipients
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
KW  - QUALITY-OF-LIFE
AB  - Background. Renal transplant recipients are at increased risk for an adverse course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), most likely due to immunosuppression and the high level of cardiovascular comorbidity. Many transplant recipients are aware of these facts. The psychological effects of this knowledge, however, remain elusive.
   Methods. Cross-sectional study on 62 renal transplant recipients. Fifty cardiovascular outpatients without immunosuppression and 55 healthy subjects served as control. We performed a focused psychological assessment during the pandemic (April 2020) and compared the data with a time 6 months before. Additionally, an intergroup analysis was performed for the data during the pandemic. The analysis was performed by means of a questionnaire derived from KPD-38. We extracted 5 questions focusing on the parameters "life satisfaction" and perceived "action competence." Life satisfaction score ranged from 2 to 8, and the score for action competence from 5 to 20.
   Results. Both life satisfaction and perceived action competence were significantly lower during the pandemic than 6 months before in all the 3 groups (P < .005 each). During the pandemic median levels of life satisfaction did not significantly differ between the 3 groups (transplant recipients 6, interquartile range [IQR] 4-7; cardiovascular patients 5, IQR: 4-6; healthy controls 6, IQR 5-7; Kruskal-Wallis P > .05). In contrast, the perceived action competence was higher in healthy subjects (15, IQR 12-17) than in both renal transplant recipients (13, IQR 10-15) and cardiovascular patients (13, IQR 8-14, Kruskal-Wallis P = .0003).
   Conclusion. The COVID-19 pandemic has negative effects on life satisfaction and perceived action competence in renal transplant recipients, cardiovascular patients without immunosuppression, and healthy subjects. The effects on life satisfaction in transplant recipients did not differ from nonimmunocompromised patients or healthy controls. In contrast, the feeling of reduced action competence exceeded healthy controls, most likely due to a subjective need for stricter social distancing to avoid infection.

AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

AB  - Introduction
   The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine is available across various countries worldwide, with public-private partnerships ensuring all individuals are vaccinated through a phased approach. Irrespective of the geographical spread, several myths pertaining to the COVID-19 vaccine have stemmed, ultimately limiting the national administration of vaccines and rollouts. This study assessed the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine among the general public in Pakistan.
   Methods
   A pre-validated questionnaire was administered from January 2(121 to February 2021 to assess the public attitude and acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine. Logistic regression analyses were run to identify factors associated with the acceptance among the population.
   Results
   A total of 936 responses were elicited, where 15% perceived their risk of being infected at 20-30% with an overall 70% agreeing to be vaccinated if recommended. Multivariate analysis identified higher acceptance in the male gender, healthcare workers, and students. Of all, 66% respondents chose healthcare workers and public officials, whereas 15.6% chose scientific literature, and 12.9% chose social media as the most reliable source of COVID-19 information.
   Conclusion
   Given the relatively greater trust in healthcare providers for information regarding COVID-19, healthcare workers ought to be on the frontline for vaccine campaigns and public outreach efforts, with governmental efforts in addition to the promotion of scientific materials for population-level understanding.

AB  - Low levels of global self-esteem have been shown to be associated with disordered eating such that individuals who possess more negative attitudes about themselves tend to report more disordered eating symptoms. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether appearance-based contingent self-esteem (i.e., the degree to which individuals base their self-esteem on their physical appearance) and actual-ideal body image discrepancies influence this association. This goal was accomplished with a sample of 877 college women who completed measures of global self-esteem, body image, appearance-based contingent self-esteem, and eating behaviors. A moderated mediation analysis showed that actual-ideal body image discrepancies mediated the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating and that this simple mediation was further moderated by appearance-based contingent self-esteem. Discussion focuses on the implications of these findings for the ways in which actual-ideal body image discrepancies and appearance-based contingent self-esteem influence the association between global self-esteem and disordered eating. Future research aimed at improving intervention and prevention of eating disorders should address the extent to which individuals base their self-worth on their appearance and consider whether reducing appearance-based contingencies of self-worth may protect individuals from developing patterns of disordered eating.

AB  - Researchers have proposed solutions to limit the spreading of the Covid-19 pandemic worldwide. Systems capable of guaranteeing compliance with the minimum distance between people have been considered important to prevent the diffusion of the virus. In this article, we describe one system that can be used to keep distancing among persons moving in public spaces. It is based on the integration of computer vision techniques for rapidly detecting the presence of gatherings in the area and local radio technologies to identify and alert persons in the detected gatherings. We show that the goal of distancing can be achieved by fully respecting the privacy of individuals, which could be compromised by other distancing solutions such as those based on apps installed on personal devices such as smartphones and tablets.

AB  - Objectives: To examine public's knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward bipolar disorder (BP) in Saudi Arabia (SA).
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey was performed in 2016 in Riyadh, SA. The survey included sociodemographic characteristics and BP awareness scale.
   Results: Of 416 participants, 49.5% had prior knowledge of BP, mainly from internet and social media, and 57% considered it to be common in SA. About half believed BP is caused by a neurophysiological or neurochemical imbalance and that it can be treated with psychiatric medications. Supernatural causes, weak faith, and weakness of character were considered causes of BP by 55%, 48%, and 40% of participants, respectively. Recreational activities and head bandaging by traditional therapists were considered viable treatment options by 55% and 41% of participants, respectively. Students and healthcare professionals scored significantly higher on awareness scale. Regarding attitude, a majority believed that persons with BP can work effectively (86%), have to pull themselves together to get over it (47%), and consider it a shame to mention that someone in a family is affected by BP (32%). Regarding relationships, 22% were not willing to maintain a friendship and 39.3% were not willing to marry someone with BP.
   Conclusions: This study revealed suboptimal public awareness towards BP in SA. It identified several misconceptions and negative attitudes toward patients with BP. Further studies are needed to investigate potential public interventions to improve literacy of BP.

AB  - Hitherto, tactical voting has not been a topic in Norwegian electoral research, despite the fact that tactical considerations have been publically discussed both by politicians and citizens for years. The complexity of the electoral system is partly to blame. Norwegian voters experience a number of tactical situations that give rise to rather different dilemmas, and hence several tactical motives. These need to be mapped and analysed separately. A set of survey questions has been especially designed for the present study to record these motives. Special attention has also been paid to the political sophistication of voters, campaign messages encouraging tactical voting, and the restraining effects of habitual voting and negative attitudes towards tactical voting. These factors may modify the inclination to tactical electoral behaviour. The web survey designed for the present project was conducted immediately following the Norwegian parliamentary election of 2013 (N = 2,278). Of the voters in the survey, 18.3 percent reported casting a tactically motivated vote. The 4 percent threshold on the distribution of compensatory seats, the competition for the last district seats and the composition of government coalitions triggered tactical voting. Tactical voters do not stand out as more politically sophisticated than other voters. Rather than calculating the expected utility for each party, they seem to rely on campaign information from the political parties and the media when voting tactically. For the habitual voters and voters with a strong dislike of tactical voting, the propensity for tactical voting is well below average.

TI  - Development and validation of a 30-day mortality index based on pre-existing medical administrative data from 13,323 COVID-19 patients: The Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 (VACO) Index
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - MILITARY
AB  - Background
   Available COVID-19 mortality indices are limited to acute inpatient data. Using nationwide medical administrative data available prior to SARS-CoV-2 infection from the US Veterans Health Administration (VA), we developed the VA COVID-19 (VACO) 30-day mortality index and validated the index in two independent, prospective samples.
   Methods and findings
   We reviewed SARS-CoV-2 testing results within the VA between February 8 and August 18, 2020. The sample was split into a development cohort (test positive between March 2 and April 15, 2020), an early validation cohort (test positive between April 16 and May 18, 2020), and a late validation cohort (test positive between May 19 and July 19, 2020). Our logistic regression model in the development cohort considered demographics (age, sex, race/ethnicity), and pre-existing medical conditions and the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) derived from ICD-10 diagnosis codes. Weights were fixed to create the VACO Index that was then validated by comparing area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) in the early and late validation cohorts and among important validation cohort subgroups defined by sex, race/ethnicity, and geographic region. We also evaluated calibration curves and the range of predictions generated within age categories. 13,323 individuals tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (median age: 63 years; 91% male; 42% non-Hispanic Black). We observed 480/3,681 (13%) deaths in development, 253/2,151 (12%) deaths in the early validation cohort, and 403/7,491 (5%) deaths in the late validation cohort. Age, multimorbidity described with CCI, and a history of myocardial infarction or peripheral vascular disease were independently associated with mortality-no other individual comorbid diagnosis provided additional information. The VACO Index discriminated mortality in development (AUC = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.77-0.81), and in early (AUC = 0.81 95% CI: 0.78-0.83) and late (AUC = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.78-0.86) validation. The VACO Index allows personalized estimates of 30-day mortality after COVID-19 infection. For example, among those aged 60-64 years, overall mortality was estimated at 9% (95% CI: 6-11%). The Index further discriminated risk in this age stratum from 4% (95% CI: 3-7%) to 21% (95% CI: 12-31%), depending on sex and comorbid disease.
   Conclusion
   Prior to infection, demographics and comorbid conditions can discriminate COVID-19 mortality risk overall and within age strata. The VACO Index reproducibly identified individuals at substantial risk of COVID-19 mortality who might consider continuing social distancing, despite relaxed state and local guidelines.

AB  - Gradual recovery of Chinese nuclear power industry and its increasingly important position in the world have created a need to understand how public attitudes towards nuclear power changed after the Fukushima nuclear accident in Japan (FNAJ). To address this need, we augment our previous work to include data from a new survey conducted three years after the FNAJ in the same study area. The results showed that three years after the FNAJ, factor knowledge continued to increase, whereas the other four perception factors acceptance, risk, benefit, and trust had recovered from their post-FNAJ changes to different degrees. The sensitive groups whose acceptance declined more after the FNAJ showed a greater increase as time passed. It was also found that median acceptable frequency for level 1 nuclear events (anomaly) showed little change from Survey 2 to Survey 3, while tolerance of more severe events (incidents and serious incidents) has decreased substantially. The overall recovery of public acceptance shown in our study was in line with the nuclear development trend of China. But more efforts still need to be made to improve nuclear safety and risk communication.

   This study examines the factors that shape public acceptance of homosexuality and support for same-sex marriage across age cohorts.
   Methods
   We analyzed data from two national surveys. We constructed hierarchical logistic and hierarchical ordinary least squares regressions for relevant age cohorts in order to test our hypotheses and explore our research questions.
   Results
   Our models suggest that personal contact has a greater impact on the attitudes of younger respondents, positively influencing public acceptance of homosexuality. Alternatively, religious and ideological predispositions have a greater impact on the attitudes of older individuals. When examining public support for gay marriage, we find that younger individuals have higher levels of deliberative engagement with the issue debate, while older individuals rely more heavily on their predispositions when determining issue stance. Interestingly, measures of media exposure are not significantly related to either public acceptance of homosexuality or support for same-sex marriage, suggesting that other factors may have a greater impact on public attitudes at this point in time.
   Conclusion
   The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the emergence of a new political generation and the continuing struggle for gay civil rights.

AB  - While past research has documented significant relationships between both athletic and Greek system (fraternity and sorority) membership and negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians, such work seems to membership in athletics and the Greek system as causal mechanisms of homophobia. In this way, athletes and Greeks may be easy targets to blame for the homophobia evident on college campuses. However, it may be more productive to attempt to identify underlying constructs that are related to collegiate athletes' and fraternity/sorority members' attitudes to best inform campus LGBT programs. In this study, athletes' and fraternity and sorority members' attitudes toward lesbian, gay, bisexual men and women, and transgender (LGBT) individuals are examined. Further exploration considers how LGBT affiliations (i.e., knowing LGBT individuals, knowing about LGBT programs, and having Gay-Straight Alliances in high school) and religiosity may mediate the relationship between athletic and Greek membership and attitudes toward LGBT individuals. Results show that being a male athlete or being a fraternity member is related to unsupportive attitudes toward LGBT individuals; however, LGBT affiliations and religiosity mediate some of the significant relationships. In contrast, being a female athlete is unrelated to attitudes toward LGBT individuals while being a sorority member is related to attitudes toward LGBT individuals in some models. Campus LGBT program implications for both athletes and Greek system members are provided.

AB  - Objectives Using the Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework, we investigated the association between attitudes towards COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy and change in these variables over a 9-month period in a UK cohort. Methods The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake.

AB  - Unprecedented measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in China. People's adherence to control measures is affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. In this study, we investigated Chinese residents' KAP towards COVID-19 during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. An online sample of Chinese residents was successfully recruited via the authors' networks with residents and popular media in Hubei, China. A self-developed online KAP questionnaire was completed by the participants. The knowledge questionnaire consisted of 12 questions regarding the clinical characteristics and prevention of COVID-19. Assessments on residents' attitudes and practices towards COVID-19 included questions on confidence in winning the battle against COVID-19 and wearing masks when going out in recent days. Among the survey completers (n=6910), 65.7% were women, 63.5% held a bachelor degree or above, and 56.2% engaged in mental labor. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 90%. The majority of the respondents (97.1%) had confidence that China can win the battle against COVID-19. Nearly all of the participants (98.0%) wore masks when going out in recent days. In multiple logistic regression analyses, the COVID-19 knowledge score (OR: 0.75-0.90, P<0.001) was significantly associated with a lower likelihood of negative attitudes and preventive practices towards COVID-2019. Most Chinese residents of a relatively high socioeconomic status, in particular women, are knowledgeable about COVID-19, hold optimistic attitudes, and have appropriate practices towards COVID-19. Health education programs aimed at improving COVID-19 knowledge are helpful for Chinese residents to hold optimistic attitudes and maintain appropriate practices. Due to the limited sample representativeness, we must be cautious when generalizing these findings to populations of a low socioeconomic status.

AB  - Background: Medical students often have a problem recognising the relevance of basic science subjects for their later professional work in the pre-clinical stage of their studies. This can lead to a lower motivation to learn biochemical content and dissatisfaction in the courses amongst the students. Alternative teaching methods such as the Inverted Classroom (IC) method can address this deficiency. The goal of this study was:
   1. to analyse the motivation and satisfaction of the students in a biochemistry seminar through the use of the e-learning-based IC method,
   2. to investigate the acceptance against the IC teaching method in biochemistry, and
   3. to compare the learning success achieved using the IC approach with that of a traditional course.
   We also investigated how a biochemistry course in the pre-clinical stage of a human medicine course of studies can be successfully organised according to the IC method. Furthermore, we examined the benefits of the IC method over conventional teaching formats.
   Method: The IC method was implemented in accordance with the guidelines of the GMA committee "New Media" [30] in a biochemistry seminar for two student IC intervention groups with 42 students. A part of the factual knowledge from the on-site phase in the form of teaching videos together with self-learning control tasks were provided online before the seminar for both IC intervention groups. Exporting content to the self-learning phase creates new free time in the on-site phase, during which the content can be critically considered and processed and additional competency- based learning objectives can be taught. Identical biochemistry teaching content was taught in parallel control groups (14 student groups with n=299 students), but no material was handed out beforehand for a self-learning phase. These students only received the materials after the on-site phase. Motivation and satisfaction as well as the acceptance for the teaching methods were recorded by questionnaires, the acquisition of knowledge by MC exams.
   Results: On a Likert scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 6 (strongly agree), the students in the IC intervention groups could be seen to be much more motivated (5.53) than students in the control group (4.01). Students in the IC intervention groups also recognised the relevance of the learning content much more clearly (5.44) than students in the control group (4.01). Furthermore, the IC group also observed that additional competencies were trained in addition to the biochemistry content. In addition, the IC intervention group award the event a school grade of 1.53, the traditional control group a grade of 2.96. The teaching videos were rated very positively by both groups with an average school grade of 1.3 in each case. A qualitative analysis showed that the motivation and a positive attitude of the lecturers played a decisive role in the successful implementation of the IC method.
   Discussion and conclusion: Pre-clinical students display a high acceptance of the e-learning- based IC method. Teaching communication competencies in a biochemistry seminar was also rated very positively by the students. The quality of the teaching video and the motivation of the lecturers were shown to be a critical parameter for the successful performance of the IC method. What's more, the IC method can contribute to implementing a competence orientation in medical studies.

AB  - It is likely that climate change communications and media coverage will increasingly stress the importance of adaptation, yet little is known about whether or how this may affect attitudes towards mitigation. Despite concerns that communicating adaptation could undermine public support for mitigation, previous research has found it can have the opposite effect by increasing risk salience. It is also unclear whether people respond differently to information about mitigation and adaptation depending on whether action is framed as an individual or government responsibility. Using an experimental design, this study sought to examine how public attitudes towards mitigation are influenced by varying climate change messages, and how this might interact with prior attitudes to climate change. UK-based participants (N = 800) read one of four texts in a 2 x 2 design comparing adaptation versus mitigation information and personal versus governmental action. No main effect was found for adaptation versus mitigation framing, nor for individual action versus government policy, but we did observe a series of interaction effects with prior attitudes to climate change. Mitigation and adaptation information affected participants' responses differently depending on their pre-existing levels of concern about climate change, suggesting that mitigation framings may be more engaging for those with high levels of concern, whereas adaptation framings may be more engaging for low-concern individuals. Government mitigation action appears to engender particularly polarised attitudes according to prior concern. Implications for climate change communications are considered.

AB  - Background: The demand for transplantable organ continues to exceed supply, particularly in minority patient populations. We explored the factors influencing organ donation attitude within the Arab American community.
   Methods: Secondary data analysis from a face-to-face survey administered in late 2003 to 1016 adults from a representative population-based sample on Greater Detroit Arab Americans.
   Results: Christian Arab Americans were more likely than Muslim Arab Americans, and women more than men, to believe organ donation after death was justifiable. Higher educational attainment and income, as well as greater acculturation into American society, were associated with greater odds of believing organ donation to be justified. Self-reported health status and level of psychological distress and health insurance status were not associated with beliefs about organ donation.
   Conclusions: A multifaceted approach toward increasing organ donation rates in this growing population requires targeted community-health care system collaborations involving religious and civic leaders using Arabic language and culturally sensitive media.
   Summary: Arab Americans represent a growing population about which little is known in regard to organ donation and transplantation. This population is not specifically captured within national and local transplantation databases, and little empiric work has assessed attitudes and barriers toward organ donation and transplantation within this community. Our work represents the first to use a representative population-based sample to explore the modifiable and non-modifiable characteristics of those who believe cadaveric organ donation to be justified.

AB  - Background The lives of many children and adolescents are today increasingly influenced by new technological devices, including smartphones. The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred in a time of outstanding scientific progress and global digitalization. Young people had relevant adverse psychological and behavioral effects due to the COVID-19 pandemic, mainly related to infection control measures, which led them to spend more time at home and with major use of technological tools. The goal this study proposes is to evaluate health and social outcomes of smartphone overuse among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing patterns and aims of utilization, as well as the eventual presence and degree of addiction. Methods This study was based on a self-report and anonymous questionnaire, which was administered to 184 Italian school-age (6-18 years) children and adolescents during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The test was electronically (email, whatsapp) explained and sent by pediatricians either directly to older children (middle and high school), or indirectly, through the help of teachers, to younger ones (primary school). All participants spontaneously and voluntarily joined the present study. The survey was made by 4 sections, and designed to know and outline modalities (frequency, patterns and aims) of smartphone use, adverse outcomes, and related parental behaviors, also in order to reveal the eventual occurrence and degree of addiction. The same information, related to the pre-epidemic period, was also investigated and analyzed. Results The data obtained revealed a significantly greater adhesion to the questionnaire by females, likely reflecting higher attention and interest than boys to initiatives relating to health education. Our study showed more frequent smartphone use among Italian children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to the pre-epidemic period. This may be related to the social distancing measures adopted during the months under investigation. The present survey also outlined the changing patterns and aims in the use of smartphones among young people, which allowed to limit some effects of the crisis. Indeed, they were used for human connection, learning and entertainment, providing psychological and social support. Finally, it was observed a significant increase of overuse and addiction. This led to many clinical (sleep, ocular and musculoskeletal disorders), psychological (distraction, mood modification, loss of interest) and social (superficial approach to learning, isolation) unfavorable outcomes. Conclusions Pediatricians and health care professionals should be aware of the potential risks related to inappropriate use of smartphones. They should monitor, in cooperation with parents, possible associated adverse effects, in order to early recognize signs and symptoms suggestive, or at high risk, for addiction. They must carry out, as well, the necessary interventions to prevent and/or lower the detrimental impact of smartphone overuse on children and adolescents' health, oriented to sustain adequate physical and psychological development as well as social relationships.

AB  - As a consequence of exposure to sexualized messages, girls and women may internalize the belief that sexual attractiveness to men is an important aspect of their identity. Whereas research on internalized sexualization has mainly focused on its consequences for girls' well-being and academic outcomes, the present study (N = 222, women, aged 20 to 29) examined whether internalized sexualization is related to sexist attitudes and tolerance of sexual harassment among young women. It also analyzed internalized sexualization' links to women's views of notorious sexual abuse allegations in the so-called Weinstein scandal and attitudes towards the #MeToo movement, a campaign aimed at combatting sexual harassment and sexual assault. The study was conducted in Italy, a context characterized by pervasive sexualized messages and diffuse criticism against the #MeToo movement. The findings showed that internalized sexualization was associated with stronger endorsement of sexist attitudes and higher acceptance of sexual harassment myths, which worked as sequential mediators of skepticism towards sexual abuse allegations in the Weinstein scandals. Endorsement of sexist attitudes mediated the relation between internalized sexualization and negative attitudes towards the #MeToo movement. This study extends the knowledge on the correlates of sexualization, suggesting that women's internalization of the belief that they should be sexually attractive to men might contribute to reinforce ideologies and attitudes that perpetrate women's mistreatment while diminishing support for social activism on women's behalf.

AB  - Within the emerging paradigm of experimental Critical Discourse Analysis, this paper investigates the framing effects of dehumanising vs militarising metaphors in anti-immigration discourses. These metaphors are characterised as `extreme metaphors' in so far as they are manifestly metaphorical and obviously inflammatory. Attested examples of these metaphors in political and media discourses are identified and critically analysed before their potential framing effects are investigated experimentally.
   Contrary to predictions, alternative metaphors did not increase support for actions and evaluations consistent with the unique framings that they present. In fact, extreme metaphors decreased support for anti-immigration sentiments and hostile immigration policies compared to literal framings. It seems that extreme metaphors alert readers to the metaphorical framing being presented so that, among certain groups of people, the framing is more readily scrutinised and rejected, prompting readers adopt more sympathetic attitudes toward immigration. The implications of these findings for Critical Discourse Analysis are discussed.

AB  - This research examines the relationship between populist thinking and global crisis-solving motivations concerning climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. Using data from five European countries (Switzerland, France, Finland, Greece, and Italy), we test a model where crisis-related science skepticism-understood as the defense of commonsense knowledge against scientific expertise-mediates the association between populist thinking and crisis-mitigation attitudes. The results show considerable convergence across national contexts. Relative deprivation predicts endorsement of two core components of populism's thin ideology, people sovereignty and antielitism. These subdimensions of populism are linked to science skepticism, although variably across contexts. Science skepticism then leads to a lower sense of personal responsibility for climate change mitigation and to negative attitudes towards a governmental measure to contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings further show that under specific conditions, the populist request for greater democratic participation may mobilize individuals to get involved in crisis mitigation. Overall, our results highlight the role of politicized common sense in motivating and justifying opposition to measures and policies based on scientific expertise. We conclude that science skepticism, rather than populism per se, explains cynical and dismissive attitudes towards global crises.

AB  - Community-based risk management strategies for people convicted of sexual offences (PCSO) can hinder successful reintegration, which plays an important role in reducing sexual recidivism. Section 161 of the Criminal Code is a Canadian risk management strategy, which aims to protect children by prohibiting people convicted of sexual offences against children (PCSO-C) from engaging in behaviours assumed (sometimes erroneously) to be associated with sexual offending. This study was the first to evaluate Section 161 prohibition orders. We explored inconsistencies in the interpretation and (hypothetical) application of these conditions between PCSO-C subject to Section 161 and two non-forensic subsamples of the Canadian public - community members and undergraduate students. Non-forensic participants expressed more negative attitudes towards the treatment of PCSO, which were found to mediate the relationship between group membership and subjective legal decision-making. Degree of support for Section 161 conditions did not appear to moderate this effect. Results raise concerns about the potential for increased personal discretion when enforcing or adhering to ambiguous or overly broad legal conditions. We suggest the need for continued efforts to establish an empirical understanding of the application, efficacy, and potential collateral consequences associated with this Canadian risk management strategy.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between ethnic composition in school and the ethnic prejudice of teachers, controlling for the individual characteristics of teachers and their perceptions of pupils' teachability. Method: Multilevel analyses were carried out on data for 499 Flemish teachers in 44 Flemish (Belgian) secondary schools, collected through an online questionnaire. In this study, ethnic prejudice means a negative attitude to Moroccans, Turks, and Eastern Europeans. A scale was created by taking the mean scores for 18 items, with higher scores indicating greater ethnic prejudice (Quillian, 1995; Witte, 1999). Results: Teachers with long-term higher education or a university diploma are shown to be less ethnically prejudiced than teachers with a lower level of education. Moreover, teachers who work at a school with a greater number of ethnic minority pupils, and at the same time evaluate their pupils as more teachable, are less ethnically prejudiced. Conclusions: These findings highlight the need for more research into the underlying processes, such as pupils' teachability, that influence the relationship between school characteristics and the ethnic prejudice of teachers. More knowledge about the context-specific factors and processes that mediate and/or moderate this relationship can increase the theoretical understanding of the development of ethnic prejudice. It can also highlight particular social characteristics, which can be the focus of social and organizational policy aimed at reducing ethnic prejudices.

AB  - This article analyses the nexus of public attitudes toward military missions abroad, specific beliefs about the respective missions, and political predispositions. While some studies have argued that specific beliefs such as success expectations are the most important explanatory factors of attitudes, others have stressed the role of party-related predispositions in shaping both beliefs and attitudes. Using the case of German citizens' attitudes toward the German participation in the International Security Assistance Force mission in Afghanistan, we argue that scope conditions determine the relative merit of these perspectives. With data from a representative survey conducted in 2010 we show that in this late stage of the military mission, success expectations had a substantial effect on German citizens' mission support that was not merely mediating the influence of predispositions. At the same time, foreign policy predispositions also had a substantial impact on mission support, while party identifications had only minor effects. We discuss the more general implications of these results for statements on the relative importance of predispositions and specific beliefs as explanatory factors in public opinion formation on the use of military force.

AB  - Many people have preconceived notions about games and distrust the effects of game-based learning and show negative attitudes. In fact, there are limitations and disadvantages of game-based learning, and it is difficult to overcome them. More than half of the inconveniences or problems of teachers who want to try game-based learning revealed by the 2009 survey have not been solved yet. Due to the sudden spread of COVID-19, the Ministry of Education has issued a policy to convert classes at schools and academies into non-face-to-face. Non-face-to-face classes have the characteristics that instructors and learners will be spatially separated, spatially simultaneous, interactive, and teaching and learning behavior will be mediated by the screen. And these features are common to live streaming. Taking advantage of this, this study aims to approach improving the perception of game-based learning as an advantage of "watching games" beyond "playing games" by using live streaming for game-based learning. This study conducted game-based learning and game streaming learning for 210 third-year middle school students, compared the effects of game-based learning on learning interest, immersion, and satisfaction with the results of previous studies to verify the design and prove the combined effect of live streaming and game-based learning. In addition, in-depth interviews with instructors who conducted game-based learning confirmed that awareness of the introduction, value, and finance of game-based learning improved.

AB  - Current studies of complex problem-solving do not commonly evaluate the regulatory role of such personality-based variables as tolerance for uncertainty, risk-readiness, and patterns for coping with decisional conflict. This research aims to establish the contribution of those traits into individual parameters of complex problem-solving strategies. The study was conducted on 53 healthy individuals 17 to 29 years old (M = 20.42; SD = 2.34). Our own computerized complex problem task "The Anthill" was developed for this research. We identified five measurable parameters of the participants' problem-solving strategies: preferred orientational level (POL); orientational level variability (OLV); class quotas` range (R); mean and median quotas shift (MS and MeS); and abrupt changes of strategy (AC). Psychodiagnostic methods included: new questionnaire of tolerance/intolerance for uncertainty; personal decision-making factors questionnaire; Melbourne Decision Making Questionnaire; Subjective Risk Intelligence Scale; Eysencks' Impulsiveness Scale. The study showed the role of tolerance for uncertainty, risk-readiness, negative attitude toward uncertainty, and decision-making styles in the regulation of complex problem-solving strategies. Specifically, procrastination, tolerance for uncertainty, and risk-readiness were significant predictors of individual strategy indicators, such as POL, OLV, and MeS. Thus, personality traits were shown to regulate resource allocation strategies and the required level of orientation in a complex problem.

AB  - Little is known about the experiences of lesbian and bisexual women with infants or children or about their views on trade-offs required by parenthood. In this study, we examined how reactions to experiences with infants/children, perceived trade-offs of parenthood, and self-reported nurturance vary as a function of women's sexual orientation. Two hundred cis-gender childless women (53 lesbian, 57 plurisexual, 90 heterosexual) from the United States, recruited via social media, participated in this study. Results showed that lesbian women reported more negative attitudes toward infants/children and parenthood than did heterosexual women. Self-reported nurturance did not differ as a function of sexual orientation. Overall, lesbian women reported that they had less favorable experiences with infants and/or children and that they anticipated more social and economic costs involved with parenthood than did heterosexual women. Lesbian women also reported lower aspirations for parenthood than heterosexual women, and this was largely accounted for by differences in perceptions of the trade-offs involved with parenthood. Plurisexual women did not differ from lesbian or heterosexual women on any outcome. These results contribute to our understanding of why lesbian women are, on average, less likely than heterosexual women to aspire to parenthood.

AB  - The US Food and Drug Administration is tasked with communicating information to the public about the harmful chemicals in cigarette smoke. Our study used eye tracking method to test the effectiveness of messages about the harmful chemicals in cigarettes smoke among adult smokers. A sample size of 211 current cigarette smokers viewed four communication messages that included: Health effects of a chemical in cigarette smoke and an image depicting the health effect. The messages focused on arsenic, formaldehyde, uranium, and general health. Eye tracking recorded the length of time participants viewed the text and the image. After each message, the participants were asked about the messages' effectiveness in changing attitudes towards smoking. We analyzed the data using multilevel modeling, and of the 211 smokers, 59.7% were female, 36.5% were Black, and 21.3% had a high school degree or less. Compared to the general message, the messages about formaldehyde and uranium were more discouraging to smoking (p < 0.05). Messages about formaldehyde were more believable and made participants want to quit more than the general messages. Increasing message dose was significantly associated with discouraging participants from smoking and made participants want to quit (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that anti-smoking messages, containing chemical information, can successfully increase negative attitudes toward smoking cigarettes and potentially encourage quitting.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how organisational culture influences the intentions of primary care staff members (PCSM) to engage in research and development (R&D).
   Design/methodology/approach - The participants (n = 30) were PCSM employed in a care centre in south-western Sweden. The study had an observational design with an ethnographic approach. The data were collected by means of observations, interviews and analysis of documents.
   Findings - The results revealed the perceptions of PCSM in two domains, research and clinical practice, both of which existed at three different cultural levels: visible (structures and policy), semivisible (norms and values) and invisible (taken-for-granted attitudes).
   Research limitations/implications - It is difficult to conduct a purely objective ethnographic study because the investigation is controlled by its context. However, it is necessary to highlight and discuss the invisible level to improve understanding of negative attitudes and preconceptions related to the implementation of R&D in the clinical setting.
   Practical implications - By highlighting the invisible level of culture, the management of an organisation has the opportunity to initiate discussion of issues related to concealed norms and values as well as attitudes towards new thinking and change in the primary health context.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the very few studies to investigate the influence of organisational culture on the intentions of PCSM to engage in R&D.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines are one of the most effective preventive strategies for containing the pandemic. Having a better understanding of the public's conceptions of COVID-19 vaccines may aid in the effort to promptly and thoroughly vaccinate the community. However, because no empirical research has yet fully explored the public's vaccine awareness through sentiment-based topic modeling, little is known about the evolution of public attitude since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Objective: In this study, we specifically focused on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson) after vaccines became publicly available. We aimed to explore the overall sentiments and topics of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, as well as how such sentiments and main concerns evolved.
   Methods: We collected 1, 122, 139 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from December 14, 2020, to April 30, 2021, using Twitter's application programming interface. We removed retweets and duplicate tweets to avoid data redundancy, which resulted in 857, 128 tweets. We then applied sentiment-based topic modeling by using the compound score to determine sentiment polarity and the coherence score to determine the optimal topic number for different sentiment polarity categories. Finally, we calculated the topic distribution to illustrate the topic evolution of main concerns.
   Results: Overall, 398, 661 (46.51%) were positive, 204, 084 (23.81%) were negative, 245,976 (28.70%) were neutral, 6899 (0.80%) were highly positive, and 1508 (0.18%) were highly negative sentiments. The main topics of positive and highly positive tweets were planning for getting vaccination (251, 979/405, 560, 62.13%), getting vaccination (76,029/405,560, 18.75%), and vaccine information and knowledge (21,127/405, 560, 5.21%). The main concerns in negative and highly negative tweets were vaccine hesitancy (115, 206/205, 592, 56.04%), extreme side effects of the vaccines (19,690/205,592, 9.58%), and vaccine supply and rollout (17, 154/205, 592, 8.34%). During the study period, negative sentiment trends were stable, while positive sentiments could be easily influenced. Topic heatmap visualization demonstrated how main concerns changed during the current widespread vaccination campaign.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate public COVID-19 vaccine awareness and awareness trends on social media with automated sentiment-based topic modeling after vaccine rollout. Our results can help policymakers and research communities track public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and help them make decisions to promote the vaccination campaign.

TI  - Factors associated with patient and health system delays in diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis in Montenegro, 2015-2016
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS
AB  - Background
   Fundamental measures of control of tuberculosis are early detection and timely treatment of the affected. The aim of this study was to identify factors associated with patient-related and health system-related delays among patients with tuberculosis in the Republic of Montenegro.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study included 130 tuberculosis patients older than 15 years of age. The inclusion criteria were diagnosis of tuberculosis based on clinical, pathohistological and microbiological findings. Patient delay referred to the number of days between the onset of symptoms and the first consultation with general practitioner (GP). Health system delay represented the number of days between the first consultation with GP and the initiation of tuberculosis treatment. We classified delays longer than median delay length as 'prolonged delays'. Delays greater than 75th percentile of the maximum length of delay were classified as 'extreme delays'.
   Results
   Distribution of patient and health system delay in the overall delay was apprioximately equal (49% vs. 51%). Being married (OR = 2.54, p = 0.026) and having more negative attitudes towards tuberculosis (OR = 4.00, p = 0.045) were associated with extreme patient delay. Greater knowledge on tuberculosis was associated with lower likelihood of prolonged (OR = 0.24, p = 0.031) and extreme (OR = 0.30, p = 0.012) patient delay. Persons with negative sputum smear were more likely to experience prolonged (OR = 7.01, p<0.001) and extreme (OR = 4.40, p = 0.032) health system delay. Persons older than 47 years of age were more likely to experience prolonged health system delay (OR = 2.61, p = 0.042). Specialist consultation delay was associated with prolonged (OR = 1.08, p = 0.001) and extreme (OR = 1.05, p<0.001) health system delay.
   Conclusion
   Contribution to overall delay is equally distributed between the patients and the health care system. Improvement of knowledge in the general population and continuing medical education of the health care workers on tuberculosis could lead to reduction in patient and health system delays in treatment of tuberculosis.

AB  - Prior work has shown that the experience of group-based emotions can motivate disadvantaged group members to engage in collective action. In the current research, we tested whether such action can also be driven by the motivation to induce certain emotions among the outgroup to the extent that disadvantaged group members believe this would help them attain their social change goals. We tested this hypothesis in three studies (two correlational and one experimental) within the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Study 1 showed that individuals' motivation to induce outgroup regret was associated with nonviolent collective action tendencies, whereas the motivation to induce outgroup fear was related to violent action. Study 2 moved beyond Study 1 by assessing corrective and punitive goals of social change. We found that preferences for inducing outgroup regret mediated the relationship between endorsement of corrective goals and nonviolent action tendencies, whereas preferences for outgroup fear mediated the relationship between punitive goals and violent action. Study 3 provided experimental support for the causal effect of goals on emotion motivations and collective action tendencies. Together, our findings are in line with the notion of instrumental emotion regulation as applied to collective action.

AB  - Background
   A recent outbreak of COVID-19 which was initially reported in Wuhan City, China, has become a worldwide pandemic. This global public health threat drew the attention of the medical and scientific community to make the necessary research efforts to combat the spread of the virus. Predictors of preventive behaviors could be of considerable importance relevant to identifying high-risk groups to manage their behavior. We aimed to investigate the association between people's perception of COVID-19 adherence to preventive measures, susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivators, barriers, confidence, and information sources.
   Methods
   We conducted a cross-sectional study during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, enrolling 1,568 participants from WhatsApp groups, aged 16 years and above from March to April 2020 in Saudi Arabia. We prepared an online Arabic self-administered questionnaire, which consisted of (1) sociodemographic characteristics; (2) compliance to preventive measures, including the perception of susceptibility, seriousness, benefits, motivation, barriers to preventive measures, self-confidence; and (3) sources of COVID-19 information.
   Results
   Of the 1,568 participants, 60% (n = 1,004) were women, 54.1% (n = 459) were unmarried, and 80.2% (n = 1,258) had earned university degrees. Regarding compliance and perception toward preventive measures, 64% of participants washed hands with soap and water; 50% followed the cough etiquette; 17.5% avoided touching their eyes, nose, and mouth; and 34.6% never shook hands with others. Approximately 52.2%-69.7% avoided going to crowded places and wore facial masks as needed. In addition, 24.3% of people observed social distancing. However, 52.4% did not receive the annual flu vaccine. Approximately 83% used banknotes, 69.8% made online payments, and 51.8% avoided ATM/credit card use. The perception of susceptibility and the seriousness of COVID-19 infection accounted for 8.5% and 50% of participants, respectively. Perceived benefits and motivation reached more than 90%. Barriers for not being able to practice preventive measures were the fear of nasal swabs, forgetfulness, and negligence, which rated 39% and 66%, respectively. Confidence in practicing the preventive measures and distinguishing the symptoms of COVID-19 accounted for 80% and 60% of the participants, respectively. The most used sources to retrieve information were the Ministry of Health (MOH) news and reports and social media, representing 53.5% and 24.6%, respectively.
   Conclusions
   During the early phase of the pandemic, people's perception of susceptibility was low, which resulted in a lack of awareness of some citizens to take the COVID-19 infection seriously. Thus, the benefits of preventive measures did not fully translate into practice. The current successful decline of COVID-19 cases should be accompanied by continuing health promotion and disease prevention programs utilizing all avenues and opportunities to remind people of scientific, religious, and cultural practices of handwashing, coughing etiquette. The persistent use of personal protective equipment (PPE), such as facial masks, gloves, and, for frontline workers, shields and protective garments is necessary. Family physicians and teams should play a vital role in this battle.

AB  - News reporting on conflict situations mainly manipulates discursive and representational strategies in portraying people, actions and events either negatively or positively based on certain prejudiced ideologies. This article examines salient discursive strategies deployed by Nigerian and Cameroonian newspapers to represent socio-political ideologies in their reports on the Bakassi Peninsula border conflict. Data comprise 127 instances of discourse strategies drawn from two Nigerian and two Cameroonian English-medium national newspapers published between August 2006 and August 2010. By integrating insights from van Dijk's Critical Discourse Analysis, findings reveal that both countries' reports create polarity of positive in-group and negative out-group ideologies through seven discursive strategies which include slanted headlining, negative labelling, evidentiality, number game, hyperbolism, victimization and depersonalization. The strategies embody ideological prejudices of positive self- and negative other-representations which are rife in both nations' news reports on the disputed Peninsula.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to understand whether service robots can safeguard servicescapes from deviant consumer behaviour. Using routine activity theory, this research examines whether increasing the perceived humanness of service robots reduces customer intentions to commit deviant consumer behaviour and whether this negative relationship is mediated by perceived empathy and perceived risk of being caught. Design/methodology/approach Five hundred and fifty-three US residents responded to a hypothetical scenario that manipulated the humanness of a service agent (from self-service technology, to robot, to human employee) across seven conditions and measured the likelihood of deviant consumer behaviour, empathy towards the service robot, perceived risk of being caught and punished and negative attitudes towards robots. Findings The results indicate that replacing human service agents with different types of service robots does inadvertently reduce customer perceptions of capable guardianship (i.e. the human element that deters potential offenders from committing crimes) in the servicescape and creates conditions that allow customers to perpetrate more deviant consumer behaviour. Practical implications When investing in technology such as service robots, service providers need to consider the unintended cost of customer misbehaviour (specifically deviant consumer behaviour) in their return-on-investment assessments to optimise their asset investment decisions. Originality/value Moving beyond research on customer adoption and use, this research examines the unintended consequences that might arise when deploying service robots in a technology-infused service environment. Humanised service robots offer more guardianship than self-service technology but do not replace human employees in preventing deviant consumer behaviour, as they remain more capable of deterring customer misbehaviour.

AB  - Background. Most original studies and all meta-analyses conducted to date converge on the conclusion that patients with schizophrenia display rather generalized neurocognitive deficits. For the present study, we reopen this seemingly closed chapter and examine whether important influences, such as lack of motivation and negative attitudes towards cognitive assessment, result in poorer secondary neuropsychological performance.
   Method. A sample of 50 patients with an established diagnosis of schizophrenia were tested for routine neurocognitive assessment and compared to 60 nonclinical volunteers. Before and after the assessment, subjective momentary influences were examined (e.g. motivation, concerns about assessment, fear about poor outcome) for their impact on performance using a new questionnaire called the Momentary Influences, Attitudes and Motivation Impact (MIAMI) on Cognitive Performance Scale.
   Results. As expected, patients performed significantly worse than controls on all neurocognitive domains tested (large effect size, on average). However, patients also displayed more subjective momentary impairment, as well as more fears about the outcome and less motivation than controls. Mediation analyses indicated that these influences contributed to (secondary) poorer neurocognitive performance. Differences in neurocognitive scores shrank to a medium effect size, on average, when MIAMI scores were accounted for.
   Conclusions. The data argue that performance on measures of neurocognition in schizophrenia are to a considerable extent due to secondary factors. Poor motivation, fears and momentary impairments distinguished patients from controls and these variables heavily impacted performance. Before concluding that neurocognitive deficits in psychiatric patients are present, clinicians should take these confounding influences into account. Although patients with schizophrenia achieved, on average, worse test scores than controls, a large subgroup displayed spared performance.

AB  - It is typical of societies to come up with their own labels or names to any phenomenon that may befall them in the course of their life time. Human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) has been no exception to this practice. In Botswana most of these labels are either in Setswana or English whereby an Eglish expression is simply adopted and used to refer to HIV/AIDS. This study looks at the different labels or names that have been used to refer to HIV/AIDS in Botswana. It is an attempt to provide insights into perceptions of HIV/AIDS by the local communities portrayed through the naming of this disease. The study demonstrates how, through the different labels, the local communities started in denial distancing themselves from this disease and in some cases associating AIDS with ailments already known to them, cultural practices and taboos. Some of these labels further demonstrate the negative attitudes that may have fuelled HIV-related stigma in the country. Based on the informants' responses, the paper further attempts a categorisation of these labels influenced by different attitudes to HIV/AIDS, some of which are self-perpetuating and may continue to be a hindrance to the fight against the disease.

AB  - Existing empirical research on the link between ethnic minority concentration in residential environments and voting for the radical right is inconclusive, mainly due to major differences between studies in the spatial scale at which minority concentration is measured. We examined whether the presence of non-western ethnic minorities in the residential environment, measured at four spatial scales, is related to individuals' intention to vote for the Dutch Party for Freedom (Dutch acronym PVV). We combined individual level survey data and register data, and we used multi-level structural equation models to examine possible mediation by anti-immigrant attitudes and political dissatisfaction. The models show different effects at different scales. At the micro scale (100 by 100 meter grids) we find a curvilinear effect: individuals with 30-50 per cent non-western minorities in their direct living environment are most likely to report to vote for the PVV. At higher spatial scales (up to municipal level) we find that the higher the proportion of non-western minorities, the more likely individuals are to report to vote for the PVV. These effects can however not be explained by anti-immigrant attitudes or political dissatisfaction. We even find that at the micro scale the presence of non-western minorities is related to less anti-immigrant attitudes.

   This qualitative study was conducted using a content analysis approach. Purposeful sampling was performed with 28 participants (21 mothers and seven fathers) through in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews, two focus group discussions, and five interviews with key informants. All interviews were recorded and typed. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and software MAXqda2010. Analysis of participants' perspectives and experiences showed the three categories including (1) Challenges of sexual health education (challenge between tradition and modernity, poor parental self-efficacy, cultural resistance, inadequate parental sexual knowledge and matching with socio-cultural developments, lack of access to valid educational references and government counseling services, parents' negative attitude towards sexual issues and poor parent-child interactions), (2) The necessity of sexual health education (strengthening of self-control skill in adolescents, reduction in high-risk behaviors, enhancement of sexual self-esteem, emotional and sexual damage, reduction in media and cyberspace and satellite misuse), and (3) Parents' educational needs for sexual health (physical changes of puberty, psychological characteristics of puberty, cognition and ways to prevent high-risk behaviors, ways to manage offspring's sexual behaviors, communication skills between parents and children, mutual perception and building trust, and commitment and responsibility of parents towards the sexual education of the offspring).

AB  - Growing wolf (Canis lupus L.) populations in the US Rocky Mountain Region have increased conflicts between livestock production and wolf conservation. Given that the costs of large carnivore conservation are disproportionately borne by local livestock producers, the United States uses compensation for wolf damage to reduce conflicts and mediate negative attitudes toward the predators. Current compensation programs, however, only consider the direct effects of wolf predation. Indirect effects, such as wolf effects on weaning weights, and conception rates, may also reduce profitability. By not including indirect wolf effects, compensation programs may systematically undercompensate ranchers. We use a stochastic budget model of a representative cow calf ranch in northwest Wyoming to estimate the economic impact of both direct (death loss and injured calves) and indirect effects (decreased weaning weights, decreased conception rates, and increased cattle sickness) of wolf predation. Our results suggest that short-run (i.e., year-to-year) financial impacts of wolf indirect effects may be as large as or larger than the direct effects. Including indirect effects implies that the compensation ratio (i.e., number of calves compensated per confirmed depredation) necessary to fully offset the financial impacts of wolves would need to be two to three times larger than current 7:1 compensation ratio used in Wyoming.

AB  - How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using reports from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum in 2016. The effect decreases sharply with distance. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition gained, while the governing right-wing party lost votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections. This suggests incumbents are punished by voters skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position. Survey data supports this finding of a competition among right-wing parties, as individuals in exposed settlements are more fearful of immigrants and support restrictive policies only if they identify as right-wing.

AB  - Simple Summary Cancer patients undergoing active treatment may be more vulnerable to COVID-19 due to the effects of the malignant disease and the anti-cancer treatment. Assessing COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in protecting these patients from SARS-CoV-2 infection, is important due to the worldwide pandemic reaching an unprecedented third surge. Cancer patients on active neoplastic treatment had a reduced antibody response following immunization with the BNT162b2 vaccine, manifested as significantly more seronegative results and lower antibody levels compared with those of non-cancer individuals. The risk of a negative serological response was 7.35 times higher in patients on active anticancer treatment. This impaired serological response was mostly attributed to chemotherapy treatment. Cancer patients receiving non-chemotherapy treatments had a similar serologic response as those without cancer. Vaccinated cancer patients treated with chemotherapy might not be protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection and may need to continue exercising precautionary measures such as social distancing and facial masking. The BNT162b2 vaccine was shown to be highly effective in reducing the risk of COVID-19 infection in healthy individuals and patients with chronic disease. However, there are little data regarding its efficacy in patients treated for cancer. We analyzed the humoral response following vaccination with the second dose of BNT162b2 in 140 patients with solid malignancies who were receiving anti-cancer therapy at the time of vaccination and 215 participants who had not been diagnosed with cancer. Multivariate analysis was performed, followed by matching the two groups by age, gender and days from vaccination. The humoral response in the cancer patient group was significantly lower than in the non-cancer group: 20/140 seronegative (14.3%) vs. 3/215 (1.4%), p < 0.001; median IgG levels 2231 AU/mL (IQR 445-8023) vs. 4100 (IQR 2231-6774) p = 0.001 respectively. The odds ratio for negative serology results in cancer patients adjusted by age and gender was 7.35 compared to participants without cancer. This effect was observed only in chemotherapy treated patients: 17/73 seronegative (23.3%) vs. 3/215 (1.4%), p < 0.001; median IgG 1361 AU/mL vs. 4100, p < 0.001 but not in patients treated with non-chemotherapeutic drugs. Reduced immunogenicity to COVID-19 vaccine among chemotherapy-treated cancer patients, raises the need to continue exercising protective measures after vaccination in these patients.

AB  - Celebrity endorsements, though popular as a means of communicating about products, carry high risks and may lead to negative consequences for the organizations that solicit them, especially when endorsers find themselves embroiled in scandals or crises unrelated to the products they promote. This study investigates how Liu Xiang's withdrawal from the 2012 London Olympics and Sun Yang's unlicensed driving crisis affected their sponsorships of Nike and Beijing Hyundai, respectively. Attribution theory and the concept of in-group/out-group orientation provide a framework for examining both primary and secondary public reactions to these public relations crises on Sina Weibo. As a comparative study, this paper adopts both qualitative (thematic analysis of two official announcements) and quantitative methods (content analysis of 738 Weibo postings). Within a Chinese cultural context, evidence indicates that celebrity-endorsement crises are internally attributed and perceived to be controllable. Where primary public attitudes are concerned, integrity violations lead to more negative reactions; however, inclusion strategies find a better reception than distancing, regardless of the public's crisis-responsibility attributions. For secondary online reactions, Weibo posters' perceptions of external locus, controllability, and integrity violations generate more "likes" than organizational strategies, thereby proving themselves more influential online. This study ultimately provides a more comprehensive refinement of attribution theory by both conceptualizing crisis-response strategies with a discussion of Chinese cultural sensitivities and offering empirical data on the ways in which primary and secondary crisis communication affects stakeholders via social media.

AB  - Introduction: The commercial sexual exploitation of children (CSEC) is a pediatric health care problem with significant physical and mental health consequences for victims, even death. Although there exists community-wide collaborations in the United States to address professional response to CSEC, these efforts often have a limited capacity to reach adolescents and involve them in CSEC prevention. As part of a prevention strategy, the National Institute of Justice recommends educating youth about CSEC and exploiters' recruitment tactics. Despite this recommendation, little is known regarding American youth knowledge of CSEC.
   Methods: A descriptive research design was used for this study. All adolescents, male and female, presenting to a high-volume urban pediatric hospital-based Midwestern Child Advocacy Center (CAC) due to concerns for alleged sexual abuse were invited to participate in the study by answering a self-administered electronic questionnaire. This questionnaire explores the participants' knowledge, awareness, and attitudes about CSEC, in addition to collecting demographic data, such as participant age, gender identity, grade, school district, and school.
   Results: During the six-month study period, 286 CAC patients were eligible to participate in the study. Nearly all participants (n = 217; 97%) agreed that pimping is wrong. While the majority of participants indicated an awareness of human trafficking (n = 198; 94%) and sex trafficking (n = 193; 87%); just (n = 91; 41%) had heard of labor trafficking. Fewer participants (n = 55; 25%) identified that a doctor, nurse, or other health care provider had ever spoken with them about sex trafficking.
   Discussion: Study participants overwhelmingly conveyed negative attitudes toward CSEC. Participating adolescents indicated a significantly higher awareness of sex trafficking (87%) versus labor trafficking (10%). Sex trafficking receives more attention in the media than labor trafficking. Given that study participants indicated hearing about trafficking primarily from the media (74%) and family/friends, this may explain the deficit in labor trafficking awareness. Although study participants demonstrated mostly accurate baseline knowledge of CSEC, that knowledge was not universal.

AB  - Background: Misconceptions are a major barrier to managing and stopping the spread of AIDS, and they cause a negative attitude towards people stricken by this serious disease that might result in grave harm to their physical and emotional spirit. This study aimed to identify determinants about misconceptions of HIV transmission among Ethiopian married women.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) data set. The samples were selected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling technique. The data were analyzed with SPSS version 24. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of misconception about HIV transmission. An adjusted odds ratio with a 95% confidence interval and P-value <0.05 were considered to declare a statistically significant association.
   Results: Of the samples of 8893 reproductive-age women, 34%, 18.5%, and 14.5% of women believed that mosquito bites, food sharing with an individual who is HIV seropositive, and witchcraft or supernatural means, respectively, were responsible for the acquisition of HIV/AIDS. Women residing in rural areas (AOR=1.52; 95% CI=1.13-2.0), did not attend education (AOR=2.36; 95% CI=1.3-4.23), attended primary education (AOR=1.8; 95% CI=1.03-3.21), unemployed (AOR=1.17; 95% CI=1.04-1.37), and had no media access (AOR=1.34; 95% CI=1.14-1.58) were positively associated with the misconception that mosquito bites can transmit HIV.
   Conclusion: Misconceptions are highly prevalent and increase the likelihood of the HIV epidemic in Ethiopia. This research revealed that women residing in a rural area, who did not have education, did not have access to media, who were catholic and Muslim religion followers, had not ever been tested for HIV, and unemployed women were strongly associated with a misconception about HIV transmission. Therefore, interventional health education programs should be taken into account to eradicate misconceptions about HIV.

AB  - The Ebola outbreak of 2014-2015 raised concerns about the disease's potential spread in the U.S. and received significant news media coverage. Prior research has shown that news media coverage of policy options can influence public opinion regarding those policies, as well as public attitudes toward the broader social issues and target populations addressed by such policies. To assess news media coverage of Ebola policies, the content of U.S.-focused news stories (n=1262) published between July 1 and November 30, 2014 from 12 news sources was analyzed for 13 policy-related messages. Eight-two percent of news stories mentioned one or more policy-related messages. The most frequently appearing policy-related messages overall were those about isolation (47%) and quarantine (40%). The least frequently mentioned policy-related message described dividing potentially exposed persons into distinct groups based on their level of Ebola risk in order to set different levels of restrictions (5%). Message frequency differed depending on whether news sources were located in an area that experienced an Ebola case or controversy, by news sources' political ideological perspective, and by type of news source (print and television). All policy-related messages showed significant increases in frequency after the first case of Ebola was diagnosed in the U.S. on September 30, 2014, with the exception of messages related to isolation, which showed a significant decrease. Results offer insight into how the news media covers policies to manage emerging disease threats. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has a tradition for being among the most respected national police organisations globally. More recent political events in Hong Kong have however placed the HKPF in highly visible public order situations. A wide array of political factions have emerged as a consequence of the handover of control in Hong Kong, many of which have involved young people protesting the curtailment of democratic rights. In this paper, we utilise Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (n = 2075). We utilise Inglehart's (1971. The silent revolution in Europe: intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. American political science review, 65 (4), 991-1017) concept of postmaterialism to examine how far young people's more negative attitudes to the police can be underpinned by cohort-based (or generational) explanations. Our findings identify associations between postmaterialist values and lower confidence in the police. Those that favoured stricter immigration controls, experienced higher fear of crime, perceived drug selling in their area, and consumed certain types of media (notably television and new media) were also less likely to have confidence in the HKPF.

AB  - Decades of intergroup contact research have found that contact with outgroups reduces negative attitudes. Yet, few studies have examined the association between contact and anti-fat attitudes. Further-more, testing different facets of contact, namely contact quantity versus contact duration, provides more precise theoretical predictions for their effectiveness in this under-tested context. This study examined whether intergroup anxiety was indirectly related to and contact favorability moderated the relation-ship between contact and anti-fat attitudes, tested through the constructs of contact quantity (i.e., how many individuals interacted with) and contact duration (i.e., how often time was spent). Undergradu-ates (N = 343; 260 women) based in the United States completed an online survey assessing intergroup contact, contact favorability, intergroup anxiety, and anti-fat attitudes. Analyses of conditional indirect effects showed that longer contact but not more contact reduced intergroup anxiety, which lowered anti-fat attitudes. The indirect paths for both contact types were not conditional upon contact favorability. Contact favorability moderated the association between contact duration and anti-fat attitudes such that longer and more favorable contact lowered anti-fat attitudes. Findings are discussed within the contact hypothesis, and future research should explore the distinct elements of the hypothesis as applicable to anti-fat prejudice in in-person and online contexts.

AB  - Public perception is a key factor influencing current conservation policy. Therefore, it is important to determine the influence of the public, end-users and scientists on the prioritisation of conservation issues and the direct implications for policy makers. Here, we assessed public attitudes and the perception of conservation managers to five non-native species in the UK, with these supplemented by those of an ecosystem user, freshwater anglers. We found that threat perception was not influenced by the volume of scientific research or by the actual threats posed by the specific non-native species. Media interest also reflected public perception and vice versa. Anglers were most concerned with perceived threats to their recreational activities but their concerns did not correspond to the greatest demonstrated ecological threat. The perception of conservation managers was an amalgamation of public and angler opinions but was mismatched to quantified ecological risks of the species. As this suggests that invasive species management in the UK is vulnerable to a knowledge gap, researchers must consider the intrinsic characteristics of their study species to determine whether raising public perception will be effective. The case study of the topmouth gudgeon Pseudorasbora parva reveals that media pressure and political debate has greater capacity to ignite policy changes and impact studies on non-native species than scientific evidence alone.

AB  - Introduction This study was undertaken to determine public attitudes toward laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and to determine how they are impacted by age, gender, and obesity.
   Methods One hundred fifty-two citizens completed a validated questionnaire. Pearson correlations were computed to determine relationships among items queried. Scores ranged from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest) and are presented as median, mean +/- SD.
   Results The citizens generally liked their physique (4, 4 +/- 1.0) and felt attractive (4, 4 +/- 1.0). LESS surgery was appealing if it involved no more risk or recovery and none to minimally more pain, operative time, and cost. Older and heavier citizens were more interested in reduced risk, pain, and operative/recovery time and less interested in scarring/appearance. Thirty-nine percent would consider NOTES, though only with no more risk, pain, operative time, and cost (<$200). Older people regarded NOTES more favorably. Lack of scarring with NOTES was most important by only 32% of those participants that would consider undergoing a NOTES procedure.
   Conclusion Acceptance of LESS surgery and NOTES depends upon no additional risk and no or minimally increased pain, recovery time, and cost. Improved cosmesis is not generally a priority, particularly in older or heavier people. Safety, pain, and recovery time remain major issues in deciding operative choices.

AB  - Recent research claims that American public opinion about welfare, long racialized, has become "immigrationized," or formed on the basis of people's feelings about immigration. However, the evidence to date is incapable of ruling out two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link. Attitudes toward immigrants and welfare recipients may instead be linked because both are shaped by the broadly ethnocentric dimension of generalized social conservatism, an orientation that fosters animosity toward a wide variety of stigmatized out-groups. They may also be correlated because stereotypes about immigrants' use of welfare are salient in opinions about immigration. This paper scrutinizes the theoretical underpinnings of each competing model and reports on a series of placebo tests, observational studies, and survey experiments designed to assess them. The results of these studies raise doubts about the centrality of immigration attitudes in American public opinion about welfare and bolster the two alternative explanations for the immigration-welfare link.

AB  - Opioid pain reliever addiction has increased among women of reproductive age over the last fifteen years. News media and public attention have focused on the implications of this trend for infants exposed to opioids prenatally, with state policy responses varying in the extent to which they are punitive or public health oriented. We fielded a six-group randomized experiment among a nationally representative sample of US adults to test the effects of narratives portraying a woman with opioid pain reliever addiction during pregnancy on beliefs about people addicted to opioid pain relievers, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, policy attitudes, and emotional responses. Portraying a high socioeconomic status (SES) woman in the narrative lowered perceptions of individual blame for addiction and reduced public support for punitive policies. Depicting the barriers to treatment faced by a low SES woman lowered support for punitive policies and increased support for expanded insurance coverage for treatment. The extent to which narratives portraying successfully treated addiction affected public attitudes depended on the SES of the woman portrayed. These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma toward this population, reduce support for punitive policies, and increase support for more public health oriented approaches to addressing this problem.

AB  - Background: Whilst there is literature on the impact of SARS viruses in the severely immunosuppressed, less is known about the link between routine immunosuppressant use and outcome in COVID-19. Consequently, guidelines on their use vary depending on specific patient populations.
   Methods: The study population was drawn from the COPE Study (COVID-19 in Older People), a multicentre observational cohort study, across the UK and Italy. Data were collected between 27 February and 28 April 2020 by trained data-collectors and included all unselected consecutive admissions with COVID-19. Load (name/number of medications) and dosage of immunosuppressant were collected along with other covariate data. Primary outcome was time-to-mortality from the date of admission (or) date of diagnosis, if diagnosis was five or more days after admission. Secondary outcomes were Day-14 mortality and time-to-discharge. Data were analysed with mixed-effects, Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models using non-users of immunosuppressants as the reference group.
   Results: In total 1184 patients were eligible for inclusion. The median (IQR) age was 74 (62-83), 676 (57%) were male, and 299 (25.3%) died in hospital (total person follow-up 15,540days). Most patients exhibited at least one comorbidity, and 113 (similar to 10%) were on immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased mortality: aHR 1.87, 95% CI: 1.30, 2.69 (time to mortality) and aOR 1.71, 95% CI: 1.01-2.88 (14-day mortality). There also appeared to be a dose-response relationship.
   Conclusion: Despite possible indication bias, until further evidence emerges we recommend adhering to public health measures, a low threshold to seek medical advice and close monitoring of symptoms in those who take immunosuppressants routinely regardless of their indication. However, it should be noted that the inability to control for the underlying condition requiring immunosuppressants is a major limitation, and hence caution should be exercised in interpretation of the results.
   Plain Language Summary
   Regular Use of Immune Suppressing Drugs is Associated with Increased Risk of Death in Hospitalised Patients with COVID-19
   Background: We do not have much information on how the COVID-19 virus affects patients who use immunosuppressants, drugs which inhibit or reduce the activity of the immune system. There are various conflicting views on whether immune-suppressing drugs are beneficial or detrimental in patients with the disease.
   Methods: This study collected data from 10 hospitals in the UK and one in Italy between February and April 2020 in order to identify any association between the regular use of immunosuppressant medicines and survival in patients who were admitted to hospital with COVID-19.
   Results: 1184 patients were included in the study, and 10% of them were using immunosuppressants. Any immunosuppressant use was associated with increased risk of death, and the risk appeared to increase if the dose of the medicine was higher.
   Conclusion: We therefore recommend that patients who take immunosuppressant medicines routinely should carefully adhere to social distancing measures, and seek medical attention early during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In line with Allport's contact hypothesis, previous research showed that direct intergroup contact can reduce prejudices. However, establishing face-to-face contact is not always feasible. We postulate that Facebook-groups are a setting where direct and observed intergroup contact can develop, reducing prejudices and increasing mutual acceptance. Analyzing the comments of nine Facebook-groups with the destructive and constructive conflict scale, our results indicated that the expression of prejudices decreased and that of mutual acceptance increased over time, both for in- and outgroup members of the Facebook-groups. Only the expression of less prejudices, but not that of more mutual acceptance was predicted by intergroup contact. The influence of group-based motivations on the engagement in intergroup contact is discussed, and the overall findings are integrated in Steele and Brown's process model of media practices.

AB  - Anti-tobacco propaganda media (Television, radio, print media and internet media) messages promote knowledge regarding the ill effect of tobacco on the human body as well as increase the negative attitude towards tobacco. However, their role in maintaining tobacco abstinence is not explored much. This review summarizes the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on the maintenance of tobacco abstinence; the influence of different types of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on tobacco users and non-users. Tobacco users and recent quitters are not benefiting from these anti-tobacco propaganda and media messages. The graphic pictorial warnings were found to have more influence over increasing knowledge, changing attitude, enhancing quit attempts, quit intentions, and motivation to quit. However, it is also noticed that these anti-tobacco propaganda media messages have a boomerang effect on tobacco users. These media propaganda messages sometimes act as a cue for tobacco users and make them relapse. Many studies in the past have shown that these media messages positively impact the quitting process but, again, remained significant to the first attempt only. Hence, these messages have not been found to be very effective in maintaining tobacco abstinence among tobacco users. The exposure and frequency of the anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages matter. Pro- tobacco advertisements can neutralize the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda messages. Although, anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages play a crucial role in modifying tobacco-related behaviour.

AB  - The goal of this study was to investigate whether the sexual objectification and virtual violence against females in video games increases negative attitudes toward females, when addressing a variety of noted methodological issues. Study participants were randomly assigned to a control group, where participants played Madden NFL 12, or an experimental group, where participants played Grand Theft Auto. In the experimental group, participants played the game with a confederate, who exposed participants to sexual objectification and violence against females. Study results indicated that both the experimental and control groups had equivalently low levels of rape myth acceptance prior to game play. Immediately after game play, there still was no statistically significant difference in rape myth acceptance between groups; however, there was a decrease in rape myth acceptance for the experimental group. The decrease in rape myth acceptance continued and magnified for the experimental group, over time, to the point of creating a statistically significant difference between the two groups for the follow-up measure at the end of the study.

AB  - Purpose - This purpose of this paper is to investigate whether higher education instructors use information from Wikipedia for teaching and research.
   Design/methodology/approach This is an explorative study to identify important factors regarding user acceptance and use of emerging information resources and technologies in the academic community. A total of 201 participants around the world answered an online questionnaire administered by a commercial provider. The questionnaire consisted of 16 Likert-scaled questions to assess participants' agreement with each question along with an optional open-ended explanation.
   Findings The findings of this project confirm that internet access was related to faculty technology use. Online resources and references were ranked the first choice by the participants when searching for familiar and unfamiliar topics. The investigator found that participants' academic ranking status, frequency of e-mail use and academic discipline were related to their use of online databases, web-based information and directing students to information from the Web. Although the participants might often use online resources for research and teaching, Wikipedia's credibility was the participants' major concern.
   Research limitations/implications This project is an exploratory study and more considerations are needed for this research area.
   Originality/value The paper shows that participants who used online databases more often showed a negative attitude toward Wikipedia. Those participants who used Wikipedia for teaching and research also allowed students to use information from Wikipedia and were more likely to be contributors to Wikipedia.

AB  - This paper describes a case study of the adoption and implementation of the sugar-sweetened beverage tax in South Africa, termed the Health Promotion Levy. Qualitative data extraction and analysis of institutional documents, such as policy proposals and parliamentary debate records, stakeholder submissions to Parliament and media reports, were guided by the Kingdon Multiple Streams Theory as adapted to study agenda setting, policy adoption, and implementation. We present the following key findings: First, consistent messaging from policy entrepreneurs, consisting of advocacy groups, health organizations, and research entities, was key to ensuring that a tax policy solution was proposed and passed. Second, the continuity of certain key policymakers contributed to the relatively expedient passage of the tax policy. Third, the use of an excise tax was, amongst others, an appealing policy solution because of its revenue-raising potential; however, uncertainty regarding the purpose of the tax negatively impacted public attitudes toward it. Fourth, industry arguments, relating to unemployment, were effective in restructuring the tax in favor of industry actors. Finally, regulatory action by sectors outside of finance and health impacted stakeholder perceptions of the tax and possibly obstructed regular annual adjustments for inflation.

AB  - For older adolescents, the COVID-19 pandemic and UK restrictions arrived during a critical period in the transition to adulthood. Early research exploring impact of the pandemic paints a picture of worsened adolescent wellbeing and mental health. We explore the subjective experiences of 16- to 19-year-olds during the first UK lockdown, with an emphasis on wellbeing and coping, to complement quantitative evidence and inform strategies and provision for support. In May 2020, we invited UK-based 16- to 19-year-olds to share written accounts of their experiences of the initial UK lockdown for The TELL Study. A total of 109 participants engaged, submitting anonymous written accounts via an online survey portal. We used inductive reflexive thematic analysis to develop rich experiential themes. We constructed seven main themes: heightened emotionality; feelings of loss, change, and uncertainty; recognizing the value of self-care; efforts to think positively; opportunities for relief, growth, and development; the importance of togetherness; and frustration with government and media. Findings highlight the multifaceted nature of adolescents' lockdown experiences, and offer insight into emotional impact and new concerns alongside the value placed on self-care and staying connected. We offer directions for supporting adolescents as pandemic consequences continue.

AB  - Research on de-radicalisation has been primarily concerned with the efficacy of de-radicalisation programmes and their negative consequences. However, there has been little research on how the public perceives de-radicalisation programmes and whether they are viewed as effective or desirable. It is important to understand public attitudes to de-radicalisation programmes because public opinion can affect the capacity to deliver the programmes. The following article takes a first step towards understanding these issues by examining how The Daily Mail has framed de-radicalisation in terms of whether or not the programmes are effective or desirable. We argue that an assumption of potential efficacy exists throughout the newspaper's framing of de-radicalisation which presents the policy as desirable, despite also framing de-radicalisation as ineffective. While practitioners are reluctant to promote de-radicalisation programmes, The Daily Mail's framing of de-radicalisation as natural, logical and desirable reflects the concept's ideological flexibility as both a rehabilitative and normative endeavour.

AB  - Background Patient awareness plays an important role in integrating palliative care into the patient care process. Lack of awareness can create a negative attitude towards palliative care and affect patients' decisions during the treatment process. The present study was conducted to determine the level of knowledge about palliative care in Iranian patients with cancer. Methods The descriptive study was conducted with a convenience sample of 103 cancer patients admitted to an oncology center in Yazd, Iran, A three-part questionnaire including demographic information, sources of palliative care information and the Palliative Care Knowledge Scale (PaCKS) was used to collect data. All statistical analyses were performed using software SPSS 21. Results The mean age of patients was 36.2 +/- 13.5 years. Of the total, 38.8% of patients received information about palliative care through the media and 36.9% from the treatment team. On a scale of 0 to 13, the mean PaCKS score was 6.7 +/- 3.7. A 'good' level of knowledge was reported by 29.1% of participants; however 84.5% stated that they should leave other doctors at the time of receiving palliative care, 71.8% considered palliative care for patients in the last six months of life, 84.5% considered palliative care for patients with cancer, and 70.9% stated that palliative care encourages people to discontinue treatments aimed at treating their disease. Conclusion Our study found most cancer patients have a moderate to weak level of knowledge and considerable misinformation about palliative care, which highlights the importance of providing palliative care education. The development of training programs in this area could play an effective role in improving patients' knowledge of palliative care.

AB  - Objectives To investigate doctors' intentions to raise a patient safety concern by applying the socio-psychological model 'Theory of Planned Behaviour'. Design Qualitative semi-structured focus groups and interviews. Setting Training venues across England (North West, South East and South West). Participants Sampling was purposeful to include doctors from differing backgrounds and grades. Main outcome measures Perceptions of raising a patient safety concern. Results While raising a concern was considered an appropriate professional behaviour, there were multiple barriers to raising a concern, which could be explained by the Theory of Planned Behaviour. Negative attitudes operated due to a fear of the consequences, such as becoming professionally isolated. Disapproval for raising a concern was encountered at an interpersonal and organisational level. Organisational constraints of workload and culture significantly undermined the raising of a concern. Responses about concerns were often side-lined or not taken seriously, leading to demotivation to report. This was reinforced by high-profile cases in the media and the negative treatment of whistle-blowers. While regulator guidance acted as an enabler to justify raising a concern, doctors felt disempowered to raise a concern about people in positions of greater power, and ceased to report concerns due to a perceived lack of action about concerns raised previously. Conclusions Intentions to raise a concern were complex and highly contextual. The Theory of Planned Behaviour is a useful model to aid understanding of the factors which influence the decision to raise a concern. Results point to implications for policymakers, including the need to publicise positive stories of whistle-blowers and providing greater support to doctors.

AB  - Japan disputes the sovereignty of two islands: Senkaku/Diaoyu with China and Takeshima/Dokdo with South Korea. These disputes have triggered political performances. In August 2012, Chinese activists landed on Senkaku/Diaoyu, and South Korean politicians landed on Takeshima/Dokdo. The group threat theory suggests that these events constitute threats to Japanese citizens, which lead to negative attitudes towards these countries. The theory also expects personal variations in the reactions to the threats, and the empirical findings of the theory predict an improvement in the worsened attitudes immediately after the event. Drawing on a Japanese social survey that was conducted every month for the two years during which these landing events occurred, I tested the effect of the events on Japanese attitudes towards China and South Korea in a natural experimental framework. The results show that the events negatively impacted Japanese attitudes towards both countries. However, contrary to the expectations of the group threat theory, individual variations (i.e., socioeconomic status, media exposure, and political orientation) in the responses to the events are not supported. Additionally, the attitudes do not return to preevent levels for one year. The contradictions between previous studies and this study potentially originate from the importance of the territories.

TI  - Does Successful Use of Digital Learning Materials Predict Teachers' Intention to Use Them Again in the Future?

AB  - Do perceptions of success in using digital learning materials (DLMs) regularly (i.e., several times a week) strengthen (or weaken) teachers' behavioural intentions to use DLMs again? And which psychological factors have a relationship with the intention to use DLMs again? These questions are important in light of stimulating teacher's use of DLMs. To answer this question, teacher "flows" were analysed using crosstabs and multinomial logistic regression. These flows visualize how teachers go from a certain degree of perceived success to a certain strength of behavioural intention. Second, Hayes (2013) process method and structured equation modeling (SEM) techniques were applied to determine the mediating role of attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioural control of perceived success on the behavioural intention. The results suggested that the teachers' strength in behavioural intention was in accordance with their perceived success for the case that their self-prediction was positive but that this strength became weaker when teachers' self-prediction was negative. Attitude and perceived norm mediated the effects only when self-prediction was positive whereas perceived behaviour control did this in both cases. Also, there was a direct effect between perceived success and behavioural intention. It is important that teachers get a chance to experience success with the use of DLMs, enabled either by school leaders (regarding in-service teachers) or by teacher training institutions (regarding pre-service teachers). Only then we will see teachers' willingness to use DLMs on a regular basis to grow.

AB  - Indoor tanning (IT) increases risk of developing skin cancer. A social media campaign to reduce mother's permissiveness toward their teenage daughters IT was evaluated. Mothers (N = 869) of daughters aged 14-17 in 34 states without bans on IT by minors were enrolled in a randomized trial with assessments at baseline and 12-months follow-up in 2017-19. A year-long adolescent health campaign was delivered to all mothers. The intervention group received posts on preventing IT and the control group, posts about preventing prescription drug misuse. Daughters (n = 469; 54.0%) completed the assessments at baseline and 12 months. At 12-month follow-up, intervention-group mothers were less permissive of IT by daughters (unadjusted means = 1.70 [95% CI: 1.59, 1.80] v. 1.85 [1.73, 1.97] [5-point Likert scale], b = -0.152), reported more communication about avoiding IT with daughters (4.09 [3.84, 4.35] v. 3.42 [3.16, 3.68] [sum of 7 yes/no items], b = 0.213), and had lower intentions to indoor tan (1.41 [1.28, 1.55] v. 1.60 [1.43, 1.76] [7-point likelihood scale], b = -0.221) than control-group mothers. Daughters confirmed intervention-group mothers communicated about IT (3.81 [3.49, 4.14] v. 3.20 [2.87, 3.53] [sum of 7 yes/no items], b = 0.237) and shared IT posts (unadjusted percentages = 52.4% v. 36.4%, b = 0.438) more than control-group mothers. No differences were found in IT behavior, self-efficacy to refuse permission, and negative attitudes toward IT. A social media campaign may be an effective strategy to convince mothers to withhold permission for IT, which may help increase the effectiveness of state laws designed to reduce IT by minors by requiring parental permission.

AB  - Background and Aims: COVID-19 has impacted everyone's life and livelihood in one way or the other. Individual response to measures taken to control the rapid spread of this disease depend on their knowledge and perceptions. Hence, we proposed to evaluate responses about COVID-19 among the health care workers (HCWs) as well as general public participants (GPPs).
   Material and Methods: This was a cross-sectional, observational survey conducted during the peak of the pandemic. The 35-items questionnaire was prepared using Google forms and distributed through e-mails and social media.
   Results: The 1,026 responses comprised of 558 HCWs (54.4%) and 468 GPPs (45.6%). The most reliable source of information was TV news for 43% GPPs, whereas it was HCWs/Local health authorities for 36.8% HCWs. HCWs had sufficient knowledge regarding COVID-19, while it was relatively low among GPPs (average correct response 65% and 53%, respectively). Intra-group analysis with respect to age, sex, qualification, and socioeconomic status showed that knowledge about mode of transmission by airborne aerosols was significantly low with respect to qualification among GPPs while younger age group (<40 years) HCWs had significantly more knowledge about mode of transmission and asymptomatic carriers. Paranoia of contracting the infection was significantly higher in GPPs with upper and middle socioeconomic status and younger HCWs.
   Conclusion: HCWs had moderate level of knowledge, whereas GPPs had low to moderate knowledge, with large scope of improvement in both groups. Continued education, both at professional and community level will not only be helpful but also necessary to improve knowledge, avert negative attitudes and control the devastating pandemic.

AB  - While different variants of COVID-19 dramatically affected the lives of millions of people across the globe, a new version of COVID-19, "SARS-CoV-2 Omicron," emerged. This paper analyzes the public attitude and sentiment towards the emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant on Twitter. The proposed approach relies on the text analytics of Twitter data considering tweets, retweets, and hashtags' main themes, the pandemic restriction, the efficacy of covid-19 vaccines, transmissible variants, and the surge of infection. A total of 18,737 tweets were pulled via Twitter Application Programming Interface (API) from December 3, 2021, to December 26, 2021, using the SentiStrength software that employs a lexicon of sentiment terms and a set of linguistic rules. The analysis was conducted to distinguish and codify subjective content and estimate the strength of positive and negative sentiment with an average of 95% confidence intervals based upon emotion strength scales of 1-5. It is found that negativity was dominated after the outbreak of Omicron and scored 31.01% for weak, 16.32% for moderate, 5.36% for strong, and 0.35% for very strong sentiment strength. In contrast, positivity decreased gradually and scored 16.48% for weak, 11.19% for moderate, 0.80% for strong, 0.04% for very strong sentiment strength. Identifying the public emotional status would help the concerned authorities to provide appropriate strategies and communications to relieve public worries towards pandemics.

TI  - Is the Anthropomorphization of Sex Dolls Associated with Objectification and Hostility Toward Women? A Mixed Method Study among Doll Users
T2  - JOURNAL OF SEX RESEARCH
LA  - English
KW  - DEHUMANIZATION
KW  - EXPERIENCES
KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Both the ownership and development of sex dolls and robots are passionately debated, with skeptics suspecting that their increasing human-likeness and the accompanying anthropomorphization (i.e., attributing human-likeness) reinforce the objectification of, and hostility toward, women. As empirical data are largely lacking, we scrutinized this hypothesis in a pre-registered study among doll owners (N = 217), comparing two user groups: "toy group" (n = 104; doll as sex toy) and "partner group" (n = 113; doll as partner). We related their objectification tendencies (i.e., seeing women merely as objects, e.g., to promote sexual desire) as well as their hostility toward women, to the anthropomorphization of their doll. Additionally, we collected qualitative data on how participants perceived their doll usage affected their attitudes toward women. The partner group expressed greater levels of hostility and anthropomorphization, moderate in magnitude. Objectification mediated the influence of anthropomorphization on hostility and a higher percentage described a change in attitudes toward women in response to doll use. These data provide the first empirical evidence that the tendency to anthropomorphize dolls is related to negative attitudes toward women. Given the ongoing development of sex robots designed to surpass dolls in human-likeness and anthropomorphization, this finding seems highly significant.

AB  - At first sight, French nuclear energy policy offers a textbook example of how technical, constitutional and economic restrictions, powerful interest groups and path dependence constrain democratic responsiveness. This paper uses what might seem to be an unlikely case in order to question explanations of policy choices in terms of technocracy, path dependence and interest groups against the background of an under-estimated factor: party and coalition strategies. The original data collected on public attitudes towards nuclear energy and the attention dedicated to this issue in the media, as well as in the parliamentary and electoral arenas, show that the effect of public opinion is conditioned by party incentives to politicise the issue at stake. In other words, parties and coalition-making constraints act as a mediating variable between citizens' preferences and policy choices. These findings point to the need to integrate this conditional variable into analyses of responsiveness and models of policymaking.

AB  - Lassa fever had been reported as a cause of death especially in endemic parts of Nigeria. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward Lassa fever control and prevention among residents of Ile-Ife, southwest Nigeria. Descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted among consenting randomly selected adults using an interviewer administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. A total of 400 questionnaires with completed data were analyzed (response rate 96%). Majority, 207 (51.8%), were males while 193 (48.2%) were females. Most, 234 (58.5%), had tertiary education while 148 (37%) had secondary education. Fifty-nine percent had heard of Lassa fever with radio as their major source of information. About 76% had inadequate knowledge, 54% had negative attitude while 51% had poor practice toward Lassa fever. Determinants of knowledge of Lassa fever include having higher education (Adjusted Odd Ratio (AOR)=11.49, 95% CI [3.10, 42.69], p=.0001), being in civil service (AOR=0.22, 95% CI [0.09, 0.51], p=.01), and earning higher income (AOR=4.23, 95% CI [2.61, 6.84], p=.0001). In conclusion, the knowledge, attitude, as well as preventive practices to Lassa fever were poor. It is necessary to increase public education and improve hygienic practices.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the competences in librarianship and information communication and technology (ICT) skills between different designations of library professionals (librarian, deputy librarian, assistant librarian and library assistants and others) working in the engineering college libraries affiliated with Visvesvaraya Technological University (VTU), Belgaum (www.vtu.ac.in) in Karnataka state, India.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study adopts a combined methodology of theory, fieldwork and the data gathering tools used which included questionnaire, observation and interaction with library and information professionals.
   Findings - The majority of the library professionals working in the engineering colleges in Karnataka state have chosen this profession by accident. The significant difference is observed between different designations towards competence on operation of computers, creation of files and folders, radio frequency identification, library automation software modules, various operating systems, internet-related skills, web design/web editors, search engines and digitization of IR. Compared to all designations, librarians have more skills on web designs. The majority of the professionals are facing financial problems, overload of work and negative attitude of the higher authority in acquiring ICT skills.
   Originality/value - This is the first ever study of library professionals working in technical institutions in Karnataka state (India) about the competences in ICT and librarianship.

AB  - Previous studies aimed at understanding public responses to emerging technologies have given limited attention to the social and cultural processes through which public concerns emerge. When probed, these have tended to be explained either in cognitive social psychological terms, typically in the form of cognitive shortcuts or heuristics or the influence of affective variables, or in social interactionist terms, as a product of the micro dynamics of the social interaction. We argue for an alternative approach that examines how public attitudes are formed in relation to the interplay of wider cultural narratives about science and technology. Using data from recent qualitative research with publics on nanotechnology and other emerging technologies, we develop a typology of five cultural narratives that underpin and structure public talk. The narratives we identify within focus group talk are familiar stories that are deeply embedded in contemporary culture, and which provide cultural resources for navigating the issues posed by emerging technology. Substantively, they inform a 'tragic' mood on the prospects of emerging technology, reflecting the loss of belief in science, when coupled to neo-liberal logics, as guaranteeing social progress. The implications for policy-making are discussed.

AB  - Immersive virtual reality has become increasingly popular to improve the assessment and treatment of health problems. This rising popularity is likely to be facilitated by the availability of affordable headsets that deliver high quality immersive experiences. As many health problems are more prevalent in older adults, who are less technology experienced, it is important to know whether they are willing to use immersive virtual reality. In this study, we assessed the initial attitude towards head-mounted immersive virtual reality in 76 older adults who had never used virtual reality before. Furthermore, we assessed changes in attitude as well as self-reported cybersickness after a first exposure to immersive virtual reality relative to exposure to time-lapse videos. Attitudes towards immersive virtual reality changed from neutral to positive after a first exposure to immersive virtual reality, but not after exposure to time-lapse videos. Moreover, self-reported cybersickness was minimal and had no association with exposure to immersive virtual reality. These results imply that the contribution of VR applications to health in older adults will neither be hindered by negative attitudes nor by cybersickness.

AB  - We interviewed 61 Muslims in 15 focus groups from the most visible Muslim population in the United States: the Detroit Metropolitan Area. Participants shared their experiences of and responses to Islamophobia on social media and face-to-face during the 2016 US presidential election campaign and aftermath. Applying Fraser's and Squires' theories of counterpublics, we developed an adapted understanding of counterpublics in collapsed contexts of online and face-to-face spaces. We argue that everyday Muslim internet users in the United States are an example of a hyper differential counterpublic. They face the pressures of near ubiquitous and ever evolving Islamophobic attacks, while needing to engage with the internet for personal and professional purposes. We suggest that hyper differential counterpublics operate in collapsed contexts of mixed, unimaginable publics, switch between group and individual responses, and craft hyper situational responses to discriminations case by case.

AB  - Many current measures of eating disorder (ED) symptoms have 1 or more serious limitations, such as inconsistent factor structures or poor discriminant validity. The goal of this study was to overcome these limitations through the development of a comprehensive multidimensional measure of eating pathology. An initial pool of 160 items was developed to assess 20 dimensions of eating pathology. The initial item pool was administered to a student sample (N = 433) and community sample (N = 407) to determine the preliminary structure of the measure using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The revised measure was administered to independent samples of patients recruited from specialty ED treatment centers (N = 158), outpatient psychiatric clinics (N = 303), and students (N = 227). Analyses revealed an 8-factor structure characterized by Body Dissatisfaction, Binge Eating, Cognitive Restraint, Excessive Exercise, Restricting, Purging, Muscle Building, and Negative Attitudes Toward Obesity. Scale scores showed excellent convergent and discriminant validity; other analyses demonstrated that the majority of scales were invariant across sex and weight categories. Eating Pathology Symptoms Inventory scale scores had excellent internal consistency (median coefficient alphas ranged from .84-.89) and reliability over a 2- to 4-week period (mean retest r = .73). The current study represents one of the most comprehensive scale development projects ever conducted in the field of EDs and will enhance future basic and treatment research focused on EDs.

AB  - Background and ObjectivesHeroin use is a severe problem worldwide. To develop more effective treatments for heroin abusers, a comprehensive psychosocial model of heroin use should be established and examined. We created and assessed a neuroticism, depression, attitudes, and heroin addiction (NDA) model.
   MethodsIn this cross-sectional study, 234 patients undergoing methadone replacement treatment were recruited from psychiatric clinics. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to assess all for neuroticism, depression, and a positive outcome expectancy (POE) (attitudes).
   ResultsThe full model had acceptable goodness-of-fit indices, but neuroticism was not significantly associated with a POE or heroin use. A reduced model that deleted insignificant paths had better goodness-of-fit indices, and neuroticism had indirect effects on heroin use via depression and a POE
   ConclusionsOur findings provide evidence that depression, neuroticism, and POE affect heroin use. We also found that POE mediates between depression and heroin use. Despite the emotional regulation strategies recommended to help heroin abusers with depression to reduce the likelihood of their heroin use, teaching them with negative attitudes using heroin should also be considered when developing treatments for heroin abusers with depression.
   Scientific SignificanceOur findings provide a comprehensive mechanism of addiction that is integrated with emotion, cognition, and personality. Drug-related beliefs and emotional regulation can be targeted to reduce the likelihood of relapse in abusers with higher levels of neuroticism. (Am J Addict 2018;27:139-143)

AB  - Objective: At the time, the 2016 Pulse Nightclub massacre in Orlando, Florida, was the most devastating mass shooting in the United States, with 49 people dead and dozens more injured. We examined American attitudes about gun legislation in its aftermath, paying particular attention to the importance of media exposure to the event. Method: Starting 5 days after the shooting. data were collected anonymously among a nationally representative U.S. sample (N = 3,199); 95% completed the survey online. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Most respondents favored gun restrictions in the aftermath of the shootings (i.e., 80%, weighted, favored universal background checks; 61%, weighted. desired stricter laws covering the sale of firearms). Multinomial logistic regressions identified traditional (Republican identity, gun ownership, age, gender, education) and novel (media exposure, recent history of violence) predictors of gun attitudes. Individuals who consumed a minimum of 1 hr average daily media coverage in the event's aftermath were significantly more likely to prefer stricter gun laws and favor universal background checks (p < .05) than those who consumed less than 1 hr, adjusting for relevant covariates. Direct exposure to the shooting was not significantly associated with gun attitudes. Conclusion: Media coverage of mass shootings may be critical in shaping contemporary public attitudes around gun violence. Research on gun violence should therefore include information on media exposure and explore whether mass shooting media coverage can shift individual attitudes toward preventive policy efforts.

AB  - Depersonalization (DP) is a dissociative phenomenon, characterized by feeling "unreal" or detached from one's own emotions, thoughts, and behavior (APA, 2013). It is considered to be a defense mechanism, employed in response to overwhelming events, whereby thoughts and emotions are suppressed in order to enhance the individual's capacity to function in traumatic environments. DP has been found to co-occur with anxiety and depressive disorders, and childhood emotional maltreatment (EM) has been identified as an important predisposing factor. The study's primary aim was to investigate the mediating role of DP in the relationship between childhood EM and psychological distress in young adults. Additionally, it aimed to confirm that a history of childhood EM (emotional abuse and emotional neglect) predicted current levels of DP and to explore how both a person's attitude towards experiencing and expressing emotions (with an emphasis on the affect phobia model) and their current attachment security are related to current DP. A cross-sectional design was employed, which included young adults (N = 761) aged between 18 and 25 years. Participants completed an online survey that comprised of several self-report measures. Regression and mediation analyses were conducted. The results indicated that: (1) DP significantly mediated the relationship between childhood EM and current psychological distress; (2) that a history of EM, but no other forms of childhood abuse, significantly predicted current DP experiences; and (3) EM, attachment-related anxiety, and negative attitudes toward emotions predicted clinical cutoff levels of DP. The results are discussed in detail, including clinical implications and direction for future research.

AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV), which is linked to specific types of cancer, can be prevented by vaccination. This study aimed to determine the knowledge and attitudes of nursing students about HPV and its vaccine as well as their intentions towards personal vaccination. A total of 536 Spanish nursing students were invited to complete the Spanish version of the questionnaire "Knowledge, attitudes and intentions towards HPV". Overall, 367 surveys were completed (68.4% response rate). Data analysis included the calculation of three scores: the knowledge score, categorized into low (<33%), moderate (33%-66%), and good knowledge (>66%); the attitude score, sorted into positive (<2.5), neutral (2.5-3.5), and negative attitude (>3.5); and the intention score, categorized into not favorable (<4), neutral (4-7), and favorable intention (>7). Knowledge about HPV and its vaccine was moderate (54.34 +/- 0.9%), and the attitude towards vaccination was positive (2.34 +/- 0.03). The intention towards personal vaccination increased significantly after completing the questionnaire (before: 4.14 +/- 0.27, after: 6.02 +/- 0.28; p < 0.001). The present study highlights the need of training future nurses about HPV and its vaccine, considering the important role it plays in the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases.

TI  - Adolescents in a tuberculosis hospital: Qualitative study of how relationships with doctors, caregivers, and peers mediate their mental wellbeing
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - HAPPINESS
AB  - Lengthy hospitalization can impact adolescents' mental wellbeing in a number of negative ways. Scholarship has indicated that a young patient's relationships play an important role in reducing the amount of stress felt and in improving emotional state. In this article we turn to the experiences of adolescents with tuberculosis [TB] in Russia to explore how exactly hospitalization together with the TB diagnosis itself impact their mental wellbeing and how relationships with others mediate these impacts. We conducted a qualitative, interview-based study in Tomsk pediatric TB clinic. Interviews were conducted with three groups relevant for reaching the aim of this research: adolescent patients, their adult caregivers, and their treating physicians [17 informants in total]. Interview data were complemented with prolonged observations in the same clinic. The results of our study highlight that threats to mental wellbeing of adolescents with TB are multiple. Adolescents who are about to enter the in-patient treatment feel apprehensive and anxious about their future. They tend to have a hard time accepting their diagnosis, which they often feel is something shameful, and, consequently, may develop a negative attitude towards themselves. Most importantly, many undergo painful loss of personal relationships and expect or actually experience rejection by peers because of having tuberculosis. However, relationships with physicians, caregivers, and other patients in the clinic mediate negative impacts of TB diagnosis and hospitalization on adolescents' mental wellbeing and can open ways for providing support. Supportive practices include physicians leaving it up to adolescents to decide what they want to discuss and when, caregivers remaining available for contact and keeping regular communication, and other adolescents with TB proactively seeking contact with the newcomers and behaving in a non-judgmental way. These results can inform design of adolescent-friendly TB services.

AB  - Media coverage of Muslims has been repeatedly shown to be negative, and attitudes toward Muslims in American society are typically more negative than attitudes toward other social groups. Does the tone of media coverage directly affect public attitudes? This relationship is not well established with respect to Muslims, nor as a proposition about social groups in general. We use an online between-subjects experiment to examine whether exposure to articles of quantifiably different valences about Muslims or Catholics affects reported attitudes toward each of those groups. We find clear support for this proposition. Our additional tests demonstrate that this effect persists but is attenuated when money is at stake. We also identify anxiety as a key mediator between exposure to articles of different valences and attitudes about each group. Our findings suggest that articles of a particular tone can influence views of social groups.

AB  - Increasing awareness of the prevalence and implications of ageism has led researchers to examine the factors contributing to this form of prejudice. Scant attention has been paid to the role of emotions in the development and formation of negative attitudes towards older adults. Our research explored this issue by focusing specifically on propensity to, and sensitivity towards, the emotion of disgust. Two self-report studies were conducted. In the first study, regression analyses were employed to determine whether there was a relation between disgust proneness/sensitivity and ageism in a sample of 308 participants aged 18 to 30. In a second study we explored the possibility of an indirect relationship between disgust proneness/sensitivity and ageism mediated by perceived vulnerability to disease and aging anxiety in a sample of 349 participants aged 18 to 30. While we found no evidence of a direct relationship between disgust proneness/sensitivity and ageism in the first study, results from the second study showed a significant indirect effect between disgust proneness/sensitivity and ageism, mediated by both perceived vulnerability to disease and aging anxiety. This relationship may be understood using an evolutionary account which involves pathogen avoidance and a Terror Management account which involves anxiety about death.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, an increasing reliance on digital technology to carry out social, entertainment, work and school activities increased, which may have affected the ways in which parents mediated their children's digital technology use. Given the prominent role that digital technology will have in the future, it is important to investigate parent and child characteristics which impacted parental mediation of children's digital technology use. Therefore, the present study aimed at analysing the frequency of parental mediation strategies (i. e. active and restrictive) during lockdown, their determinants, and how the two strategies affected children's digital skills and time spent online. Data were collected from 461 parent and 461 child participants. Results showed that almost half of parents (46%) practiced parental mediation with the same frequency, while the 42.6% applied it more often. Active mediation was predicted by parental worries about online risks, while restrictive mediation was predicted by time spent online by children, parental worries about online risks, parental negative attitudes towards digital technology and parents' digital skills. Children developed more digital skills when their parents applied higher levels of both active and restrictive mediation, and they spent the lowest amount of time online when their parents employed higher levels of restrictive and lower levels of active mediation. Practical implications for families and children's wellbeing are discussed.

AB  - Studies of a variety of media have found a negative slant in portrayals of individuals with mental illness. These portrayals may contribute to harmful public stigma. As consumers shift focus to online sources of news, it is important to understand whether negative portrayals are also found online. The current study analyzed language use and other coverage choices in online articles (N = 811) about mass shooting events as a function of the mental illness status of the shooter. Regression analyses controlling for relevant crime characteristics showed that less angry language was used and more positive details about the shooter were included when the shooter had a mental illness. The number of victim fatalities, location of and motive for the crime, and shooter age were also related to language use and coverage choices. Whereas the current results do not align with prior findings of overtly negative media portrayals of individuals with mental illnesses, it is not clear whether this reflects a modern improvement in media portrayals or whether it is perhaps a more subtle sign of continued bias toward associating mental illness with dangerousness and lack of responsibility for committing violent acts. Future work should focus on the impact of online information sources on public attitudes and stigma toward individuals with mental illness.

AB  - Access to vaccination information could influence public attitudes towards vaccination. This study investigated the number and types of vaccination-related information sources, and estimated their associations with vaccine confidence and hesitancy in China. In January 2019, we conducted a cross-sectional survey in China, and 2122 caregivers with children <6 years completed self-administered questionnaires. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations between caregivers' primary information sources and vaccine confidence/hesitancy. A majority (72%) of caregivers had multiple sources of vaccination-related information. The proportions of caregivers reporting professional sources, media, and peers as primary information sources were 81%, 63%, and 26%. Internal migrants were less likely to get information from professional sources; more educated and wealthier caregivers reported more information sources and were more likely to get information from media and peers. Caregivers who reported professional information sources had significantly higher odds of being confident about the safety of vaccines and lower odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. Caregivers who reported the media as a primary information source had significantly higher odds of being hesitant toward vaccination than those who did not. To address vaccine hesitancy, it is essential to promote universal access to professional vaccination-related information sources, and to use the media to disseminate evidence-based information and clarify misinformation. Health communication should target internal migrants, and more educated and wealthier caregivers.

AB  - The homicide statistics of a popular UK television fictional crime series and the former Lothian & Borders police force region, Scotland were compared. This comparison was used to consider the implications for public attitudes which may influence the adoption of public health interventions to reduce homicide.
   217 homicides were identified by 105 perpetrators in the television series 'Midsomer Murders' between 1997 and 2011; these were compared to 55 homicides by 53 perpetrators in the regional sample between 2006 and 2011. The numbers of serial killings (p < 0.0001), planned homicides, female perpetrators (p < 0.0001), shootings (p = 0.0456) and poisonings (p = 0.0289) were higher in the fictional sample. Lothian & Borders cases were almost all single killings, mostly unplanned, with a far greater rate of homicide by kitchen knives (p < 0.0001) and hitting/kicking (p = 0.0005) by intoxicated perpetrators.
   Control of access to pointed kitchen knives by members of certain groups may reduce homicide rates. If the popular perception of UK homicides is influenced by popular culture, the importance of such a public health intervention may not be apparent.

AB  - According to cultural cognition theory, individuals hold opinions about politically contested issues like climate change that are consistent with their "cultural way of life," conforming their opinions to how they think society should be organized and to what they perceive are the attitudes of their cultural peers. Yet despite dozens of cultural cognition studies, none have directly examined the role of the news media in facilitating these differential interpretations. To address this gap, drawing on a national survey of US adults administered in 2015, we statistically modeled the cultural cognition process in relation to news choices and media effects on public attitudes about climate change. Individuals possessing strongly held cultural worldviews, our findings show, not only choose news outlets where they expect to find culturally congruent arguments about climate change, but they also selectively process the arguments they encounter. Overall, our study demonstrates the substantial role that cultural cognition in combination with news media choices play in contributing to opinion polarization on climate change and other politicized science topics.

AB  - Purpose Autonomous technologies represent an increasingly important, but at the same time controversial technological field with enormous potential. From a consumer perspective, however, the growing autonomy of technologies might result in a perceived loss of control, which can lead to consumer resistance. Given the practical and theoretical relevance, this research examines antecedents to consumer adoption of autonomous technologies in the context of self-driving cars. Design/methodology/approach This article looks through the lens of the technology acceptance model and conducts structural equation modeling. Findings The study validates the positive effect of perceived usefulness on behavioral intention to adopt self-driving cars. The results further suggest that individuals with a generally negative attitude toward technologies are afraid that they might not be capable of handling the new technology. Moreover, further mediation analyses reveal that perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness help us to explain the indirect effects of novelty seeking and technology anxiety on adoption intention. Practical implications The results imply that users' perceptions of an autonomous technology's usefulness are an important determinant of technology adoption. Adoption barriers could be overcome by emphasizing the usability of the new technology. On the other hand, individuals who enjoy using the old technology may be persuaded by arguments that focus on the usefulness of the new technology rather than its ease of use. Originality/value Self-driving automobiles will change our perception of mobility. It is important to understand the mechanisms that drive the adoption of such innovations.

AB  - Persons with mental disorders often experience stigmatization. There is a number of social factors that may affect the process of recovery and at the same time, in certain circumstances, could be a source of stigma. Mentally ill may find strength in themselves to fight against the disease or the opposite - can internalize the negative attitudes of the society and become self-stigmatized. The patient's family, on the one hand, is often the only source of social support, on the other hand, can experience a destructive influence of courtesy-stigma. Mentally ill have to face social reluctance which is reinforced by stereotypical media coverage of mental disorders. The social network of patients is poor and often limited to a family system. Negative views about persons diagnosed with mental illness are most visible in the labour market. Patients experience many types of discrimination at work, have lower employment rates and lower mean wages than healthy ones. Structural discrimination is a form of stigma which is revealed in underfunded and inefficient system of mental health care. All the social factors mentioned above are necessary for recovery (positive stimulation of functioning), but can also increase stigma and become a significant barrier in the recovery of psychiatric patients. This paper highlights the complex and ambiguous nature of the relationship between social factors and the recovery of the mentally ill basing on the data from the literature.

AB  - This study models cross-national attitudes towards immigrants in East and Southeast Asia as a signed and weighted bipartite network of countries and evaluative reactions to a variety of political issues, or determinants. This network is then projected into two one-mode networks, one of countries and one of determinants, and community detection methods are applied. The paper aims to fill two deficiencies in the current research on attitudes towards immigrants: 1) the lack of cross-national studies in Asia, a region where migration is growing, and 2) the tendency of researchers to treat determinants as uncorrelated, despite the interdependent nature of evaluative reactions. The results show that the nine countries in the sample are a cohesive clique, showing greater similarities than differences in the determinants of their attitudes. A blockmodeling approach was employed to identify eight determinants in attitudes towards immigrants, namely views on independence and social dependencies, group identities, absolute or relative moral orientation, attitudes towards democracy, science and technology, prejudice and stigma, and two determinants related to religion. However, the findings of this survey yielded some surprising results when compared with the literature review. First, education was not found to be a significant determinants of attitudes towards immigrants, despite its strong and consistent predictive power in European models. Second, prejudice appears to be mediated in part by religion, especially in religious identification and belief in God. Group identity and prejudice also appear to be related, though only weakly. Finally, anxiety appears in clusters related to social norms, suggesting that fears regarding immigrants relates closely to expectations of others' behavior.

AB  - Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is a major social and public health problem of global proportions. Public attitudes toward IPVAW shape the social environment in which such violence takes place, and attitudes of acceptability of IPVAW are considered a risk factor to actual IPVAW. The aim of this study was to develop and validate a scale measuring acceptability of IPVAW (A-IPVAW). To this end, a sample of 1,800 respondents was recruited via social media. A second sample of 50 IPVAW offenders was used for concurrent validity analyses. Following a cross-validation approach and using item response theory analyses, we found that the latent structure of the scale was one-dimensional and very informative for high and very high levels of acceptability of IPVAW. Regarding criterion-related validity, we found that (a) our measure was related to perceived severity of IPVAW and ambivalent sexism, (b) men showed higher levels of acceptability than women, and (c) IPVAW offenders reported higher levels of acceptability than men from the general population. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the A-IPVAW is a reliable and valid instrument to assess acceptability of IPVAW.

AB  - Prejudice is one of the major threats to the cohesion of multicultural societies and adolescent years play a key role in its development. How social contexts contribute to adolescent prejudice is, however, not yet well-known. This 3-wave study of Swedish majority adolescents (N = 659; M-ageT1 = 13.41; M-ageT3 = 17.33) examined the effects of parents' and peers' attitudes on changes in youth attitudes toward immigrants as well as an interplay between parent, peer, and school context. The results of multilevel analyses revealed that within-person fluctuations in youth attitudes were positively related to fluctuations in peers' but not parents' attitudes. Both parents' and peers' attitudes, however, significantly predicted the differences in level and rate of change in attitudes between adolescents. In addition to these direct effects, mediation analysis showed that parents' attitudes predicted youth attitudes indirectly, via the attitudes of the peers youth associate with, suggesting an overall greater importance of parental bias. Peers' attitudes did not moderate the effects of parents but youth from ethnically diverse classrooms were less affected by their parents' prejudice than youth from less diverse classrooms. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of social context in the development of prejudice. They suggest that while parents set the stage, peers explain the day-to-day variation in prejudice, and that classroom diversity offsets some of the negative effects of parental bias.

AB  - Background: Despite the significant body of evidence on the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of internet interventions, the implementation of such programs in Portugal is virtually non-existent. In addition, Portuguese psychologists' use and their attitudes towards such interventions is largely unknown.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to explore Portuguese psychologists' knowledge, training, use and attitudes towards internet interventions; to investigate perceived advantages and limitations of such interventions; identify potential drivers and barriers impacting implementation; and study potential factors associated to previous use and attitudes towards internet interventions.
   Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was developed by the authors and disseminated by the Portuguese Psychologists Association to its members.
   Results: A total of 1077 members of the Portuguese Psychologists Association responded to the questionnaire between November 2018 and February 2019. Of these, 37.2% (N=363) were familiar with internet interventions and 19.2% (N=188) considered having the necessary training to work within the field. 29.6% (N=319) of participants reported to have used some form of digital technology to deliver care in the past. Telephone (23.8%; N=256), e-mail (16.2%; N=175) and SMS (16.1%; N=173) services were among the most adopted forms of digital technology, while guided (1.3%; N=14) and unguided (1.5%; N=16) internet interventions were rarely used. Accessibility (79.9%; N=860), convenience (45.7%; N=492) and cost-effectiveness (45.5%; N=490) were considered the most important advantages of internet interventions. Conversely, ethical concerns (40.7%; N=438), client's ICT illiteracy (43.2%; N=465) and negative attitudes towards internet interventions (37%; N=398) were identified as the main limitations. An assessment of participants attitudes towards internet interventions revealed a slightly negative/neutral stance (Median=46.21; SD=15.06) and revealed greater acceptability towards blended treatment interventions (62.9%; N=615) when compared to standalone internet interventions (18.6%; N=181). Significant associations were found between knowledge (chi(2)(4) =90.4; P<.001), training (chi(2)(4) =94.6; P<.001), attitudes (chi(2)(3) =38.4; P<.001) and previous use of internet interventions and between knowledge (chi(2)(12)= 109.7; P<.001), training (chi(2)(12) 64.7; P<.001) and attitudes towards such interventions, with psychologists reporting to be ignorant and not having adequate training in the field, being more likely to present more negative attitudes towards these interventions and not having prior experience in its implementation.
   Conclusions: This study revealed that most Portuguese psychologists are not familiar with and have no training or prior experience using internet interventions and had a slightly negative/neutral attitude towards such interventions. There was greater acceptability towards blended treatment interventions compared to standalone internet interventions. Lack of knowledge and training were identified as the main barriers to overcome, underlining the need of promoting awareness and training initiatives to ensure internet interventions successful implementation.

AB  - In 2009, the United States Air Force aired a series of science fiction-themed recruitment commercials on network television and their official YouTube channel. In these advertisements, the superimposition of science fiction imagery over depictions of Air Force operations frames these missions as near-future sci-fi adventure, ironically summarized by the tagline: "It's not science fiction. It's what we do every day." Focusing on an early advertisement for the Air Force's Reaper unmanned aerial vehicle, this essay explores how themes essential to the science fiction genre play a role in influencing contemporary attitudes about autonomous and semi-autonomous robotic weapons, as well as the way in which the aesthetic and functional qualities of these advanced technologies are used to frame moral arguments about their use. As a reconfiguration of the near-future battleground in the guise of science fiction, the "Reaper" ad reveals the way in which science fiction has come to serve as a functional-aesthetic benchmark and cultural sounding board, against which "every day" technologies can be measured and claims about their value, ethos, and social appeal are made. This essay explores the ethical entanglements between science fiction film and video games, and military technology, and the complex role science fiction plays in influencing public attitudes towards military technologies.

AB  - Behavior, attitudes, and lifespan development are key antecedents of happiness. However, little is known about the multivariate effect of those items on happiness. Thus, the purpose of this study was to determine the comparative impacts of leisure routines and attitudes on overall happiness and to elucidate how routine leisure activities and attitudes may influence happiness at different life stages. Questionnaires were completed by 379 students and 253 alumni members of the same university. Analysis of variance indicated alumni rated locus of control and happiness variables significantly higher than did current students. Students rated the leisure routine variable significantly higher than did alumni. Structural equation modeling showed leisure routines had a significant indirect effect on happhiess with attitudes as a full mediator. Multigroup path analysis showed there is little variance between the two groups. Findings indicate that one's routine leisure activities and attitudes can have a significant positive effect on overall happiness, and this path is consistent at different life stages.

AB  - How does a chief executive officer (CEO)'s social media content disclosure on Twitter affect perceived CEO attributes, relationship investment, and public engagement, and to what extent does the CEO's gender (male vs. female) moderate how publics evaluate content disclosures? A 2 (CEO gender: male vs. female) x 4 (level of disclosure: 100% corporate vs. 70% corporate and 30% personal vs. 30% corporate and 70% personal vs. 100% personal disclosure) between-subject experimental design was used to address these questions with a random sample of 465 adult Twitter users in the United States. Results showed that posts that featured high personal disclosure did not increase the perceived likability or competence of the CEO. Nor did CEO gender impact these outcomes. However, CEO professional disclosure proved to be an effective means to gain high levels of perceived relationship investment from publics. Finally, publics may hold implicit gender bias in cognitive (i.e., perceived relationship investment) and behavioral evaluation (i.e., engagement intention) of a female CEO.

AB  - This paper addresses the link between native attitudes and return migration. We exploit the variation in xenophobia using information on media consumption by migrants in Italy. A widely documented crime provides a quasi-experimental setting to identify the impact of Italian attitudes on migrants' settlement intentions. Our results suggest a significant effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on the intended duration of stay in the host country. The impact is more pronounced for low-skilled migrants, which has consequences for how migration affects the long-run convergence between sending and destination countries.

AB  - Objectives: To quickly understand rural-to-urban migrants knowledge and acceptance of voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS and community attitudes to providing VCT service to migrants in Shanghai, China.
   Study design: A rapid assessment consisting of in-depth interviews and focus group discussions was conducted.
   Methods: A total of 101 in-depth individual interviews and four focus group discussions were administered in 2008. The interviews were audiotaped or taken note and then transcribed. Collected data were analysed according four impact domains on VCT uptake among rural-to-urban migrants: knowledge of HIV/AIDS and VCT (Impact domain I), self-perceived risk of HIV infection (Impact domain II), accessibility and confidential of VCT service (Impact domain III), and social environment (Impact domain IV).
   Results: Current barriers to getting VCT among rural-to-urban migrants included misconceptions about HIV/AIDS, limited to no knowledge about VCT, extremely low self-perception of HIV risks, limited accessibility of VCT service for rural migrants, worrying about disclosure of HIV infection status, and community leaders' or stakeholders' negative attitudes to rural migrants living with HIV and even those attending VCT.
   Conclusions: It indicates that much greater effort is needed to remove barriers to accessing VCT for rural-to-urban migrants. Community mobilizations, mass media programs to improve HIV/AIDS and VCT knowledge and awareness, and anti-stigma associated with taking VCT or HIV infection are among the priorities.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to measure the level of public awareness about the threat of the emerging coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic among the Omani population. It also aims to investigate the mediating effect of the Omanis' attitudes and behaviors with underlying conditions of COVID-19.
   Design/methodology/approach - A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect data via an online survey of Omani citizens and residents from various geographic areas in Oman, 305 responses were received. SPSS and partial least square-structural equation modeling were used for data analysis.
   Findings - The study revealed that public awareness regarding the COVID-19 pandemic was significantly influenced by people's perceived risk, information source and health-related knowledge. Further, preventive behavior during the disease spread has a significant direct and indirect impact on their awareness. However, an insignificant mediation effect of public attitude was found between the source of information and public awareness.
   Research limitations/implications - This study is limited by the scarcity of related literature in the Omani context. It is recommended that future research complete an in-depth study of public awareness regarding COVID-19, using other constructs and/or other data collection techniques.
   Practical implications - This research will provide governmental health authorities and policymakers with a guideline to establish more efficient pandemic containment strategies to control public behavior toward the COVID-19 pandemic and curb viral prevalence.
   Social implications - This research will help in improving prevention measures against COVID-19 are recommended to be more educated through a more effective mechanism to raise public attitude regarding pandemic prevalence positively.
   Originality/value - The originality of this research can be drawn from key findings that indicate that people overall gained knowledge about how to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and the accuracy of information significantly impacts public awareness.

AB  - The main aim of the present study was to develop, validate and test an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that contributes to the overall understanding of students' intention to use digital tools in a blended learning context of higher education. The external bidimensional factor of familiarity with digital tools, which is not usually explained by the TAM, was included, and evaluated. Following a four-stage scale development technique, a seven-dimensional 25-item survey was developed, which includes two external correlated variables: familiarity with high-tech digital tools and familiarity with traditional digital tools, two mediator variables-computer anxiety, and perceived barriers, and three response variables, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and intention to use. The initial version of the survey was administered on 250 undergraduate students. Next, for another sample of 206 students, latent dimensions of the survey were tested using exploratory factor analysis. The structure of the survey was validated in two other subsequent stages with one sample of 262 responses of undergraduates and one of 310 responses of master's students from two different universities. All students who agreed to participate in research attended blended learning. The validity, reliability and invariance of the instrument were established by psychometric analyses. Collected data indicated that the survey has an adequate multifactorial structure that is reliable and invariant across degree levels.

AB  - At present, there have been a number of studies examining the sexualization of female characters in various media. However, most studies to date have not clearly delineated whether sexualized images or the presence of assertive versus passive female characters influences negative attitudes toward women in viewers, as well as female viewer anxiety. The present study investigated whether the inclusion of powerful female characters in movies with sexualized content influences both male and female viewers' attitudes towards women as well as anxiety responses of female reviewers. Participants included 134 undergraduate students attending a private liberal arts university in the southern region of the United States. Participants were randomized to watch one of three movie conditions: first, movies that involve strong female lead characters, but which also include sexualized characters, Second, movies that involve strong female lead characters without sexualization and third, movies that involve sexualized female characters without strong portrayals (i.e. damsels in distress). Participants were measured on attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance and anxiety. Results indicated little support for the view that sexualized media impacted viewers' attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance or anxiety.

AB  - Data from the Transatlantic Trends: Immigration survey was used to investigate whether the debate surrounding Thilo Sarrazin's immigration-skeptical Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany abolishes itself) had any impact on migration-related attitudes in Germany. The book was published in August 2010 and fieldwork took place during the evolving debate, providing a unique opportunity to study the impact of a major media event on public attitudes. Descriptive findings on the aggregate level show no substantial change in migration-related attitudes in the months after publication. More detailed findings reveal a significant increase in skepticism only for respondents with low levels of education, whose assessment of Muslim migrants' integration became more negative during the debate. There are two possible reasons for the lack of more substantial attitudinal change. Firstly, the debate was highly polarized and lacked the consonant national media coverage that is an important precondition for media effects on public opinion. Secondly, there were no additional "external shocks" prior to the book's release, such as a high levels of immigration, that could have made the public more susceptible to criticism of the impact of migration.

AB  - Background: Although timely and accurate information during the COVID-19 pandemic is essential for containing the disease and reducing mental distress, an infodemic, which refers to an overabundance of information, may trigger unpleasant emotions and reduce compliance. Prior research has shown the negative consequences of an infodemic during the pandemic; however, we know less about which subpopulations are more exposed to the infodemic and are more vulnerable to the adverse psychological and behavioral effects.
   Objective: This study aimed to examine how sociodemographic factors and information-seeking behaviors affect the perceived information overload during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also investigated the effect of perceived information overload on psychological distress and protective behavior and analyzed the socioeconomic differences in the effects.
   Methods: The data for this study were obtained from a cross-national survey of residents in 6 jurisdictions in Asia in May 2020. The survey targeted residents aged 18 years or older. A probability-based quota sampling strategy was adopted to ensure that the selected samples matched the population's geographical and demographic characteristics released by the latest available census in each jurisdiction. The final sample included 10,063 respondents. Information overload about COVID-19 was measured by asking the respondents to what extent they feel overwhelmed by news related to COVID-19. The measure of psychological distress was adapted from the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5). Protective behaviors included personal hygienic behavior and compliance with social distancing measures.
   Results: Younger respondents and women (b=0.20, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.26) were more likely to perceive information overload. Participants self-perceived as upper or upper-middle class (b=0.19, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.30) and those with full-time jobs (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.17) tended to perceive higher information overload. Respondents who more frequently sought COVID-19 information from newspapers (b=0.12, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.14), television (b=0.07, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.09), and family and friends (b=0.11, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.14) were more likely to feel overwhelmed. In contrast, obtaining COVID-19 information from online news outlets and social media was not associated with perceived information overload. There was a positive relationship between perceived information overload and psychological distress (b=2.18, 95% CI 2.09 to 2.26). Such an association was stronger among urban residents, full-time employees, and those living in privately owned housing. The effect of perceived information overload on protective behavior was not significant.
   Conclusions: Our findings revealed that respondents who were younger, were female, had a higher socioeconomic status (SES), and had vulnerable populations in the household were more likely to feel overwhelmed by COVID-19 information. Perceived information overload tended to increase psychological distress, and people with higher SES were more vulnerable to this adverse psychological consequence. Effective policies and interventions should be promoted to target vulnerable populations who are more susceptible to the occurrence and negative psychological influence of perceived information overload.

AB  - Introduction: Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) remains a global health problem disproportionately distributed across Nigeria. Cross river state (CRS), a tourist state, located in the Niger delta, has one of the highest prevalence rates. There is evidence that poor knowledge and stigmatization are obstacles to achieving universal access to HIV prevention programs. The objective of this study was to determine the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of HIV among adults resident in CRS, Nigeria. Methods: A cross sectional descriptive survey design was employed. A total of 1,620 healthy adults were recruited. KAP towards HIV was assessed using a structured pre-tested questionnaire. Categorical variables were described as frequencies and continuous variables as median and interquartile range. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine relationship between variables and median KAP scores. P value < 0.05 was considered significant. All analyses were performed using Stata 12 statistical package. Results: A total of 1,465 respondents completed the questionnaire correctly giving a response rate of 91%. The M: F ratio was 1:1.8. The median age was 38 years. Majority was married and had formal education. Knowledge of HIV and common routes of transmission was high (>80%). However, misconception that HIV can be transmitted through hugging, hand shake, mosquito bites and witch craft was also common (>60%). The overall attitude and practice towards persons living with HIV infection was poor. Conclusion: This study showed misconceptions in the knowledge and consequences of HIV infection which is associated with negative attitude towards persons living with HIV.

AB  - By 2050, the youth population in Sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) is expected to exceed 60%. To contain the ensuing youth bulge, reduce unemployment and 'flight' from rural areas, and increase agricultural productivity, countries seek policies to enhance youth engagement in agriculture. However, orthodox assumptions and locally inappropriate policies keep youth engagement low.
   We use qualitative enquiry with focus group discussions and key informant interviews in Ghana and Malawi to examine youth strengths, aspirations, barriers to sustainable agriculture intensification (SAI), and implications for enhancing their inclusion. We further examine the potential of three equity-analysis tools to guide decision making on youth-inclusive SAI.
   Findings show that youth face limited access to land and capital, limited involvement in decision making and in farmer/development groups, and negative attitudes from community members and officials. Land access was complex, mediated by land-inheritance system, land type, population pressures, culture, and land markets. Land access problems were acute in matrilineal Malawi, particularly for young men. Decision makers attested to the relevance and usefulness of selected youth-equity analysis tools, and to positive training outcomes on awareness, knowledge, and skills in using them.
   We contribute context-specific evidence on youth's positive contributions in SAI and the need to recognize them with more targeted and location-differentiated interventions on resources access, including land. Findings also inform the quest for pathways to move the youth-agriculture/SAI debate into tangible actions from below, equipped with youth-analysis tools for decision makers to foster youth-inclusive SAI in Ghana, Malawi, and other countries with similar contexts.

AB  - BackgroundThe Lebanese public perceives the physician-patient relationship as flawed. The objectives of this study are to assess factors associated with the public's trust in physicians in the context of the Lebanese healthcare system and to explore potential ways to enhance it.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study based on a grounded theory methodology using semi-structured interviews with members of the Lebanese public (not restricted to patients). We selected participants through convenience and maximum variation sampling approaches. The constant comparative analysis resulted in a theoretical framework that describes the factors influencing trust in physicians.ResultsParticipants trusted an experienced, up-to-date, graduate of a North American or Western European school, working in a reputable hospital, with a high level of diagnostic skills. The personal characteristics that improved trust were physicians who are non-materialistic', have a good rapport, and have sufficient encounter time with patients. Social factors that enhance trust in the physician include: being a family member, recommended by a family member, featured in mainstream media, and/or having a good reputation. Trust increased compliance, loyalty despite occasional mistakes committed, high consultation fees, and negative attitudes towards the physician's institution. Conversely, no trust led to severed therapeutic relationship and seeking second opinions.ConclusionThe level of trust of members of the Lebanese public in physicians was affected by the personal characteristics of physicians, their practice or clinical skills, their interactions with the patient, finances, in addition to a number of social factors. Moreover, the level of trust had major implications on patients' interactions with their physicians.

AB  - Background The spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and the guidance from authorities for social distancing and media reporting lead to significant uncertainty in Germany. Concerns have been expressed regarding the underdiagnosing of harmful diseases. We explored the rates of emergency presentations for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and acute cerebrovascular events (ACVE) before and after spread of SARS-CoV-2. Methods We analyzed all-cause visits at a tertiary university emergency department and admissions for ACS and ACVE before (calendar weeks 1-9, 2020) and after (calendar weeks 10-16, 2020) the first coronavirus disease (COVID-19) case in the region of the Saarland, Germany. The data were compared with the same period of the previous year. Results In 2020 an average of 346 patients per week presented at the emergency department whereas in 2019 an average of 400 patients presented up to calendar week 16 (p = 0.018; whole year 2019 = 395 patients per week). After the first COVID-19 diagnosis in the region, emergency department visit volume decreased by 30% compared with the same period in 2019 (p = 0.0012). Admissions due to ACS decreased by 41% (p = 0.0023 for all; Delta - 71% (p = 0.007) for unstable angina, Delta - 25% (p = 0.42) for myocardial infarction with ST-elevation and Delta - 17% (p = 0.28) without ST-elevation) compared with the same period in 2019 and decreased from 142 patients in calendar weeks 1-9 to 62 patients in calendar weeks 10-16. ACVE decreased numerically by 20% [p = 0.25 for all; transient ischemic attack: Delta - 32% (p = 0.18), ischemic stroke: Delta - 23% (p = 0.48), intracerebral haemorrhage: Delta + 57% (p = 0.4)]. There was no significant change in ACVE per week (p = 0.7) comparing calendar weeks 1-9 (213 patients) and weeks 10-16 (147 patients). Testing of 3756 samples was performed to detect 58 SARS-CoV-2 positive patients (prevalence 1,54%, thereof one patient with myocardial and two with cerebral ischemia) up to calendar week 16 in 2020. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant decrease in all-cause admission and admissions due to cardiovascular events in the emergency department. Regarding acute cerebrovascular events there was a numerical decrease but no significant difference.

   DesignQualitative exploratory study.
   MethodsA qualitative study with 35 Iranian health professionals was conducted from February to April 2019 using semi-structured interviews to elicit their opinions. MAXQDA 11 software was used for data management, and the data were analysed using framework analysis.
   ResultsBarriers, which potentially have negative impact on patient engagement in the delivery of safer care, were categorized into four themes. The first category included patient-related barriers such as low levels of health literacy, ineffective education, patient unwillingness and cultural barriers. The second category included staff-related barriers such as the existence of negative attitudes towards engaging patients in matters relating to patient safety, ineffective communication, high workload and the reluctance on the part of physicians to engage with patients. Barriers created by limited resources and inadequate training provided by universities and in the workplace formed the third category and community-related barriers such as the inadequate dissemination of information via the mass media and a lack of community-based services formed the fourth category.
   ConclusionResults demonstrate the multilayered nature of the significant barriers to the engagement of patients in the delivery of safe care and reflect the need for a collaborative approach between the recipients of care, researchers, care providers and policy makers if these are to be overcome.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to analyze the factors associated with knowledge and attitudes about influenza A (H1N1) and vaccination, and possible relations of these factors with anxiety among healthcare workers (HCW).
   Methods: The study used a cross-sectional descriptive design, and it was carried out between 23 November and 4 December 2009. A total of 300 HCW from two hospitals completed a questionnaire. Data collection tools comprised a questionnaire and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI).
   Results: Vaccination rate for 2009 pandemic influenza A(H1N1) among HCW was low (12.7%). Most of the respondents believed the vaccine was not safe and protective. Vaccination refusal was mostly related to the vaccine's side effects, disbelief to vaccine's protectiveness, negative news about the vaccine and the perceived negative attitude of the Prime Minister to the vaccine. State anxiety was found to be high in respondents who felt the vaccine was unsafe.
   Conclusions: HCW considered the seriousness of the outbreak, their vaccination rate was low. In vaccination campaigns, governments have to aim at providing trust, and media campaigns should be used to reinforce this trust as well. Accurate reporting by the media of the safety and efficacy of influenza vaccines and the importance of vaccines for the public health would likely have a positive influence on vaccine uptake. Uncertain or negative reporting about the vaccine is detrimental to vaccination efforts.

AB  - On September 16, 2018, Typhoon Mangkhut, with record sustained winds of an estimated 110-115 mph, struck southern China, causing tremendous damage to the region. Since then, there have been many online discussions about the typhoon and how the government responded to it. In the domain of emergency response to disasters, the increasingly prominent role of social websites has been confirmed. This paper presents a case study of public attitudes and opinions regarding Typhoon Mangkhut that were collected from the Sina Weibo and WeChat websites, as well as from news websites. We then present a method for managing false online information in the wake of such natural disasters. The method consists of four phases: information extraction, sentiment recognition, opinion classification, and simulation analysis. In the last phase, a simulation experiment was conducted to assess how false information spreads. We used three scenarios in the simulation-namely, a real scenario, an isolation scenario, and an embedment scenario, each of which was based on a scale-free network based on a scale-free network. The results showed that the embedment strategy better controlled the transmission of false information than did the isolation strategy. In addition, we have provided some practical suggestions. This paper contributes to the literature on the emergency management of natural disasters.

AB  - This article explains why dissatisfaction with the performance of individual politicians in new democracies often turns into disillusionment with democracy as a political system. The demands on elections as an instrument of political accountability are much greater in new than established democracies: politicians have yet to form reputations, a condition that facilitates the entry into politics of undesirable candidates who view this period as their one-time opportunity to get rich. After a repeatedly disappointing government performance, voters may rationally conclude that all politicians are crooks and stop discriminating among them, to which all politicians rationally respond by acting like crooks, even if most may be willing to perform well in office if given appropriate incentives. Such an expectation-driven failure of accountability, which I call the trap of pessimistic expectations, may precipitate the breakdown of democracy. Once politicians establish reputations for good performance, however, these act as barriers to the entry into politics of low-quality politicians. The resulting improvement in government performance reinforces voters' belief that democracy can deliver accountability, a process that I associate with democratic consolidation. These arguments provide theoretical microfoundations for several prominent empirical associations between the economic performance of new democracies, public attitudes toward democracy, and democratic stability.

AB  - Purpose
   Celebrity endorsement is common in the marketing communications context, especially in the Asian market. Thanks to the popularity of online DIY celebrities, many marketing communications practitioners have started to involve such celebrities in brand and product endorsement strategies. However, few existing studies have compared the endorsement persuasiveness of online DIY celebrity endorsers with traditional celebrity endorsers, particularly in the Asian market. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to fill the literature gap by examining how consumers perceive and evaluate online DIY and traditional celebrity endorsers.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In-depth personal interviews were conducted with 15 interviewees with a median age of 23. They were asked to report their overall evaluations and attitudes toward online DIY celebrity endorsers and traditional celebrity endorsers, and their respective endorsement strategies.
   Findings
   Although the popularity of online DIY celebrities is growing in China, they received a lower level of appreciation from interviewees than traditional celebrities. The persuasiveness of online DIY celebrity endorsers was not as effective as that of traditional celebrity endorsers. Interviewees even held an overall negative attitude toward online DIY celebrities and their endorsements. Interviewees perceived traditional celebrity endorsers more positively, and their endorsements to be more effective, than online DIY celebrity endorsers.
   Research limitations/implications
   The small sample size may constrain any generalization to be drawn from the findings. Future studies are suggested using survey and experiment methodology to further test and compare the persuasiveness of online DIY and traditional celebrity endorsement.
   Practical implications
   We suggest communications practitioners continue to use traditional celebrities to improve overall brand image and enhance the target audience's purchase intention as the exploratory study reveals that audiences have an overall positive experience with traditional celebrities, instead of online DIY celebrities. If online DIY celebrities are preferred in communications strategies, we suggest practitioners carefully select qualified online DIY celebrity endorsers based on image congruence between such online DIY celebrities and the product category in that audiences in the exploratory study are quite cautious when exposed to product endorsement messages from online DIY celebrities. Besides this, audiences have more confidence in product endorsement if there is a fit between online DIY celebrities' expertise and the endorsed product type.
   Originality/value
   This is the first qualitative study on consumers' perception of product endorsement at the level of online DIY and traditional celebrity endorsers.

AB  - Objective: The main aim of this study was to assess schoolteachers' knowledge of and attitudes toward epilepsy in Taif City, in the western region of Saudi Arabia. Method: A structured 28-item questionnaire was distributed to and collected from 290 schoolteachers between November 2017 and November 2018 in Taif City. Results: Generally, a negative attitude toward epilepsy was observed in this study. Of the 290 schoolteachers in this study, 80% had prior knowledge regarding epilepsy and 72% had witnessed a seizure. Only 2% of the participants expressed the thought that epilepsy is contagious but 59% of them expressed the thought that epilepsy is a mental disease. With respect to attitude, 64% of the participants reported that they would not approve of their daughter/son marrying someone with epilepsy. This attitude correlates with age and marital status as the prevalence of this attitude was higher among those who were either over 40 years old or married (P < 0.05). Although 73% of the participants stated that they know the correct management procedure to follow when helping an epilepsy patient during a seizure, inadequate practices are still performed by many. Finally, almost two-thirds of the respondents (66%) expressed the opinion that top-ranking professions are not suitable for people with epilepsy. This belief was twice as common among older respondents as it was among younger respondents (P < 0.05).Conclusion: This study concludes that schoolteachers' knowledge regarding epilepsy is limited and that an immediate intervention through educational campaigns is required to develop a well-informed community.

AB  - Objective: This study examined associations between multidimensional experiential avoidance, alcohol use motives, alcohol use, and alcohol-related consequences among individuals with a history of trauma and varying levels of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms. Methods: A total of 459 college students completed measures online, and the analysis sample was limited to the 313 participants who reported a past Criterion A traumatic event. These participants were separated into two groups based on DSM-IV TR diagnostic criteria: those with a high level of PTSD symptomatology (n = 34) and those with a low level of PTSD symptomatology (n = 279). A multi-group path model examined associations between experiential avoidance, drinking motives, alcohol use, and alcohol problems across these two groups. Results: The majority of participants were female (n = 192, 61.3%) and Caucasian (n = 281, 89.8%) and had a mean age of 19.37 (SD = 2.04). Two unique pathways to alcohol-related problems were observed. Among those with a high level of PTSD symptomatology, distress endurance (ability to behave effectively when under distress) was inversely associated with alcohol-related consequences via alcohol motives and use. For those with a low level of PTSD symptomatology, distress aversion (negative attitudes about, or lack of acceptance of, distress) was positively associated with alcohol-related consequences via alcohol motives and use. Conclusions: Results suggest unique pathways to alcohol consequences as a function of trauma symptom severity and may explain some of the comorbidity between PTSD and alcohol use disorders. Multidimensional indices of experiential avoidance may shed light on risk and resilience factors in PTSD.

AB  - Using a quasi-experimental research design, this study examines the effect of terrorist events on the perception of immigrants across 65 regions in nine European countries. It first elaborates a theoretical argument that explains the effect of events and points to economic conditions, the size of the immigrant population, and personal contact as mediating factors. This argument is evaluated using the fact that the terror attack in Bali on October 12, 2002, occurred during the fieldwork period of the European Social Survey. The findings from this natural experiment reveal considerable cross-national and regional variation in the effect of the event and its temporal duration. The analysis on the regional level supports the argument about contextual variations in the response to the event and a second analysis based on the 2004 Madrid bombing confirms the study's conclusions. Implications of the findings for societal responses to terror attacks, the literature on attitudes toward immigrants, and survey research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Pain is one of the most common and distressing symptoms in patients with cancer, with a high prevalence of 90%. Appropriate pain assessment is very important in managing cancer pain.
   Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) evaluate patient satisfaction with pain control therapy using a self-reporting pain assessment tool, (2) explore the usefulness of a self-reporting assessment tool for patients and physicians, and (3) evaluate patient perception of pain management and opioid analgesics.
   Methods: We enrolled a total of 587 South Korean adult cancer patients hospitalized for five days or more. Pain assessment using a self-reporting pain assessment tool was performed by patients themselves from Day 1 to Day 5. The average pain intensity on a numeric rating scale (NRS) and the frequency of breakthrough pain between Day 1 and Day 5 were recorded with a self-reporting pain assessment tool. We evaluated patient satisfaction with pain control and the usefulness of a self-reporting pain assessment tool for patients and physicians on Day 5.
   Results: Among the 587 enrolled patients, 551, excluding 36 patients who violated inclusion criteria, were analyzed. The pain satisfaction rate was 79.5%, and only 6.2% of assessed patients had a negative pain management index (PMI). However, symmetry analysis for pain intensity between patient and physician showed low agreement (kappa=0.21). The patients with dissatisfaction for cancer pain control expressed negative attitudes toward using opioid analgesics and misconceptions regarding pain management. The satisfaction for using a self-reporting pain assessment tool was 79.2% in patients and 86.4% in physicians, respectively.
   Conclusion: The use of a self-reporting pain assessment tool as a communication instrument provides an effective foundation for evaluating pain intensity in cancer pain management. A more individualized approach to patient education about pain management may improve patient outcome.

AB  - Background Current preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) technologies enable embryo genotyping across the whole genome. This has led to the development of polygenic risk scoring of human embryos (PGT-P). Recent implementation of PGT-P, including screening for intelligence, has been extensively covered by media reports, raising major controversy. Considering the increasing demand for assisted reproduction, we evaluated how information about PGT-P is communicated in press media and explored the diversity of ethical themes present in the public debate. Methods LexisNexis Academic database and Google News were searched to identify articles about polygenic embryo screening. This led to 535 news articles. 59 original articles met the inclusion criteria. Inductive content analysis was used to analyse these articles. Results 8.8% of articles gave embryo polygenic scoring a positive portrayal, while 36.8% expressed a negative attitude. 54.4% were neutral, mostly highlighting limited practical value of the technology in in vitro fertilization settings. We identified five main ethical themes that are also present in academic literature and the broader debate on reproductive technologies: a slippery slope towards designer babies, well-being of the child and parents, impact on society, deliberate choice and societal readiness. Conclusions Implementation of embryo polygenic profiling engenders a need for specific recommendations. Current media analysis discloses important ethical themes to consider when creating future guidelines for PGT-P.

AB  - Background: Harm reduction programs are often vulnerable to political and vocal opposition despite documented evidence of their effectiveness and economic benefit. It is not well understood if opponents to harm reduction represent the general public's attitudes.
   Objective: To understand the attitudes of the people of British Columbia (BC) towards various harm reduction strategies and services, and factors associated with support for harm reduction.
   Methods: A random-digit dialing telephone survey assessing attitudes towards various harm reduction strategies was administered to British Columbians in August 2011 (n = 2000). We compared the level of support for general harm reduction by sex, age, education level, and area of residence (Health Authority region) (chi(2)). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess odds of support for harm reduction.
   Results: Overall support for general harm reduction among participants was 76%; needle distribution 72%; needle distribution in one's local community 65%; and safer inhalation equipment distribution 52%. In the multivariate analysis, those with significantly lower odds of supporting harm reduction were male, older, had equal or less than high school education or completed a certificate/diploma program, and resided in the Fraser Health Authority region. The Health Authority region with a municipality that has introduced a bylaw prohibiting the implementation of harm reduction services was found to have 69% support for harm reduction. Another Health Authority region with a municipality that closed a long-standing needle distribution site was found to have over 78% support.
   Conclusion: In contrast to some local policies, our results show the British Columbians surveyed in our study support harm reduction. It is unclear whether policy makers are swayed by a vocal minority or block harm reduction activities for other reasons. Tailoring messages towards segments of the public less likely to support harm reduction, as well civic policy-makers and the media, may help to reduce stigma and gain support for harm reduction services designed to protect and improve the health of the individual and the public.

AB  - Purpose Since its inception, mobile payment is rapidly gaining popularity over the years, and starting to replace traditional modes of payment. The usage of mobile payments has further escalated following various precautionary measures (i.e. social distancing) in curbing the transmission of the COVID-19 outbreak. However, most of the elderlies are still sceptical about the usage of mobile payment services. The current study was set to investigate the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers that resulted in elderlies' resistance towards using such services. The impact of stickiness to cash was also examined as a moderator on the investigated relationships. Design/methodology/approach Online survey questionnaires were used to collect the responses from 400 elderly consumers at the age of 60 and above. Data analysis was then performed using the SPSS and AMOS statistical software packages. Findings Findings obtained acknowledged the significance of functional (i.e. perceived complexity, perceived incompatibility and perceived cost), psychological (i.e. lack of trust, inertia, and technological anxiety) and risk (i.e. privacy risk, security risk, financial risk and operational risk) barriers in influencing resistance towards mobile payment services among the elderlies. Consequently, resistance would influence their attitude and non-adoption intention; with attitude as the mediator between resistance and non-adoption intention. Finally, moderation analysis also confirmed the moderating effect of stickiness to cash towards elevating the correlation between resistance and non-adoption intention. Originality/value This study is one of the very few studies that explored the minimally investigated territory on the consequential importance of mobile payment usage among the elderlies, specifically, through extending the literature on the impact of functional, psychological and risk barriers towards the individuals' resistance. Besides, this study also successfully contributed to existing body of knowledge by highlighting the mediating role of attitude and moderating role of stickiness to cash in the interrelationships between resistance, attitude and non-adoption intention.

AB  - In the present paper we analyze the relation between political competence and media exposure. Taking into account the dynamic transition of media environment related to growing impact of the internet (web 2.0) we made several assumptions about the influence of traditional and new media on political sophistication. We hypothesize that the impact of the media on political competence is related to qualitative, rather than quantitative factors; competence rises with the way a media consumer interacts with the medium, rather than on the amount of time spent with the medium. The empirical analysis based on a mass public opinion survey confirms our assumptions: there is a positive relationship between media exposure and political competence, however various kind of media differ as far as their influence is concerned. Moreover the use of interactive internet features (participation in information exchange) is a key factor shaping competence.

AB  - Social media technologies have been widely adopted by governments to increase civic engagement, promote openness, and extend services. Previous research finds that public managers' attitudes are important predictors of social media adoption and successful implementation. Managers' attitudes may vary due to different organizational structures, functions, and operations based on department type or because departments vary along with key dimensions. This research investigates the following questions: (1) Does department type significantly predict public managers' attitudes toward social media, (2) does department type moderate the effect of predictors of managers' attitudes toward social media found in previous research, and (3) do the predictors of managers' attitudes toward social media found in previous research mediate attitude differences observed across different kinds of departments. Using data collected from a 2014 national web survey in the United States on technology in city government, we find department type is an important predictor of managers' attitudes toward social media use. The effects of other predictors of attitudes toward social media use were not moderated by department type. Instead, those predictors had similar effects regardless of department type. Some of the variables related to organizational characteristics and culture (e.g., social media use, innovativeness, and use of e-services) helped to explain differences between the attitudes of managers from different departments. Our findings are important for developing strategies to target managers' negative attitudes toward using social media, thus removing one of the barriers to successful technology implementation.

AB  - As US Internet penetration rates have climbed, digital divide researchers have largely shifted attention to differences in Internet skills. Interviews with 72 low-income US residents from both a large metropolitan city and a medium-sized Midwestern town, however, reveal that many people still struggle to maintain physical access, supporting technology maintenance theory. Technology maintenance theory argues that although most of the US poor now use digital technology, access is unstable and characterized by frequent periods of disconnection. As a result, low-income users must work to maintain access, often experiencing cycles of dependable instability. In these interviews, nearly all used the Internet, but technology maintenance practices were widespread, including negotiation of temporarily disconnected service, broken hardware, and logistic limitations on public access. As a result, participants had limited access to health information and employment, and biased attitudes toward technology. That is, in some cases, negative attitudes toward Internet adoption reflected a rational response to disconnection rather than cultural norms or fears of the Internet, as suggested by previous research. Findings support and extend the theory of technology maintenance by emphasizing a shift in the US digital divide from issues ofownership to issues of sustainability; they also provide insight into the interrelated nature of access and attitudes toward technology. This new theoretical approach complements other theoretical approaches to the digital divide that foreground a contextualized understanding of digital disparities as embedded within a history of broad social disparities.

AB  - Contact with members of outgroups is an important factor for ingroup members' attitudes toward these groups. Ingroup members can also come into contact with outgroups in the media. This media contact can take different forms: parasocial contact, when the audience simply observes outgroups; or vicarious contact, when ingroup audience members witness fellow ingroup members interacting with outgroups. However, extant research does not test whether these two forms of media contact differ in their effects on outgroup attitudes. In addition, we lack empirical evidence on the negative media contact effects and the role of predispositions, such as previous personal contact with outgroups. In two experiments, we test the differential effects of negative parasocial and vicarious contact on audience members who differ in their previous personal contact with refugees. The results show that negative parasocial and vicarious contact increase negative outgroup attitudes (Studies 1 & 2). While study 1 shows that negative vicarious contact results in more negative attitudes toward refugees, especially for people with no or little contact, a replication study does not corroborate this finding. Overall, negative parasocial and vicarious contact with refugees increase prejudice toward refugees. Personal contact does not inoculate individuals against this mediated contact effect.

AB  - What determines the success of a peaceful settlement attempt of a border dispute? In order to fully understand why decision makers choose to put an end to an ongoing conflict, it is necessary to consider the social trust levels of the general populations in both states. International conflict settlement requires public support at the domestic level. If a state's general population perceives the potential dangers of a settlement as too severe, the conclusion of a peace agreement will be difficult. We argue that high levels of social trust allow citizens (1) to favor more conciliatory foreign policies and (2) to be more optimistic about the future behavior of other states. In democratic settings, these public attitudes serve as powerful constraints for decision makers. As a result, high aggregate levels of social trust should be directly related to concession-granting behavior by democracies as well as effective dispute settlement among jointly democratic dyads. We test these expectations with a new aggregate-level measure of social trust and find mixed support for our hypotheses: While trust does not influence the behavior of challenger states, it does have strong effects on democratic target states and jointly democratic dyads.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the knowledge and sources of knowledge among Saudi female adolescent students, attending public and private schools in the city of Riyadh with regard to sexuality and reproductive health.
   Methods: This cross sectional survey was conducted from January to April 2009. Female adolescents between 11 and 21 years of age were invited to participate in the survey. Five classes of intermediate and secondary levels were randomly selected from 2 schools in Riyadh city A total of 417 female students were included into the sample. Students were asked to answer a self-administrated questionnaire.
   Results: Forty-two percent of the participants reported that they discussed sexual matters with their friends. Only 15.8% discussed these matters with their parents (mothers). Interestingly, 17.3% discussed sexual matters with the domestic helper. Most (61%) reported that their teachers had negative attitudes toward questions related to sexual issues. Only 33.3%, 37.9% and 14.5% knew that syphilis, gonorrhea, and hepatitis B, are sexually transmitted diseases. No significant differences were found between students in private schools and public schools.
   Conclusion: Formal sexual education should be introduced in the curriculum of the schools within the context of our religion and culture. Parents and teachers should be more open to discuss sexual issues with their children and students. Saudi Med J 2012; Vol. 33 (9): 1001-1009

AB  - This paper explores the behaviours and meanings associated with intimacy and sexuality among older adults with diverse partners living in subsidised senior housing. It utilises survey and qualitative data from a mixed methods of ageing/HIV exposure to illustrate gendered views on sexual and intimate behaviours, and attitudes towards transactional/commercial sex. Data suggest that women were cautious about engaging in intimate relationships, while men sought them and the companionship they provided to address loneliness. Reasons for non-intimacy were age and health problems. Generally speaking, both men and women had positive attitudes towards sex. Men took risks by having multiple partners and using condoms irregularly; women believed they could avoid risks by taking time to get to know their partners, but never used condoms. Forty per cent of men who saw sex workers were not regular condom users. They traded risk of gossip, violence and infection for companionship with women seeking money and physical safety. Findings have implications for policies, counselling and interventions for older sexually active adults in institutional and residential settings. ResumeCet article examine les comportements et les significations associes a l'intimite et a la sexualite chez les personnes agees ayant plusieurs partenaires et vivant dans des residences subventionnees pour personnes agees. Il utilise des donnees d'enquete et qualitatives provenant d'une approche de methodes mixtes du vieillissement/VIH pour illustrer les opinions fondees sur le genre, a propos des comportements sexuels et intimes, et les attitudes vis-a-vis du sexe transactionnel/commercial. Les donnees suggerent que les femmes sont prudentes lorsqu'il s'agit de s'engager dans des relations intimes, alors que les hommes les recherchent, de meme que la compagnie qu'elles procurent, pour resoudre leur probleme de solitude. Les obstacles a la non-intimite sont l'age et les problemes de sante. D'une maniere generale, les hommes comme les femmes ont des attitudes positives vis-a-vis des rapports sexuels. Les hommes prennent des risques en ayant des partenaires multiples et en utilisant des preservatifs irregulierement ; les femmes croient qu'elles peuvent eviter les risques en prenant le temps de faire connaissance avec leurs partenaires, mais n'utilisent jamais de preservatifs. Quarante pour cent des hommes qui frequentent des travailleuses du sexe n'utilisent pas de preservatifs de maniere reguliere. Ils echangent le risque de rumeurs, de violences et d'infections contre la compagnie de femmes qui cherchent a obtenir de l'argent et une securite physique. Les resultats ont des implications pour les politiques, le conseil et les interventions destines aux personnes agees et sexuellement actives dans les environnements institutionnels et residentiels. ResumenEn este articulo analizamos los comportamientos y significados relacionados con la intimidad y la sexualidad en adultos mayores con varias parejas que viven en viviendas subvencionadas para la tercera edad. Mediante datos cualitativos y de estudios a partir de metodos combinados de exposicion al virus del sida en personas mayores ilustramos las opiniones de los diferentes generos con respecto a conductas sexuales e intimas, y actitudes hacia el sexo transaccional/comercial. Los datos indican que las mujeres eran prudentes a la hora de participar en relaciones intimas mientras que los hombres buscaban estas relaciones y la compania que proporcionaban paliaba la soledad.
   La edad y los problemas de salud eran motivos para no tener relaciones intimas. En terminos generales, tanto los hombres como las mujeres tenian actitudes positivas con respecto a las relaciones sexuales. Los hombres corrian riesgos al tener varias parejas a la vez y usar preservativos de forma irregular; las mujeres pensaban que podian evitar riesgos si dedicaban mas tiempo a conocer a sus parejas, pero nunca utilizaban preservativos. El cuarenta por ciento de los hombres que tenian relaciones con trabajadoras sexuales no utilizaban preservativos de forma regular. Corrian el riesgo de habladurias, violencia e infecciones para tener la compania de mujeres que buscaban dinero y seguridad fisica. Los resultados tienen repercusiones en las politicas, el asesoramiento y los programas para adultos mayores sexualmente activos en entornos institucionales y residenciales.

AB  - Racial and ethnic prejudice is one of the most pressing problems in modern societies. Although previous social neuroscience research has suggested the amygdala as a key structure in racial prejudice, it still remains elusive whether the amygdala activity reflects negative attitudes toward an outgroup or other unrelated processes. The present study aims to rigorously WA the role of the amygdala in negative prejudice toward an outgroup. Seventy Japanese individuals passively viewed images related to an ethnic outgroup (South Korea) inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Using Multi-Voxel Pattern Analysis (MVPA), we found that Japanese individuals' level of implicit (but not explicit) evaluations of South Korea could be predicted from neural signals in the left amygdala. Our result further suggested that the medial and lateral parts of amygdala play different roles in implicit evaluations. In contrast to the MVPA findings, conventional univariate analyses failed to find any reliable relationship between brain activation and both implicit and explicit evaluations. Our findings provide evidence for the amygdala's role in representing an implicit form of prejudice and highlight the utility of the multivariate approach to reveal neural signatures of this complex social phenomenon.

   Method: A rapid qualitative assessment was conducted in three geographically diverse provinces that reported low coverage (<50%) of HepB-BD. Using purposive sampling of participants, 29 focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with caregivers (n = 96), healthcare providers (n = 75), and healthcare administrators (n = 16). Summary notes from these were translated, and inductive coding was used to derive themes. The SAGE Vaccine Hesitancy Determinants Matrix was used as a theoretical framework to organize barriers and facilitators associated with the themes into three levels of influence.
   Results: At the individual and group level, caregivers who had higher levels of knowledge about HepB-BD sought the vaccine proactively, while others with lower knowledge faced barriers to the vaccine. Some caregivers reported a negative attitude toward health services because of a language barrier or had generalized concerns about HepB-BD due to media reporting of the past adverse events. Distress arising from potential adverse events was equally common among healthcare providers. At the contextual level, the physical environment made it difficult for caregivers to access healthcare facilities and for providers to conduct outreach. Home births posed a challenge for timely administration of HepB-BD, while health facility births facilitated it. Vaccination-specific barriers included misinterpretation of pre-vaccination screening criteria and asking for the consent of caregivers. Inadequate resources for service delivery negatively influenced HepB-BD attitudes and practices.
   Conclusion: Given the diversity of barriers associated with attitudes towards and practices of HepB-BD in the three provinces, tailored interventions will be necessary for both demandand supply-side factors. Rural areas, often with more home births and geographic barriers, may require focused attention. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Avoiding catastrophic climate change will require rapid decarbonization of the world's energy supply systems, and achieving such a significant transformation will involve a range of social and psychological challenges. The authors write that public consent and acceptability will need to be fostered if plans for large-scale renewable energy systems are to be realized. Despite highly favorable views in national polls, some renewable projects have already encountered severe public contestation. The authors write that valuable lessons can be learned from existing research on the siting controversies that have surrounded nuclear power and radioactive waste facilities. A range of contextual factors drive local opposition: lack of tangible local benefits, threats to valued landscapes or community identity, and distrust of outside agencies. Poorly executed dialogue and communication processes also serve to rapidly escalate concerns. The "facility siting credo" provides an important set of evidence-based principles for those seeking to engage communities about new renewable energy infrastructure projects.

AB  - Background: Much research suggests that the general public relies on the popular media as its main source of information about mental illness. Assessing media representations of people with mental illness is vitally important, given that research suggests that the media exerts a strong, often negative, influence on public attitudes.
   Aims: Few specific methodological guidelines exist to help researchers conducting media analyses. The aim of this article is to describe lessons learnt from over 2 years of experience conducting a large-scale systematic national project analyzing media portrayals of mental illness.
   Methods: We do this by presenting and discussing five of the biggest challenges (and associated solutions) that have faced us as we have progressed in our national study.
   Results: These are as follows: (i) defining relevant search terms; (ii) developing appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria; (iii) creating a coding scheme; (iv) choosing strategies of analysis and dissemination and (v) staffing and training issues.
   Conclusion: It is our hope that the information purveyed in this article may help those analyzing media representations of mental illness elsewhere.

AB  - The article discusses the concept of the site "usability" as an indicator of educational institution media culture. Being a multicomponent concept, usability (the level of accessibility, simplicity and comfort for a visitor to work with the site) includes not only objective aspects affecting operational comfort, but also subjective aspects of perceiving the web interface. The user should easily find the necessary information without getting lost in the functionality and numerous pages, and at the same time enjoy working with the resource. The criteria matrix proposed by the authors allows to study the level of the site usability of a general educational institution and evaluate its success. The research results based on the sites of 37 basic schools of the Kirov region included in the Basic School Project showed that focusing on user-friendly web-interface parameters is poorly developed. Educational organizations do not pay due attention to the proper development of the header (the "head" of the site), the footer (the "basement" of the site), and of the site content usability as a whole. Despite the fact that the resources analyzed dearly demonstrate complying with legal requirements to the structure and content of the site, at the same time, the user convenience parameters are taken into account insignificantly. All this reduce the work efficiency, leads to site visitors' dissatisfaction. It is emphasized that usability plays an important role in the effective interaction of students with the institution, affects the formation of the school image and loyal public attitude. The research results are of practical importance and can be used to increase the level of information work and media culture of educational institutions in the Internet.

AB  - Objective: Facial masks are an essential personal protective measure to fight the COVID-19 (coronavirus disease) pandemic. However, the mask adoption rate in the United States is still less than optimal. This study aims to understand the beliefs held by individuals who oppose the use of facial masks, and the evidence that they use to support these beliefs, to inform the development of targeted public health communication strategies.
   Materials and Methods: We analyzed a total of 771 268 U.S.-based tweets between January to October 2020. We developed machine learning classifiers to identify and categorize relevant tweets, followed by a qualitative content analysis of a subset of the tweets to understand the rationale of those opposed mask wearing.
   Results: We identified 267 152 tweets that contained personal opinions about wearing facial masks to prevent the spread of COVID-19. While the majority of the tweets supported mask wearing, the proportion of anti-mask tweets stayed constant at about a 10% level throughout the study period. Common reasons for opposition included physical discomfort and negative effects, lack of effectiveness, and being unnecessary or inappropriate for certain people or under certain circumstances. The opposing tweets were significantly less likely to cite external sources of information such as public health agencies' websites to support the arguments.
   Conclusions: Combining machine learning and qualitative content analysis is an effective strategy for identifying public attitudes toward mask wearing and the reasons for opposition. The results may inform better communication strategies to improve the public perception of wearing masks and, in particular, to specifically address common anti-mask beliefs.

AB  - Identification with a superordinate entity, like Europe, reduces prejudice towards immigrants in general, but no research so far investigated if this differs between prejudice towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe. Using online survey data from four European countries, we determined whether national and European identification are (differently) related to attitudes towards immigrants from inside and outside Europe, and to which extent these relations can be explained by differences in refugee threat perceptions. We found that those who strongly identify with Europe hold more favorable views towards both European and non-European immigrants, while the reverse effect is found for strong national identifiers - an effect that can be explained by realistic and symbolic refugee threat perceptions. We did not find evidence for our expectation that the strength of the associations of national identification on attitudes and threat perceptions would depend on the level of European identification of participants. Overall, our findings provide mixed support for the Common In-group Identity Model because European identifiers, although more positive towards immigrants, did not make strong distinctions between European and non-European immigrants.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 infodemic, a surge of information and misinformation, has sparked worry about the public's perception of the coronavirus pandemic. Excessive information and misinformation can lead to belief in false information as well as reduce the accurate interpretation of true information. Such incorrect beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic might lead to behavior that puts people at risk of both contracting and spreading the virus.
   Objective: The objective of this study was two-fold. First, we attempted to gain insight into public beliefs about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 in one of the worst hit countries: the United States. Second, we aimed to test whether a short intervention could improve people's belief accuracy by empowering them to consider scientific consensus when evaluating claims related to the pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted a 4-week longitudinal study among US citizens, starting on April 27, 2020, just after daily COVID-19 deaths in the United States had peaked. Each week, we measured participants' belief accuracy related to the coronavirus and COVID-19 by asking them to indicate to what extent they believed a number of true and false statements (split 50/50). Furthermore, each new survey wave included both the original statements and four new statements: two false and two true statements. Half of the participants were exposed to an intervention aimed at increasing belief accuracy. The intervention consisted of a short infographic that set out three steps to verify information by searching for and verifying a scientific consensus.
   Results: A total of 1202 US citizens, balanced regarding age, gender, and ethnicity to approximate the US general public, completed the baseline (T0) wave survey. Retention rate for the follow-up waves-first follow-up wave (T1), second follow-up wave (T2), and final wave (T3)-was high (>= 85%). Mean scores of belief accuracy were high for all waves, with scores reflecting low belief in false statements and high belief in true statements; the belief accuracy scale ranged from -1, indicating completely inaccurate beliefs, to 1, indicating completely accurate beliefs (T0 mean 0.75, T1 mean 0.78, T2 mean 0.77, and T3 mean 0.75). Accurate beliefs were correlated with self-reported behavior aimed at preventing the coronavirus from spreading (eg, social distancing) (r at all waves was between 0.26 and 0.29 and all P values were less than .001) and were associated with trust in scientists (ie, higher trust was associated with more accurate beliefs), political orientation (ie, liberal, Democratic participants held more accurate beliefs than conservative, Republican participants), and the primary news source (ie, participants reporting CNN or Fox News as the main news source held less accurate beliefs than others). The intervention did not significantly improve belief accuracy.
   Conclusions: The supposed infodemic was not reflected in US citizens' beliefs about the COVID-19 pandemic. Most people were quite able to figure out the facts in these relatively early days of the crisis, calling into question the prevalence of misinformation and the public's susceptibility to misinformation.

AB  - Background: HIV stigma in health care settings acts as a significant barrier to health care. Stigma drivers among health professionals include transmission fears and misconceptions and pre-existing negative attitudes toward marginalized groups vulnerable to HIV. The DriSti intervention, consisted of 2 sessions with videos and interactive exercises on a computer tablet and one interactive face-to-face group session, mostly tablet administered, was designed to target key stigma drivers that included instrumental stigma, symbolic stigma, transmission misconceptions and blame to reduce HIV stigma, and discrimination among nursing students (NS) and ward staff and tested in a cluster randomized trial. Setting: This report focuses on second and third year NS recruited from a range of nursing schools that included private, nonprofit, and government-run nursing schools in south India. Results: Six hundred seventy-nine NS received intervention and 813 NS were in the wait-list control group. Twelve months outcome analyses showed significant reduction among intervention participants in endorsement of coercive policies (P < 0.001) and in the number of situations in which NS intended to discriminate against PLWH (P < 0.001). Mediation analysis revealed that the effects of intervention on endorsement of coercive policies and intent to discriminate against PLWH were partially mediated by reductions in key stigma drivers. Conclusions: This brief scalable stigma reduction intervention targeting key stigma drivers fills a critical gap in identifying the mechanistic pathways that aid in stigma reduction among health professionals.

AB  - Objective: The media is largely regarded as an important stakeholder in health service delivery, with a great influence on public attitudes. However, little is known about its interest in mental health and the guiding factors that influence media coverage of mental health issues. This article describes the importance accorded to mental health by the media and the factors that influence media coverage of mental health issues in Uganda. Method: Semi-structured interviews were held with representatives from six prominent media houses as part of the situational analysis of the mental health system in Uganda. Data was analyzed using Nvivo 7 qualitative data analysis software. Results: The media was found to be interested and actively involved in health initiatives, but with little attention devoted to mental health. Coverage and interest in mental health was noted to be mainly dependent on the individual journalists' interests, and mostly for personal reasons. Low interest was largely attributed to mental health being perceived as a non-priority area, and the fact that mental illness is not a major contributor to mortality Media coverage and reporting is guided by prioritization of the Health Department. Conclusion: The media in Uganda is an important stakeholder in the health care system with a key role of advocacy publicity and mass education. Media houses however are less interested in mental health as evidenced by low coverage of mental health issues. This calls for advocacy and sensitization as a way of persuading media for more involvement in mental health initiatives.

AB  - Demonstrations have become more visible across Europe since the Great Recession. To clarify the connection between crisis and protest, we open the black box of crisis-related grievances, suggesting a typology for this subjective phenomenon and addressing the mediating role of emotions on protest. Using panel data, we explore the dimensionality of thirty different items that Spanish citizens have claimed to endure as a consequence of the crisis, and then we test their potential of these grievances as triggers of protest. Results show that both financial deprivation and grievances related to worker-citizens' status and rights encourage protest activity. Crisis-related grievances trigger negative emotions, and curiously enough, both anger and anxiety boost protest. Our findings hold, regardless of political ideology, previous participation, or perceptions of self-efficacy.

AB  - Objective: Media portrayals of severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, psychosis and bipolar disorders, are often negative or prominently linked to violence or crime and consequently have a negative influence on public attitudes and behaviours. This study aimed to determine key stakeholders' recommendations for improving news reporting of severe mental illness in the context of violence and crime.
   Method: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with Australian key stakeholders including people with lived experience of severe mental illness (n = 12), news media professionals (n = 12) and mental health professionals (n = 8) with expertise in media reporting of mental illness. Data were analysed thematically.
   Results: Recommendations for improving news reports of violence and crime were consistent with existing guidance for reporting on mental illness more generally. This covered inclusion of positive stories of the lived experience of severe mental illness, avoiding undue prominence of severe mental illness, and discussing underlying broader social issues. The importance of improving media professionals' understanding of mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, psychosis and bipolar disorder was emphasised. Additional supports and resources were acknowledged as being necessary to facilitate change to media portrayals. Incentives for improving media portrayals barriers and enablers were also discussed.
   Discussion: These findings indicate that it would be useful and feasible to implement guidelines for media reporting on severe mental illness that provide specific and detailed guidance for reporting on violence and crime. Feedback from participants has already informed the development of these guidelines, and the findings of this study will inform their implementation to help ensure widespread dissemination and uptake.

AB  - Purpose - The study aims to examine consumer attitudes toward offshore-outsourcing of professional services in the USA. It focuses on the services of accountants, attorneys and doctors to provide a framework for discussing policy and marketing implications.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study reviews a review of the literature on consumer decision-making under uncertainty and attitude formation, and a focus group study to examine consumers' attitudes toward offshore-outsourcing of professional services.
   Findings - Contrary to reports in the popular press, this paper suggests that consumers do not have a generalized negative attitude toward offshore-outsourcing of all forms of professional services. While consumers do not mind offshore-outsourcings of the services of medical doctors and attorneys, they seem to be concerned about offshore-outsourcings of accounting or financial services. These results suggest that persons engaged in offshore-outsourcings of tax and other related services must re-strategize.
   Research limitations/implications - While the results of this study offer a window into the US consumers' feelings about offshore-outsourcings of professional services, the results lack generalizability, as they are based on an exploratory study.
   Practical implications - Even though outsourcing has received a lot of media attention and some limited attention from academics, no study, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has specifically investigated US consumers' attitudes toward offshore-outsourcings of professional services. Given the fact that the trend is growing instead of abating, a study, such as the current one, that investigates how consumers feel about the practice is not only timely but will also provide valuable information to managers for strategy reformulation and to lawmakers for regulation purposes.
   Originality/value - This paper, to the best of the authors' knowledge, is the first to specifically examine consumer attitude toward offshoring of the basic professional services - the services of doctors, accountants and attorneys.

TI  - The social media response to twice-weekly mass asymptomatic testing in England
T2  - BMC PUBLIC HEALTH
LA  - English
KW  - COVID-19
KW  - Public health
KW  - Asymptomatic testing
AB  - Background From 9th April 2021, everyone in England has been encouraged to take two COVID-19 tests per week. This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to describe the effect of religiosity on luxury and counterfeit purchase intentions and to determine the role of consumer ethics in the context of counterfeit purchase intention. The conceptual framework is based on Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In the context of counterfeit consumption, religiosity is proposed to be an added component to the theory, while ethical consumption is proposed to mediate the relationship between religiosity and counterfeit purchase intention. In the context of luxury consumption, religiosity is proposed to precede TPB components which then affect luxury purchase intention. Design/methodology/approach This is a descriptive study; this study uses a mixed-methods approach, where eight semi-structured in-depth interviews and 500 surveys were conducted and distributed to Egyptian luxury consumers. Findings The major results suggest that religiosity and ethical consumption negatively affect counterfeit purchase intention as proposed. The results also reveal that religiosity did not necessitate a negative attitude toward luxury consumption. Religiosity was found to have a positive effect on attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Only subjective norms had significant effect on luxury purchase intention in the research context. Originality/value This paper contributes to the TPB by adding religiosity to the theory components as well as integrating the theory of planned behavior with Consumer's Ethics theory in the context of counterfeit consumption. The study is an attempt to compare between luxury and counterfeit purchase intention while considering the role of individual's religiosity in these purchases.

AB  - Introduction: The appearance of the skin and its appendages not only reflects the general body condition, but also exerts an effect on one's self-esteem and self-image, and the way he/she is perceived by the others.
   Aim: To analyse the quality of life (QOL) in dermatological diseases, assessed by the patients themselves and the nurses being their caregivers.
   Material and methods: The survey was completed by 300 patients diagnosed with various dermatological conditions; however, only the data from 281 surveys were considered during the analysis. All patients completed an anonymous questionnaire designed specifically for the purpose of the study. The survey included 32 questions. Moreover, the study patients were surveyed with the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Moreover, the study included 1713 nurses employed in various healthcare institutions and providing care to patients with dermatological diseases. The survey for the nurses consisted of 32 questions.
   Results: Mean DLQI score for the study patients was 12.4 +/- 8.1 points. Based on the median, lower and upper quartile values, every fourth person presented with DLQI scores > 18 points, half of the respondents had DLQI scores no greater than 12 points, and every fourth respondent experienced good QOL (DLQI score no higher than 5 points).
   Conclusions: According to the majority of patients and nurses, individuals with skin conditions are not fully able to cope with their disease and show a negative attitude towards it. The QOL of patients with skin diseases is determined by the type of the dermatological condition.

AB  - Minority stress, which includes discrimination as well as internalized negative attitudes, is an important factor associated with maladaptive health behaviors such as binge eating among sexual minority individuals. In addition, body shame and social anxiety are robust predictors of binge eating. We examined social anxiety and body shame as sequential mediators of the association between minority stress and binge eating among young adult lesbian women. We hypothesized that social anxiety would be a key factor linking minority stress to body shame and binge eating. Self-identified lesbian women (N = 496) completed online measures of minority stress, social anxiety, body shame, and binge eating. Structural equation modeling supported the hypothesized model. Discrimination and proximal sexual minority stress were associated with increased social anxiety. In turn, social anxiety was associated with more body shame, and body shame was related to binge eating. Results suggest the oppressive social environments created by the experience of minority stress may have adverse consequences for lesbian women's body satisfaction and eating behaviors. Interventions that bolster coping with sexual minority stress and focus on reducing social anxiety, in addition to targeting eating behavior directly, may be particularly useful for lesbian women with eating disorders or binge eating.

AB  - The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to examine university students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and towards the need for the implementation of education for sustainable development into the higher education system. To that end, the paper explores in a process-oriented focus which drivers and barriers are experienced as being the most important ones and how they relate to one another.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is based on the questionnaire for the evaluation of attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development. This instrument consists of 9 batteries with 83 items presented in the form of the five-point Likert scale. The questionnaire evaluated different aspects of respondents' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development, but students' attitudes in relation to the items from the following subscales will be presented for this paper: understanding the concept of sustainable development, position of sustainable development in the system of higher education, sources of information about sustainable development and entities responsible for sustainable development. The study sample consisted of students from the University of Novi Sad, specifically from the faculties with accredited programs in the field of humanities and technological sciences.
   Findings
   In general, students recognized the main determinants of sustainable development and they support an integral approach to sustainability, i.e. the need to include the knowledge, values and skills for sustainable development in the higher education programs. In addition, they identified a number of obstacles and the uncertainties of overcoming them. In this regard, the students did not recognize the responsibility of the higher education institutions as the key responsibility or their own responsibility in relation to sustainable development, which can be related to their feeling of marginalization and the doubt that their behaviour and decisions can influence the development of the local society, as well as the development of the society as a whole. On the other hand, the respondents acknowledged the role, the importance and the responsibility of the mass media in the process of developing the attitudes towards and opinions about the problems related to environmental protection and sustainable development.
   Practical implications
   The results of the study indicate the students' attitudes towards sustainable development, thus making the directions for higher education reform clearer and in line with the present needs for sustainable development in Serbia. The obtained results can serve as a recommendation to the governing structures, i.e. to the relevant ministries of education and environmental protection, as well as to the universities in terms of which direction their process of planning and creating paths of sustainability should take. This is particularly important in the case of the Republic of Serbia, which is currently in the process of joining the European Union and responding to the requirements set by the process of negotiation for Chapter 27 in terms of improving the strategic framework and plans for the education for sustainable development and building the capacities in response to climate change. On the other hand, linking the results of this research with the results of similar studies around the world contributes to the further enrichment of the scientific knowledge base in this field and confirms the need for stronger and united efforts on the path to a sustainable future.
   It is a fact that, regardless of the national, economic, socio-political and cultural context, there is a global lack of success in shaping a humane and sustainable relationship between man and nature. Therefore, the results of this research should be considered as an invitation for new research initiatives regarding the ways to support the positive attitudes of students towards the concept of sustainable development and to facilitate their further development in the educational process, as well as in other academic domains.
   Originality/value
   This research is inspired by the fact that, in the Balkan countries, education for sustainable development has not been extensively discussed within the scientific discourse on higher education for sustainable development. This is one of the first papers to provide data about students' attitudes towards the concept of sustainable development and the need for its implementation in the higher education system in Serbia. The value of the paper lies in its potential to help understand the role that different drivers and barriers play in higher education for sustainable development.

AB  - This paper considers how the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) have a hand in dismantling Apartheid's spatial violences and the potential to foster a renewed sense of belonging and good citizenship in public spaces. Three South African case studies are presented: the Maboneng Township Arts Experience (Johannesburg and Cape Town), the Infecting the City public arts festival (Cape Town) and the Open Streets initiative (Cape Town). The three initiatives are attempting to change how people interface with their cities and exemplify the potential role the CCIs play in mediating feelings of belonging, promoting access and supporting socio-economic development. The case studies can be categorised in different ways, but they are driven by common interests in how they view cities, spatialities, public attitudes, and the 'real' and symbolic economy. They all have to negotiate challenging bureaucratic boundaries that regulate public space. These are the policies generated and managed by city governments that have become critical mechanisms for negotiating how public life is enriched with and by art and culture. They also have to negotiate these bureaucratic boundaries alongside commercial interests. Accordingly the paper will examine how these three public development and support initiatives are yielding positive socio-economic and symbolic results in the South African CCI landscape.

AB  - Background: School closures have inevitably deprived students of their traditional source of information. The objective of this study was to determine knowledge, attitudes, and safety practices about COVID-19 among high school students in Iran.
   Methods: This study was conducted from March 24th-April 3rd, 2020. Data were collected via an online-parent-administrative questionnaire.
   Results: Responses of 704 students were analyzed. Students' mean (SD) knowledge score was 21.5 (4.6) of 30. More than 90% of students knew about the cause of the disease, the routes of transmission, and the most renowned symptoms: dyspnea and cough. Social-and- audiovisual-media were the leading information source. Most students believed that people need to keep safe physical distancing, everyone should isolate themselves upon symptoms onset, people should avoid unnecessary in-person contact with family and friends, and that cities need to go under lockdowns if needed. Students' mean (SD) practice score was 20.2 (2.5) of 24. Most students did not go on a trip, and more than 80% said they would wear facemasks when going outside.
   Conclusions: High school students' knowledge and safety practices about COVID-19 were somewhat satisfactory, and their attitudes toward the disease were mainly positive. Nevertheless, some witnessed knowledge gaps, negative attitudes, and unsafe practices in the study highlighted the need for targeted education on the pandemic. Social and mass media's significant role and potential could be utilized to battle misinformation and deliver proper knowledge to young adolescents.

AB  - Background: Inequities in health are a major challenge for health care planners and policymakers globally. In Vietnam, rapid societal development presents a considerable risk for disadvantaged populations to be left behind. The aim of this review is to map the known causes and determinants of inequity in maternal and child health in Vietnam in order to promote policy action.
   Methods: A review was performed through systematic searches of Pubmed and Proquest and manual searches of "grey literature." A thematic content analysis guided by the conceptual framework suggested by the Commission on Social Determinants of Health was performed.
   Results: More than thirty different causes and determinants of inequity in maternal and child health were identified. Some determinants worth highlighting were the influence of informal fees and the many testimonies of discrimination and negative attitudes from health staff towards women in general and ethnic minorities in particular. Research gaps were identified, such as a lack of studies investigating the influence of education on health care utilization, informal costs of care, and how psychosocial factors mediate inequity.
   Conclusions: The evidence of corruption and discrimination as mediators of health inequity in Vietnam calls for attention and indicates a need for more structural interventions such as better governance and anti-discriminatory laws. More research is needed in order to fully understand the pathways of inequities in health in Vietnam and suggest areas for intervention for policy action to reach disadvantaged populations.

AB  - This study examines how political activists are framing the space weaponization debate in Canada and whether their arguments can influence public attitudes and perceptions about the issue. Eighty university students from two undergraduate courses were recruited as participants in a quasi-experiment. One class (n = 38) was exposed to the documentary Masters of Space, an episode of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's program The Nature of Things, and another class (n = 42) served as the control group. Pre-test and post-test questionnaires were used to measure the effects of viewing anti-weaponization arguments in the media, while also controlling for the influence of prior beliefs and background characteristics of participants. Results suggest that visually depicting the use of satellite technology in society can convince viewers that satellites are important to their way of life, but not necessarily to the defense of North America. Framing missile defense as a 'space weapon in disguise' also seemed to raise opposition to Canada's participation in continental missile defense. The findings, meanwhile, indicate that viewers respond strongly to the issue of space debris and that mobilizing support for joint military space projects may best be achieved by emphasizing the usefulness of these projects for locating and tracking such debris. In the end, media exposure seemed to help legitimize anti-weaponization arguments based more on rational self-interests than on idealistic beliefs. These findings can have implications for the way space policies are communicated to the public. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The outcomes of social interactions among members of different groups (e.g., racial groups, political groups, sexual orientation groups) have long been of interest to psychologists. Two related literatures on the topic have emergedthe intergroup interaction literature and the intergroup contact literaturein which divergent conclusions have been reported. Intergroup interaction is typically found to have negative effects tied to intergroup bias, producing heightened stress, intergroup anxiety, or outgroup avoidance, whereas intergroup contact is typically found to have positive effects tied to intergroup bias, predicting lower intergroup anxiety and lower prejudice. We examine these paradoxical findings, proposing that researchers contributing to the two literatures are examining different levels of the same phenomenon and that methodological differences can account for the divide between the literatures. Further, we introduce a mathematical model by which the findings of the two literatures can be reconciled. We believe that adopting this model will streamline thinking in the field and will generate integrative new research in which investigators examine how a person's experiences with diversity unfold.

AB  - Objectives As young children increasingly grow up in a digital environment, parents are confronted with the question whether and how to regulate young children's digital gaming effectively. The goal of this study was to examine correlates of parents' degree of restrictive mediation and their (autonomy-supportive or controlling) style of doing so. Specifically, we tested associations of parents' degree and style of restrictive mediation with parents' attitudes about digital gaming, parental perceptions of children's defiance and problematic gaming, and their interest in social play.
   Methods A sample of 762 parents of children between 3 and 9 years filled out questionnaires on their degree and style of restrictive mediation, their attitudes about gaming, and their perceptions of children's oppositional defiance, problematic gaming, and interest in social play.
   Results We found that parents who hold more negative attitudes about digital gaming were more likely to use a controlling style when mediating their child's gaming. Further, a higher degree of restrictive mediation generally related to more adaptive child outcomes (i.e., lower levels of perceived defiance and problematic gaming, higher levels of perceived interest in social play), whereas the opposite pattern was found for parents' controlling style of mediation. Finally, these associations were not moderated by children's age or gender, nor by parents' gender or educational level.
   Conclusions Also in the context of children's digital gaming, it seems important for parents to set clear rules. Yet, when doing so, it is equally important to refrain from using controlling strategies, as they seem to be counterproductive.

AB  - Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) has long been successfully applied to such behaviors such as nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) and more recently, bulimic behaviors. However, it is less clear how patients experiencing these comorbid symptoms may benefit from this treatment modality. Self-criticism, defined as a highly negative attitude towards the self, has been implicated in both EDs and NSSI and is amenable to DBT; thus, further examination of this construct may be beneficial in informing DBT treatment approaches. However, research has only examined these relationships cross-sectionally and no published research has examined self-criticism as a longitudinal predictor of NSSI and ED symptoms. Thus, this study examined self-criticism as a potential driving factor of NSSI in EDs in order to inform treatments, particularly DBT. Data were collected from 92 treatment-seeking adults at ED treatment facilities in the United States. Participants self-reported ED pathology, NSSI engagement, and self-criticism at baseline and a two-month follow-up. A path analysis revealed that self-criticism at baseline was associated with NSSI frequency at follow-up over and above baseline NSSI and ED symptomology. Self-criticism at baseline was not associated with ED pathology at follow-up. Self-criticism longitudinally predicted NSSI, but not ED pathology, in an ED sample. As such, it may be important for clinicians to assess for self-criticism and consider treatments that target both self-criticism and self-injury, like DBT, for this population.

AB  - Background: Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer affecting women. The five most frequent cancers affecting women in India are breast, cervical, oral cavity, lung, and colorectal cancer. More women die from cervical cancer in India than in any other country. Cancers of major public health relevance such as breast, oral, cervical, gastric, lung, and colorectal cancer can be cured if detected early and treated adequately. The objective of this study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer screening and prevention. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 100 professional college female students to obtain information about their knowledge and attitudes on cervical cancer screening and prevention. Results: In this study, we intended to assess the knowledge and attitudes toward cervical cancer screening and prevention among 100 professional college female students with a mean age of 18 years. All the respondents were single. Majority of the respondents were not aware about the cervical cancer, PAP smear testing, and human papillomavirus vaccine. Conclusion: These results indicate that most of the students participated in our study were not aware about the cervical cancer screening and prevention. Deaths resulting from cervical cancer are tragic as this type of cancer develops slowly, which is treatable and can be prevented through screening. Therefore, it is important that negative attitudes and gaps in knowledge should be addressed early before the women reach suitable ages for screening and vaccination.

AB  - A correlational study investigated extended contact as a strategy to improve outgroup attitudes and stereotyping and to prepare children for future contact. Additional aims were to investigate when and why the effects of extended contact occur. In particular, intergroup empathy was tested as a mediator and direct contact (i.e. cross-group friendship) as a moderator of extended contact. Participants were Italian and immigrant elementary school children. Results showed that extended contact was associated with improved intergroup empathy, which, in turn, was associated with more positive outgroup attitudes, stereotypes and behavioural intentions. These effects were significant only among participants with a low or moderate level of direct contact. The theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

AB  - The current COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by the circulation of an unprecedented amount of "polluted" information, especially in the social media environment, among which are false narratives and conspiracy theories about both the pandemic and vaccination against COVID-19. The effects of such questionable information primarily concern the lack of compliance with restrictive measures and a negative attitude towards vaccination campaigns, as well as more complex social effects, such as street protests or distrust in governments and authorities in general. Even though there is a lot of scholarly attention given to these narratives in many countries, research about the profile of people who are more prone to believe or spread them is rather scarce. In this context, we investigate the role of age, compared with other socio-demographic factors (such as education and religiosity), as well as the role of the media (the frequency of news consumption, the perceived usefulness of social media, and the perceived incidence of fake information about the virus in the media) and the critical thinking disposition of people who tend to believe such misleading narratives. To address these issues, we conducted a national survey (N = 945) in April 2021 in Romania. Using a hierarchical OLS regression model, we found that people who perceive higher incidence of fake news (ss = 0.33, p < 0.001), find social media platforms more useful (ss = 0.13, p < 0.001), have lower education (ss = -0.17, p < 0.001), and have higher levels of religiosity (ss = 0.08, p < 0.05) are more prone to believe COVID-19-related misleading narratives. At the same time, the frequency of news consumption (regardless of the type of media), critical thinking disposition, and age do not play a significant role in the profile of the believer in conspiracy theories about the COVID-19 pandemic. Somewhat surprisingly, age does not play a role in predicting belief in conspiracy theories, even though there are studies that suggest that older people are more prone to believe conspiracy narratives. As far as media is concerned, the frequency of news media consumption does not significantly differ for believers and non-believers. We discuss these results within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

AB  - The focal aim of the project was to assess the economic anxiety (EA) and the performance of small and medium enterprises (SMEs) during partial and full lockdowns in Kuwait. The challenges facing the SMEs during COVID-19 and the potential solutions were also explored. The call for this vital investigation was due to the global economic fallout and the shocking drop within the marketplace caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A descriptive approach was used for online survey design to collect datasets from 147 SMEs spanning all governorates of Kuwait in the period between March and June 2021. It included sociodemographic data, economic anxiety perception, potential challenges and solutions to SMEs, and SMEs' performance. The data analysis using SPSS 25 showed that 78.2% of the SMEs were affected directly by the COVID-19 pandemic, and about 83% were affected negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. In comparison, only 12.2% experienced a positive impact, mainly medical, technology, social media, food supplies, and delivery or logistics industries. With great concerns of SMEs for all dimensions related to economic anxiety (with an average of around 3.95), the greatest concerns were the financial and cash flow, followed by labor shortage (an average between 4.51 and 5.00). The results also showed that most of the performance indicators for the SMEs were low (with an average of less than or equal to 2.5), and more than 66% of them worked fewer hours during the pandemic; the number of operating hours was dropped dramatically. More than 74% of the SMEs used technology in more than 20% of their activities, representing an increase in using technologies of about 44%, and about 25.2% used social networks in more than 80% of their activities. The performance of SMEs is also found to be significantly and positively correlated with the economic anxiety levels, with a correlation coefficient of 0.186. The findings revealed significant and crucial outcomes for policymaking, decision-makers, and governmental agencies to build recovery plans and proper actions needed to manage the consequences caused by the disaster against the economic and other developments within the context of SMEs. Overall, there is a clear need to find ways and customize operations to adapt to the new work modes that require social distancing, online operations, and site management. In addition, new alternative modes of SMEs work follow to compensate for the lower working hours from the office and increased online working from home.

AB  - Based on theories of narrative engagement and embodied cognition, we hypothesised that a fit between the psychological state of a protagonist and the physical sensation of the viewer would enhance the subsequent identification with the protagonist, but not para-social relationship with him (seeing the protagonist as a friend). We also hypothesised that identification and a para-social relationship would lead to distinct effects on attitudes related to the narrative. Participants (N = 60) were randomly assigned to either a warmed or cooled room where they watched a movie clip alone in which a suffering protagonist wanted to undergo euthanasia while his close others wanted him to stay alive. Then, the participants answered a questionnaire measuring their identification and para-social relationship with the protagonist and their attitudes toward euthanasia. In accordance with the hypotheses, the results demonstrated that feeling cold enhanced identification with the suffering protagonist. However, the environmental temperature did not affect the development of para-social relationships. Moreover, identification with the suffering protagonist contributed to acceptance of his attitudes, reflected in more positive views of euthanasia. In contrast, having a para-social relationship with the protagonist resulted in negative attitudes toward euthanasia.

AB  - This article presents the results of three studies that examine how the perceived opinions of others are related to sexual minorities' support for social change toward greater equality. Results of two cross-sectional studies (Study 1: N = 1,220; Study 2: N = 904) reveal that perceived intolerance (i.e., perceived intolerant societal norms) is indirectly related to intentions to engage in collective action in both negative and positive ways: the negative effect was mediated by lower perceptions of perceived efficacy; positive effects were mediated by greater anger (about the legal situation and public opinion) and greater perceived need for a movement. Study 3 (N = 408) replicates this conflicting effect with a delayed outcome measure by showing that perceived intolerant norms were indirectly, both negatively and positively, associated with actual collective action engagement. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of our expanded social identity model of collective action.

AB  - Intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) is the most common form of violence suffered by women and constitutes a serious public health problem of global proportions. Public attitudes towards IPVAW are key to understanding the social context in which this type of violence occurs. Victim-blaming attitudes are among those that reflect public tolerance and acceptability of IPVAW and are often used to explain or justify IPVAW. In this study we develop and validate a new instrument to assess victim-blaming attitudes in cases of IPVAW. A sample of 1,800 participants was recruited through social media and a second sample of 50 IPVAW offenders was used for validation purposes. Through a cross-validation approach and by fitting an item response theory model to the data, we found that the latent structure of the instrument was one-dimensional and particularly informative for medium and high levels of victim-blaming attitudes. Differential item functioning analysis showed that item parameters did not differ by gender. We found, in addition, that (a) our measure was strongly related to acceptability and perceived severity of IPVAW, and also to ambivalent sexism, (b) men presented higher levels of victim-blaming attitudes than women, and (c) IPVAW offenders showed higher levels of victim-blaming attitudes than men from the general population. A five-item short version of the scale is also presented for use in studies with limited application time or space. Our findings confirm that this new scale is a reliable and valid measure to assess victim-blaming attitudes in cases of IPVAW.

TI  - Short-distance Translocation as a Management Option for Nuisance Maritime Pocket Gophers
T2  - SOUTHEASTERN NATURALIST

KW  - GEOMYS
KW  - MOVEMENTS
AB  - Geomys personatus maritimus (Maritime Pocket Gopher) is a genetically distinct subspecies of pocket gopher that occurs only in deep, sandy soils located in Nueces and Kleberg counties of southern Texas. The US Fish and Wildlife Service considers it a species of concern. Pocket gophers are considered a nuisance because they dig burrows and create mounds in landscaped areas. Lethal control options are not advised because of the Maritime Pocket Gopher's rarity status and recent public attitude disfavoring lethal methods. However, short-distance translocation might be a management option, but research to determine its viability is lacking. We captured 15 Maritime Pocket Gophers from athletic fields and commercial properties in Corpus Christi, TX. For all captured gophers, we subcutaneously or intraperitoneally implanted a radio transmitter, translocated the animals to private property within 2 km from their capture site, and radio-tracked their movements for <= 4 months to determine if their behavior and activity differed from 4 control gophers. Subcutaneous transmitters implanted in the scapular region were lost by 86% of the gophers (n = 12 of 14), while 100% (n = 5) of the gophers retained intraperitoneal-implanted transmitters. Relocated Maritime Pocket Gophers did not return to their site of origin. Gopher movements generally were away from their homing lines (i.e., an imaginary line drawn between each translocated gopher's capture site and release site), and they did not become successively closer to their respective sites of capture. Therefore, short-distance translocation has the potential to be a management option for nuisance gophers.

KW  - ATTITUDES
KW  - SUPPORT
AB  - Background Decisions about withdrawal of life support for infants have given rise to legal battles between physicians and parents creating intense media attention. It is unclear how we should evaluate when life is no longer worth living for an infant. Public attitudes towards treatment withdrawal and the role of parents in situations of disagreement have not previously been assessed.
   Methods An online survey was conducted with a sample of the UK public to assess public views about the benefit of life in hypothetical cases similar to real cases heard by the UK courts (eg, Charlie Gard, Alfie Evans). We then evaluated these public views in comparison with existing ethical frameworks for decision-making.
   Results One hundred and thirty participants completed the survey. The majority (94%) agreed that an infant's life may have no benefit when well-being falls below a critical level. Decisions to withdraw treatment were positively associated with the importance of use of medical resources, the infant's ability to have emotional relationships, and mental abilities. Up to 50% of participants in each case believed it was permissible to either continue or withdraw treatment.
   Conclusion Despite the controversy, our findings indicate that in the most severe cases, most people agree that life is not worth living for a profoundly disabled infant. Our survey found wide acceptance of at least the permissibility of withdrawal of treatment across a range of cases, though also a reluctance to overrule parents' decisions. These findings may be useful when constructing guidelines for clinical practice.

AB  - Trust in information sources about COVID-19 may influence the public attitude toward the disease and the imposed restrictions, thus determining the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given country. Acknowledging an increase in trust in the government or the so-called rally 'round the flag' effect around the world at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explores possible determinants of this effect in Latvia, looking at such variables as the perceived disease risk, gender, age, education, income, and language spoken in the family. Presuming that risk perception may be amplified by trust in various information sources, we investigate a spill-over of the rally 'round the flag' effect on healthcare professionals, media, and interpersonal networks. Studying data from a nationally representative sociological survey conducted in September 2020, we confirm a positive relationship between trust in all information sources, except friends, relatives, and colleagues, and perceived disease risk. Correlations are also strong regarding trust in almost all information sources and the measured socio-demographic variables, except gender. Interpersonal trust seems to be relatively stable, and in most cases the correlations are statistically insignificant. With this study we suggest that increase in trust in government institutions as well as other information sources, even in crisis situations, does not depend on any single element, but instead presents a more complex phenomenon.

AB  - 1. It is essential for us to understand what drives human behaviour if we want to tackle anthropogenic damage to the environment. Popular media can play an important role in shaping public attitudes, behaviours and norms towards wildlife, and documentaries in particular have become an increasingly prominent tool for social change. There is, however, a need for robust impact evaluation both in documentary-making and in conservation, to refine future interventions.
   2. The 2013 documentary Blackfish portrayed human-orca interactions at the US-based marine park, SeaWorld. Following its release, SeaWorld suffered financial difficulties and the company underwent structural changes, including a cessation of its orca breeding programme. These impacts have often been attributed to the Blackfish documentary, but little evidence has been provided to justify these claims. We combined an analysis of stock market data and semi-structured interviews with 26 key informants to build an in-depth contribution analysis. We used General Elimination Methodology, a qualitative impact evaluation methodology to build an understanding of the impact of Blackfish.
   3. We found a consensus among stakeholder groups that Blackfish induced negative publicity for SeaWorld and a change in people's perceptions of captivity. As a result, attendance at the park decreased and the market value of the company dropped. Blackfish catalysed a whole movement against marine mammal captivity. There were three key factors that led to its impact: the support from major distribution channels which allowed it to reach major audiences, emotional impact of the content and timing of its release. Blackfish benefitted from a perfect storm, building upon decades of activism to create an appropriate cultural climate for its release in 2013.

AB  - Background:
   The prevalence of pediatric asthma in China is approximately 3%, and asthma remains poorly controlled in many of these patients. This study assessed the rate of adherence to home nebulizer treatment in paediatric patients in China.
   Methods:
   The CARE study was a 12-week, multicentre, prospective, observational study across 12 tertiary hospitals in China. Patients were aged 0-14 years, clinically diagnosed with asthma and prescribed home nebulizer inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) therapy for > 3 months. The primary endpoint was electronically monitored treatment adherence. Patients attended onsite visits at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks to assess asthma control, severity and treatment adherence (recorded by electronic monitoring devices and caregivers).
   Results:
   The full analysis set included 510 patients. Median treatment adherence reported by electronic monitoring devices was 69.9%, and median caregiver-reported adherence was 77.9%. The proportion of patients with well-controlled asthma increased from 12.0% at baseline to 77.5% at visit 4. Increased time between asthma diagnosis and study enrolment was a significant predictor for better adherence [coefficient: 0.01, p = 0.0138; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.00, 0.01] and asthma control (odds ratio = 1.001, p = 0.0498; 95% CI: 1.000, 1.002). Negative attitude to treatment by the caregiver was associated with poorer asthma control.
   Conclusions:
   Adherence to home nebulization, a widely used treatment for asthma, was high among Chinese pediatric patients. Asthma control improved with increasing treatment duration. These results suggest that home nebulization of ICS is an effective and recommendable long-term treatment for paediatric patients with asthma.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarettes are increasing in popularity, and they are easily accessible in a variety of locations. Despite increasing its popularity, little is known about its overall health effects. Physicians have rated the most trustful source of information about it and play also a role in disseminating information about it. Thus, this study identified the difference in knowledge and beliefs about electronic cigarettes between health care providers and the general population in Egypt.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study using the self-administered questionnaire in the Arabic language was conducted between December 2018 and March 2019 in the Chest Department in Ain Shams University Hospital in Egypt. Study population (n=610) was divided into health care providers (n=260) and general population (n=350).
   Result: A total of 593 respondents participated in this study and returned filled questionnaire with total response rate=97.2%, only 8.8% of all participates were smokers, none of the study population reported using electronic cigarettes, despite that, 79.3% of the participants have heard of electronic cigarettes, media advertisements were the main source of getting to know it and there was a statistically significant difference between both groups regarding most beliefs and attitudes toward electronic cigarettes.
   Conclusion: There was high awareness about electronic cigarettes in Egypt and more negative attitude about it among health care providers than the general population, but still educational programs and guidelines for health care providers are needed to raise more the awareness which will aid in counseling general population appropriately.

AB  - A common reaction experienced by family members of patients with psychosis is grief for the loss of their healthy relative. Importantly, high levels of perceived loss have been related to the manifestation of high expressed emotion (EE), which includes the negative attitudes expressed by relatives toward an ill family member. However, the mechanisms underlying the relationship between relatives' perceived loss and EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis are still not fully understood. In this regard, attachment theory has been suggested as a useful framework for understanding this link. The current study aimed to examine: (1) whether relatives' perceived loss was associated with relatives' EE dimensions (i.e., criticism and emotional over-involvement (EOI)), and (2) whether such associations were mediated by relatives' attachment dimensions (i.e., anxiety and avoidance). Seventy-eight relatives of patients with early psychosis completed the Mental Illness Version of the Texas Inventory of Grief for the assessment of loss reactions. Attachment dimensions and EE attitudes were assessed by the Psychosis Attachment Measure and the Family Questionnaire, respectively. Findings indicated that relatives' perceived loss was associated with EE dimensions. Relatives' attachment anxiety, but not avoidance, mediated the relationship of perceived loss with both criticism and EOI. Findings highlight the importance of examining the role of relatives' attachment characteristics for understanding how perceptions of loss might impact the manifestation of EE attitudes in the early stages of psychosis. Family interventions aimed at assisting relatives to improve their management of negative emotional reactions to loss are fundamental to prevent impairing loss reactions and the entrenchment of high-EE attitudes.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has been causing a global health crisis since December 2019. Due to this virus declared by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, the health authorities of the countries are constantly trying to reduce the spread rate of the virus by emphasizing the rules of masks, social distance, and hygiene. COVID-19 is highly contagious and spreads rapidly globally and early detection is of paramount importance. Any technological tool that can provide rapid detection of COVID-19 infection with high accuracy can be very useful to medical professionals. The disease findings on COVID-19 images, such as computed tomography (CT) and X-rays, are similar to other lung infections, making it difficult for medical professionals to distinguish COVID-19. Therefore, computer-aided diagnostic solutions are being developed to facilitate the identification of positive COVID-19 cases. The method currently used as a gold standard in detecting the virus is the Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Due to the high false-negative rate of this test and the delays in the test results, alternative solutions are sought. This study was conducted to investigate the contribution of machine learning and image processing to the rapid and accurate detection of COVID-19 from two of the most widely used different medical imaging modes, chest X-ray and CT images. The main purpose of this study is to support early diagnosis and treatment to end the coronavirus epidemic as soon as possible. One of the primary aims of the study is to provide support to medical professionals who are most worn out and working under intense stress during COVID-19 through smart learning methods and image classification models. The proposed approach was applied to three different public COVID-19 data sets and consists of five basic steps: data set acquisition, pre-processing, feature extraction, dimension reduction, and classification stages. Each stage has its sub-operations. The proposed model performs in considerable levels of COVID-19 detection for dataset-1 (CT), dataset-2 (X-ray) and dataset-3 (CT) with the accuracy of 89.41%, 99.02%, 98.11%, respectively. On the other hand, in the X-ray data set, an accuracy of 85.96% was obtained for COVID-19 (+), COVID-19 (-), and those with Pneumonia but not COVID-19 classes. As a result of the study, it has been shown that COVID-19 can be detected with a high success rate in about less than one minute with image processing and classical learning methods. In the light of the findings, it is possible to say that the proposed system will help radiologists in their decisions, will be useful in the early diagnosis of the virus, and can distinguish pneumonia caused by the COVID-19 virus from the pneumonia of other diseases.

AB  - In recent months, COVID-19 has become a global pandemic and had a huge impact on the world. People under different conditions have very different attitudes toward the epidemic. Due to the real-time and large-scale nature of social media, we can continuously obtain a massive amount of public opinion information related to the epidemic from social media. In particular, researchers may ask questions such as "how is the public reacting to COVID-19 in China during different stages of the pandemic?", "what factors affect the public opinion orientation in China?", and so on. To answer such questions, we analyze the pandemic-related public opinion information on Weibo, China's largest social media platform. Specifically, we have first collected a large amount of COVID-19-related public opinion microblogs. We then use a sentiment classifier to recognize and analyze different groups of users' opinions. In the collected sentiment-orientated microblogs, we try to track the public opinion through different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Furthermore, we analyze more key factors that might have an impact on the public opinion of COVID-19 (e.g. users in different provinces or users with different education levels). Empirical results show that the public opinions vary along with the key factors of COVID-19. Furthermore, we analyze the public attitudes on different public-concerning topics, such as staying at home and quarantine. In summary, we uncover interesting patterns of users and events as an insight into the world through the lens of a major crisis.

AB  - This is a qualitative text-analytic study of the discursive representations of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian press 1970-2016. Our study shows how immigration critics textually are estranged and constituted as an other throughout the period. We examine how three main categories of immigration critics are estranged: extremists, populist politicians, and critical citizens. Within these categories, we find manifest estrangement through demonizing and ridiculing. We call this category of rhetorical work for conspicuous estrangement. However, we also find more subtle hints of illegitimacy or alienation in the portrayals. We call this category of rhetorical work of marginalization for inconspicuous estrangement. While other studies have argued that such forms of soft oppression may prepare the ground for forms of hard oppression and increased marginalizing, our study demonstrates that representations instead move toward legitimation, indicating a normalization of populist politics and anti-immigration attitudes in Scandinavia. Our findings thus support research arguing that a mainstreaming of the radical right has occurred.

AB  - Owing to the changes in its technological and economic environment, the national contexts that previously defined the world of sport have changed dramatically. The contribution of sport in defining national identity has been discussed by many scholars across a range of national contexts. However, there has not been a critical examination of the role of sport in articulating Hungarian identity. This is somewhat surprising given that Hungary has been very successful in international sporting competitions producing a society that is rich in sport-related collective memories. The objective of this article is to explore the relationship of sport and national identity in Hungary within the context of globalization and social change. Using document analysis and a survey of a representative sample (n = 1027) of the Hungarian adult population the research focuses on public attitudes to sport, and within these, the different aspects of national identity. The achievements of elite Hungarian athletes are emphasized by (sport) politicians and by the media, having an impact on the opinions and expectations of citizens. The results show that for the majority of Hungarian society elite-sport success is important, however, identification decreases in cases of failures and scandals. Issues that are not related to elite sport are not as prominent although these may strengthen national integration regardless of performance success.

AB  - Background: There is continued scientific debate regarding the link between risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity and tobacco and cannabis use. The way this topic is presented in news media coverage may influence public attitudes and behavior and is thus an important topic of investigation. This study examines (1) the extent to which Israeli news media reported a positive (i.e., protective/therapeutic), negative (i.e., harmful), or inconclusive association between three types of substance use (tobacco, medical cannabis, recreational cannabis) and risk of COVID-19 infection and/or increased disease severity, and (2) the extent that this media coverage refers to scientific research.Methods: A quantitative content analysis of news articles related to tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 ( N = 113) from eleven of the highest circulation newspapers in Israel.Results: News items were significantly more likely to mention increased COVID-19 risk for tobacco use, compared to cannabis use. All medical cannabis news items reported that medical cannabis use was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. In contrast, news items about recreational cannabis use were more likely to describe a balanced or inconclusive risk for COVID-19, or increased risk. The majority of articles referred to scientific research. Conclusion: While Israeli news media reported a relatively consistent message about the increased risk of COVID19 in relation to tobacco use, messages about cannabis use were less consistent in communicating risk information. Research should examine effects of media coverage of tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 on public perceptions and behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: One of the main problems of patients with eating disorders is their body dissatisfaction. Although these individuals usually are not satisfied with their bodies there are not many investigations that focus on how these patients see people with real weight problems. For this reason, in this study it is analyzed how women with eating disorders see obese people.
   Methods: A total of 104 participants (35 with anorexia nervosa, 28 with bulimia nervosa, 16 with eating disorder not otherwise specified and 25 controls) were selected to conduct the study. To measure anti-fat attitudes the Spanish version of the Antifat Attitudes Questionnaire was used. To measure if participants had body dissatisfaction it was used the Spanish versions of the Body Shape Questionnaire. Finally, anthropometric measures (height and weight) were taken in order to calculate the BMI (kg/m(2)), as well as some socio-demographic information.
   Results: It was found that participants with bulimia nervosa showed scores higher on antifat attitudes than the rest of the participants. Additionally, it was found that this result was influenced by the body dissatisfaction of the participants.
   Discussion: These results suggest that negative attitudes toward obese people may influence an individual's body image. One way of maintaining a positive body image (especially, the subjective dimension, body satisfaction) is to compare oneself with those perceived as physically inferior (people with weight problems), a strategy that is especially relevant when the mass media insists in depict extreme thin women.

AB  - Previous research has shown that foreign policy crises can cause a 'rally 'round the flag' effect, boosting citizens' approval of their leaders. While scholars agree on the effect's existence, its magnitude and nature are less readily apparent. This article considers two factors that have been neglected in previous studies: the context in which a conflict occurs and the public's level of trust in government. The theory presented here suggests that trust is not only an effect of a rally, but mediates the magnitude of the rally. It also proposes that the nature of the rally will be unaffected by whether the state is provoked by its opponent prior to crisis initiation. The resulting hypotheses are tested using aggregate US public opinion data around international crises, as well as individual-level data from the 1990-92 ANES panel regarding the Persian Gulf War. The analysis indicates that trust in government has a major influence on the size of a rally effect, especially at the individual level. However, trust matters more for those in the opposition than for those who have supported the government in the past. These results suggest implications for understanding public attitudes toward foreign policy and for the diversionary theory of war.

AB  - Carbon-14 (C-14) is a radionuclide of major interest in nuclear power production. The Fukushima accident changed the public attitude on the use of nuclear energy all over the world. In terms of nuclear safety, the need of quality-assured radiological models was emphasized by many international organizations, and for models used by decision-makers (i.e. regulatory environmental models and radiological models), a moderate conservatism, transparency, relative simplicity and user friendliness are required. Because the interaction between crops and the environment is complex and regulated by many feedback mechanisms, however, these requirements are difficult to accomplish. The present study makes a step forward regarding the development of a robust model dealing with food contamination after a short-term accidental emission and considers a single crop species, rice (Oryza sativa), one of the most widely used rice species. Old and more recent experimental data regarding the carbon dynamics in rice plants are reviewed, and a well-established crop growth model, ORYZA2000, is used and adapted in order to assess the dynamics of C-14 in rice after a short-term exposure to (CO2)-C-14. Here, the model is used to investigate the role of the genotype, management and weather on the concentration of radiocarbon at harvest.

AB  - Although criminologists have studied public attitudes to community sanctions, and there has also been some attention to media representations of them, there has been no serious examination of the relationships between media and public understandings. This article presents an interdisciplinary analysis (drawing on sociology, media and communications and organizational studies) of the potential influence of media consumption practices on penal tastes among diverse participant groups. We aim to develop a clearer understanding of how these processes shape the public legitimacy of community sanctions. In particular, we report on original research employing innovative methodologies to explore the dynamic set of practices deployed by audiences in the process of making meaningful the media landscape on punishment and community sanctions. Our findings offer some confirmation of the primacy of the prison in the popular imagination; the media profile of community sanctions is delimited by their perceived banality, in turn leading to confusion surrounding their purpose and potential. However, this study suggests that the legitimacy problem for community sanctions may be far more complex than 'newsworthiness'. Community sanctions, we argue, may be subject to appraisal in line with penal 'tastes' in which the function of moral censure is of central significance. However, we also uncover some evidence about how traditional markers of taste are disrupted by processes of media convergence (of appropriation, circulation, response) in ways which can operate to limit deliberation even amongst more liberal audience groups, and conversely open it up amongst those who are more punitive.

AB  - Objectives To understand the perceptions of program managers and service providers using in depth interview technique, a well-accepted qualitative research that can also offer semi quantitative input.
   Methods Need assessment was done qualitatively using in-depth interviews, among program managers of health care system including District Medical Officers and RCH Officers and program service providers, both in rural and urban areas.
   Results In total 34 in-depth interviews were conducted. Nearly half (2+) of the program managers and service providers of adolescent programs opined that the important problems faced by adolescents were issues related to sexuality, psychosocial conflict, identity crisis, adjustment problems and scholastic problems. Approximately half of them thought that improper parenting, negative attitude of parents, separated parents, ignorance of parents, family background, nuclear family setup etc. are the most important factors, which influence adolescent problems and that friends and media are their major source of reproductive sexual health information. Nearly half of them pointed out that pain and psychological disturbances like anxiety, tension and anger were the important menstrual problems faced by adolescents. Again nearly half of them, felt that FLE Family Life Education) should be given at school and ARSH services at PHCs, but there was little consensus on provision of contraceptive service and abortion services to adolescents.
   Conclusion All the service providers and program managers are ready to cooperate but they had varied opinions about who should impart adolescent reproductive sexual health education and how the program should be done.

AB  - Background: Health information seeking is critical to medical decision-making and optimal health. Although researchers have begun to explore how people with disabilities search for health information, no studies have investigated health information seeking by women with physical disabilities.
   Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the health information seeking experiences of women with physical disabilities.
   Method: We conducted a series of semi-structured, online focus group meetings with 21 women with disabilities. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and data were analyzed using conventional content analysis.
   Results: Two broad themes emerged: 1) pathways to information on general health; sexual and reproductive health; as well as bowel, bladder, and other pelvic health issues; and 2) perceived facilitators and barriers to obtaining health information. Information pathways differed by the type of information sought. Internet was a commonly used resource, with a high value placed on social media interaction among peers. Self-advocacy emerged as a prominent facilitator of health information seeking. Barriers identified were lack of disability-related education, limited accessibility, and providers' negative attitudes.
   Conclusion: This is the first known in-depth qualitative exploration of health information seeking by women with disabilities. Study findings revealed pathways to information commonly used by women with disabilities. The study also identified notable gaps and challenges to health information seeking including the need for improved provider education and training. Findings highlight the importance of the availability and accessibility of high quality, health-related information essential for the health and well-being of women with disabilities.

AB  - Many past cannabis prevention campaigns have proven largely ineffective due in part to the diversity of adolescents' cannabis-relevant beliefs. The current studies evaluated the impact of a sequential multiple message approach tailored to the usage norms of adolescents expressing negative attitudes toward a cannabis prevention appeal. A multiple-message strategy was implemented-initial unfavorable message evaluations were invalidated using attitudinal rebuttal feedback prior to presenting a third tailored communication. Participants were cannabis-abstinent middle and high school students (ages 11 to 16). Study 1 (N = 808) compared effects of gain- and loss-framed messages tailored to each student's normative usage perceptions. In Study 2 (N = 391), students were randomly assigned to receive a tailored or non-tailored message after receiving feedback meant to destabilize anti-message attitudes. For at-risk adolescents in Study 1 who perceived cannabis use as normative, a tailored gain-framed message resulted in the lowest usage intentions (p < .05). In Study 2, a conditional multiple-moderated mediation model showed that for high-risk teens with normative beliefs and pro-cannabis attitudes, exposure to a tailored gain-framed communication was associated with decreased cannabis attitude certainty, and lower usage intentions 2 months later (p < .05). Findings have implications for sequential messaging utilization in mass media campaigns and support the efficacy of tailored messages over a one-size-fits-all media approach. Further, results suggest that systematically weakening resistance to persuasive communications and tailoring messages consistent with individually perceived peer norms is an effective prevention strategy.

AB  - Background: Primary health care bears the main responsibility for treating depression in most countries. However, few studies have comprehensively investigated provision of pharmacological and psychosocial treatments, their continuity, or patient attitudes and adherence to treatment in primary care.
   Methods: In the Vantaa Primary Care Depression Study, 1111 consecutive primary care patients in the City of Vantaa, Finland, were screened for depression with Prime-MD, and 137 were diagnosed with DSM-IV depressive disorders via SCID-I/P and SCID-Il interviews. The 100 patients with current major depressive disorder (MDD) or partly remitted MDD at baseline were prospectively followed up to 18 months, and their treatment contacts and the treatments provided were longitudinally followed.
   Results: The median number of patients' visits to a general practitioner during the follow-up was five; of those due to depression two. Antidepressant treatment was offered to 82% of patients, but only 50% commenced treatment and adhered to it adequately. Psychosocial support was offered to 49%, but only 29% adhered to the highly variable interventions. Attributed reasons for poor adherence varied, including negative attitude, side effects, practical obstacles, or no perceived need. About one-quarter (23%) of patients were referred to specialized care at some time-point. Limitations: Moderate sample size. Data collected in 2002-2004.
   Conclusions: The majority of depressive patients in primary health care had been offered pharmacotherapy, psychotherapeutic support, or both. However, effectiveness of these efforts may have been limited by lack of systematic follow-up and poor adherence to both pharmacotherapy and psychosocial treatment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Few studies using psychographic segmentation have been conducted; even fewer in minority samples. Study aims were to identify psychographic clusters and their relation to tobacco and alcohol use within a predominantly Hispanic (87%) young adult (ages 18-25) sample. Participants (N = 754; 72.5% female; M-age = 20.7[2.2]) completed the following measures online: sociodemographics, tobacco use history, the Daily Drinking Questionnaire (Collins, Parks, & Marlatt, 1985), a social activities scale, a psychographic survey, a music preference item, the Brief Sensation Seeking Scale (Hoyle, Stephenson, Palmgreen, Lorch, & Donohew, 2002), and the Mini International Personality Item Pool (Donnellan, Oswald, Baird, & Lucas, 2006). Two step cluster analysis identified two groups. 'Popular Extroverts' (493% of sample) reported higher: extroversion scores F(1, 652) = 40.03, sensation seeking scores F(1, 652) = 20.38, alcohol use (greater number of drinks per week [F(1, 652) = 9.69]; and past month binge drinking [chi(2) (1) = 12.80]), and lifetime tobacco use (chi(2) [1] = 10.61) (all ps <= 0.002). 'Mainstream/Conventionals' (50.7% of sample) reported greater intentions to smoke in the next month F(1, 284) = 11.81, p = 0.001. 'Popular Extroverts' may benefit from prevention/cessation messaging promoting peer support and intensity-oriented activities. For 'Mainstream/Conventionals,' messaging communicating negative attitudes toward smoking and the tobacco industry may be effective. Future directions include testing targeted messages which may be incorporated into mass media tobacco and alcohol interventions for young adults on the U.S./Mexico border.

AB  - Objective: To investigate obesity prevention support in the German general public and to assess determinants of general prevention support as well as support of specific prevention measures.
   Methods: This study was a cross-sectional analysis of a telephone based representative German study (3,003 subjects (52.8% women, mean age 51.9, s.d. = 18.0, range 18-97 years). Likert scale-based questions on general prevention support and support of specific measures were used. Furthermore willingness to take part in preventive programs and willingness to pay were assessed. Stigmatizing attitudes were assessed with the Fat Phobia Scale (FPS). Causation of obesity was differentiated in three dimensions (internal, e. g. lack of exercise; external, e. g. social surroundings; and genetic factors).
   Results: Obesity prevention was perceived as possible (98.2%), however, almost exclusively lifestyle changes were named. Participants with higher stigmatizing attitudes were less likely to believe obesity prevention is possible. The majority of participants would take part in preventive programs (59.6%) and pay at least partially themselves (86.9%). Factor analysis revealed three dimensions of preventive measures: promoting healthy eating, restrictive and financial, governmental prevention efforts. In regard to these, promoting healthy eating was the most supported measure. Higher age, female gender and external causation were associated with higher support for all three dimensions of preventive measures. Only for governmental regulation, higher age was associated with lower support.
   Conclusion: Obesity prevention support in Germany is high. Structural prevention efforts are supported by the majority of the general public in Germany. The vast majority proclaims willingness to pay themselves for programs of weight gain prevention. This could be an indication of higher perceived self-responsibility in the German system but also for risen "fear of fat" in the population due to media coverage. For Germany, the government and communities ought to be encouraged by these results to start the implementation of structural obesity prevention.

AB  - Objectives:
   Increasing dentists' visibility in the media to make the case for sugary beverage taxes can help advance public policy that improves oral health outcomes. We assessed California dentists' media engagement behaviors related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention and correlates of engaging in such behavior.
   Methods:
   Survey items related to sugar policies and media engagement were embedded in an electronically distributed statewide survey of dentists' tobacco cessation counseling behaviors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent characteristics, perceived professional responsibility to discuss selected topics with patients, and attitudes and behaviors related to sugar restriction policy and media communication. Multivariable models identified independent correlates of media engagement.
   Results:
   Of 624 respondents, most had never talked to traditional media (78%) or posted to social media (64%) about sugar or sugar policies for dental caries prevention. Respondents with the highest level of media engagement were more likely to agree that sugary beverage taxes are effective at reducing dental caries, that they had support from dental professional organizations to talk to the media, that it is realistic for patients to reduce their sugar consumption, and that sugar and sugary drinks are extremely harmful to health.
   Conclusions:
   Efforts to increase dentists' media engagement related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention should address dentists' negative attitudes toward the effectiveness of sugar restriction policies and may require increased support from dental professional societies.
   Knowledge Transfer Statement:
   Study findings identify dentists' low engagement in media advocacy to support sugar restriction policy adoption. The results identify correlates of media engagement and of dentists' willingness and confidence to act, which could serve to inform interventions to support and enhance engagement.

AB  - The contemporary refugee crisis is an ongoing global concern. For the many East European displaced persons who were resettled in Queensland following the Second World War, these events are particularly poignant. Their prior experiences of violence, incarceration and encampment are being echoed in current developments, and contribute to their approach towards these events today. While scholars have considered generalised public attitudes towards refugees, little comparative research exists to assess the impact of this situation on displaced persons in Australia. Even less knowledge exists to inform practitioners', scholars', and policy makers' understanding of how former refugees are engaging with this current crisis, and thus how resettled refugees can be supported as they reconcile their own experiences of violence and loss with public debate surrounding the validity of refugees' claims for asylum. This article shows that the displacement and trauma of post-war Polish, Ukrainian, and Latvian displaced persons retain an ongoing influence on their perceptions of crisis and displacement in the present. It reveals a unique response to mass refugee movements that speaks to their own experiences as displaced persons. This reflects the way in which these displaced families' remembered experiences have become crucial to their engagement with contemporary events and refugees.

AB  - Objective To determine the knowledge, attitude, and practice of antenatal attendees towards COVID-19 in Alex Ekwueme Federal University Teaching Hospital, Abakaliki, Nigeria. Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 430 consenting pregnant women attending antenatal clinics between March 1 and May 30, 2020, using pretested questionnaires. Results The mean age and mean gestational age of the respondents were 30.04 years (95% confidence interval [CI] 28.9-31.1) and 26.3 weeks (95% CI 23.3-29.3), respectively. More than four-fifths (82%) of the women believed that COVID-19 is real and their main source of information was mass media. The majority had adequate knowledge of COVID-19. More than half of the respondents said COVID-19 is a curable disease and that chloroquine can be used. The majority showed a good attitude and preventice practice of COVID-19 disease; however, one-fourth (24%) thought that infected individuals should be killed to prevent the spread of the virus. Conclusion The study population has good knowledge, attitude, and practice of COVID-19 disease. However, it is worrisome that some respondents thought that infected individuals should be killed. Proper education must be given to the populace to avert these negative attitudes while promoting a positive preventive attitude. The study population has adequate knowledge, good attitude, and preventive practice of COVID-19; however, community education is needed to reduce anxiety among the populace.

AB  - Background: There is evidence that anal sex is becoming increasingly popular among heterosexual women and men. Several studies carried out in especially vulnerable populations (e. g. sex workers and low-income youth) suggested that anal sex may indicate a more general propensity to sexual risk-taking. Methods: To assess whether this epidemiologically important finding holds in the case of young adults from the general population, we analysed data from a cross-sectional probability survey carried out in 2010 on 1005 Croatian women and men aged 18-25. Results: Anal intercourse was reported by 36.5% of 861 sexually experienced participants (42.7% of men and 29.8% of women). About one-third of them (34%) used a condom at most recent anal intercourse. The experience of anal sex was significantly associated (P < 0.001) with all four indicators of sexual risk-taking (condom use at most recent vaginal intercourse, number of sexual partners in the past year, concurrent sexual relationships and anonymous sex in the past year), as well as with negative attitudes and beliefs about condom use (P < 0.01). Sexual sensation-seeking mediated the relationship between anal sex and some of the sexual risk-taking behaviours. Conclusion: According to the findings, heterosexual anal sex is directly and indirectly associated with increased behavioural risks of acquiring HIV and other sexually transmissible infections (STI). Sex education and STI prevention programs should focus on the importance of using protection when practicing anal sex.

AB  - Previous research suggests that threat can bolster anti-immigration attitudes, but less is known about the effects of threat on ideological tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that realistic threats - tangible threats to e.g., the safety or financial well-being of one's group - bolster support for right-wing extremists. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 200) learned that crime and unemployment rates were either increasing (high threat condition) or remaining the same (low threat condition). Consistent with our hypothesis, higher threat lead to a significant increase in tolerance for right-wing, but not left-wing, extremists. In a second, preregistered extended replication experiment (N = 385), we added a baseline (no threat) condition. Additionally, attitudes to immigrants were examined as a mediator. This experiment produced non-significant threat effects on tolerance of right-wing extremists. Overall, the current research provides weak support for the hypothesis that realistic threats have asymmetric effects on tolerance of political extremists. However, consistent with previous research, people were more tolerant of extremists within their own ideological camp.

AB  - Many physicians are involved in relationships that create tension between a physician's duty to work in her patients' best interest at all times and her financial arrangement with a third party, most often a pharmaceutical manufacturer, whose primary goal is maximizing sales or profit. Despite the prevalence of this threat, in the United States and globally, the most common reaction to conflicts of interest in medicine is timid acceptance. There are few calls for conflicts of interest to be banned, and, to our knowledge, no one calls for conflicted practitioners to be reprimanded. Contrast our attitudes in medicine with public attitudes toward financial conflicts among government employees. When enforcement of rules against conflict of interest slackens in the public sector, news organizations investigate and publish their criticism. Yet even when doctors are quoted in the media promoting specific drugs, their personal financial ties to the drug maker are rarely mentioned. Policies for governmental employees are strict, condemnation is strong, and criminal statutes exist (allowing for corruption charges). Yet the evidence that conflict is problematic is, if anything, stronger in medicine than in the public sector. Policies against conflicts of interest in medicine should be at least as strong as those already existing in the public sector.

AB  - Scholarly and journalistic accounts of the recent successes of radical-right politics in Europe and the United States, including the Brexit referendum and the Trump campaign, tend to conflate three phenomena: populism, ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism. While all three are important elements of the radical right, they are neither coterminous nor limited to the right. The resulting lack of analytical clarity has hindered accounts of the causes and consequences of ethno-nationalist populism. To address this problem, I bring together existing research on nationalism, populism and authoritarianism in contemporary democracies to precisely define these concepts and examine temporal patterns in their supply and demand, that is, politicians' discursive strategies and the corresponding public attitudes. Based on the available evidence, I conclude that both the supply and demand sides of radical politics have been relatively stable over time, which suggests that in order to understand public support for radical politics, scholars should instead focus on the increased resonance between pre-existing attitudes and discursive frames. Drawing on recent research in cultural sociology, I argue that resonance is not only a function of the congruence between a frame and the beliefs of its audience, but also of shifting context. In the case of radical-right politics, a variety of social changes have engendered a sense of collective status threat among national ethnocultural majorities. Political and media discourse has channelled such threats into resentments toward elites, immigrants, and ethnic, racial and religious minorities, thereby activating previously latent attitudes and lending legitimacy to radical political campaigns that promise to return power and status to their aggrieved supporters. Not only does this form of politics threaten democratic institutions and inter-group relations, but it also has the potential to alter the contours of mainstream public discourse, thereby creating the conditions of possibility for future successes of populist, nationalist, and authoritarian politics.

AB  - Several studies provide evidence of group-centric policy attitudes, that is, citizens evaluating policies based on linkages with visible social groups. The existing literature generally points to the role of media imagery, rhetoric and prominent political sponsors in driving group-centric attitudes. This article theorizes and tests an alternative source: exposure to rising local ethnic diversity. Focusing on the issue of crime, it first develops a theoretical account of how casual observation in the local context can give rise to ethnic stereotypes. Then, using two large, nationally representative datasets on citizen group and policy attitudes linked with registry data on local ethnic diversity, each spanning 20 years, it shows that crime attitudes become more strongly linked with immigration attitudes as local ethnic diversity rises. The results suggest that the typically emphasized 'top-down' influence on group-centric attitudes by elite actors is complemented by 'bottom-up' local processes of experiential learning about group-policy linkages.

AB  - Cohesion policy is the European Union's (EU) main investment policy and seeks to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion. While accomplishments in this regard are constantly measured, European citizens are not always aware of the policy's impact and the role the EU plays therein. This is especially relevant as the communication of EU policies is central to the emergence of a European public sphere, an acknowledged condition for European integration. In this paper, we aim at advancing research in this regard through the analysis of cohesion policy communication on the social media channels of ten Local Managing Authorities (LMAs) responsible for managing and communicating structural funds at the local level. By building on a bottom-up construction of shared meaning structures through semi-automatic analysis techniques, we make the following three observations: first, social media communication is indicative of 'horizontal Europeanization'; second, Europeanization occurs both in the form of the spontaneous amalgamation of shared discontent expressed by citizens and the institutionalization of top-down EU communication measures adopted by LMAs; and third, a cluster of topics articulated internationally and showcasing a negative attitude towards the EU funding scheme suggests that, counter-intuitively, Euroscepticism seems to facilitate the emergence of a European public sphere.

AB  - Integrating evolutionary and social representations theories, the current study examines the relationship between perceived disease threat and exclusionary immigration attitudes in the context of a potential avian influenza pandemic. This large-scale disease provides a realistic context for investigating the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes. The main aim of this cross-sectional study (N = 412) was to explore mechanisms through which perceived chronic and contextual disease threats operate on immigration attitudes. Structural equation models show that the relationship between chronic disease threat (germ aversion) and exclusionary immigration attitudes (assimilationist immigration criteria, health-based immigration criteria and desire to reduce the proportion of foreigners) was mediated by ideological and normative beliefs (social dominance orientation, belief in a dangerous world), but not by contextual disease threat (appraisal of avian influenza pandemic threat). Contextual disease threat only predicted support for health-based immigration criteria. The conditions under which real-life disease threats influence intergroup attitudes are scrutinized. Convergence and dissimilarity of evolutionary and social representational approaches in accounting for the link between disease threat and immigration attitudes are discussed.

AB  - This paper explores how material-based and identity-based concerns influence views on immigration in Japan. Our analysis, based on in-depth interviews with 28 local residents and public and policy opinion leaders conducted in 2015 in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan, found widespread opposition to immigration with the exception of the immigration of care workers. General opposition to immigration stemmed from identity-based concerns, while openness to and support for the immigration of care workers was related to material-based concerns. Our findings suggest that while the identities approach to understanding anti-immigration sentiment has explanatory power in Japan, material-based concerns can, when sufficiently strong, override identity-based concerns in a phenomenon we call 'pragmatic divergence'.

AB  - BackgroundCervical cancer is the most common cancer and a major cause of morbidity and mortality among women in Zimbabwe yet it is preventable, early detectable and highly curable. The objective of this study was to investigate knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices towards cervical cancer, its prevention and treatment in Harare, Zimbabwe.MethodsSequential explanatory mixed methods approach consisting of analytical cross sectional survey and a qualitative inquiry was used. Study population consisted of women with cervical cancer, health workers and other stakeholders who are involved in cancer control programmes. Patient survey data were collected using validated structured questionnaire in Surveytogo software in an android tablet. Qualitative study used key informant interviews to understand survey findings better. Data analyses for the survey involved univariate and multivariate analyses using STATA version 14. For qualitative study, themes in transcripts were coded and analyzed using Dedoose software to generate evidence for the study.ResultsParticipants reported different levels of knowledge of causes (23%), risk factors (71%), prevention (72%), screening (73%) and treatment (80%) of cervical cancer. Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were negatively associated with: being aged 45 or more years (OR=0.02; p=0.004), having no household income (OR=0.02;p=0.007), household income <US$600 per month (OR=0.02; p=0.015), middle class wealth (OR=0.01;p=0.032), watching TV daily (OR=0.01;p=0.007) and 1-6 times per week (OR=0.02; p=0.045). Knowledge of causes of cervical cancer were also positively associated with listening to radio daily (OR=394, CI: 11.02-1406) (p=0.001) and 1-6 times a week (OR=100, CI: 2.95-3364) (p=0.010). Knowledge of prevention was only positively associated with listening to the radio daily (OR=77, CI: 1.89-3114) (p=0.022) and 1-6 times a week (OR=174, CI: 2.42-1255) (p=0.018). Major drivers of lack of knowledge for cervical cancer were: limited awareness programmes, lack of knowledge among health workers, donor prioritization of infectious diseases, infancy of cervical cancer interventions, negative attitudes towards cervical cancer and misconceptions.ConclusionsThis study revealed that knowledge of causes and prevention of cervical cancer was associated with frequent radio listenership. Strengthening of health education through the packaging of messages targeting the wider society using different delivery channels is thus recommended.

AB  - BackgroundMedia representations of sexuality after childbirth depict vaginal birth as harmful and cesarean delivery as protective, although research does not support these depictions. The objective of the current study was to investigate perceptions of the effects of mode of delivery on sexuality.
   MethodsNulliparous participants who were able to and interested in giving birth (N=1428) completed an online survey about their preferences for mode of delivery and their perceptions of childbirth as they specifically relate to sexuality. Participants provided demographic information, rated how influential different sources of information about childbirth were, and completed the Attitudes Toward Women's Genitals Scale.
   ResultsUp to half (16-48%), the participants agreed with different statements about vaginal birth as harmful to, and cesarean delivery as protective of, future sexuality. Participant characteristics that were independently predictive of endorsing these beliefs were: self-identifying as heterosexual, holding negative attitudes toward women's genitals, and reporting that reality media, nonreality media, and online media sources are influential sources of childbirth information. Participants who rated health care professionals as an influential source of information were less likely to endorse these beliefs.
   ConclusionGiven that there is no clear evidence in the empirical literature to support the claim that vaginal births are harmful and cesarean delivery is protective to one's future sexual life, it is important to dispel the existing misconceptions. Various media sources likely play a role in the perpetuation of this misinformation.

AB  - Background
   Although performance-enhancing drugs appear to be prevalent in adolescent sports, relatively little attention has been paid to why adolescent athletes decide to use these drugs. In this study, we examine doping among adolescents from a motivational perspective and explore how motivational variables, such as achievement goal orientations and the perceived self-determination of sports activities, may be related to moral attitudes, doping intentions and doping behavior in adolescents who participate in competitive sports.
   Methodology
   The study included 1035 adolescents participating in competitive sports from all regions of the Czech Republic (mean age = 16.3 years). The respondents completed a battery of questionnaires assessing their achievement goal orientations (task, ego), sports motivation at various levels of self-determination (intrinsic motivation, external regulation, amotivation), moral attitudes toward sport competition (acceptance of cheating, keeping winning in proportion, attitudes toward doping), doping intentions and doping behavior. A structural equation model was used to test the relations among motivational variables, attitudes, intentions and doping behavior.
   Principal results
   Our analyses indicated a good fit with the proposed model, which explained 59% of the variance in doping intentions and 17.6% of the variance in doping behavior. Within the model, task orientation was positively associated with intrinsic motivation and lower amotivation, whereas ego orientation was positively associated with extrinsic regulation and amotivation. Furthermore, intrinsic motivation was positively associated with keeping winning in proportion and negatively associated with acceptance of cheating and attitudes toward doping; the less self-determined forms of motivation showed opposite relationships. However, only the acceptance of cheating and attitudes toward doping were related to doping intention, which subsequently predicted doping behavior.
   Conclusions/Significance
   The results provide further evidence that sports motivation represents a psychological variable that should be considered in anti-doping policies, programs, and interventions aimed at the adolescent population because motivation was linked to the doping-related attitudinal variables and also partially mediated the effect of achievement goal orientations in this regard. On the basis of these results, we may argue that the focus on intrinsic enjoyment, self-referenced criteria of success and self-improvement may be related to more negative attitudes toward doping and cheating, lower doping intentions and less frequent doping behavior, whereas the emphasis on competition, comparison with others and external motivation appear to be related to the opposite outcomes.

AB  - Ethnic diversity and interethnic contact are increasing in Europe. Intergroup contact theory suggests interethnic contact to improve interethnic attitudes, but for young children, parental attitudes toward child interethnic relations might be an important factor determining whether they are exposed to these potentially positive contact effects. This study therefore examined maternal attitudes toward child contact with different ethnic outgroups among 251 mothers (137 White Dutch, 69 Turkish-Dutch, and 45 Afro-Dutch) of a 6- to 10-year-old child (M = 7.51, SD = 0.98). Furthermore, associations between maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations and child outgroup rejection were examined, as well as mediation effects of child actual outgroup contact. Neutral to positive maternal attitudes toward child interethnic relations were found, with relatively more negative attitudes among Turkish-Dutch than White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers, and toward child relations with Muslims as compared to another outgroup among White Dutch and Afro-Dutch mothers. Furthermore, results did not indicate that maternal attitudes were related to child actual outgroup contact or child outgroup prejudice and no support for the intergroup contact theory was found. These results suggest that intergroup contact theory does not easily apply, highlighting the need for more research on children in various populations and contexts using different measures and informants. Patterns from the present study suggest that most improvement in terms of maternal attitudes fostering child interethnic relations can be made in the interethnic relations including ethnic groups in the Netherlands that predominantly identify as Muslim.

AB  - The microbiome is proving to be increasingly important for human brain functioning. A series of recent studies have shown that the microbiome influences the central nervous system in various ways, and consequently acts on the psychological well-being of the individual by mediating, among others, the reactions of stress and anxiety. From a specifically neuroethical point of view, according to some scholars, the particular composition of the microbiome-qua microbial community-can have consequences on the traditional idea of human individuality. Another neuroethical aspect concerns the reception of this new knowledge in relation to clinical applications. In fact, attention to the balance of the microbiome-which includes eating behavior, the use of psychobiotics and, in the treatment of certain diseases, the use of fecal microbiota transplantation-may be limited or even prevented by a biased negative attitude. This attitude derives from a prejudice related to everything that has to do with the organic processing of food and, in general, with the human stomach and intestine: the latter have traditionally been regarded as low, dirty, contaminated and opposed to what belongs to the mind and the brain. This biased attitude can lead one to fail to adequately consider the new anthropological conceptions related to the microbiome, resulting in a state of health, both physical and psychological, inferior to what one might have by paying the right attention to the knowledge available today. Shifting from the ubiquitous high-low metaphor (which is synonymous with superior-inferior) to an inside-outside metaphor can thus be a neuroethical strategy to achieve a new and unbiased reception of the discoveries related to the microbiome.

AB  - Objective: Fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is one of the major obligations for all adult Muslims. We performed a survey of Turkish Muslim cancer patients to examine the extent of their fasting status and to compare various clinical characteristics of fasting and non-fasting cancer patients during the month of Ramadan.
   Methods: This study was conducted on 701 adult cancer patients who attended ambulatory patient care units answered the questionnaires.
   Results: The population comprised 445 women (63.5%), and the median age was 54 years. Before diagnosis of cancer, 93.1% of the patients used fast consists of completely (78.3%) and partial (14.8%). However, 15% of cases were fasting on the day of interview, either partially (7.4%) or completely (7.6%) with equal distributions. Patients who were females, those with good performance status, those without any comorbid disease, who had non-metastatic disease, those with history of surgery, those treated with radiotherapy and those being treated with oral chemotherapeutic agents were more likely to be fasting than others. The fasting ones had more prevalent among patients with lymphoma, urogenital cancer and breast cancer; conversely, the rate of fasting status among patients with lung and gastrointestinal cancer was quite low. Only 20.8% of all patients asked their physician whether it was alright for them to fast and physicians generally had a negative attitude towards fasting (83.2%).
   Conclusions: Majority of cancer patients are not fasting during the month of Ramadan, and a small part of patients consult this situation to their physician.

AB  - Bisexual individuals are invisible sexual minorities, who face prejudice and "double discrimination" from both heterosexual and sexual minority communities. Despite this, little empirical research has examined bisexual prejudice reduction. To address this, the current study tested an E-contact intervention - a highly structured, text-based, online interaction tool - to reduce bisexual prejudice. Heterosexual participants (N = 170) were randomly allocated to an intergroup (E-contact) or intragroup (control) interaction, with either a male or female interaction partner. Findings indicated that intergroup E-contact resulted in less intergroup anxiety compared to an intragroup interaction, and that this effect was more pronounced when the bisexual interaction partner was male for heterosexual men, but not for heterosexual women. Although E-contact had no direct effect on tolerance toward bisexual individuals or the perceived stability of bisexuality as a sexual orientation, findings revealed that reduced intergroup anxiety mediated the effect of E-contact on these outcome variables. This result was found in the intergroup dynamic of heterosexual men interacting with bisexual men, providing an important experimental demonstration of the potential for harnessing an E-contact intervention to reduce affective prejudice toward bisexual individuals.

AB  - Though there is evidence of an historical exclusion of trans women from lesbian feminist separatist spaces supported by radical feminist lesbian anti-trans discourse as well as modern examples of anti-trans perspectives promoted by feminists sometimes described as Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists, it remains unclear as to if there is a significant association between being a lesbian cis woman feminist and harboring negative attitudes toward trans women or alternatively, if the recent proliferation of exclusionary tactics directed toward trans women's rights (especially via social media) has been the result of loud voices among a minority who have been successful anti-trans mouthpieces as of late. The current study utilizes survey data (N = 1461 cis women; n = 331 lesbian cis women) to investigate the following research questions: (1) do lesbian cis women feminists express greater levels of negativity toward trans women than other cis women (heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual) do? and (2) is there a relationship between feminist identity among lesbian cis women and the stigmatization of trans women (as undeserving of rights, as incapable parents/mothers, as excluded from the military, and as sexually problematic)? Results provide ample evidence of anti-trans perspectives among some lesbian cis women feminists. Overall, the findings provide a starting point to begin to understand how to dismantle the complexities embedded in the relationships between feminism, lesbian identity, and trans negativity and work toward a trans-inclusive future of feminism.

AB  - Background: Tobacco industry denormalization (TID) seeks to expose the industry's misconducts. Research on TID beliefs, meaning negative attitudes toward the tobacco industry (TI), may inform TID programs, but was limited to western populations. We investigated TID beliefs and their association with smoking and sociodemographic characteristics in Hong Kong adolescents.
   Methods: In a school-based cross-sectional survey of 14 214 students (mean age 15.0 years, 51.5% boys), TID beliefs were assessed by two questions: (1) whether the TI was respectable and (2) whether the TI tried to get youth to smoke, each with four options from "definitely no" to "definitely yes." Smoking susceptibility and behaviors were also assessed. Sociodemographic characteristics included age, sex, perceived family affluence, highest parental education, numbers of co-residing smokers, and school-level smoking prevalence.
   Results: Of all students, 77.6% considered the TI not respectable and 56.6% believed that the TI tried to get youth to smoke. Stronger TID beliefs were inversely associated with smoking susceptibility and behaviors. For example, students considering the TI definitely not respectable (vs. definitely yes) were 56% (95% confidence intervals [CI] = 45% to 66%), 49% (95% CI = 41% to 56%), and 53% (95% CI = 36% to 65%) less likely to be susceptible to smoking (among never-smokers) and be ever- and current smokers, respectively. Of all correlates examined, only younger age and having no co-residing smoker were associated with TID beliefs.
   Conclusions: Substantial proportions of Hong Kong adolescents did not hold TID beliefs, but those who did were less likely to smoke. Our results suggest that TID programs may help reduce adolescent smoking.

AB  - Attitudes, and attitudinal change towards persons with disabilities, is an important area of research as it can potentially enable greater understanding of the constraints that may preclude full participation in society. In the realm of sport and recreation mega sporting events have been suggested as a potential catalyst for positive societal change and shifting negative attitudes. Much of the event research to date, however, has focused on able-bodied sport events, with parasport events being largely overlooked. As a result, the impact of major parasport events on attitudinal change towards persons with a disability is assumed by sport practitioners, policy-makers and politicians but not justified by empirical evidence. The current study thus presents a starting point by examining the benefits of hosting mega sport events and in particular focuses on an important event stakeholder group; volunteers. More specifically, the current study addresses volunteer's perceptions of attitudes towards disability at two major parasport events: the 2014 Commonwealth Games (where parasport was integrated with the able-bodied sport) and the 2015 Pan Am/ParaPan American Games (where parasport was separated from the able-bodied sport). Data were collected at two time points for each event: pre-Games, and post-Games. Results revealed that both events had an impact on volunteer awareness levels of disability and accessibility-related issues, as well as positively impacting attitudes towards persons with disability. Interestingly, the integrated events at the Commonwealth Games appeared to impact attitudes to a greater degree than the non-integrated events at the ParaPan Am Games. Implications are discussed pertaining to the impact of an integrated vs. non-integrated major parasport event on disability/accessibility awareness, and attitudes towards disability.

AB  - Purpose To test whether exposure to news images depicting law enforcement affects public attitudes toward the police. Method Participants drawn from a national online panel were randomly assigned to view one of three pictures that depicted a range of hostile to friendly police-civilian interactions (compared to a control group who saw no pictures). Dependent variables were perceptions of police officers' effectiveness, misconduct, and bias. Moderating variables were respondents' experiential, ideological, or demographic characteristics. As a follow-up to the results of the experiment, regression analyses were employed to explore other factors that may influence perceptions of police or interact with the media effects. Results Image exposure did not directly affect any dimension of attitudes toward the police, but there was one significant moderation effect. Respondents who had been recently stopped by an officer and saw a picture of a friendly interaction between officers and a civilian perceived more frequent police misconduct than respondents in the same experimental condition who were not recently stopped. Routine media consumption was significantly related to perceptions of police in the non-experimental analysis. Conclusions Findings indicate that brief exposure to static images of law enforcement disseminated by the media does not independently affect people's opinions about the performance of police in society. Rather, people's global opinions about the police are shaped by their own beliefs, prior experiences with officers, and cumulative, self-selected media consumption.

AB  - Objective: Public attitudes and stigma toward epilepsy may limit patient motivation for treatment and participation in social activities. Stigma research requiring individuals to report personal beliefs is useful but is subject to social desirability bias. Self-reporting methods often do not capture implicit attitudes; therefore, in this study, implicit stigma was measured using the implicit association test (IAT), which is a word sorting task to minimize this bias. Recently, in Japan, several serious car accidents caused by people with epilepsy (PWE) resulted in pedestrian fatalities. Traffic accidents involving PWE have been reported extensively and repeatedly in the media since 2011. The present study aimed to examine differences in implicit stigma toward epilepsy among medical students in 2010, 2013, and 2016.
   Methods: We recruited 41 medical students in 2010, 44 medical students in 2013 and 42 medical students in 2016. We investigated the strength of conceptual associations between the words "Epilepsy" or "Hypertension", and "Safety" or "Danger" in the IAT.
   Results: The association between the words "Epilepsy" and "Danger" was stronger in 2013 compared with that in 2010; however, the association was weaker in 2016 compared with that in 2013. There was no significant difference between 2010 and 2016.
   Conclusion: The change in IAT results between 2010 and 2013 might be due to the traffic accident involving PWE in Japan. However, the result in 2016 might indicate that the implicit attitudes toward epilepsy were improved to the same level as those in 2010. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

TI  - Trust in Doctors, Positive Attitudes, and Vaccination Behavior: The Role of Doctor-Patient Communication in H1N1 Vaccination
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION

KW  - PROVIDER COMMUNICATION
KW  - ETHICS
AB  - Although there is a wide variety of scientific evidence that demonstrates the benefits of vaccination on a multitude of diseases, vaccination rates remain low while misperceptions about vaccines are on the rise. The primary objective of the present study is to examine the role of doctor-patient communication and vaccination. We test the impact of doctor-patient communication on trust in doctors' vaccine recommendations as a mediator, to understand the mechanisms leading to positive vaccination attitudes, and ultimately leading to actual H1N1 vaccination behavior. We use data from a nationally representative U.S. sample from one of the Multimedia Audience Research Systems (MARS) data sets collected by Kantar Media. Our results demonstrate the crucial role of doctor-patient communication in building patients' trust in doctors, which in turn positively impact vaccination attitudes and H1N1 vaccination behavior. Unlike other preventive health measures, getting vaccines after a pandemic is a critical decision because these vaccines are previously unknown. Our finding implies that verified communication from the physician's office may be one of the effective strategies during or after a pandemic. Our findings have implications for public health organizations to incorporate effective vaccination communication and could have critical implications for the COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - Overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic requires motivating the vast majority of Americans to get vaccinated. However, vaccination rates have become politically polarized, and a substantial proportion of Republicans have remained vaccine hesitant for months. Here, we explore how endorsements by party elites affect Republicans' COVID-19 vaccination intentions and attitudes. In a preregistered survey experiment (n = 1,480), we varied whether self-identified Republicans saw endorsements of the vaccine from prominent Republicans (including video of a speech by former President Donald Trump), from the Democratic Party (including video of a speech by President Joseph Biden), or a neutral control condition including no endorsements. Unvaccinated Republicans who were exposed to the Republican elite endorsement reported 7.0% higher vaccination intentions than those who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement and 5.7% higher than those in the neutral control condition. These effects were statistically mediated by participants' reports of how much they thought Republican politicians would want them to get vaccinated. We also found evidence of backlash effects against Democratic elites: Republicans who viewed the Democratic elite endorsement reported they would be significantly less likely to encourage others to vaccinate and had more negative attitudes toward the vaccine, compared with those who viewed the Republican elite endorsement or the neutral control. These results demonstrate the relative advantage of cues from Republican elites-and the risks of messaging from Democrats currently in power-for promoting vaccination among the largest vaccine-hesitant subgroup in the United States.

KW  - Cross-cultural schemata
AB  - Purpose - For about four decades, Iran and the USA have continued to be two most stubborn enemies and this has drawn much research on this subject. Yet, only a very small fraction of this body of research has been allocated to studying the perceptions that the people of the two countries have of each other. Using a mixed method survey, the purpose of this paper is to explore cross-cultural schemata US American people have of Iranians.
   Design/methodology/approach - By way of an e-mail survey, the authors collected 1,752 responses from American citizens across 50 American states. The open ended responses were codified and categorized. Three out of six categories were further sub-categorized.
   Findings - The outcomes showed that about 40 percent of Americans had negative cross-cultural schemata of Iranians with the media being the mam source of negative cross-cultural schemata. Conversely, personal contact and communication with Iranians proved to be the source of positive cross-cultural schemata toward Iranians. Other results showed that US American exceptionalism and negative attitudes toward Iranians had a direct and positive relationship with having negative cross-cultural schemata of Iranians.
   Originality/value - As the authors have explained in this paper, very few scholars have taken up the issue of cross-cultural schemata Iranian and American people have of each other. By doing this and several other works, the authors have tried to create a new research interest in academic circles.

AB  - Five experiments (N = 2,251) and a meta-analysis examine how group labels shape Americans' levels of prejudice, behavioral intentions, and policy preferences toward immigrants living in the US without authorization. These studies extend research documenting how the perceived negativity of group labels (e.g., those describing gay people) affects people's downstream attitudes. To this end, Study 1 examines the perceived negativity of the five most commonly used labels to describe unauthorized immigrants. Study 2 found that relatively negative (vs. neutral) labels (e.g., illegal aliens vs. noncitizens) engendered more prejudice, punitive behavioral intentions, and greater support for punitive policies. Study 3 replicates these effects and examines the role of familiarity. People who personally knew members of the group were more positive towards them overall, but were nevertheless susceptible to the labels' influence. Studies 4 and 5 provide additional replications and explore prejudice as a mediator of behavioral intentions and policy preferences.

AB  - In an attempt to improve organ donation rates, some countries are considering moving from "opt-in" systems where citizens must express their willingness to be an organ donor, to "opt-out" systems where consent is presumed unless individuals have expressed their wishes otherwise, by, for example, joining an "opt-out" register. In Wales-a part of the United Kingdom-the devolved government recently legislated for an "opt-out" system. For the change to be effective, a public awareness campaign was critical to the policy's success. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we explored media coverage of the change to better understand the relationship between the state, policy actors, media and the public when such policy changes take place. Our findings illustrate how a state communication campaign can effectively set the media agenda within which we saw a degree of interdependency created with the state using the media to promote policy, and the media relying on the state for credible information. Yet we also found that the media is not uncritical and observed how it uses its autonomy to influence policy setting. Over the period of study, we found that a change in tone and view towards deemed consent organ donation has taken place in the media. However, while this may influence or reflect public attitudes, it is yet to be seen whether the media campaign translates into behavioural change that will result in increases in organ donations.

   To assess the effect of an antismoking advertisement under real-world conditions.
   Design
   Quasi-experimental study.
   Setting/participants
   Multiplex cinema in Kiel, Germany; 4073 patrons were surveyed after having viewed a movie. Some 4005 patrons were >= 10 years old (28.7% between 10 and 17 years). A total of 654 subjects (16.3%) were smokers.
   Intervention
   In the intervention condition (weeks 1 and 3), a 30-second antismoking advertisement-accentuating long-term health consequences of smoking and promoting cessation-was shown prior to all movies; in the control condition (weeks 2 and 4) no such spot was shown.
   Main outcome measures
   (i) Awareness of smoking in the movie, (ii) approval of smoking in the movie, (iii) attitude towards smoking, (iv) intention to smoke in the future and (v) desire to smoke among smokers.
   Findings
   Patrons who were exposed to the antismoking advertisement were more likely to be female, but did not differ with respect to smoking status. After controlling for gender differences, patrons exposed to the antismoking advertisement had (i) higher awareness of smoking in the movies, (ii) lower levels of approval of smoking in the movies, and (iii) a more negative attitude towards smoking in general compared with those not exposed. Among smokers, smoking in the movies increased urge to smoke, but there was no interaction between smoking in the movies and experimental condition.
   Conclusions
   Study results suggest that placing an antismoking advertisement before movies can affect attitudes towards smoking, bolstering evidence in support of such policies.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding community members' knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus and the prevalence of associated stigma are critical steps for increasing accurate public health knowledge, encouraging uptake of preventative or mitigating health behaviors, and ultimately bringing the COVID-19 pandemic under control.Methods: We conducted a one-time, phone-based assessment to assess the presence of perceived COVID-19 community stigma reported by Kenyan primary and secondary school teachers, as well as adolescents living with HIV. Participants were previously enrolled in an ongoing, cluster-randomized trial to evaluate the impact of multi-media teacher training on teachers' negative attitudes and beliefs around HIV. The SAFI Stigma Questionnaire, a validated tool to assess HIV-related stigma in this setting, was adapted to ask questions regarding the stigma and discrimination experienced or perceived during the COVID-19 pandemic.Results: We enrolled 330 participants in this study, including 311 primary and secondary teachers (56% female, average age 36 years) and 19 adolescents living with HIV (57.89% female, average age 16.37 years). None of the adolescent participants reported witnessing or experiencing discrimination related to COVID-19, nor did they report losing financial and/or social support. In contrast, the teacher participants reported prominent social stigma experiences of various levels and related to COVID-19. Teachers in the intervention group, who had completed the multi-media training on HIV-related stigma, were significantly less likely to think that the community viewed COVID-19 as a dirty or shameful disease, and less likely to feel it was important to keep their COVID-19 infection a secret, compared to the teacher control group.Conclusion: These findings suggest that COVID-19-related stigma may be prevalent in western Kenya and that interventions to reduce community-level stigma for HIV may also have a protective impact on other stigmatized infectious diseases such as COVID-19.
