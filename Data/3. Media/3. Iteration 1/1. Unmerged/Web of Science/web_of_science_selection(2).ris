AB  - Background: Prepregnancy health care is vital to alleviate and prevent maternal and neonatal disability and death.
   Objective: The purpose of the study was to measure the levels of knowledge and attitude on preconception care and their determinants among women who delivered at government hospitals in a rural setting in southern Ethiopia.
   Method: A facility-based cross sectional study was done from January 01 to February 30, 2017 on a sample of 370 women who delivered at government hospitals in Wolayita zone. The mothers were selected using systematic random sampling technique. The data were collected using structured and pretested interviewer administered questionnaires at the postnatal ward of each hospital. Data were analyzed using bivariate and multivariable techniques.
   Results: The result showed that 53% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 47.8%, 58.1%) of mothers who delivered at public hospitals had adequate level of knowledge on preconception care, whereas 54.3% (95% CI: 49.2%, 59.5%) possessed positive attitude to preconception care. Mothers who have radio, planned pregnancy and have participated in community meetings related to preconception care had a meaningfully higher odds of good level of knowledge to preconception care. Ordinal regression showed that women who own mobile phone had at least three times significantly higher odds of positive attitude to preconception care, whereas women who have participated community meetings had lower odds of positive attitude on preconception care.
   Conclusion: The results revealed that the levels of mothers' knowledge and positive attitude on preconception care are low relative to other studies. Using transistor radio and mobile phone have significant effect in improving the knowledge and attitude of reproductive age women on preconception care. Hence, providing community health education based on radio and/or mobile phone messaging could be useful in positively influencing the knowledge and attitude of women on preconception care.

AB  - In Bangladesh, an array of measures have been adopted to control the rapid spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. Such general population control measures could significantly influence perception, knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) towards COVID-19. Here, we assessed KAP towards COVID-19 immediately after the lock-down measures were implemented and during the rapid rise period of the outbreak. Online-based cross-sectional study conducted from March 29 to April 19, 2020, involving Bangladeshi residents aged 12-64 years, recruited via social media. After consenting, participants completed an online survey assessing socio-demographic variables, perception, and KAP towards COVID-19. Of the 2017 survey participants, 59.8% were male, the majority were students (71.2%), aged 21-30 years (57.9%), having a bachelor's degree (61.0%), having family income >30,000 BDT (50.0%), and living in urban areas (69.8). The survey revealed that 48.3% of participants had more accurate knowledge, 62.3% had more positive attitudes, and 55.1% had more frequent practices regarding COVID-19 prevention. Majority (96.7%) of the participants agreed 'COVID-19 is a dangerous disease', almost all (98.7%) participants wore a face mask in crowded places, 98.8% agreed to report a suspected case to health authorities, and 93.8% implemented washing hands with soap and water. In multiple logistic regression analyses, COVID-19 more accurate knowledge was associated with age and residence. Sociodemographic factors such as being older, higher education, employment, monthly family income >30,000 BDT, and having more frequent prevention practices were the more positive attitude factors. More frequent prevention practice factors were associated with female sex, older age, higher education, family income > 30,000 BDT, urban area residence, and having more positive attitudes. To improve KAP of general populations is crucial during the rapid rise period of a pandemic outbreak such as COVID-19. Therefore, development of effective health education programs that incorporate considerations of KAP-modifying factors is needed.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the combined influence of gender stereotypes, sexism, and homophobia on attitudes toward bullying and bullying behavior. A total of 1,500 Spanish adolescents between 12 and 18 years of age (49.3% girls and 50.7% boys) completed a questionnaire that included measures of bullying, attitudes toward bullying, gender-stereotyped personality traits (instrumentality and expressiveness), hostile and benevolent sexism, and attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. First, the findings demonstrated that boys scored significantly higher on all the variables assessed except on benevolent sexism. Two similar models were obtained for both sexes. Benevolent sexism and, in boys, more positive attitudes toward gay men predicted more negative attitudes toward bullying when mediated by more expressive gender traits. An inverse pattern was also observed: Hostile sexism predicted more favorable attitudes toward bullying when mediated by instrumental gender traits. Attitudes toward bullying were highly correlated with bullying behavior. The five-predictor variables (including attitudes toward bullying) explained 58% of the variance of bullying behavior in girls and 37% of such variance in boys.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus Disease-19 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory infection characterized by rapid transmission mainly by close contact with an infected person. To control its spread, Saudi Arabia adopted a very strict control measures including raising public awareness by all available means. The current study investigated the knowledge, attitudes, and practice of Saudi population, towards COVID-19 pandemic.
   Method: This study was cross-sectional. The study population were Saudis from the five regions of the kingdom. Data were collected by an electronic questionnaire after obtaining an ethics approval and informed consents. Three thousand six hundred and fortytwo subjects were included in the study. Data analysis was performed by SPSS version 23.
   Results: Most of the participants had average and good knowledge about COVI-19 constituted 52.7% and 44.8% respectively. The population practice and attitude towards COVID-19 was 84.0% and 96.9% respectively. Males had better COVID-19 knowledge compared to females. Nine hundred and ninety-two (48.3%) and 704 (40.9%) of males and females had good knowledge respectively. Females had more positive attitude towards COVID-19 than males (98.4% versus 95.5%). The positive COVI-19 attitude for the single, the married, the divorced and the widow were 95.7%, 98.2%, 97.3% and 96.6% respectively.
   Conclusion: The level of COVID-19 knowledge of Saudi population is average and the attitude of most population is positive. Males have better COVID-19 knowledge compared to females: however, most females have positive attitude towards the disease compared to males. The level of COVID-19 knowledge increases with age and education level of the population. Population who have higher level of knowledge have positive attitude. The social media (Twitter) is the main source of COVID-19 information for the Saudi population.

AB  - Background The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on health services offered to patients with non-communicable diseases, including chronic neurological illnesses, are diverse and universal. We used a self-reported questionnaire to investigate these impacts on neurology patients in Jordan and assess their knowledge and attitudes towards the pandemic. Results Most respondents had positive attitudes towards the COVID-19 pandemic, with 96% reporting they believed in the seriousness of the pandemic and adhered to prevention measures. Nearly 97% resorted to the internet and media outlets for medical information about the pandemic. About one in five clinic visitors had their appointments delayed due to interruption of health services. A similar portion of patients with MS, epilepsy, and migraine or tension headache reported medication interruptions during the pandemic. One in two patients reported new events or worsening illness since the start of the pandemic, and sleep disturbances were reported by nearly one in three patients who had epilepsy or headache. Conclusion The COVID-19 pandemic's impacts on patients with neurological illnesses in Jordan were deep and diverse. Meanwhile, the majority of surveyed neurology patients demonstrated a positive attitude towards the pandemic.

AB  - COVID-19 has affected many areas of daily life, including communication and learning. Social distancing is essential to prevent the spread of COVID-19. In these situations, teaching communication skills is essential for helping individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) reach their full potential. To provide communication education while maintaining social distancing, we developed a communication training system using a tele-operated robot. In this system, we prepared a PC and a robot for each participant. The participants were grouped in pairs and communicated with each other through the tele-operated robot. The objective of this study was to test whether this system can maintain motivation for training in individuals with ASD and whether our system was useful for improving communication skills. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups: the taking a class by teachers alone (TCT) group or robot-mediated communication exercise (RMC) group. Participants in the TCT group took a class about communication skills from their teacher. Participants in the RMC group, in addition to taking a class by teacher, were grouped in pairs and communicated with each other through the tele-operated robot once a week over 4 weeks (for a total of five sessions). In total, twenty individuals with ASD participated in the study. One-way ANOVA revealed that there were significantly greater improvements in being good at describing their thoughts to others, which was self-rated (F = 6.583; p = 0.019), and good at listening to the thoughts or feelings of others, which was rated by themselves (F = 5.635; p = 0.029) and their teacher (F = 5.333; p = 0.033). As expected, the motivation for training using this system was maintained during a session. Overall, this study revealed that our system was useful for improving communication skills (e.g., listening to the thoughts or feelings of others). Teaching communication skills under pandemic conditions is important, and this study demonstrated the feasibility of communication training using tele-operated robots.

AB  - Background: Self-injury is a complex issue, further complicated by the fact that up to half of young people who self-injure do not receive help. Young people who do receive help for self-injury claim they prefer to access family and friends over more formal sources of help. This original research set out to examine the influence of negative attitudes to professional help and a sense of autonomy on help-seeking intentions.
   Methods: A cross-section of 220 university students and young adults from the community ( Students = 131, other participants = 89; mean age = 24.64) completed anonymous online questionnaires measuring self-injurious behaviour and mental health related problems, attitudes toward seeking professional mental health help, autonomy, and intentions to seek help for self-injury. Two separate mediation models were tested using a bootstrapping approach to investigate intentions to seek help - one on mental health problems, and one specifically on self-injury.
   Results: More positive attitudes to help-seeking were significantly associated with greater intentions to seek help, while higher perceived autonomy was associated with lower intentions to seek help. Attitudes fully mediated the negative relationship between autonomy and willingness to seek help for self-injury. The model also maintained partial mediation for willingness to seek help for other mental health problems, beyond self-injury. Current self-injurers expressed significantly more negative attitudes toward help-seeking compared to past self-injurers and those with no history of self-injury. Similarly, current self-injurers reported being less likely to seek help from anyone compared to both other groups.
   Conclusions: This study appears to be the first to set out to compare self-injurers' attitudes to help-seeking directly with those of non-self-injurers, and the first to show that attitudes mediate the relationship between autonomy and help-seeking. The findings provide evidence that will assist development of interventions targeting negative attitudes toward seeking professional help, in order to increase help-seeking among self-injurers who would otherwise not receive treatment.

AB  - Building on psychological research linking essentialist beliefs about human differences with prejudice, we test whether lay belief in the biological basis of political ideology is associated with political intolerance and social avoidance. In two studies of American adults (Study 1: N = 288, Study 2: N = 164), we find that belief in the biological basis of political views is associated with greater intolerance and social avoidance of ideologically dissimilar others. The association is substantively large and robust to demographic, religious, and political control variables. These findings stand in contrast to some theoretical expectations that biological attributions for political ideology are associated with tolerance. We conclude that biological lay theories are especially likely to be correlated with prejudice in the political arena, where social identities tend to be salient and linked to intergroup competition and animosity.

AB  - Although meditation is increasingly accepted as having personal benefits, less is known about the broader impact of meditation on social and intergroup relations. We tested the effect of lovingkindness meditation training on improving implicit attitudes toward members of 2 stigmatized social outgroups: Blacks and homeless people. Healthy non-Black, nonhomeless adults (N = 101) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 conditions: 6-week lovingkindness practice, 6-week lovingkindness discussion (a closely matched active control), or waitlist control. Decreases in implicit bias against stigmatized outgroups (as measured by Implicit Association Test) were observed only in the lovingkindness practice condition. Reduced psychological stress mediated the effect of lovingkindness practice on implicit bias against homeless people, but it did not mediate the reduced bias against Black people. These results suggest that lovingkindness meditation can improve automatically activated, implicit attitudes toward stigmatized social groups and that this effect occurs through distinctive mechanisms for different stigmatized social groups.

AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

AB  - Background: The perceived threat of a contagious virus may lead people to be distrustful of immigrants and out-groups. Since the COVID-19 outbreak, the salient politicized discourses of blaming Chinese people for spreading the virus have fueled over 2000 reports of anti-Asian racial incidents and hate crimes in the United States.
   Objective: The study aims to investigate the relationships between news consumption, trust, intergroup contact, and prejudicial attitudes toward Asians and Asian Americans residing in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We compare how traditional news, social media use, and biased news exposure cultivate racial attitudes, and the moderating role of media use and trust on prejudice against Asians is examined.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was completed in May 2020. A total of 430 US adults (mean age 36.75, SD 11.49 years; n=258, 60% male) participated in an online survey through Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform. Respondents answered questions related to traditional news exposure, social media use, perceived trust, and their top three news channels for staying informed about the novel coronavirus. In addition, intergroup contact and racial attitudes toward Asians were assessed. We performed hierarchical regression analyses to test the associations. Moderation effects were estimated using simple slopes testing with a 95% bootstrap confidence interval approach.
   Results: Participants who identified as conservatives (beta=.08, P=.02), had a personal infection history (beta=.10, P=.004), and interacted with Asian people frequently in their daily lives (beta=.46, P<.001) reported more negative attitudes toward Asians after controlling for sociodemographic variables. Relying more on traditional news media (beta=.08, P=.04) and higher levels of trust in social media (beta=.13, P=.007) were positively associated with prejudice against Asians. In contrast, consuming news from left-leaning outlets (beta=-.15, P=.001) and neutral outlets (beta=-.13, P=.003) was linked to less prejudicial attitudes toward Asians. Among those who had high trust in social media, exposure had a negative relationship with prejudice. At high levels of trust in digital websites and apps, frequent use was related to less unfavorable attitudes toward Asians.
   Conclusions: Experiencing racial prejudice among the Asian population during a challenging pandemic can cause poor psychological outcomes and exacerbate health disparities. The results suggest that conservative ideology, personal infection history, frequency of intergroup contact, traditional news exposure, and trust in social media emerge as positive predictors of prejudice against Asians and Asian Americans, whereas people who get COVID-19 news from left-leaning and balanced outlets show less prejudice. For those who have more trust in social media and digital news, frequent use of these two sources is associated with lower levels of prejudice. Our findings highlight the need to reshape traditional news discourses and use social media and mobile news apps to develop credible messages for combating racial prejudice against Asians.

AB  - This study examines the news coverage of the Commonwealth Games in India in major newspapers in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the UK. Textual analysis of news articles reveals a heavy focus on issues of mismanagement and deficiencies in game preparations, and the use of negative stereotypes of India. The article draws attention to the bias in coverage of events in developing countries and calls attention to the hegemonic function of the Western press in perpetuating old social attitudes and prejudices that undermine the success and achievements of events in developing countries like India.

AB  - Over the past 2 decades, Alberta's bitumen industry has emerged as a major point of contention in Canadian politics, with the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion (TMX) project being a recent controversy that has attracted both domestic and international media attention. This brief research report focuses on news coverage of TMX in a rarely studied form of ethnic media: WeChat newsfeeds (known as "public accounts") targeting Chinese diasporas across Canadian metropolises. A thematic analysis of TMX-related WeChat articles published between January 2016 and May 2021 reveals an overall negative attitude toward the project's opponents. This stance is mainly due to WeChat public accounts' heavy reliance on the Canadian mainstream media's framing of TMX. As a result, the Canadian mainstream media's downplay of the climate emergency and decarbonization sets the news agendas of the surveyed WeChat public accounts. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop non-English alternative media to engage ethnic minority groups in broader public conversations on climate change mitigation.

AB  - A growing social science literature has used Twitter and Facebook to study political and social phenomena including for election forecasting and tracking political conversations. This research note uses a nationally representative probability sample of the British population to examine how Twitter and Facebook users differ from the general population in terms of demographics, political attitudes and political behaviour. We find that Twitter and Facebook users differ substantially from the general population on many politically relevant dimensions including vote choice, turnout, age, gender, and education. On average social media users are younger and better educated than non-users, and they are more liberal and pay more attention to politics. Despite paying more attention to politics, social media users are less likely to vote than non-users, but they are more likely to support the left leaning Labour Party when they do vote. However, we show that these apparent differences mostly arise due to the demographic composition of social media users. After controlling for age, gender, and education, no statistically significant differences arise between social media users and non-users on political attention, values or political behaviour.

AB  - In modern psychology, mindfulness is an important resource for psychological well-being and intergroup relations, but its role in intercultural communication effectiveness has not been sufficiently studied. This research aims to identify the interrelationship between interpersonal mindfulness, intergroup anxiety, and intercultural communication effectiveness among international students. The sample includes 337 (M-age = 22.93, SD = 3.11) international students (41.5% of females) from different countries studying in Russian Universities. Interpersonal mindfulness was measured using the Interpersonal Mindfulness Scale, Intergroup anxiety using ten items adapted from Stephan and Stephan and used in Gudykunst and Nishida, and Intercultural communication effectiveness using the eight items adapted from Gudykunst's Perceived Effectiveness of Communication measure. Descriptive analysis, correlations, and mediation analyses were used to process the data. The research findings showed that interpersonal mindfulness has both a direct effect on intercultural communication effectiveness and a mediation effect on intercultural communication effectiveness through intergroup anxiety among the international students.

AB  - National panel data gathered in 2008 (T1) and 2010 (T2) from 420 Black and White US adults aged 18-89 years (M = 45.37, SD = 15.85) were employed to assess prospective associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes. Premarital sex attitudes were indexed via a composite measure of perceptions of the appropriateness of adults and teenagers having premarital sex. Wright's (2011) sexual script acquisition, activation, application model ((3)AM) of media sexual socialization was used as the guiding theoretical framework. The (3)AM maintains that sexual media may be used by consumers to inform their sexual scripts but that attitude change from exposure to sexual media is less likely when media scripts are incongruent with consumers' preexisting scripts. Consistent with these postulates, the association between pornography consumption at T1 and more positive attitudes toward premarital sex at T2 was strongest for younger adults, who are less oppositional to premarital sex than older adults. Contrary to the position that associations between pornography consumption and premarital sex attitudes are due to individuals who already have positive attitudes toward premarital sex selecting content congruent with their attitudes, premarital sex attitudes at T1 did not predict pornography consumption at T2.

AB  - Coronavirus popularly known as COVID-19 is a pandemic that stormed the globe and rendered strong nations helpless and even the world powers, powerless. Initially, the Nigerian government was reluctant to put measures in place or lock its borders until a returnee was diagnosed after he had infected some people. This necessitated several measures including total lockdown, social distancing and improved personal hygiene to forestall its spread. Moreover, Nigerians believe that the state of the nation is even worse than this pandemic and, thus, have developed mastery, especially via satire in weathering any kind of storm. It is therefore, not surprising that the Facebook has become a veritable platform where Nigerians evoke humour while exposing human foibles in their linguistic disposition, with the intention to improve the society. This study, therefore, examined the satirical devices in the Facebook posts of Nigerians with the aim of teasing out the ideologies portrayed in relation to the existing social, economic and political attitude of the people towards the pandemic. Consequently, 22 Facebook posts were purposively selected for analysis, drawing input from Horatian's approach to satire and Fairclough's (1995) sociocultural approach to Critical Discourse Analysis. The analysis reveals various satirical elements deployed as a subtle and effective alternative to contest power abuse, social injustice and propagate change. The study also reveals the wittiness and absurdity of satire that makes it a ready tool to unbridle people's feelings; laden with different ideologies with the aim of relaxing tension and catalysing transformation in the society. Moreover, the import of weathering the storm becomes bare as an essential make-up of Nigerians; the tinge of humour intended in the posts relieves perceived tension and reminds the readers to take life easy, thus, making the study quite engaging.

AB  - Audience expectations of journalism are a crucial dimension not only to understand journalism's public legitimacy and institutional character but also its economic foundations in terms of consumers' prospects. Although we see a critically growing disconnect between the audience and journalism, we know little about what the audience actually expects from journalism and what explains audience expectations. Using data from an online survey among the audience (n = 2775) as well as professional journalists (n = 818), this study compares audience expectations of journalism with journalists' role orientations in Austria. Furthermore, multivariate analyses particularly aim to explore the role of political parameters for the understanding of audience expectations of journalism. Results show both congruencies and discrepancies between citizens' and journalists' perception of specific functions of journalism and that - besides media use - political attitudes may very well play an important role.

AB  - Objectives: Participants in breast cancer screening programmes may benefit from early detection but may also be exposed to the risks of overdiagnosis and false positives. We surveyed a sample of Spanish women to assess knowledge, information sources, attitudes and psychosocial impact.
   Materials and methods: A total of 434 breast cancer screening programme participants aged 45-69 years were administered questionnaires regarding knowledge, information sources, attitudes and psychosocial impact. Scores of 5 or more (out of 10) and 12 or less (out of 24) were established as indicating adequate knowledge and a positive attitude, respectively. Psychosocial impact was measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Cancer Worry Scale.
   Results: Only 42 women (9.7%) had adequate knowledge. The mean (SD) knowledge score was 2.97 (1.16). Better educated women and women without previous false positives had higher scores. The main sources of information were television, press, Andalusian Health Service documentation and family and friends. Most participants (99.1%) had a positive attitude, with a mean (SD) score of 3.21 (2.66). Mean (SD) scores for anxiety, depression and cancer worry were 1.86 (3.26), 0.72 (1.99) and 9.4 (3.04), respectively.
   Conclusion: Women have a very positive attitude to breast cancer screening, but are poorly informed and use television as their main information source. They experience no negative psychosocial impact from participation in such programmes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A growing body of research has shown that naturalized citizens' attitudes towards immigration worsen following citizenship acquisition. Accordingly, these socially mobile individuals tend to distance themselves from their former immigrant ingroup. The present contribution explains such self-group distancing coping strategy in terms of an "ironic" procedural fairness effect. Study 1 (N = 566), a survey conducted among naturalized Swiss citizens, showed that fairness perceptions with respect to the naturalization process were indeed associated with stronger anti-immigration attitudes, and that this relationship was mediated by identification with the host nation. Next, two experiments were conducted to demonstrate the causality of the hypothesized mediation model. In Study 2 (Experiment 1; N = 248), fairness of the admission procedure (accurate vs. inaccurate) increased identification with a desirable group. In Study 3 (Experiment 2; N = 141), administration of a national identity prime evoked stronger anti-immigration attitudes. Taken together, our findings highlight a somewhat "dark side" of procedural fairness.

AB  - In response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many aspects of day-to-day life were considerably altered. Professional sports leagues, educational institutions, public worship, and workplace closures were commonplace. Quarantines and lockdowns put public life on hold due to social distancing requirements. As a result, internet users increased their web activity as a way of staying connected and passing the time. In this manuscript, streaming activity on Facebook Gaming, YouTube Gaming, Mixer, and Twitch is analyzed to discover changes in consumption. It is compared to school closures and stay-at-home orders in US states to better understand changes in social media platform utilization during the global pandemic. This helps to provide insights into user patterns that firms can consider in planning their future social media efforts.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of the study is to investigate the relationship between consumers' attitudes toward hotel Twitter accounts and attitudes toward hotel brands, booking intentions and electronic word-of-mouth. The study focuses on Saudi Arabia owing to the widespread use of Twitter in that market.
   Design/methodology/approach Modifying a previously developed theoretical model on marketing effectiveness of social media, this study empirically tests consumers' attitudes toward hotel Twitter accounts. Data have been collected via a structured online survey. A confirmatory factor analysis and a structural equation model fit have been used to test the model.
   Findings When consumers have positive attitudes toward hotel tweets, they have positive attitudes toward the hotel's Twitter account, which, in turn, improves their attitudes toward the hotel's brand and results in intent to book and spread electronic word of mouth.
   Originality/value The study contributes to the body of knowledge about social media marketing effectiveness in the hospitality industry.

AB  - The Internet has radically decreased the influence of physical distance by allowing people to share images and information about distant places at the click of a button. But we still do not understand how exposure to this information influences our mental conception of places that are far away, and how these effects may change our attitudes towards distant locations. This has implications for both tourism marketers and travelers consulting social media sites for information on destinations. We conducted an experiment to see if exposing participants to one of four mediated representations of an unfamiliar environment impacted their attitudes towards the location. We found that mediated exposure to a distant place positively influenced desire to visit the location through different routes: 3D panoramas heightened feelings of spatial presence which translated into more positive attitudes towards the place, while textual descriptions decreased psychological distance which in turn was associated with more positive attitudes.

AB  - This study aims to see the challenges of social and psychological distance among Malay students to learn foreign languages. The self-interest and awareness of students is not the only factor to ponder an engagement in learning a foreign language. At the same time, social distance challenges will occur considering the culture of Malay students thought that foreign languages are not easy to learn and complicated. This study also aiming at the alternative taken by the students in order to improve their learning process in mastering a foreign language. The challenges facing by them is in the aspect of self-confidence, peers who can interact in Arabic and Japanese and facilities provided in the campus. Based on the study and observation, students in public universities receive more of these facilities than students in private universities. The main reason is that a reliable financial injection given by the Ministry of Higher Education will certainly be able to help the public universities in strengthening learning facilities for students. 20 respondents were interviewed and information been analyzed narratively through qualitative techniques. The results came up that the variations in background, which is not from the community group that uses the language is also a challenge for them. As an alternative, students can double practice of communicating with foreign students who using both languages most of the times, as well as the role of social media that displays the story of society and by using it in the plot of the story.

AB  - Background This paper builds on the results from the study: Illicit drug use in English adolescent students - results of a cumulative mediation analyses. The study sets out to specify the most significant social learning (SL) pathways for each of the ages, regions, and gender. Methods Mediation analyses of a secondary dataset: Smoking Drinking Drug Use Survey 2016 (N = 12,051) on adolescents aged 11-15 years. Results The most important SL pathway to drug use for boys was imitation of friends and for girls it was having the "perception" that fellow peers were consuming drugs. Positive attitudes to glue was a strong SL pathway at ages 11 and 12 but not for ages 13-15 years. In the Northern parts of England positive attitudes to cannabis and in the Southern regions peer association were the strongest SL pathways to drug use. Conclusion The results are of relevance to policy because they confirm that drug use is a learnt behaviour and that this learnt behaviour varies for gender, region and specific ages.

AB  - Employees may continue to work remotely for a substantial amount of time, even after the end of the pandemic. Our established theories of group processes and intergroup relations can help us understand these new ways of working and online group experiences. However, there are key differences in computer-mediated and face-to-face (FtF) groups. In this essay, I present some of the extant robust theories and findings from computer communication research to understand virtual working within online groups. These perspectives include that group processes develop over a longer period of time as compared to FtF, informal communication is neglected, computer-mediated groups have some advantages over FtF groups, sociomateriality is a useful theoretical lens, and dispersion affects group member cognitions about each other. I use my own lab's work on entitativity as an example of how moving from FtF to online group research can deepen our understanding of both FtF and online groups. The essay concludes with recommendations for future research.

AB  - Transgender individuals face many barriers to healthcare access, including providers' lack of knowledge on transgender-specific healthcare needs. Physicians and medical students report a lack of training on and low confidence with transgender-related healthcare. Previous research has demonstrated the importance of self-efficacy and beliefs regarding affirmative practice for counsellors' engagement in affirmative practice with LGBTQ+ clients. The present study investigated healthcare professional students' attitudes towards transgender individuals, as well as the influence of students' skills in working with transgender clients and their confidence understanding transgender healthcare terms on their beliefs about, self-efficacy regarding, and actual engagement in affirmative practice. Sixty-one Canadian healthcare professional students participated in an online survey. Participants reported positive attitudes towards transgender individuals, and positive beliefs about the importance of affirmative practice with LGBTQ+ clients. In a multiple mediation model, confidence with understanding transgender healthcare terms and practical skills with working with transgender clients each related to self-efficacy regarding affirmative practice; self-efficacy in turn related to engagement in affirmative practice. Healthcare professional students' positive attitudes and beliefs are promising; additional training that builds practical skills and confidence in using correct language is important for students' self-efficacy and engagement in affirmative practice.

AB  - This study aimed to improve our understanding of what constitutes a healthy organizational change process among university employees. Positive attitudes and proactive participation toward organizational change were presumed to affect and be affected by personality resources measured via core self-evaluations and work-related motivational well-being (vigor). The study used 3-wave longitudinal data collected in 2 large Finnish universities during their recent process of organizational change (N = 926). Structural equation modeling was used to establish the direction of the relationships between the variables. The results showed that high levels of both core self-evaluations and vigor were associated with more favorable perceptions of organizational change: employees high in core self-evaluations and vigor were more satisfied with the changes and the information provided about the changes, and were also more likely to be actively involved in the change process. It was further found that positive attitudes to change mediated the relation between vigor and core self-evaluations: vigorous employees perceived the organizational changes more positively, which in turn strengthened their internal self-evaluations. Overall, these longitudinal results show that, among university employees, core self-evaluations and vigor are both important resource factors influencing perceptions and reactions to organizational changes.

AB  - Background: The World Health Organization has recommended that individual governments identify vaccine hesitancy areas. It is proposed that the governments, with the aid of local organizations, educate and implement social insights on the vaccination so that high population levels are covered with this safe immune program. Methods: A longitudinal online survey covered 3000 adults from India. We examined the demography, behavioral (socio-economic) attitude, vaccine hesitancy, vaccine resistance for the COVID-19 vaccine. The specific reasons for the COVID-19 vaccine decline were also evaluated. Results: Our survey revealed 59% definite response, 29% low-level response, and 7% high-level response for vaccine hesitancy, while 6% had resistant views on the COVID-19 vaccine. Individuals who had higher income levels, lived in a society, maintained social distancing, had downloaded the COVID-19 update app, showed a positive attitude towards their government, and more confidence in their healthcare system were more inclined towards the vaccination. On the contrary, individuals who had overstated the risks of COVID-19 and had a religious and populistic attitude towards vaccination were more hesitant/resistant to vaccination. The respondents who declined vaccine administration were further evaluated for their specific reason for their response. The most common reasons for declining the COVID-19 vaccine were post-vaccine scare of adverse health effects and accepting the information spread by social media. Conclusions: The results in our study show that by identifying population "hot spots " that have negative or unclear information on the COVID-19 vaccination, these "hot spots " can be addressed by involving friendly organizations that can clear their strong disbeliefs and increase the percentage of vaccine-definite people within the population. The role of government-induced COVID-19 vaccine policy measures can always be beneficial to cause this shift from disbelief to confidence within the population.</p>

AB  - Does the consumption of ideologically congruent news on social media exacerbate polarization? I estimate the effects of social media news exposure by conducting a large field experiment randomly offering participants subscriptions to conservative or liberal news outlets on Facebook. I collect data on the causal chain of media effects: subscriptions to outlets, exposure to news on Facebook, visits to online news sites, and sharing of posts, as well as changes in political opinions and attitudes. Four main findings emerge. First, random variation in exposure to news on social media substantially affects the slant of news sites that individuals visit. Second, exposure to counter-attitudinal news decreases negative attitudes toward the opposing political party. Third, in contrast to the effect on attitudes, I find no evidence that the political leanings of news outlets affect political opinions. Fourth, Facebook's algorithm is less likely to supply individuals with posts from -counter-attitudinal outlets, conditional on individuals subscribing to them. Together, the results suggest that social media algorithms may limit exposure to -counter-attitudinal news and thus increase polarization.

AB  - Background: Dementia remains a public health concern and a leading cause of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. However, the knowledge and attitudes towards dementia among university students remain unknown. This study assessed the knowledge and attitude towards dementia among university students in Uganda.
   Methods: An online descriptive, cross-sectional study was undertaken from August to November 2020, among undergraduate students from 11 Ugandan universities. A validated study questionnaire was used to collect data on socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitudes of dementia. A score <60% was considered poor knowledge while >= 80% good knowledge and more than 80% reflected positive attitudes.
   Results: Overall, 1005 participants with a median age of 23 (interquartile range: 18 to 35) years participated in the study. The majority of the students were male (56.5%, n=568) and nearly half were pursuing human sciences/medicine-related programs. The mean knowledge score was 65.5% (SD +/- 18.5). Thirty-two percent of the study participants had poor knowledge and only 26.8% (n=269) had good knowledge of dementia. More than half of the study participants believed that dementia is a normal part of aging and that memory loss happens to all people as they age. Attitudes towards patients with dementia were positive with a mean score of 81.9% (SD +/- 19.6) and 65.2% of the study participants had positive dementia attitudes. Those aged more than 24 years were significantly associated with positive attitudes (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 1.5, 95% CI: 1.1-2.0, p=0.019). There was a weak correlation between knowledge and attitude scores (rho=0.341, p<0.001).
   Conclusion: Whereas the majority of university students have positive attitudes towards patients with dementia, a significant number still have poor knowledge of the same. Continuous health education is suggested to improve knowledge of dementia in this population. Further studies to understand the perception in the general population are recommended.

The survey collected demographic information, electronic health (eHealth) literacy, COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and prevention behavior data using descriptive analysis and multinomial logistic regression to analyze the data.
   Results: The mean age of study participants was 20.88 years, of which 31.8% were male (n=613). Television (84.9%) and WeChat (79.6%) were the major sources of their information. Nursing students had good knowledge (14.68 +/- 2.83), had positive attitudes (4.03 +/- 0.59), had good practices (3.92 +/- 0.65), and had basic eHealth literacy (30.45 +/- 6.90). Nursing students with higher eHealth literacy (odds ratio [OR]=0.89, P<0.01), good knowledge (OR=0.89, P<0.01), and positive attitudes (OR=0.24, P<0.01) took more preventive behaviors. Students living in the countryside (OR=0.09, P<0.01) and of a young age (OR=1.51, P<0.05) seldom took preventive actions. Men, compared with women, were less likely to take preventive measures. (OR=1.44, P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Good eHealth literacy, good knowledge, and a positive attitude were the most important variables that affected the prevention behavior against COVID-19. Targeted health education should be conducted for male students and students living in the countryside by providing reliable and effective online sources.

AB  - Purpose: To explore the association between children's self-reported contact with people with disabilities and attitudes towards them, as well the potential mediating influence of anxiety about interacting with people with disabilities and empathy for them. Method: 1881 children, aged 7-16 years, from 20 schools in South West England completed a survey assessing their contact with people with disabilities and their attitudes towards them. Anxiety about interacting with people with disabilities and empathy towards them were examined as potential mediators. Gender, school year, perceived similarity between people with and without disabilities, proportion of children with additional needs at the school and socioeconomic status (SES) were assessed as moderators. A random effects ("multilevel") regression model was used to test the contact-attitude association and moderation, and path analysis was used to test for mediation. Results: Participants with more self-reported contact reported more positive attitudes towards disability (p < 0.001). Less anticipated anxiety and greater empathy together mediated around a third of this association. Only school year moderated the contact-attitude association (affective attitudes), with stronger contact-attitude associations in primary school children than secondary school children. Conclusions: Self-reported contact was observed to be associated with more positive attitudes towards disability, which was partially mediated by empathy and anxiety. Providing opportunities for contact with people with disabilities that reduces anxiety and increases empathy may improve attitudes to disability and merits evaluation in interventions.
   Implications for Rehabilitation
   Children who reported greater levels of contact with people with disabilities had more positive attitudes towards disability.
   Anxiety about interacting with people with disabilities and empathy towards them partially mediated the contact-attitude associations.
   Providing opportunities for contact with people with disabilities, reducing anxiety and increasing empathy may improve children's attitudes to disability.

AB  - We investigate experiences of disillusionment as a source of political polarization. Disillusioning experiences motivate a search for meaning, and we propose that people respond by seeking reassurance in political ideologies, reflected in political polarization. We first tested this hypothesis in the context of two major political events: the European Union (EU) membership referendum in the United Kingdom and the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In Study 1, disillusionment stemming from the EU referendum outcome led remain supporters to express more extreme political views. In Study 2, we measured political stance and disillusionment before and after the U.S. presidential election. Political polarization occurred among Clinton supporters, and this was mediated by increased disillusionment levels. In Study 3, we manipulated disillusionment and found that disillusioned participants expressed stronger support for diverging forms of political activism. Consistent with our approach, this effect was mediated by epistemic motivations. Implications regarding the effect of political polarization in society are discussed.

AB  - Background: On January 1, 2019, a new regulation on the control of smoking in public places was officially implemented in Hangzhou, China On the day of the implementation, a large number of Chinese media reported the contents of the regulation on the microblog platform Weibo, causing a strong response from and heated discussion among netizens.
   Objective: This study aimed to conduct a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new regulation.
   Methods: We analyzed all microblogs on Weibo that mentioned and explained the regulation in the first 8 days following the implementation. We conducted a content analysis on these microblogs and used social network visualization and descriptive statistics to identify key users and key microblogs.
   Results: Of 7924 microblogs, 12.85% (1018/7924) were in support of the smoking control regulation, 84.12% (6666/7924) were neutral, and 1.31% (104/7924) were opposed to the smoking regulation control. For the negative posts, the public had doubts about the intentions of the policy, its implementation, and the regulations on electronic cigarettes. In addition, 1.72% (136/7924) were irrelevant to the smoking regulation control. Among the 1043 users who explicitly expressed their positive or negative attitude toward the policy, a large proportion of users showed supportive attitudes (956/1043, 91.66%). A total of 5 topics and 11 subtopics were identified.
   Conclusions: This study used a content and network analysis to examine topics and patterns in the social media response to the new smoking regulation. We found that the number of posts with a positive attitude toward the regulation was considerably higher than that of the posts with a negative attitude toward the regulation. Our findings may assist public health policy makers to better understand the policy's intentions, scope, and potential effects on public interest and support evidence-based public health regulations in the future.

AB  - This study extends the research of the third-person effect by examining the effect of time span of media message on perceptual and behavioral components of the third-person effect. Using a survey of Hong Kong residents, the study explores perceived media effect of the news coverage of a short- and a long-term issue and the predictor of intention to take action to reduce negative effect. The results revealed no third-person effect by the short-term messages and the reverse third-person effect (first-person effect) by the long-term messages. There was a significant difference in discrepancy between the perceived media effect on self and others (third-person perception) produced by the messages of the short- and long-term issue. The study also found that perceived media effect on self is a stronger predictor of intention to take action to reduce the negative effects of the short- and long-term issue than the third-person effect.

AB  - The aim of the study was to test the motivation and awareness variables of the I-change model as predictors of adolescent intention to go to bed earlier. Questionnaires regarding sleep related motivational and awareness variables were administered to 127 sleep restricted (determined by actigraphy) high school students (12-17 years old). The motivational variables positive attitudes towards sleep and parents setting wake time predicted higher intentions to go bed earlier. The awareness variable sleep related cues to action also predicted higher intentions to advance bedtime. Positive attitudes towards sleep partially mediated the effect of sleep related cues to action on intention to advance bedtime. Future sleep promotion programs should train adolescents to detect cues to go to bed earlier to increase their intentions to go to bed earlier. Adolescents should be assisted to develop positive attitudes towards sleep as to enhance their autonomous motivation to advance their bedtime.

TI  - Do the Ladies Run This Mutha? The Relationship between Political Rap and Black Feminist Attitudes
T2  - NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - HIP-HOP
AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College; a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women.

AB  - Racial segregation encourages members of historically advantaged groups to form negative intergroup attitudes, which then motivate practices of discrimination that sustain inequality and disadvantage. By implication, interventions designed to increase intergroup contact have been proposed as a means of reducing dominant group prejudices and promoting social change. In this article, we highlight another mechanism through which segregation shapes intergroup relations, namely, by inhibiting political solidarity between historically disadvantaged groups. Building on a field survey conducted in postapartheid South Africa, we demonstrate how challenging this form of segregation may reveal alternative mechanisms through which intergroup contact facilitates social change. Notably, we report evidence that positive contact with Black residents of an informal settlement in Pietermaritzburg was associated with Indian residents' support for political policies and forms of collective action that might improve conditions in that settlement. In addition, we show that such support was partly mediated by perceptions of collective discrimination.

AB  - The main objective of this cross-sectional study was to compare the self-reported depressive symptoms and physical activity (PA) levels among participants who performed self- nonexercising (NE), guided exercise (SGE), remotely supervised exercise (RSE), and face-to-face supervised exercise (FFE) during social distancing. Three hundred and forty-four individuals (>= 18 years and 67% women) answered a self-reported online survey that included questions related to the physical exercise practice (e.g., supervised and remote) during social distancing and questions about perceptions of depressive symptoms (Montgomery-angstrom sberg Depression Rating Scale-Self Rated [MADRS-S] scores) and metabolic equivalent task minutes per week (METs min center dot wk-1) of moderate- and vigorous-intensity PA, and total PA scores (International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Short Form) before and during social distancing. The RSE group (n=45) showed higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA than the SGE (n=146) and NE (n=109) groups. The RSE and FFE (n=44) groups showed higher METs of the total PA scores than the SGE and NE groups. The NE group showed higher MADRS-S scores than the other groups. Lower MADRS-S scores depend on the exercise practice and higher METs of vigorous-intensity PA depend on the supervised exercise practice. Thus, telehealth interventions can be implemented during the pandemic to enhance vigorous PA.

AB  - Two experiments tested the hypothesis that imagine-other and imagine-self perspective-taking have different implications for prejudice reduction when instantiated in intergroup exchanges characterized by the potential for evaluation. We reasoned that because imagine-other perspective-taking is more likely than imagine-self perspective-taking to lead individuals to an unproductive focus on how they themselves are evaluated, imagine-other perspective-taking would hinder prejudice reduction whereas imagine-self perspective-taking would not. Results across two different intergroup relationships were consistent with these predictions and further suggested that the negative implications of imagine-other perspective-taking were mediated by relative meta-stereotype activation, an index of the extent to which individuals focused more on how their own group was viewed than on their view of the outgroup. These findings highlight that considering how individuals' concerns with evaluation guide their thoughts and experiences during intergroup exchanges can help identify the likely effects of different intervention strategies in such contexts.

AB  - To better understand the role of local news in voters' opinions of candidates, we ask whether candidate coverage in local news sources readily activates race and gender stereotypes in voters' opinions of presidential primary candidates? We conduct an original content analysis of local newspaper coverage of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama during the 2008 presidential primary season. We code 1,849 news articles in 11 battleground and early primary states to evaluate how local news coverage frames issues of race and gender for each candidate. Then we utilize the 2008 Cooperative Campaign Analysis Project (CCAP) to match primary voters with their local news content. We find considerable variation in local news coverage of candidates' race and gender across states. While local news coverage frames Obama and Clinton in terms of race and gender issues, we find that race is covered more frequently. In addition, we find that as news coverage of gender issues increases, voters are not less likely to characterize Clinton as a strong leader. However, as local news focuses more readily on Obama's race, voters are less likely to consider him trustworthy. These findings illustrate the power of local news media to activate stereotypes related to race and gender.

AB  - Research suggests that positive intergenerational contact can improve young people's attitudes towards older adults. However, today's age-segregated society may not provide ample opportunities for positive contact between younger and older adults to occur on a regular basis. In three studies, we investigated whether the positive attitudinal outcomes associated with direct contact might also stem from a more indirect form of intergenerational relationship: extended contact. In Study 1 (N=70), extended contact was associated with more positive attitudes towards older adults even when controlling for direct intergenerational contact (contact frequency and contact quality). In Study 2 (N=110), the positive effects of direct and extended contact on young people's age-related attitudes were mediated by reductions in intergroup anxiety and ageing anxiety. The mediational effects of intergroup anxiety were replicated in Study 3 (N=95) and ingroup norms additionally emerged as a mediator of the positive effects of extended contact on young people's attitudes towards older adults. Discussion focuses on the implications for strategies aimed at tackling ageism.

AB  - Coherent development of theories of ethnopolitical conflict has been slow and scattered. Moreover, the role of communication has been seriously neglected. I theorize ethnopolitical conflict along two dimensions: the level in which the conflict is entered (macro state-level, mid civil society level, and individual level) and the type of communication most characteristic of the level (bargaining and negotiation, intergroup relations and intercultural communication, identity theories and deliberative processes). Additionally, the article makes the case for a social constructionist perspective on ethnicity, and develops a relationship between communication and ethnopolitical conflict. Finally, theories of communication are posed as mediators of social systems that couple the communication systems of two conflictive groups in order for them to increase commensurability.

KW  - ETHNOLINGUISTIC VITALITY
AB  - Ethnolinguistic Vitality Theory (EVT) asserts that status, demographic and institutional support (IS) factors make up the vitality of ethnolinguistic groups within intergroup relations. Specifically, IS factor refers to the extent to which a language group enjoys representation in the various institutions of a society, in particular, mass media, education, government services, industry, religion, culture and politics. However, some scholars suggest that EVT underestimates the strength of ethnic institutions. This article addresses the perceived IS among indigenous and mestizo students and perceived community support among indigenous students in Chiapas. The results show significant differences between indigenous perceived IS and community support. Based on this finding, we suggest that studies of ethnolinguistic vitality can be enriched by the use of new scales to measure ethnic groups' own institutions involved in fostering their native languages and traditions in contexts where the mainstream institutions do not give any formal or informal support.

AB  - Background: Traumatic experience can affect the individual's basic beliefs about the world as a predictable and safe place. One of the cornerstones in recovery from trauma is reestablishment of safety, connectedness, and the shattered schema of a worldview.
   Objective: This study explored the role of negatively changed worldview in the relationship between war-related traumatization and readiness for social reconstruction of intergroup relations in a post-conflict community measured by three processes: intergroup rapprochement, rebuilding trust, and need for apology. It was hypothesized that more traumatized people are less supportive of social reconstruction and that this relationship is mediated by the changed worldview.
   Method: The study included a community random sample of 333 adults in the city of Vukovar, Croatia, that was most devastated during the 1991-1995 war. Six instruments were administered: Stressful Events Scale, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, Changed Worldview Scale, and three scales measuring the post-conflict social reconstruction processes: Intergroup Rapprochement, Intergroup Trust and Need for Apology.
   Results: Mediation analyses showed that the worldview change fully mediated between traumatization and all three aspects of social reconstruction.
   Conclusions: In a population exposed to war traumatization the worldview change mediates post-conflict social recovery of community relations.

AB  - Introduction: This study examined the effects of experimentally manipulated social media exposure on adolescents' willingness and intention to use e-cigarettes.
   Aims and Methods: Participants were 135 adolescents of age 13-18 (52.6% female, mean age=15.3) in California. Participants viewed six social media posts online in a 2 (post source: peer or advertisement) x 2 (e-cigarette content exposure: heavy or light) between-subjects design. Analyses were weighted to population benchmarks. We examined adolescents' beliefs, willingness, and intention to use e-cigarettes in association with social media use intensity in daily life and with experimentally manipulated exposure to social media posts that varied by source (peer or advertisement) and content (e-cigarette heavy or light).
   Results: Greater social media use in daily life was associated with greater willingness and intention to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes, greater perceived norms, and lower perceived danger of e-cigarette use (all p-values <.01). In tests of the experimental exposures, heavy (vs. light) e-cigarette content resulted in greater intention (p=.049) to use e-cigarettes and more positive attitudes (p=.019). Viewing advertisements (vs. peer-generated posts) resulted in greater willingness and intention (p-values <.01) to use e-cigarettes, more positive attitudes (p=.003), and greater norm perceptions (p=.009). The interaction effect of post source by post content was not significant for any of the outcomes (all p-values >.529).
   Conclusions: Greater social media use and heavier exposure to advertisements and e-cigarette content in social media posts are associated with a greater risk for e-cigarette use among adolescents. Regulatory action is needed to prohibit sponsored e-cigarette content on social media platforms used by youth.

AB  - The present research tested the hypothesis that perceived men's feminisation can decrease heterosexual men's positive attitudes towards homosexuality because of their increased motivation to psychologically differentiate heterosexual men from gay men ' i.e. in order to restore ingroup distinctiveness. Study 1 (N = 173) manipulated perceptions of men's feminisation and showed that prompting participants with bogus evidence that men are becoming feminine decreased positive attitudes towards homosexuality. Furthermore, the extent to which heterosexual men reported increased psychological differentiation from gay men (both at the interpersonal and the intergroup levels) mediated the impact of perceived men's feminisation on attitudes towards homosexuality. Study 2 (N = 178) used a fully experimental approach and manipulated perceived biological differences between heterosexual and gay men in order to threaten or grant ingroup distinctiveness. The results revealed that perceived men's feminisation decreased positive attitudes towards homosexuality in the distinctiveness threat condition (i.e. when gay men were described as biologically similar to straight men), but increased positive attitudes both when ingroup distinctiveness was granted (i.e. when gay men were described as biologically different from straight men) and when it was not relevant (i.e. when the similarity of all human beings was salient). We discuss the relevance of these findings for masculinity norms, attitudes towards homosexuality, and the ingroup distinctiveness literature.

AB  - Physical attractiveness is an essential factor in consumers' evaluation processes during a service encounter. Using both experimental and field study designs, we demonstrate that a service representative's physical attractiveness affects consumer response (i.e., customer satisfaction, service quality perception, and likability of the service representative). Also, we find that a consumer's social distance perception between themselves and a service representative mediates the physical attractiveness effect on consumer response. Thus, this article is the first to demonstrate that social distance perception is an underlining mechanism of the physical attractiveness effect. Furthermore, findings from Studies 2 and 3 show that consumers' physical attractiveness and their attractiveness-ability belief moderate the physical attractiveness effect. Although contentious to some, our findings indicate that the recruitment of attractive representatives may be an effective business practice in service settings. However, managers should not regard consumers as a homogeneous group; self-perceived unattractive consumers may respond negatively to their service representative's physical attractiveness.

AB  - This study argues that research on advergames needs to better address the relationships between players' psychological characteristics and their behavioural responses. In this article, we present a theoretical model that explains the antecedents and consequences of players' transportation experience to have positive advergame outcomes. Our model demonstrates that three key psychological traits (sensation seeking, transportability and perceived interactivity) foster positive attitudes towards the featured brand in an advergame and intention to replay the game. The results also reveal that transportability is the most influential factor than others. Then, we show a mediation effect of transportation in the association between the psychological traits and desired advergame outcomes. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Objective To assess the knowledge and attitude toward epilepsy among the final and semi-final years medical students at University of Bahri. Methods An observational cross-sectional study was carried out at College of Medicine, University of Bahri. Self-administered questionnaires were applied to 228 medical students in the final and semi-final years. Results Sixty-three percent of students showed a high level of knowledge. Despite that 10.1% of the students do not know that atonic seizure is a type of epilepsy, 62.7% attributed the causes of epilepsy to psychological factors only, and 9.6% considered epilepsy is an untreatable disease. The majority of students are not aware that screaming is a manifestation of certain types of epilepsy. More than half of the students considered inserting something into the patient's mouth during the seizure will prevent tongue biting. Interestingly, a total of 8.3% of students thought that it is a demonic attack, whereas 34.6% of students thought the Holy Quran as an appropriate treatment for epilepsy (P = .026). Up to 77% of the students showed a positive attitude toward patients with epilepsy. However, 42.1% of students agreed that there should be some restrictions in sport and leisure activities for people who suffer from epilepsy, and 13.6% of students admitted they will not get married to someone with epilepsy. Significance Our study showed an overall relatively high level of knowledge toward epilepsy among medical students with a potentially positive attitude toward patients with the disease. However, there are still misconceptions of epilepsy in different aspects. This study showed some important facts for policymakers and key opinion leaders in curriculum preparation and training programs for medical schools which should be designed to increase knowledge and understanding of epilepsy among the medical students, not just the scientific knowledge but also discuss the social impact of epilepsy on a patient's life.

Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables. Conclusion One-fourth of the students demonstrated only low and moderate levels of knowledge, negative attitude and undesirable practices in preventing COVID-19. The implications suggesting various approaches to enhance KAP to moderate the spread of COVID-19 among the students were recommended to aid the higher educational institutions.

AB  - Past experiments have demonstrated that the cognitive broadening produced by positive emotions may extend to social contexts. Building on this evidence, we hypothesized that positive emotions triggered by thinking about Barack Obama may broaden and expand people's sense of self to include others. Results from an expressive-writing study demonstrated that African American college students prompted to write about Obama immediately prior to and after the 2008 presidential election used more plural self-references, fewer other-references, and more social references. Mediation analyses revealed that writing about Obama increased positive emotions, which in turn increased the likelihood that people thought in terms of more-inclusive superordinate categories (we and us rather than they and them). Implications of these findings for the role of positive emotions in perspective-taking and intergroup relations are considered.

AB  - Significant research depicts the implications of sport's role in racial formation located mainly in the 'Global North'. Yet, there has been less attention afforded to the related role of sport in the 'Global South', particularly in divided societies, where the consequences of sports' influence on ethno-racial relations, are also significant. This study relies on empirical evidence gathered during an in-depth exploration into the role of soccer and rugby in Fijian intergroup relations. Sport is analysed as an arena that not only plays host to ethno-racial groupings but one which is also instrumental in their maintenance and reimagining. In Fiji at least, the organisation and positioning of sport in popular culture and discourse means that it becomes an emblematic sphere, active in the reconfirmation and preservation of ethno-racial division. Through this discussion, this study contributes to sport and racial formation theory, widening the gaze to diverse and divided socio-cultural settings.

AB  - Stereotyping has always permeated inter-ethnic understanding, conflating knowledge with prejudice. The seventeenth century European image of the Cape indigenous peoples was bound by a sustained ideological bias. The so-called "echo chamber of the discourse of the Cape" captured the Cape Khoi as primitive beasts in a negation of Christian values, and meant that knowledge about the Cape Khoi did not actually advance (Coetzee). In this paper I show that the Dutchman Jan Willem van Grevenbroek, VOC clerk at the Cape from 1684 to 1694, did in fact challenge the prevailing European image about the Khoi, then commonly called "Hottentots." In a Latin letter, he positions himself against negative primitivism and interprets Khoi customs as authentically Christian. However, Grevenbroek thus risks being drawn into an oppositional discourse that limits the possibilities for renegotiating stereotypes (Hall; Matusitz). At the same time, he strategically demonstrates that the stereotype contains no inherent knowledge about the people and thus exploits one of the few possibilities to open ideological discourse up to renegotiation (Hall). Grevenbroek's position challenges the very notion of there ever having been a single, colonial discourse (White), which makes Grevenbroek a valuable voice in Cape history, post-colonial discourse, and the history of knowledge in South Africa and beyond.

AB  - Drawing on color psychology, two scenario-based experiments were conducted to investigate how hotel room colors affect consumer's affective responses, attitude, and booking intention. The moderating effects of trip purpose and consumer characteristic (environmental consciousness) were also examined. In Study 1, consumers demonstrated more positive attitude and higher booking intention for a hotel room that featured the cool color scheme than a room that featured the warm color scheme. Meanwhile, feeling of pleasure mediated the effect of hotel room color on booking intention. In Study 2, we found that consumers who are more environmental conscious demonstrated more positive attitude and higher booking intention for a hotel room featuring the green color than a room featuring the red color. Implications and future research are discussed.

AB  - The abundant dissemination of misinformation regarding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) presents another unprecedented issue to the world, along with the health crisis. Online social network (OSN) platforms intensify this problem by allowing their users to easily distort and fabricate the information and disseminate it farther and rapidly. In this paper, we study the impact of misinformation associated with a religious inflection on the psychology and behavior of the OSN users. The article presents a detailed study to understand the reaction of social media users when exposed to unverified content related to the Islamic community during the COVID-19 lockdown period in India. The analysis was carried out on Twitter users where the data were collected using three scraping packages, Tweepy, Selenium, and Beautiful Soup, to cover more users affected by this misinformation. A labeled dataset is prepared where each tweet is assigned one of the four reaction polarities, namely, E (endorse), D (deny), Q (question), and N (neutral). Analysis of collected data was carried out in five phases where we investigate the engagement of E, D, Q, and N users, tone of the tweets, and the consequence upon repeated exposure of such information. The evidence demonstrates that the circulation of such content during the pandemic and lockdown phase had made people more vulnerable in perceiving the unreliable tweets as fact. It was also observed that people absorbed the negativity of the online content, which induced a feeling of hatred, anger, distress, and fear among them. People with similar mindset form online groups and express their negative attitude to other groups based on their opinions, indicating the strong signals of social unrest and public tensions in society. The paper also presents a deep learning-based stance detection model as one of the automated mechanisms for tracking the news on Twitter as being potentially false. Stance classifier aims to predict the attitude of a tweet towards a news headline and thereby assists in determining the veracity of news by monitoring the distribution of different reactions of the users towards it. The proposed model, employing deep learning (convolutional neural network (CNN)) and sentence embedding (bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT)) techniques, outperforms the existing systems. The performance is evaluated on the benchmark SemEval stance dataset. Furthermore, a newly annotated dataset is prepared and released with this study to help the research of this domain.

AB  - Two pre-registered experiments (Total N = 822) explored the effect of economic inequality on social class stereotyping and the social mechanisms driving this relationship. In both experiments, participants were randomly assigned to a fictitious society with high or low levels of inequality and rated a wealthy and a poor individual on Vertical (i.e., assertiveness and competence) and Horizontal stereotype dimensions (i.e., friendliness and morality). We found that higher (versus lower) inequality caused both social classes to be perceived as more incompetent, immoral, and unfriendly, and the poor to be perceived as more unassertive. Moreover, we found that high (versus low) inequality caused stereotypes of the wealthy and poor to be more different on unique dimensions (i.e., in relation to the poor, the wealthy were stereotyped as more assertive, but also more unfriendly and immoral). Importantly, inequality affected the stereotype dimensions through distinct mechanisms. We found evidence of class-based categorization mediating the effect of inequality and social class stereotypes on the Vertical dimension, and evidence of negative intergroup relations (i.e., increased competition and reduced trust) explaining stereotypes on the Horizontal dimension. Further, we found that social class stereotypes influenced support for redistributive wealth policies. Our work contributes to the literature by identifying the mechanisms through which inequality affects perceptions of the social classes.

AB  - This study explored associations between disordered eating, barriers, and attitudes towards help-seeking. A total of 198 young women completed online questionnaires assessing eating pathology, attitudes towards seeking professional psychological help, and barriers to seeking help. Higher levels of self-reported eating pathology were associated with more positive attitudes toward seeking professional help and with greater perceptions of barriers to help-seeking. An inconsistent mediation model (with suppression effect) indicated young women with higher eating pathology perceived more barriers to seeking help, which were associated with less positive attitudes towards seeking help for psychological issues; however, when barriers were held constant, eating pathology was associated with more positive attitudes towards seeking help. Results from this study highlight the need to identify and reduce barriers that impede mental health service utilization among young women with disordered eating.

AB  - Three experiments integrated several theories in psychology and sociology to identify the conditions under which multiculturalism has positive versus negative effects on majority group members' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities. On the basis of social cognitive construal theories, we predicted and found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms by highlighting its broad goals reduced White Americans' prejudice toward ethnic minorities relative to a control condition, whereas construing multiculturalism in concrete terms by highlighting specific ways in which its goals can be achieved increased White Americans' prejudice relative to the same control (Experiments 1 and 2). Using social identity threat research, we found that construing multiculturalism in abstract terms decreased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity, whereas construing it in concrete terms increased the extent to which diversity was seen as threatening national identity; threat in turn fueled prejudice (Experiments 2 and 3). Perceivers' political orientation moderated the effects of multiculturalism construals on prejudicial attitudes and social distancing behavioral intentions (Experiment 3). Symbolic threat to national identity but not realistic threat to national resources mediated these effects. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate when multiculturalism leads to positive versus negative intergroup outcomes, why, and how political orientation shapes prejudice and behavioral intentions toward ethnic minorities.

TI  - Elite stigmatization of the unemployed: The association between framing and public attitudes
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - This paper uses a multi-methods approach to explore the social psychological construction of stigma towards the unemployed. Study 1a uses thematic analysis to explore frames used by political elites in speeches at U.K. national party conferences between 1996 and 2016 (n = 43); in study 1b, we track the usage of these frames in six national newspapers (n = 167,723 articles) over the same period showing an increase in the use of negative frames. Study 1c shows that these are associated with national attitudes towards welfare recipients using the British Social Attitude Survey. We find the `Othering' frame is correlated with negative attitudes towards the unemployed, even when controlling for the unemployment rate. This finding supports the claim that social attitudes are related to frames produced in the political and media spheres. We provide theoretical integration between social representations theory and framing which affords development in both domains.

AB  - Despite the continuing, adverse impact of discrimination on the lives of racial and ethnic minorities, the denial of discrimination is commonplace. Four experiments investigated the efficacy of perspective taking as a strategy for combating discrimination denial. Participants who adopted a Black or Latino target's perspective in an initial context were subsequently more likely to explicitly acknowledge the persistence of intergroup discrimination than were non-perspective takers (Experiments 1-3) or participants who adopted a White target's perspective (Experiment 1). Perspective taking also engendered more positive attitudes toward a social policy designed to redress intergroup inequalities (i.e., affirmative action), and this relationship was mediated by increased recognition of discrimination (Experiments 2a and 2b). Increased identification with the targeted outgroup, as reflected in automatic associations between the self and African Americans, was found to underlie the effect of perspective taking on sensitivity to discrimination (Experiment 3). The collective findings indicate that perspective taking can effectively combat discrimination denial. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined perceptions of institutional apologies related to past political violence and socio-emotional climate among victims and non-victims in Argentina (n=518), Chile (n=1,278), and Paraguay (n=1,172) based on quasi-representative samples. The perceptions of apology as sincere and efficient in improving intergroup relations were associated with a positive socio-emotional climate across the three nations. Victims evaluated apologies more positively and perceived a more positive socio-emotional climate compared to non-victims in Paraguay and Argentina, whereas the opposite was true in Chile where the government opposed the victims' leftist political orientation. The evaluations of apologies also mediated the effects of exposure to violence on the perception of socio-emotional climate, but these effects were moderated by the context. Together, these findings suggest that apologies reinforce positive sociopolitical climate, and that, personal experience of victimization is an important factor determining these effects.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) prepares health students to become collaboration-ready healthcare professionals. Assessing students' baseline attitudes toward IPE and collaborative practice is essential to inform development of IPE curricula. Kuwait University Health Sciences Center (HSC) is early in its IPE journey but is planning to join the broader global movement toward IPE. A cross-sectional survey was conducted to explore the attitudes of HSC students from Faculties of Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmacy, and Allied Health Sciences toward collaborative practice and IPE at early and late stages of study. A total of 770 students completed the survey (81.1% response rate). Students expressed positive attitudes toward interprofessional healthcare teams and IPE (median [IQR] overall attitudes were rated 4.0 [1.0] and 4.0 [2.0], respectively, on a scale of 5). Overall attitudes toward both scales were significantly more positive among pharmacy students than students from other faculties (p < .001). Final-year students reported more positive attitudes toward healthcare teams than early- and middle-year students, while early- and final-year students expressed more positive attitudes toward IPE than middle-year students (p < .001). There were no significant differences in overall attitudes between female and male students toward the two scales (p > .05). These findings have implications for engaging students from different professions in IPE initiatives.

AB  - The prosperity of inclusion of students with disabilities largely rest on the attitudes of mainstream teachers. Few studies explore the relationship among school climate, teachers' attitude on inclusion and teachers' efficacy in China. This study surveyed 266 general teachers in China to understand the role of teachers' efficacy on inclusive education between school climate and teachers' attitude. The results indicated that teachers hold positive attitudes towards inclusion on average, especially in the dimension of affection. Additionally, school climate, teachers' efficacy and teachers' attitude were significantly associated, and the mediating effect of teachers' efficacy between school climate and teachers' attitude were proved by mediation analyses. The findings suggested that creating more inclusive school climate and improving general teachers' knowledge and skills on inclusive education, especially the skills on collaboration with others, which could contribute to promote more positive attitude on inclusive education of general teachers.

AB  - With the severity of the COVID-19 outbreak, we characterize the nature of the growth trajectories of counties in the United States using a novel combination of spectral clustering and the correlation matrix. As the United States and the rest of the world are still suffering from the effects of the virus, the importance of assigning growth membership to counties and understanding the determinants of the growth is increasingly evident. For the two communities (faster versus slower growth trajectories) we cluster the counties into, the average between-group correlation is 88.4% whereas the average within-group correlations are 95.0% and 93.8%. The average growth rate for one group is 0.1589 and 0.1704 for the other, further suggesting that our methodology captures meaningful differences between the nature of the growth across various counties. Subsequently, we select the demographic features that are most statistically significant in distinguishing the communities: number of grocery stores, number of bars, Asian population, White population, median household income, number of people with the bachelor's degrees, and population density. Lastly, we effectively predict the future growth of a given county with a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network using three social distancing scores. The best-performing model achieves a median out-of-sample R-2 of 0.6251 for a four-day ahead prediction and we find that the number of communities and social distancing features play an important role in producing a more accurate forecasting. This comprehensive study captures the nature of the counties' growth in cases at a very micro-level using growth communities, demographic factors, and social distancing performance to help government agencies utilize known information to make appropriate decisions regarding which potential counties to target resources and funding to. Supplementary materials for this article, including a standardized description of the materials available for reproducing the work, are available as an online supplement.

AB  - Research adopting the ideological-conflict hypothesis indicates that low religiosity, nonbelief, and antireligious sentiments predict prejudice toward ideological opponents. How to understand this, from an individual differences perspective, given that nonbelievers are typically open-minded and low in authoritarianism? We investigated, among 422 UK adults, social distance from antiliberals (antigay activists), fundamentalists, and religionists of major world religions (Catholicism, Islam, and Buddhism). Nonbelievers showed prejudice toward all religious targets - but not toward an ethnic outgroup (Chinese). Furthermore, antireligious sentiment implied (1) valuing rationality and, in turn, social distance from fundamentalists and (2) low empathy and low belief in the benevolence of others and the world and, in turn, social distance from religionists. Finally, (3) valuing liberty predicted social distance from antiliberals but failed to mediate the effect of antireligious sentiment. Though general processes (e.g., perceived threat) explain all prejudices, specific individual differences seem to distinguish nonbelievers' and believers' prejudice toward each other.

AB  - Non-compliance with social distancing (SD) measures clearly has negative effects on both public health and post-pandemic economic recovery. However, little is as yet known about people's views on and factors influencing their behavioral intentions toward SD measures. This study draws on moral disengagement theory and the norm-activation model to investigate mechanisms that promote or hinder compliance with SD measures. A longitudinal research approach was adopted to compare changes in the main factors over three periods of the COVID-19 pandemic in England (UK). The results reveal significant differences between the three periods regarding intentions to comply with SD measures, altruistic value, moral obligation and moral disengagement, with no significant change in ascription of responsibility. Residents showed the strongest intentions to comply with SD measures during the first national lockdown, with the highest moral obligation and lowest moral disengagement levels, compared with the lowest intention to comply during the first re-opening period. Altruistic value is important in promoting moral obligation and compliance with SD measures, whereas the predictive powers of ascription of responsibility and moral disengagement were weaker than expected. These findings offer guidance to policymakers and researchers in developing more effective policies and public communication strategies. The results suggest that communication is key to normalizing SD compliance, which can be achieved most effectively by fostering residents' altruistic value and moral considerations. Particular attention must be paid to re-opening periods between lockdowns, with clear messages to remind residents of prosocial aspects of SD compliance and public health. In addition to appropriate communication and education, technologies such as apps, QR codes and contactless shopping settings may also be used to facilitate compliance with SD measures.

AB  - Gastrointestinal nematodes present a major threat to the health and welfare of equids worldwide. Anthelmintic resistance (AR) is increasingly reported and challenges effective control in horses and ponies in many regions. The use of faecal worm egg counts (FECs) to support targeted treatment (FEC-TT) and targeted selective treatment (FEC-TST) has been promoted as an effective deworming strategy that may prolong the useful life of anthelmintics and reduce the costs associated with parasite control. However, treatment applied at set intervals or on pre-determined dates remains common. A structural equation model was developed to identify factors influencing the uptake of FEC-directed treatment strategies, based on well-established socio-psychological theories of intentional health-related behaviours: the Theory of Planned Behaviour and the Health Belief Model. More than 850 valid responses were received from horse owners in the UK via an online survey. The intention to use FECs prior to deworming was not influenced by the perceived risk of anthelmintic resistance or that of gastrointestinal nematode infection but was positively influenced by a negative attitude towards anthelmintics, a positive attitude towards FECs, an increase in social pressure (e.g. significant others think the respondent should use FECs) and an increase in perceived control over their deworming programme. The results were consistent with a similar study conducted on FEC-TT in cattle in Belgium. An increase in respondents' self-perceived level of knowledge significantly increased the intention to use FECs via mediating factors. These results suggest that knowledge transfer activities aimed at increasing awareness and understanding of sustainable nematode control practices may be more effective at encouraging behaviour change than emphasising the dangers of nematodes and AR, which had limited influence on behaviour intention in this study population.

Two experiments were conducted to explore the effects of media type, exposure type and placement on attitudes towards advertisements and purchase intention. The first experiment involved two factors: media type (still pictures vs. motion pictures) and placement of advertisements (top vs. bottom). The results for 192 participants indicated that bottom-located motion picture mobile advertisements elicited more positive attitudes regarding advertisements and purchase intention. The second experiment was a between-subjects experiment examining two factors, media type (still pictures vs. motion pictures) and exposure type (banner vs. pop-up). The results for 180 participants indicated that pop-up motion picture mobile advertisements elicited more positive attitudes and purchase intention. The findings and limitations of this study are both explained from the perspectives of advertising studies and media features.

AB  - We extend investigations of the impact of the content of video contact with an individual with schizophrenia on stigma reduction. We examine whether differential impacts persist over a 2-week period and the extent to which they are mediated by perceived similarity and feelings of empathy and/or sympathy.
   We used a randomized control trial wherein participants were exposed to a video in which an individual described his recovery from schizophrenia, or the same person described acute symptoms of schizophrenia, or a no-video control condition. Outcomes included impressions of and preferred social distance to the person in the video and people in general with schizophrenia and well as perceptions of similarity and feelings of sympathy and empathy. We also measured an overt behaviour, seating distance, at 2-week follow-up.
   The recovery-focused material was generally more effective in improving impressions and reducing preferred level of social distance. Although the symptom-focused video resulted in great sympathy for the person, this did not translate into positive impressions or reduced social distance. Mediational analyses yielded findings consistent with the benefits of the recovery video being mediated by increased perceptions of similarity and lower feelings of sympathy. Exposure to the recovery-focused video resulted in less anxiety in anticipation of meeting the person in the video relative to the control condition.
   Video contact emphasizing potential for recovery from schizophrenia was more effective in reducing stigmatizing responses than contact highlighting acute symptoms. Increased sympathy does not necessarily translate into reductions in stigma.

AB  - This study is linked to research into narrative persuasion and the techniques used to reduce rejection of stigmatized groups. Upper-secondary school students were assigned to one of two conditions: viewing a film that arouses empathy toward immigrants or seeing a film that underscores positive intergroup contact. One month before viewing the films the participants completed the Modern Racism Scale. After they viewed the films, researchers measured their identification with ingroup and outgroup characters and their attitudes toward immigration. Results showed that viewing the empathyarousing film caused greater identification with the outgroup characters, which in turn induced more positive attitudes toward immigration, but only when previous prejudice was low or moderate. We discuss findings in the context of narrative persuasion research.

TI  - Prejudice Against Immigrants Symptomizes a Larger Syndrome, Is Strongly Diminished by Socioeconomic Development, and the UK Is Not an Outlier: Insights From the WVS, EVS, and EQLS Surveys

AB  - Public attitudes toward immigrants in the UK, especially prejudice against them, form a strong theme in retrospective media postmortems emphasizing the uniqueness of Brexit, yet similarly hostile public opinion on immigrants forms a recurrent theme in populist politics in many European Union nations. Indeed, if UK residents are not uniquely hostile, then the UK's exit from the EU may be only the first symptom of proliferating conflicts over immigration that will plague EU nations in future years. A well-established symptom (or consequence) of prejudice-aversion to outgroups as a neighbors-shows that prejudice against immigrants, other races, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, and Gypsies are all relatively low in the UK. This is as expected from the general decline of prejudice and social distance with socioeconomic development, demonstrated here in broad perspective across many countries. Indeed, UK residents are about as prejudiced against each of these ethno-religious outgroups as are their peers in other advanced EU and English-speaking nations, and much less prejudiced than their peers in less prosperous countries. Confirmatory factor analysis supports the view that a single latent ethno-religious prejudice generates all these specific prejudices, so it is not specific experiences with any one of these groups, nor their specific attributes, that are the wellspring of this deep-seated underlying prejudice. Replication using other measures of prejudice and another cross-national dataset confirms these findings. Data are from the pooled World and European Values Surveys (over 450,000 individuals, 300 surveys, and 100 nations for this analysis) and from the well-known European Quality of Life surveys. Analysis is by descriptive, multilevel (random intercept, fixed effects), and structural equation methods.

AB  - Migration has become increasingly discussed as intangible and uncontrollable and hence as a risk to receiving societies. In the past years, strong public concern and negative attitudes toward immigration have been seen across European countries. The mass media are oftentimes suggested to contribute to such concerns. But mediated risks of immigration do not affect all citizens to an equal extent. This study considers the relationship between information about migration as found in mass media and immigration attitudes as a function of individuals' risk propensity. Our results suggest that tangible risk frames have an effect on immigration attitudes, while abstract risks do not. Tangible risks are statistically not likely to be personally experienced by most people. Yet, they are often framed as having the potential to negatively impact a person's community or wellbeing. Risk propensity played no role in moderating such effects.

AB  - Background Radiographs are an essential part of most clinical dental examinations and diagnoses. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and attitudes of parents towards dental radiographs for their children. Methods A 21-item questionnaire, covering parental level of radiation knowledge and socio-demographics was applied. Sliding scales were used to assess attitude towards dental radiographs. Results There were 1467 questionnaires distributed between five primary schools in the Perth (Western Australia) metropolitan area, with 309 surveys (21%) returned for collection. Most parents displayed a low level of knowledge, but had a positive attitude towards dental radiographs. Parents with children who have previously had dental radiographs perceived dental radiographs as good', useful' and pleasant'. A higher level of education and parents with children who have previously had radiographs were significantly associated with a higher level of knowledge about dental radiography. Parents who had higher scores on questions assessing radiation knowledge were more likely to perceive dental radiographs as safe' and beneficial'. Conclusions Most parents have a positive attitude towards dental radiographs on their children. However, the majority of parents lack knowledge regarding dental radiography, especially regarding the risks involved.

AB  - The hierarchy of effects (HOE) model is often used in planning mass-reach communication campaigns to promote health, but has rarely been empirically tested. This paper examines Canada's 30 year ParticipACTION campaign to promote physical activity (PA). A cohort from the nationally representative 1981 Canada Fitness Survey was followed up in 1988 and 2002-2004. Modelling of these data tested whether the mechanisms of campaign effects followed the theoretical framework proposed in the HOE. Campaign awareness was measured in 1981. Outcome expectancy, attitudes, decision balance and future intention were asked in 1988. PA was assessed at all time points. Logistic regression was used to sequentially test mediating and moderating variables adjusting for age, sex and education. No selection bias was observed; however, relatively fewer respondents than non-respondents smoked or were underweight at baseline. Among those inactive at baseline, campaign awareness predicted outcome expectancy which in turn predicted positive attitude to PA. Positive attitudes predicted high decision balance, which predicted future intention. Future intention mediated the relationship between decision balance and sufficient activity. Among those sufficiently active at baseline, awareness was unrelated to outcome expectancy and inversely related to positive attitude. These results lend support to the HOE model, in that the effects of ParticipACTION's serial mass media campaigns were consistent with the sequential rollout of its messages, which in turn was associated with achieving an active lifestyle among those initially insufficiently active. This provides support to an often-used theoretical framework for designing health promotion media campaigns.

AB  - We study partisan differences in Americans' response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Political leaders and media outlets on the right and left have sent divergent messages about the severity of the crisis, which could impact the extent to which Republicans and Democrats engage in social distancing and other efforts to reduce disease transmission. We develop a simple model of a pandemic response with heterogeneous agents that clarifies the causes and consequences of heterogeneous responses. We use location data froma large sample of smartphones to showthat areaswithmore Republicans engaged in less social distancing, controlling for other factors including public policies, population density, and local COVID cases and deaths. We then present new survey evidence of significant gaps at the individual level between Republicans and Democrats in self-reported social distancing, beliefs about personal COVID risk, and beliefs about the future severity of the pandemic.

AB  - Aims: Several states in the U.S. have legalized cannabis for recreational or medical uses. In this context, cannabis edibles have drawn considerable attention after adverse effects were reported. This paper investigates Twitter users' perceptions concerning edibles and evaluates the association edibles-related tweeting activity and local cannabis legislation.
   Methods: Tweets were collected between May 1 and July 31, 2015, using Twitter API and filtered through the eDrugTrends/Twitris platform. A random sample of geolocated tweets was manually coded to evaluate Twitter users' perceptions regarding edibles. Raw state proportions of Twitter users mentioning edibles were ajusted relative to the total number of Twitter users per state. Differences in adjusted proportions of Twitter users mentioning edibles between states with different cannabis legislation status were assesed via a permutation test.
   Results: We collected 100,182 tweets mentioning cannabis edibles with 26.9% (n = 26,975) containing state-level geolocation. Adjusted percentages of geolocated Twitter users posting about edibles were significantly greater in states that allow recreational and/or medical use of cannabis. The differences were statistically significant. Overall, cannabis edibles were generally positively perceived among Twitter users despite some negative tweets expressing the unreliability of edible consumption linked to variability in effect intensity and duration.
   Conclusion: Our findings suggest that Twitter data analysis is an important tool for epidemiological monitoring of emerging drug use practices and trends. Results tend to indicate greater tweeting activity about cannabis edibles in states where medical THC and/or recreational use are legal. Although the majority of tweets conveyed positive attitudes about cannabis edibles, analysis of experiences expressed in negative tweets confirms the potential adverse effects of edibles and calls for educating edibles-naive users, improving edibles labeling, and testing their THC content.

TI  - Knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards COVID-19 and associated factors among adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - UNIVERSITY
AB  - Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is currently the critical health problem of the globe, including Ethiopia. Visitors of healthcare facilities are the high-risk groups due to the presence of suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the healthcare setting. Increasing the knowledge, attitude, and practices towards COVID-19 prevention among hospital visitors are very important to prevent transmissions of the pandemic despite the lack of evidence remains a challenge in Ethiopia. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the status of knowledge, attitude, and preventive practice towards COVID-19 and associated factors among hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia.
   Methods A facility-based cross-sectional study design was employed during August 1 to 30, 2020 from randomly selected 404 adult hospital visitors in South Gondar Zone Hospitals, Northwest Ethiopia. The data was collected using interviewer-administered questionnaire. The outcome of this study was good or poor knowledge, positive or negative attitude and good or poor preventive practice towards COVID-19. Three different binary logistic regression models with 95% CI (Confidence interval) was used for data analysis. For each mode, bivariable analysis (crude odds ratio [COR]) and multivariable analysis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]) was used during data analysis. From the bivariable analysis, variables with a p-value <0.25 were retained into the multivariable logistic regression analysis. From the multivariable logistic regression analysis, variables with a significance level of p-value <0.05 were taken as factors independently associated with knowledge, attitude and preventive practices towards COVID-19.
   Main findings About 69.3% of the respondents had good knowledge, 62.6% had a positive attitude, and 49.3% had good preventive practice towards the prevention of COVID-19. We found that factors significantly associated with good knowledge about COVID-19 were educational status who can read and write (AOR = 2.78; 95%CI: 1.18-6.56) and college and above (AOR = 6.15; 95%CI: 2.18-17.40), and use of social media (AOR = 2.96; 95%CI: 1.46-6.01). Furthermore, factors significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 includes the presence of chronic illnesses (AOR = 5.00; 95%CI; 1.71-14.67), training on COVID-19 (AOR = 3.91; 95%CI: 1.96-7.70), and peer/family as a source of information (AOR = 2.45; 95%CI: 1.06-5.63). Being a student (AOR = 7.70; 95%CI: 1.15-15.86) and participants who had a good knowledge on COVID-19 (AOR = 4.49; 95%CI: 2.41-8.39) were factors significantly associated with good practice towards COVID-19.
   Conclusion We found that knowledge, attitude, and preventive practices towards prevention of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors were low. Therefore, we recommended that different intervention strategies for knowledge, attitude and preventive practices are urgently needed to control the transmission of COVID-19 among adult hospital visitors. Health education of those who could not read and write about COVID-19 knowledge issues and advocating use of social media that transmit messages about COVID-19 are highly encouraged to increase the good knowledge status of adult hospital visitors. Furthermore, providing training about COVID-19 prevention methods and using various sources of information about COVID-19 will help for improving positive attitude towards COVID-19 prevention, whereas for increasing the status of good preventive practices towards COVID-19, improving the good knowledge about COVID-19 of adult hospital visitors are essential.

AB  - In the present study, we examined the associations between self-perceptions of attractiveness, contingencies of self-worth and the attitude toward the use of physical attractiveness as an influence strategy (adonization) among young women. Five hundred and eighty-seven women aged 18-35 years assessed their self-perceptions of attractiveness, contingencies of self-worth, and the attitude toward adonization. Structural equation modeling demonstrated that self-perceptions of physical and social attractiveness predicted a positive attitude toward adonization. External contingencies of self-worth predicted less positive perceptions of attractiveness, while internal contingencies of self-esteem predicted more positive self-perceptions of physical attractiveness. Additionally, external contingencies of self-worth predicted a positive attitude toward adonization. Self-perceptions of physical and social attractiveness mediated between external contingencies of self-esteem and attitude toward adonization.

AB  - Background: Malnutrition is a debilitating and highly prevalent condition in acute hospital settings especially in older person; however international literature revealed negative attitudes in providing nutritional care among nurses and health professionals. Few studies have investigated attitudes towards nutritional care among nursing students, there are no data regarding the Italian context.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore nursing students' attitudes towards nutritional care in older people.
   Design: A multicentre cross-sectional survey incorporating a pre post design.
   Setting and participants: A convenience sample of nursing students of the bachelor's degree in Nursing in the three hospitals were recruited.
   Methods: Nursing students completed "The Staff Attitudes to Nutritional Nursing Care Geriatric Scale (Italian version) (SANN_G(ITA) scale)"; first year students completed the scale before (TO) and after (T1) lectures about nutrition and nutritional care.
   Results: 245 students were enrolled (response rate 88.4%). The overall score of sample attitudes was Median (Me) = 66 (IQR = [60; 72]); at the variation of the year the neutral attitudes are prevalent with a significant tendency to increase the positive attitudes (p < .003) and there is a statistically significant difference (p < .05) in all dimensions except the "habits" dimension "(P = .1126). After two months from the end of the lessons regarding nutritional care there is an increase in subjects with neutral attitudes and a decrease in those with negative attitudes (P = .05).
   Conclusions: This study revealed a progressive improvement of the attitudes during the three-year course, underling the importance of nutritional contents provided; understanding the most critical aspects about nutritional care can be helpful in understanding in which areas university education should be improved, in order to train nurses able to assess and face with each patients' assistance need.

AB  - Objectives: To examine racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19-like illness (CLI) during March - August 2020 in New York City, and to test effect modification by age, nativity, and working from home vs outside the home, and mediation via social distancing behavior.
   Design: Analysis of the monthly Community Health Survey datasets.
   Setting: New York City.
   Participants: 5,305 adults living in New York City.
   Methods: Prevalence of having CLI was compared among racial and ethnic groups using multivariable log-linear regression. Stratified and causal mediation analyses were conducted to test effect modification and mediation, respectively.
   Main Outcome Measures: A binary indicator of having new onset of CLI in the past 30 days.
   Results: Overall percentage of CLI decreased from 25% during March-May to 14% during June-August. In both periods, there was no increased prevalence of CLI among Black or Latino New Yorkers compared with White New Yorkers. However, in stratified analyses, Latino vs White New Yorkers had 2.05 times (95%CI=1.09, 3.83) higher prevalence of CLI among adults working outside the home. Mediation via social distancing was not statistically significant.
   Conclusions: I xcess burden of CLI among Latino adults working outside the home underscores inequitable impacts of COVID-19 in New York City.

AB  - This study examines nonsmokers' responses to antismoking messages. Informed by construal-level theory (CLT), it investigates whether and how evidence type (narrative vs. non-narrative) and social distance might interact to influence nonsmokers' attitudes toward others' quitting smoking and intentions to persuade others to quit smoking. Results of a controlled experiment (N=281) revealed an approximately significant two-way interaction pertaining to attitudes. Simple effects analyses revealed that narratives produced less-favorable attitudes toward others' quitting smoking than nonnarratives when participants thought about their best friend. Yet, there was no difference in attitudes between narratives and nonnarratives when participants thought about socially distant others. The results also indicated that nonnarratives overpowered narratives to influence participants' attitudes toward others' quitting smoking. Moreover, social distance had a consistent impact on their risk beliefs, such that they perceive fewer health risks of their close friends than an average college student. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

AB  - In times of crisis, the media play a crucial role in offering people information and updates related to the ongoing events. Thus, the media implicitly shape public opinion on the issues they cover and, as a result, influence public attitudes and behaviors. In this context, this paper aims at analyzing the media coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, by means of quantitative content analysis (N=1511) conducted on both television and online news stories released during March 18-31 2020, this study sheds light on the agenda-setting effects of the media and the phenomenon known as intermedia agenda-setting. Main results show that, in spring 2020, both television and online news stories extensively covered COVID-19 topics, focusing on domestic issues such as decisions taken by the authorities in order to manage the pandemic, effects of the virus, and statistics. Furthermore, results show a relatively high intermedia agenda-setting effect within the Romanian media environment. Content published online (either in the form of social media content or online stories) is frequently "borrowed" and cited in both online and television news stories, leading us to the idea that digital media might have become mainstream information sources.

AB  - Much research has demonstrated the power of social norms to affect proenvironmental behavior and conservation-related attitudes and beliefs in traditional offline social contexts. With the emergence of social media and citizen science platforms that allow for socially coordinated conservation efforts at scale comes a need to better understand the influence of social norms in online contexts. The present experiment explored effects of norm violations on impression formation and intergroup judgments within the context of Habitat Network, a socially networked mapping application where users create and share virtual representations (maps) of their properties. Results revealed that when participants viewed a map depicting the violation of a strongly held group normnamely, the presence of an outdoor (vs. indoor) pet catthey judged the map owner as significantly less likely to engage in a variety of proenvironmental behaviors. Importantly, this effect emerged despite evidence that the owner was already engaging in various sustainable practices. Moreover, the effect was mediated by the perceived quality of wildlife habitat represented by the map and moderated by participants' group membership status (as a cat owner) in a manner consistent with theories of impression formation and intergroup judgments. We discuss implications for social cognition and intergroup relations in proenvironmental online contexts.

AB  - Partisan effects on media consumption have been widely documented, with considerable attention given to partisan influences on selective exposure. Although researchers have debated the degree to which selective exposure drives media consumption in general and partisan consumption of the news in particular, one of the hypothesized mechanisms linked to this phenomenon seems inherently plausible: Exposure to disliked news coverage can generate psychological discomfort. The physiological effects of this hypothesized discomfort were examined by determining how political partisanship influences release of the stress hormone, cortisol, following exposure to news coverage of a presidential election. The study was conducted in the week following the 2008 election. Participants were students at a large, mostly conservative state university who read news coverage about the election victory of Barack Obama or a set of control news stories. Results indicated that conservative political identification was associated with more negative and less positive emotional responses and with a spike in salivary cortisol levels. Contrary to predictions, however, the cortisol spikes appeared to operate independent of self-reported emotional distress. The implications of these results are considered as they relate to selective exposure and the physical health of partisans who follow political news.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals were advised to adhere to social distancing guidelines limiting physical interpersonal contact. Humans have a suite of adaptations to satisfy belonging needs while avoiding diseased conspecifics. Competition between motivational systems may explain adherence and resistance to social distancing guidelines and how technologically mediated interactions further shape these decisions. This study is a preregistered analysis of data in a representative sample collected during the pandemic investigating how individual differences in affiliative and pathogen-avoidant motives predict interest in physical interactions (N = 2409). Germ aversion predicted disinterest in physical interactions and need to belong predicted interest. Additional analyses revealed technology use satisfied belonging motives that unexpectedly heightened interest in physical contact. Exploratory analyses further indicate that internet speed was similarly associated with greater interest in physical interactions. We frame these results through a competing fundamental social motives framework and discuss how to address future pandemics effectively.

AB  - Frontline employees must believe in corporate social responsibility (CSR) programs if they are to achieve their goals. In light of this, the current study explores which organizational capabilities and factors foster employees' positive attitudes toward CSR. Past research shows that organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) positively influences CSR effectiveness. We hypothesize that the organizational capabilities of frugality and polychronicity and the organizational factors of servant leadership and job satisfaction facilitate OCB. To test the proposed model, we collected data from a sample of 246 frontline employees across different industries. We rely on structural equation modeling to test our hypotheses. Findings suggest that firms should develop organizational values and managerial processes oriented to cautiously administer resources, practice corporate frugality, and develop polychronicity as core factors to cultivate OCB. These practices support positive attitudes toward CSR programs among frontline employees. The proposed moderating effects of managers' servant leadership and employees' job satisfaction receive support from the analysis. When managers inspire employees to serve internal and external customers, the positive relationship between OCB and CSR becomes stronger. Furthermore, when frontline employees feel satisfied with their jobs, the relationship between OCB and CSR strengthens. Post-hoc analysis from the proposed model suggests that OCB mediates the relationship between polychronicity and CSR.

AB  - Advents of new technology have transformed how we currently view and use artificial intelligence (AI). Originally, AI was first developed to assist humans to complete tasks, but AI now takes on more social roles, such as functioning as a companion. However, little is known about how individuals view these different types of AI. Thus, the present study conducted an online experiment to explore people's perceptions about social AI vs. functional AI. Primary results suggest that individuals have more positive attitudes toward functional AI than social AI. Perceived usefulness of AI is found to have a mediation effect, suggesting functional AI, compared to social AI, leads to stronger perceived usefulness, which consequently fosters more positive attitudes and stronger perceived realism of AI. The results collectively suggest meaningful implications for human-AI communication and human-machine communication research.

AB  - In this paper, we reflect on 'scientific' governmental and media responses to Covid-19 in the UK, illuminating their negative impacts on complex and emergent touch forms/practices and people's related emotions. The scientisation of the pandemic led to the government initially placing the country in lockdown and enforcing social distancing. It thereby regulated and proscribed routine and normative touch practices in order to save lives. However, such strategies were not accompanied by an awareness that increased touch deprivation could be emotionally harmful, that lockdown could exacerbate abusive touch in the privatised familial domestic sphere, and that paid care-giver touch in other contexts, such as care homes for the elderly, could also be potentially lethal. These negative consequences are important for social workers to understand and appropriately respond to, as they disproportionately impact vulnerable and marginalised groups and are heightened for service users, who are frequently members of many disadvantaged groups simultaneously.

AB  - While extensive efforts have been made to harness benefit of computing technologies in education, little attention focuses on how such efforts lead to students' positive attitudes toward science and technology. Building on the technology acceptance model and motivation literature, the current study proposed that hands-on experiences with computing devices allow students to perceive their technology use as being useful and enjoyable, which in turn leads to positive attitudes toward science and technology in general. Data collected from a pedagogical intervention support our predictions regarding the role of utility perception and enjoyment. Furthermore, it is suggested that students' prior attitudes toward science and technology and the type of device used in the intervention influence perceived usefulness and enjoyment of classroom computing. When using education-specific devices, students' prior attitudes were positively associated with postintervention attitudes as well as with utility perception and enjoyment. When using general-purpose devices, however, students' prior attitudes were not related to those outcomes. These results imply that distribution of technologies to schools may improve attitudes toward science and technology, particularly in populations that have been underrepresented in the fields of science and technology thus far.

AB  - Because rats are commensal organisms that depend on human activities for food, shifts in human behavior will have pronounced effects on local rat populations. In the spring of 2020, social distancing measures were implemented globally to curtail the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This presented a unique opportunity to obtain information regarding the immediate effects of shifts in human behavior on rat populations in a variety of countries. In response to increased sightings of rats in the USA that were reported in American media, we analyzed the changes in the number of public service calls in Tokyo, Japan. We found that the number of calls increased after the implementation of social distancing measures, suggesting that rat sightings had also increased in Tokyo. We then surveyed the changes in the business activities of pest management professionals in the USA, Canada, and Tokyo. We found that the activities were increased in 50 to 60% of the respondents from the USA and Canada. In contrast, 60 to 70% of the respondents from Tokyo answered that their activities were not changed. These results implied that, following the implementation of social distancing measures, rat infestations increased in North America, but not in Tokyo. The survey also suggested that roof rats were considered to be the predominant rodent species in Tokyo. This may account for the limited infestations in Tokyo because roof rats are more sedentary than brown rats. Taken together, our findings suggest that social distancing measures differentially affected rat populations in North America and Tokyo.

AB  - Social network sites (SNSs) provide new avenues for self-expression and connectivity, and they have considerable potential to strengthen social capital and psychological well-being. SNSs have consequently become deeply rooted in people's daily lives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, e-learning has become a dominant learning modality to maintain social distancing. Because of the excellent connectivity provided by Internet platforms, SNSs can be leveraged as collaborative learning tools to enhance learning performance. However, conflicts may emerge when extending the socializing function to learning; thus, this topic merits in-depth investigation. One potential reason for the conflicts is the various types of overload caused by the system features, information, communication, and social aspects that users experience, leading to negative emotional responses, such as social network fatigue. Although SNS overloads have been extensively studied, most of these studies were conducted from the perspective of SNSs as platforms for socializing, and the overloads were treated as linear and independent. We apply multi-criteria decision-making tools to bridge the research gaps. Specifically, we recruited 15 active Facebook learning community members as an expert panel under the saturation principle. After extensive pairwise comparisons between the primary constructs and further matrix calculations, our significant research findings include antecedents to social network fatigue and their causal effects, representing a valuable complement to conventional structural equation modeling-approaches. We also discuss the theoretical and practical implications of the study.

AB  - The present work examines the acknowledgment of past ingroup victimization by adversary outgroup leaders as an effective means to promote intergroup trust. More specifically, through an experimental study we demonstrated that Israeli-Jewish participants who were exposed to Palestinian leaders' messages acknowledging the Jews' suffering from anti-Semitic persecutions (past victimization condition) displayed more trust toward outgroup leaders than participants who were exposed to messages acknowledging the Jews' sufferings from the ongoing conflict (present victimization condition) and participants who were exposed to a control message condition. Further, trust mediated the relationship between acknowledgment of past victimization by rivals and forgiveness toward the outgroup as a whole. The implications of these results for restoring fractured intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - China's economic liberalization reforms and quest for global status have raised concerns over ideological inconsistencies (the adoption of market economy is discrepant from China's avowed belief in socialism) and image problems (the world that China wants to embrace perceives her as a menace). Official media discourse makes frequent reference to globalization and uses it to manage the inconsistencies and to bolster China's global image. These discursive functions, though related to media discourse's meaning-making functions, are sufficiently distinct from the latter to merit their own analysis. This article provides a theoretical discussion of the functions derived from social-psychological research on inconsistency justification and intergroup relations, with illustrative examples from relevant articles published in the People's Daily between 1996 and 2006.

AB  - The potential of the camera framing, or shot-size, semiotic resource to encode meanings related to social distance has been recognized for some time. This study seeks to bring this resource into the remit of systematic analysis. Data are taken from screen measurements of portrayals of social actors in news programming produced by two national broadcasters, NHK in Japan and the BBC in the UK. Results for these two media outlets are compared and an attempt made to place the results in a meaningful cultural context. Analysis focuses on NHK's images and the less familiar Japanese media system.

AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research.

AB  - The communication of group-based anger in intergroup conflict is often associated with destructive conflict behavior. However, we show that communicating group-based anger toward the out-group can evoke empathy and thus reduce intergroup conflict. This is because it stresses the value of maintaining a positive long-term intergroup relationship, thereby increasing understanding for the situation (in contrast to the communication of the closely related emotion of contempt). Three experiments demonstrate that the communication of group-based anger indeed reduces destructive conflict intentions compared with (a) a control condition (Experiments 1-2), (b) the communication of group-based contempt (Experiment 2), and (c) the communication of a combination of group-based anger and contempt (Experiments 2-3). Moreover, results from all three experiments reveal that empathy mediated the positive effect of communicating pure group-based anger. We discuss the implications of these findings for the theory and practice of communicating emotions in intergroup conflicts.

AB  - A superordinate identity improves intergroup relations and bolsters support for the political system. Yet, why do only some identify superordinately? I argue that personality is an important determinant. I test this using an original survey in the United Kingdom, where European Union integration has increased the salience and feasibility of the European identity option in addition to a national one. Several Big Five traits matter: openness and extraversion increase identification with Europe while agreeableness decreases it. Mediation analysis subsequently shows that personality's effects also travel through the mechanisms of risk aversion, knowledge, and ideology. Results imply that certain predispositions prompt some to be more receptive than others to seeing themselves in superordinate terms and that European identification may be at least partly more primordial than previously thought.

AB  - Research has shown that vicarious contact can help to reduce prejudice. We tested the effect of a controlled, video-based vicarious-contact intervention on straight men's (implicit and explicit) attitudes toward gay men. Findings of Experiment 1 (n = 99 German participants) failed to show direct effects but were in line with the idea that negative (situation-specific) emotions mediate the intervention effect. Experiment 2 (n = 108 U.S. participants) expanded findings: straight men with antigay preattitudes reported less negative intergroup emotions toward gay men after watching the vicarious-contact video (compared to the control condition); and less negative intergroup emotions were related to more positive attitudes toward gay men. For straight men with positive preattitudes, findings were in line with the hypothesis that positive intergroup emotions toward gay men were the relevant mediator. We discuss the moderating role of preattitudes to explain processes underlying vicarious-contact effects.

AB  - Citizens are now central to national security strategies, yet governments readily admit that little is known about public opinion on security. This article presents a unique and timely examination of public perceptions of security threats. By focusing on the breadth of security threats that citizens identify, their psychological origins, how they vary from personal to global levels, and the relationships between perceptions of threats and other political attitudes and behaviours, the article makes several new contributions to the literature. These include extending the levels at which threats are perceived from the national versus personal dichotomy to a continuum spanning the individual, family, community, nation and globe, and showing the extent to which perceptions of threat at each level have different causes, as well as different effects on political attitudes and behaviour. These findings are also relevant to policy communities' understanding of what it means for a public to feel secure.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to describe the demographic, behavioral, and psychosocial characteristics of adolescent and caregiver lay health advisers (LHAs) participating in an intervention designed to reduce risk behaviors among rural African-American adolescents. Teach One, Reach One integrates constructs from the Theory of Planned Behavior and Social Cognitive Theory. It acknowledges that changing the sexual behaviors of African-American adolescents requires changing one's knowledge, attitudes, normative beliefs about the behavior of peers, and self-efficacy regarding adolescent sexual behavior, parent-teen communication about sex, and healthy dating relations among adolescents. Study participants completed baseline questionnaires assessing demographics and psychosocial determinants (knowledge, attitudes, perceived social norms, and self-efficacy) of sexual behaviors. Sixty-two adolescent and caregiver dyads participated. Caregivers included biological parents, legal guardians, or other parental figures. Strengths and areas in need of improvement were determined using median splits. Few adolescents had initiated sex. Their strengths included high levels of open parent-teen communication; positive attitudes and normative beliefs regarding both sex communication and healthy dating relationships; and high knowledge and self-efficacy for healthy dating behaviors. Areas needing improvement included low knowledge, unfavorable attitudes, poor normative beliefs, and low self-efficacy regarding condom use. Caregiver strengths included positive attitudes, normative beliefs, and self-efficacy for sex communication; positive attitudes and self-efficacy for condom use; and low acceptance of couple violence. Areas needing improvement included low levels of actual communication about sex and low knowledge about effective communication strategies and condom use. The current study highlights the value of assessing baseline characteristics of LHAs prior to intervention implementation, as it enables a better understanding of the key characteristics necessary for planning and implementing interventions, as well as engaging in targeted training activities.

AB  - This study aims to test the third-person effect (TPE) in the perception of Internet privacy risks. Support was found for a TPE model suggesting that users report greater perceived Internet privacy risks on others than on themselves, based on a sample (N = 613) from Amazon MTurk. In particular, the differential perception of Internet privacy risks between self and others increased people's willingness to recommend protective measures to others but decreased their willingness to adopt protective measures themselves. Moreover, social distance, perceived Internet privacy knowledge, negative online privacy experiences, and Internet use activities emerged as significant predictors of TPE perceptions about Internet privacy risks. Study findings indicated that third-person perception is one of the major barriers inhibiting the adoption of privacy protection measures. The antecedents of TPE perceptions detected here provide valuable implications about how to enable Internet users to protect their privacy security.

AB  - Giving thanks has multiple psychological benefits. However, within intergroup contexts, thankful responses from low-power to high-power group members could solidify the power hierarchy. The other-oriented nature of grateful expressions could mask power differences and discourage low-power group members from advocating for their ingroup interests. In five studies (N = 825), we examine the novel idea of a potentially harmful side of "thanks," using correlational and experimental designs and a follow-up. Across different contexts, expressing thanks to a high-power group member who transgressed and then helped undermined low-power group members' protest intentions and actual protest. Thus, the expression of thanks can pacify members of low-power groups. We offer insights into the underlying process by showing that forgiveness of the high-power benefactor and system justification mediate this effect. Our findings provide evidence for a problematic side of gratitude within intergroup relations. We discuss social implications.

AB  - This paper addresses the question why tourist attitude towards the interactions with residents are more positive in some urban settings than others, by comparing three different urban settings within Hong Kong: the city centre (Central), a suburban shopping/entertainment centre (Sha Tin) and a new urban tourism area (Mong Kok). Two competing hypotheses can explain the variation in tourist attitudes. The first is causation; some settings provide more intensive and better interactions which lead to more positive attitudes. The second is selection; some settings attract different types of tourists with different attitudes. Mediation analysis provides weak support for causation and strong support for selection. Sha Tin attracts more repeat tourists, holidaymakers and shopping tourists, which have more positive attitudes. Managing growth of tourism is more effective if sub-centres are developed as product-market combinations that distract these tourists from the overcrowded city-centre.

AB  - As one of the early COVID-19 epidemic outbreak areas, China attracted the global news media's attention at the beginning of 2020. During the epidemic period, Chinese people united and actively fought against the epidemic. However, in the eyes of the international public, the situation reported about China is not optimistic. To better understand how the international public portrays China, especially during the epidemic, we present a case study with big data technology. We aim to answer three questions: (1) What has the international media focused on during the COVID-19 epidemic period? (2) What is the media's tone when they report China? (3) What is the media's attitude when talking about China? In detail, we crawled more than 280 000 pieces of news from 57 mainstream media agencies in 22 countries and made some interesting observations. For example, international media paid more attention to Chinese livelihood during the COVID-19 epidemic period. In March and April, "progress of Chinese vaccines," "specific drugs and treatments," and "virus outbreak in U.S." became the media's most common topics. In terms of news attitude, Cuba, Malaysia, and Venezuela had a positive attitude toward China, while France, Canada, and the United Kingdom had a negative attitude. Our study can help understand China's image in the eyes of the international media and provide a sound basis for image analysis.

AB  - Mainstream and alternative media often frame key political events in divergent ways. The present research examined how mainstream and alternative media consumption was linked to public support for Bersih, a pro-democracy movement in Malaysia. We conducted a two-wave panel study before and after the Bersih 5 protests demanding electoral reform (N = 422), and another two-wave panel study before and after the 14th General Elections which were historic in unseating the ruling government (N = 386). Against mounting corruption, the two events were important to Malaysia's democratic transition. Across both studies, alternative media consumption was linked to more positive attitudes toward the Bersih movement, especially among people who were strong supporters of the previous ruling government. Mainstream media did not play a consistent role in shaping attitudes toward the movement, nor was there evidence of backlash among government supporters. Thus, alternative media may have legitimized the cause for social change.

AB  - Using data from a national sample of parent and family educators in the US (n = 697), this comparative study examines professionals' practices and technology-related attitudes, skill and workplace conditions. Overall, professionals report positive attitudes about the value of using technology in practice and view themselves as proficient. They most frequently use technologies like the email and document preparation software, and less frequently social media and even virtual reality. Workplace resources vary significantly, educators are not motivated by employer expectations and most report self-training as more valuable than formal sources. Mean comparisons by family educator type validate differences by context. Parenting educators, occasional family educators (e.g., teachers, counselors) and Family Life Educators vary from those in Higher Education/Administration. Those in Higher Education/Administration have more technology resources, report more positive attitudes, are more confident about their skills, and view formal technology training as useful. Conclusions suggest the need for the field of parent and family education to join other educational professions (e.g., licensed classroom teachers) to embrace technology use as a critical competency and advocate for the necessary resources in the preparation and ongoing service training of professionals.

AB  - Employee contributions are indispensable to the success of corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices; however, surprisingly little research has focused on how positive attitudes toward CSR-oriented management can be facilitated among employees. Applying a relational demography approach and related theories, this study examines employees' emotional identification and behavioral engagement with CSR-oriented mission activities. Data from a Fortune Global 500 company in Japan show the direct effect of position and the asymmetric effects of position dissimilarity. Lower-positioned employees tend to report enhanced positive attitudes toward CSR-oriented mission activities when working with a greater number of higher-positioned colleagues. Furthermore, perceived mission-based support mediates the effect of the interaction between position dissimilarity and position on employees' attitudes toward CSR-oriented activities. On the basis of these findings, it is argued that companies should recognize the importance of managerial members as role models and provide employees with sufficient support to facilitate positive attitudes toward CSR practices.

AB  - Concerns about the diversification of Britain, and its impact on social capital and health are widely debated. The literature has however produced a fuzzy discourse, full of assumptions and claims that are rarely tested. We attempt to disentangle some of these assumptions by providing empirical evidence on the mediating and moderating influence of inter-ethnic conflict and contact, and examine whether they underlie the erosion of health among minorities and white British respondents residing in diverse local areas. Analyses were conducted using multilevel models that relied on geocoded data from a random stratified sample of adults 16-75 years collected in the 2009-2011 Citizenship Survey merged to small area aggregated statistics from the 2011 UK census. The final sample comprised of minorities (n = 13,236) and white British (n = 15,021) residing in England. We find that local area deprivation matters much more for the health of minorities and whites than diversity. Yet, residing in diverse areas can be problematic for whites if it is accompanied by high levels of social distance measured by negative attitudes towards immigrants. Greater contact among minorities and whites, residing in more diverse areas appears to have no significant effect on health. Overall, the findings supported our hypothesis that residing in areas of greater diversity has a differential impact on minorities when compared to whites. In particular, diversity appear to be more beneficial for minorities, especially newly arriving migrants. The effect of contact as measured by social capital is dwarfed in comparison to the effect of deprivation, underlying the importance for policy makers to tackle structural inequalities.

AB  - Declining political involvement of adolescents in western society has caused widespread concerns about the health of democracy in the future. This study investigates the role of the media in the formation of political attitudes and political mobilization of adolescents. Based on a secondary data analysis of the European Social Survey (N = 5657), the influence of exposure to news and entertainment content on political trust, signing petitions and consumer politics is assessed in a multi-level regression analysis. Additionally, the impact of the political and educational system on political attitude formation and civic engagement of adolescents is investigated. The results show a higher level of engagement in countries with a well-functioning democracy. At the individual level, news media exposure is positively related to engagement in consumer politics, whereas exposure to entertainment is negatively related to mobilization.

AB  - Integrating theory on interpersonal relationships and intergroup relations, this research examined the role of common ingroup recategorization (i.e., perceiving outgroup members as belonging to the same superordinate group as oneself) in fostering communal interracial relationships. A cross-sectional study (Study 1) and a short-term intensive longitudinal study (Study 2) involving Black and White friendship and romantic dyads suggested that recategorization predicted greater communal motivation and security via perceived similarity. These effects were found in terms of both enduring characteristics and changes over time. In turn, communal motivation and security predicted greater self-reported prosocial behavior and relationship satisfaction, suggesting that they are beneficial to interracial relationship quality. Communal motivation also predicted increases over time in recategorization and perceived similarity, suggesting bidirectional effects. Taken together, these results suggest a reciprocal process in which common ingroup recategorization and perceptions of similarity promote and derive from the communal nature of interracial relationships.

AB  - What is the role of culture in establishing young people's pathways into gang membership? Italian criminal organizations (COs) exhibit adherence to codes of honor and masculinity, important values in the context where they originated. Here it is proposed that the embedding of these values at an individual level may lessen young people's group-based opposition to such organizations, and indirectly, create a space in which such organizations can persist and recruit. In a study of young Southern Italians (N = 176; M-age = 16.17), we found that those who endorsed ideological beliefs related to the honorableness of male violence reported lower intentions to engage in antimafia activities. Consistent with the hypothesized mechanisms, this relationship was mediated by more positive attitudes toward COs, and lower reported vicarious shame in relation to the activities of COs. Directions for future research and implications for research on gangs are discussed.

AB  - It is frequently suggested that increasing awareness of intergroup bias and limited control over biased responses can improve intergroup interaction behavior. Some uses of the Implicit Association Test (IAT) epitomize this approach to improving intergroup relations. However, if completing the IAT enhances caution and inhibition, reduces self-efficacy, or primes categorical thinking, the test may instead have negative effects. Two experiments demonstrated that when White individuals completed a race-relevant IAT prior to an intergroup interaction (as compared with when they did not), their interaction partner left the exchange feeling less positively regarded. No such effect was evident when White individuals completed a race-irrelevant IAT (Study 1) or an explicit prejudice measure (Study 2) before the exchange, or when their interaction partner was White (Study 1). Mediation analyses (Study 2) suggested that White participants who completed the IAT communicated less positive regard because they adopted a cautious approach to the interaction, limiting their self-disclosure.

AB  - This special issue illuminates the ways in which media portrayals and practices, together, create barriers to inclusion for diverse groups and normalize existing patterns of relegation on and off the screen. Media representations of race and ethnicity have critical consequences for intergroup relationships and for marginalized group members' self-concept. A synthesis of the research included in this volume demonstrates the significance of these questions across media outlets, their relevancy despite the rise of new technologies, and their application to social contexts outside the United States. Finally, this concluding article suggests directions for future research and offers implications for policies that can foster prosocial outcomes.

AB  - This paper presents a FLIR/INS/RA integrated landing guidance method to provide information of aircraft states and carrier dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft landing on the aircraft carrier in low-visibility weather and high sea states. The method utilizes the Forward-Looking Infrared (FLIR) system, the Inertial Navigation System (INS), and the Radio Altimeter (RA) as sensors, to track infrared cooperated targets on the aircraft carrier. Several algorithms like the Newton iterative algorithm, the Kalman Filter (KF), and the Wavelet Transform (WT) are employed to compute real-time and high-precision estimates of the aircraft states (runway-related position, attitude, and velocity) and the carrier dynamics (pitch, roll, and heave). A simulation experiment is conducted and shows satisfactory results for the aircraft carrier landing guidance.

AB  - Cycling-inclusive urban planning is attracting attention worldwide because of the environmental, health, economic, and transport benefits inherent to cycling from the individual and the societal perspectives. The Czech Republic is one of the emerging cycling countries that are trying to promote and support cycling, but cycling mode shares are low because of the poor quality of the scarce infrastructure and the psychological barrier of the perceived lack of safety when cycling in mixed traffic. This study takes a multimodal approach based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour and focuses on the factors underlying the willingness to share the road from the perspective of cyclists and drivers: positive attitudes toward cycling, positive attitudes toward cyclists' behavior, social norms toward cycling and anxiety to share the road. A web-based questionnaire was tailor-designed and administered in the Czech Republic via social networks, web forums, and the Civinet network, and a hybrid bivariate-ordered model tested the behavioral framework. Results show that the willingness to share the road as a cyclist or as a driver relates positively to positive attitudes towards cycling and cyclists' behavior, and negatively to the anxiety of sharing the road. Moreover, mediator effects are observed and a clear relation emerges between the experience on the road as both a cyclist and a driver on the willingness to share the road as a cyclist. Lastly, results show that the factors underlying road sharing intentions are related significantly to gender, travel habits, and perceived personal and infrastructure-related barriers to cycling.

AB  - In recent years, activists have increasingly organized to protest large-scale energy projects, and research has found that such activism affects project approval. Despite its increasing relevance, little is known about who participates in energy activism. This paper builds a profile of energy activists by drawing on existing literature to derive and test general expectations on resources, political attitudes, media exposure, trust, risk, climate concern, and local factors. We analyze an original survey from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. public to identify the individual-level determinants of energy activism and compare these factors with a more traditional model of political activism. We find that energy activists are distinct from political activists. Energy activists tend to be younger and more demographically diverse, more concerned about local environmental conditions, and, heterogeneous in their political attitudes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the results, implications for energy producers, and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Authors suggest that in liberal contexts, groups considered as lacking autonomy, such as people with schizophrenia, can face stigma. Following Social Dominance theory, we hypothesized that perceived autonomy of people with schizophrenia mediates the relation between SDO and stigmatizing attitudes. Participants from the general population (N = 255; 76.5% women, Mage = 25.33, SD = 12.3) responded to our questionnaire assessing one's SDO, perceived autonomy and stigmatizing attitudes towards schizophrenia (i.e., dangerousness and desired social distance). Analysis of direct paths from SDO to perceived autonomy (b = -.45, p < .001) and from the latter to perceived dangerousness (b = -.33, p < .001) and to social distance (b = -.46, p < .001), as well as analysis of indirect paths (b = .15, p < .01) for perceived dangerousness (b = .25, p < .001 for social distance), confirmed our hypotheses, and our model showed a good data fit. Our results provide evidence for the stigmatizing role of the autonomy ideal for people with disabilities and invite further development regarding anti-stigma efforts.

AB  - We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world's highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults (N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one's online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.

AB  - This study investigates the role of components of intercultural competence in the use of intercultural mediation behaviors. Through the use of the Revised Intercultural Mediation Measure, an instrument revised by the authors, 291 Anglophone and 161 Francophone participants in Canada were asked to indicate their likelihood of employing various mediation strategies to reduce a conflict between two linguistic groups. The results demonstrated that involvement as an intercultural mediator is likely to be initiated by individuals who are members of the same linguistic group as the perpetrator. By virtue of their xenophilic representations of the victimized group, these individuals take on the role of mediator to reduce tension. In contrast, participants from both linguistic groups were unlikely to become involved as a mediator when witnessing members of the in-group being victimized. Furthermore, path analyses revealed that the use of mediation strategies when the in-group was being discriminated against was, at most, limited to endorsing fewer avoidant mediation strategies. The findings are interpreted within the context of research on intergroup relations and discrimination.

AB  - Members of a minority population are expected to evaluate political authorities through a different spectrum than majority members. Still, only a few studies have explored the role of local conditions as determinants for political attitudes among a linguistic minority population. This study focuses on the role of linguistic homogeneity, local economic conditions and community size as determinants for corruption perceptions and political trust at the individual level among members of a linguistic minority population: the Swedish-speaking Finns. Moreover, this study differs empirically between evaluations of the local and national authorities. Combining data from a panel survey collected by Barometern (2019-21) with varying contextual-level factors in a multilevel model, we show that evaluations of local authorities are related to local contextual factors, in particular municipal unemployment rates and median incomes, while national evaluations are largely unrelated to local conditions. In contrast to theoretical expectations for an in-group bias among minority members, however, we find no effect for linguistic homogeneity on corruption perceptions and political trust after controlling for economic conditions. The results make an important contribution to our understanding about the role of local conditions for political attitudes among a well-assimilated minority population.

AB  - The persuasiveness and popularity of narratives in commercial advertising has gained much attention but its application in inculcating responsible behaviour is severely limited. Domestic violence against women is a global issue and there is a dire need for effective bystander intervention campaigns. This two-part study delved into how narratives could be employed to elicit favourable ad attitudes and encourage bystanders to report instances of domestic abuse in their neighbourhood. Study 1 focused on testing the effectiveness of narratives in two culturally diverse countries - India and the United States. In general, findings showed that narratives (vs. non-narratives) were more persuasive in both countries. As the next step, using culture (interdependence vs. independence) and social distance (parents vs. neighbours), Study 2 found narratives with a socially proximal entity (parents) to be more persuasive in India while no differences between countries were observed for the socially distant entity (neighbours). Theoretical and managerial implications are discussed.

AB  - The large number of refugees and host countries' citizens' reactions regarding their admission have been major global issues. Thus, psychological interventions to foster intergroup relations in the asylum context are desirable. In three experiments with general population samples (N = 986), we adapted a paradoxical thinking intervention to the intergroup context of Germans and refugees, thus testing its effectiveness in an early stage of conflict. Participants in the paradoxical condition, compared to two control conditions, showed lower levels of conflict-related concerns (Experiment 1), higher levels of openness to alternative information (Experiment 1, 3) and higher willingness to compromise (Experiment 2). In addition, the intervention was still successful when the sender of the paradoxical questions belonged to a political outgroup (Experiment 3). A mini-meta-analysis corroborated significant effects across experiments (for openness and willingness to compromise). Ideas for future research and the intervention's practical use are discussed (e.g., in social media).

AB  - This research aims to test the loyalty of tourists who visit tourism village as one of the community based tourism. The loyalty model that is proposed explores the relationship between attractiveness, trust, service quality, positive attitude, intention to visit, and intention to recommend. This research uses the respondent survey of domestic and foreign tourists who visit community based tourism tourist village in the Province of Daerah Istimewa Yogyakarta (DIY), Indonesia. The sampling technique is using purposive sampling with the respondent criteria of tourists who are motivated to visit because of special intention. The number of respondent is 400 people. The data analysis technique is using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). This research result explains that the research model is accepted, this means that there is a relationship between attractiveness, trust, service quality, positive attitude, intention to visit and intention to recommend. This research result gives a direction for the manager of tourism village about the increased tourist loyalty through infrastructure improvement either in tourism location or home stay provided by the community, ease of access, security, hospitality, and professional tour guide.

AB  - Objectives. This study examined the impact of sheltering in place and social distancing among adults aged 60 and older during the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in the United States.
   Methods. Using convenience sampling respondents were asked to complete a web-administered survey to explore impact of social distancing on loneliness, stress, and behavioral changes. The analytic sample consisted of 833 responses of persons aged 60 and older.
   Results. A large portion reported being stressed (36%), and/or being lonely (42.5%). Nearly 1/3 stated that their sense of loneliness increased during the time of social distancing. Respondents reported engaging in more solitary activity (and fewer in-person activities), using email and text messages more than usual, and spending more time on computers/tablet than usual. Approximately 2/3 reported using more social media than usual. These differed significantly by younger (age 60-70) and older (71+) respondents. Additionally, changes in physical activity, drinking, recreational drug use and sleeping pattern changes differed by age.
   Conclusions. Social distancing has significant consequences on loneliness and health behaviors among adults in the United States, many of which differ by age group. Results have implications for continued shelter in place practices, but also for any older adult that may be homebound for other reasons.

AB  - From an intergroup relations perspective, relative group size is associated with the quantity and quality of intergroup contact: more positive contact (i.e., intergroup friendship) supports, and negative contact (i.e., experienced discrimination) hampers, minority identity, and school success. Accordingly, we examined intergroup contact as the process through which perceived relative proportions of minority and majority students in school affected minority success (i.e., school performance, satisfaction, and self-efficacy). Turkish minorities (N = 1,060) were compared in four Austrian and Belgian cities which differ in their typical school ethnic composition. Across cities, minority experiences of intergroup contact fully mediated the impact of perceived relative group size on school success. As expected, higher minority presence impaired school success through restricting intergroup friendship and increasing experienced discrimination. The association between minority presence and discrimination was curvilinear, however, so that schools where minority students predominated offered some protection from discrimination. To conclude, the comparative findings reveal positive and negative intergroup contact as key processes that jointly explain when and how higher proportions of minority students affect school success.

AB  - This study focuses on the role of social identity and prejudice as causal variables in public attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in a UK sample. In all, 222 participants participated in an experimental vignette study with a 2 x 2 x 2 design with between-participants factors of ethnicity, sexual orientation and gender, and completed measures of attitudes toward gay men, Black Africans, and PrEP. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed significant effects of gender on attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans; of ethnicity on attitudes toward gay men and PrEP; and of religion on attitudes toward gay men. A univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed more positive attitudes toward PrEP when it was presented as benefitting men (vs. women). Structural equation modeling showed that the relationship between the independent variables of gender, ethnicity, and religion and the dependent variable of attitudes toward PrEP was mediated by attitudes toward gay men and Black Africans. Individuals must perceive the principal beneficiaries of PrEP (i.e., gay men and Black Africans) positively to endorse PrEP for these groups, and sexism may reduce public acceptability of PrEP for women. Future research should use representative samples and alternative experimental manipulations, and include strength of social identification as an independent variable.

AB  - YouTube, the most popular present-day online video platform, is also considered one of today's leading advertising media. There is an ongoing argument that YouTube measures and shares its own ad effectiveness. However, the consumer research results contradict with their measurements. The difficulty of measuring the performance of video ads on YouTube without YouTube's built-in data increases the debate about its effectiveness as an advertising environment and therefore makes it more important to collect data from consumers through empirical research. This study was carried out with YouTube viewers located in Turkey, whose population is among the most online video watching Internet users in the world, to uncover the determining attitudes and the factors affecting them in the effectiveness of bumper ads, which YouTube introduced in 2016 as 6-seconds unskippable ad videos. The acquired data were tested by correlation and regression analysis under a predicted model that could explain the attitudes towards the ad. According to findings; it has been shown that the attitudes towards bumper advertisements are significantly related to the factors such as entertainment, informativeness, credibility, irritation, frequency of exposure and advertising value. However, it was found that the participants did not develop a positive attitude towards these factors, and the bumper advertisements, along with them.

AB  - Children in foster care are at high risk for poor psychosocial outcomes, including school failure, alcohol and other substance abuse, and criminal behaviors. Promoting healthy development by increasing broad-impact positive skills may help reduce some of the risk factors for longer-term negative outcomes. School readiness has been linked to a number of positive outcomes across childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and may also boost intermediary positive skills such as self-competence. This paper presents findings from a longitudinal study involving 192 children in foster care who were 5 years old at the start of the study. They participated in a randomized controlled trial of a school readiness program to prepare them for kindergarten. Outcomes were assessed at third grade (9 years old) on variables associated with risk for later involvement in substance use and delinquency. These included positive attitudes towards alcohol use, positive attitudes towards antisocial behaviors, and involvement with deviant peers. Results showed that the intervention decreased positive attitudes towards alcohol use and antisocial behaviors. Further, the mediating role of children's self-competence was tested. The intervention positively influenced children's third-grade self-competence, which in turn, decreased their involvement with deviant peers. Findings suggest that promoting school readiness in children in foster care can have far-reaching, positive effects and that increased self-competence may be a mechanism for reducing risk.

AB  - Background: Ear health and hearing loss (HL) among infants has devastating outcomes. With most HL being deemed preventable, the assessment of one's knowledge and attitude regarding this impairment is important. In Saudi Arabia, the state of the general population's knowledge on infant HL remains unknown. Objectives: To determine and further elucidate the general population's knowledge and attitude with regard to HL in Saudi Arabia. Methods: This is a cross-sectional survey-based study conducted on the general population of Saudi Arabia. A predetermined questionnaire was translated into Arabic. This was distributed among the targeted participants in several provinces of Saudi Arabia (central, northern, eastern, western, and southern) by using an online survey via social media. The data were collected and analyzed via the SPSS program. Results: The knowledge with moderate, poor, and good was determined among 60.9%, 29.6%, and 9.4% of the participants, respectively. The participants with positive and negative attitudes were detected among 92.6% and 7.4% of respondents, respectively. Increasing age was associated with better attitude, while increased knowledge was directly related to higher educational attainment. Those who have a child with HL had nearly twice as poor knowledge as those who do not have a child with HL (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Although most of the respondents possessed a positive attitude toward infant HL, their knowledge about it seems to be lacking. Thus, there is a need to address these knowledge gaps regarding infant HL.

AB  - Anti-Islamic sentiments have become central to right-wing populist mobilization in Western societies, which often results in negative portrayals of Muslims in political campaigns. Although these portrayals may have detrimental effects on minority members' identity formation and attitudes toward majority members, little is known about their effects on members of the depicted group. A lab experiment with 145 young Muslims reveals that right-wing populist ad exposure increases perceived discrimination, which in turn decreases individuals' self-esteem and national identification, and encourages hostility toward majority members. Religious identification, in contrast, is not affected by ad exposure. Implications of these findings for intergroup relations and democratic processes are discussed.

AB  - Background: Public attitudes towards a given medical procedure can have a significant influence on the employment of that method. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a medical procedure that has received an exceptionally ambiguous public reception since its inception.
   Aim: To survey the level of information about and attitudes towards ECT in a general population sample of the Chuvash Republic of the Russian Federation.
   Methods: A randomly selected cohort of 5,373 people was contacted by telephone. The respondents were asked three closed and three open questions.
   Results: The response rate was 74.7%. Only 35.2% of those interviewed said they knew anything about ECT. Health professionals and younger respondents were better informed. The two main sources of information about ECT were foreign films and the mass media. The main indication of ECT was thought to be schizophrenia. The majority (63.3%) of the respondents had negative opinions and emotions about ECT.
   Conclusion: Limited information about and generally negative attitudes towards ECT were found in the general population of the Chuvash Republic. Gender, age, education level, employment in the health industry, and information source were found to be the determining factors in the knowledge of and attitudes towards ECT.

AB  - Intergroup contact is a known remedy for complicated intergroup relations. At the same time, contact is rare in postconflict settings. In the present article, we examine whether exposure to narratives about moral exemplars (i.e., members of a perpetrator group who acted morally and in opposition to the passivity or aggression displayed by majority) could increase openness to contact among historical adversaries. In Study 1 (N = 73), presenting members of a historical perpetrator group with information about ingroup moral exemplars led to a decrease of prejudice towards individuals from a historical victim group, which, in turn, resulted in higher openness to contact with them. In Study 2 (N = 100) and 3 (N = 92), exposure to narratives about outgroup moral exemplars in a historically victimized group increased openness to contact with members of a perpetrator group. These effects were mediated by a decrease in prejudice (Studies 2 and 3) and by an increase in trust towards historical perpetrators (Study 2).

AB  - Background: A minority of all with alcohol use disorders seek treatment. In Denmark, a media campaign, "RESPEKT," has been broadcast nationwide since 2015. The campaign is unique from an international perspective and aims to increase treatment-seeking. Similar interventions have, up until now, not been scientifically evaluated. Aim: To investigate campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking pre- and post the campaign period. Also, associations to demographic factors and year of campaign will be investigated. Method: Study design: Repeated cross-sectional study Participants: Adults aged 30-70 years, in total n = 9169. Data: Pre- and post the campaign period between 2017 and 2020, an online questionnaire was administered by a market research company. The questionnaire covered demographic data, campaign awareness, understanding, attitudes, and information-seeking about treatment for alcohol use disorders. In addition, complete-case logistic regression was performed to model dichotomous outcomes, and odds ratios were calculated. Results: Campaign awareness varied between 8 and 40% over the different years. Understanding of the main message was high and received higher endorsements over the study period. A majority expressed positive attitudes toward the campaign and support for the main message regarding free treatment. However, very few self-reported seeking information about AUD treatment. Female sex was associated with higher awareness of the campaign, higher understanding and more positive attitudes toward the campaign. Conclusion: The campaign evoked positive attitudes and had an impact on increasing knowledge and changing attitudes. However, no effect on self-reported information seeking about treatment was found.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate the satisfaction consequences in repurchase situations.
   Design/methodology/approach - Online travel services are chosen because customers in these types of services had direct contact with firms. A conceptual model of CS-RPI link is developed and used to test proposed hypotheses. A total of 514 respondents are used to test the proposed model.
   Findings - The empirical findings indicate that psychological mediators are useful when repurchase situations are considered. The study provides the roles of positive attitude in the formation of CS-RPI link. Also, three factors: adjusted expectations, trust, and positive attitude, are found to have a significant mediating influence on the link of CS-RPI.
   Research limitations/implications - Future researchers attempting to replicate and extend these findings may wish to collaborate with companies marketing products and services online and track customers' actual behaviors. This would be an excellent way to validate the current model relationships, particularly those involving repurchase intentions and customer satisfaction.
   Practical implications - The results can be used by web site designers to tailor their sites' features and marketing analysts to monitor the changes of click-through rates as a parameter of the CS-RPI. The discovery of significant interrelationships between satisfaction and trust, such as adjusted expectation, positive attitude and repurchase intention, reinforces the importance of the psychological state when repurchasing behavior is considered. For instance, it was observed that the three mediators result in lower levels of the indirect effect, but this is not limited in the whole process of the CS-RPI.
   Originality/value - The conceptual framework is tested in an understudied e-service context that is characterized by consumer-focused competition. This context is noteworthy because no research has investigated determinants between the two parties. Research suggests that companies should understand how to capture determinants on post-satisfaction, since competing businesses are only a mouse-click away in e-commerce settings.

AB  - Infant feeding education forms a key element in undergraduate midwifery education in the UK. Students must be prepared to provide women with support and information to make appropriate health choices for themselves and their infants. However, student midwives may already have developed opinions about infant feeding prior to commencing a midwifery education programme. The education literature suggests that existing attitudes may present a barrier to learning for some students. This particularly applies to learning in relation to sensitive or emotionally laden subjects. A review of the literature was undertaken to identify potential teaching approaches which might help students to overcome barriers to learning. Following this the evidence was utilised at a UK university to develop activities which prepare student midwives for effective learning around infant feeding. Students enrolled in the midwifery education programme were introduced to a number of activities aimed at encouraging them to accommodate unfamiliar ideas or 'alien knowledge'. These included placing students in situations which challenged their ideas, as well as engaging in group discussions and reflective exercises. The impact of these educational interventions was identified through formative and summative assessment, and through evaluation of the teaching strategy at the end of the programme. This demonstrated that, amongst those students with previously negative attitudes towards infant feeding, there was a move towards more positive attitudes and a greater confidence in providing evidence based information to parents.

AB  - Donald Trump frequently attacks foreign countries such as Germany (e.g., via Twitter). Drawing from social identity theory and intergroup threat theory, I theorized that exposure to news about Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increases anti-Americanism in Germany. First, I theorized that Trump's utterances result in negative attitudes toward Trump and, in turn, increase anti-Americanism (spillover effect). Second, I theorized that Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly affect anti-Americanism via increased European Union (EU) popularity. Furthermore, I assumed that effects would be stronger for individuals low in political interest. A quota-based online experiment (N= 428) revealed that Trump's anti-German utterances increased EU's popularity. This effect was moderated by political interest. EU's popularity was increased for moderately interested individuals and individuals low in political interest. No effects were detected for highly interested individuals. EU popularity, in turn, increased anti-Americanism. Therefore, Trump's anti-German utterances indirectly increased anti-Americanism burdening relations between Germany and the United States. Implications for journalistic news coverage are discussed.

AB  - Introduction. - This study investigates the impact of an organisational multiculturalism perspective of diversity on in-group bias towards people of foreign origin.
   Objective. - We hypothesise that organisational multiculturalism constitutes a norm which creates a positive context for intergroup relations. We expect that when workers perceive that their organisation recognises group differences, their own values are influenced, namely egalitarian values and perceived value violation. The value-related mediators are conceptualised in the frame of justification-suppression model (Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) respectively as suppression and justification.
   Method. - Data were collected from a sample of 402 workers who completed an anonymous questionnaire.
   Results. - Based on structural equation modelling, results show that the perception of organisational multiculturalism is negatively and indirectly related to in-group bias through both suppression and justification processes.
   Conclusion. - This study highlights that the perception of the normative context of an organisation is related to workers' attitudes. The results are discussed consistent with the literature on diversity. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this research we demonstrate the powerful role of ingroup favoritism, rather than hostility, in American intergroup biases. Specifically, we take a novel perspective to understanding the relationship between political ideology and discrimination against ethnic-minority Americans by focusing on the role of patriotism. Across three studies, we show that political ideology is a strong predictor of resource allocation biases, and this effect is mediated by American patriotism and not by prejudice or nationalism. Conservatives report greater levels of patriotism than liberals, and patriotism is associated with donating more to American, as opposed to ethnic-minority American, organizations. We further show that the link between patriotism and partiality to the national group is mediated by stronger American=White associations. These findings have important implications for intergroup relations and diversity-related policy issues in the United States.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of applying two types of authentic technology, the immersion-based augmented reality (AR) and animation simulation (AS), on college students' achievement, study approach, and attitude to learning concepts of natural science. The attention-relevance-confidence-satisfaction (ARCS) model was adopted as a learning framework, and a pretest-posttest quasiexperimental design was employed. In total, 122 college freshmen from three classes participated in the 6-week experimental instruction. The Revised Two-Factor Study Process Questionnaire and an attitude questionnaire were used during the experiment to obtain learners' perceptions and manner of use of these technologies. The results revealed that (a) both types of technology improved knowledge, but the AR group significantly outperformed the AS group; (b) the study approach of the AR group changed from being balanced to being in favor of deep motivation and surface strategy, whereas that of the AS group changed from being balanced to biased toward deep strategy; (c) the AR group had a more positive attitude toward multimedia features and interaction functions, whereas the AS group exhibited a more positive attitude toward teaching materials, interface design, and practicality.

AB  - Bot Detection is crucial in a world where Online Social Networks (OSNs) play a pivotal role in our lives as public communication channels. This task becomes highly relevant in crises like the Covid-19 pandemic when there is a growing risk of proliferation of automated accounts designed to produce misinformation content. To address this issue, we first introduce a comparison between supervised Bot Detection models using Data Selection. The techniques used to develop the bot detection models use features such as the tweets' metadata or accounts' Digital Fingerprint. The techniques implemented in this work proved effective in detecting bots with different behaviors. Social Fingerprint-based methods have been found to be effective with bots that behave in a coordinated manner. Furthermore, all these approaches have produced excellent results compared to the Botometer v3. Second, we present and discuss a case study related to the Covid-19 pandemic that analyses the differences in the discourse between bots and humans on Twitter, a platform used worldwide to express opinions and engage in dialogue in a public arena. While bots and humans generally express themselves alike, the tweets' content and sentiment analysis reveal some dissimilitudes, especially in tweets concerning President Trump. When the discourse switches to pandemic management by Trump, sentiment-related values display a drastic difference, showing that tweets generated by bots have a predominantly negative attitude. However, according to our findings, while automated accounts are numerous and active in discussing controversial issues, they usually do not seem to increase exposure to negative and inflammatory content for human users.

AB  - Purpose Brand transgressions, characterized by service failure, are a frequent theme for marketing scholars. Their impact on satisfaction, trust and brand loyalty is of high interest. However, in assessing the influence of those events on third-party consumers, the literature is still lacking. The purpose of this paper is to explore how social distance explains the reactions of close and distant third-party consumers toward other consumers during a brand transgression event. Anger is analyzed as a driver of this process.
   Design/methodology/approach Two experiments were conducted. Both studies presented a 3 (social distance: victim vs close third party vs distant third party) by 2 (severity: low vs high) between-subjects design. Respondents were asked to read a transgression scenario in a mobile phone service (study 1) and in a restaurant (study 2) and then completed scales that measured their affective reactions and evaluations of the relationship - satisfaction, trust, and loyalty intention - with the transgressing brand.
   Findings The results showed that transgression severity intensifies the effect of the brand transgression on consumer's anger. Victims and close third parties demonstrated higher levels of anger compared to distant third-party consumers. In the case of severe transgressions, an experience of anger contagion between victims and close third-party consumers was responsible for the negative effect on the relationship evaluation of the transgressing brand compared to distant third-party consumers.
   Originality/value This study extends previous research about how social distance influences consumer-brand relationships and demonstrates the mediating role played by affective anger contagion.

AB  - One of the direct effect of current COVID-19 pandemic' social distancing on an unspecified period of time urges us to compensate our lack of physical connection with our readiness in the online environments, especially social media platforms. Present research investigates to which extent the internet content awareness construct, difficulties in emotional regulation and online duality have an impact on predicting future helping attitudes of bystanders. In order to investigate the eligibility of this prediction model, our team has advanced the Erasmus+ funded project Hate's Journey. In 2019, our research team has designed a multiple specific sections online questionnaire addressing 206 youth from Latvia, Turkey, Spain and Romania. We have used a multiple linear regression analysis. The obtained results validate our hypothesis, confirming that if an individual is characterized by a decreased internet content awareness, a high level of difficulties in emotional regulation and increased online duality, then there is a 37% probability that the youth bystanders will develop a lack of helping attitudes towards the victims when facing a digital hate speech context. Conclusions and implications regarding to the current pandemic social distancing and digital closeness effects over the prosocial behaviour are discussed.

AB  - Based on two cross-sectional probability samples (Study 1: N = 1,382, Study 2: N = 1,587), we studied the interplay between positive and negative intergroup contact, different types of intergroup emotions (i.e., episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact and more general chronic intergroup emotions), and outgroup behavior in the context of intergroup relations between non-immigrant Germans and foreigners living in Germany. In Study 1, we showed that positive and negative contact are related to specific episodic intergroup emotions (i.e., anger, fear and happiness). Results of Study 2 indicate an indirect effect of episodic intergroup emotions encountered during contact experiences on specific behavioral tendencies directed at outgroup members via more chronic situation-independent intergroup emotions. As expected, anger predicted approaching (discriminatory) behavioral tendencies (i.e., aggression) while fear predicted avoidance. The results extend the existing literature on intergroup contact and emotions by addressing positive and negative contact simultaneously and differentiating between situation-specific episodic and chronic intergroup emotions in predicting discriminatory behavioral tendencies.

AB  - There has recently been a call for the use of more diverse images by the media to promote body satisfaction. This experimental study evaluated the impact of body diversity images and whether these could act as a buffer against thin-ideal norms. Female participants (n = 106, aged 16-30 years) completed measures of body compassion, body and face satisfaction before and after random allocation to images reflecting one of three interventions: control, body diversity and thin-ideal. Attitudes towards thin-ideal images were also assessed. The results showed significant differences between groups for overall body compassion, the body compassion subtype of body kindness, body satisfaction and face satisfaction with those viewing the body diversity images reporting higher scores after exposure compared to the other two groups. Those in the body diversity group also displayed more negative attitudes towards thin-ideal images compared to controls. No between groups differences were found for body compassion subtypes relating to common humanity, motivated action and body criticism or positive attitudes to the thin-ideal images. In sum, exposure to body diversity images had a positive impact on body kindness and overall body compassion and body satisfaction providing experimental support for the use of diversity images as a buffer against thin-deals.

AB  - Contemporary mobile technologies offer tablets and smartphones that elicit young children's active participation in various educational apps, dramatically transforming playing, learning, and communication. Even the most knowledgeable users face difficulties in deciding about the value and appropriateness of the so-called educational apps because of many factors that should be considered. Their importance for children's attitudes is affected by the perceived positive and negative aspects, which vary across a multiplicity of criteria. Filling the gap in the relevant literature, a new instrument, named PEAU-p (Perceptions about Educational Apps Use-parents), was developed and validated in the present study designed to measure parents' perception of educational apps for kindergarten pupils. Data (N = 435) were collected via online procedures, and the psychometric properties of PEAU-p were studied via exploratory and confirmatory methods. Principal Components Analysis extracted six factors, namely Usability, Enjoyment, Involvement, Learning, Worries, and Values, which explained 72.42% of the total variance. Subsequently, by implementing Latent Class Analysis based on the above factors, four Clusters (i.e., parents' Profiles) were extracted corresponding to their perceptions and attitudes towards the educational apps used for kindergarten pupils. Those were named as 'mild attitude', 'negative attitude', 'positive attitude', and 'indifferent attitude'. This categorization, besides the statistical support, is fully interpretable, and the profiles were associated with certain covariates, such as age, the number of children, knowledge on new technologies, or distal outcomes, e.g., the frequency of using apps, the general position towards apps or their intention to recommend apps use. The findings are discussed within the current research field, investigating the influential role parents play in young children's media selection and use.

TI  - Asynchrony Between Individual and Government Actions Accounts for Disproportionate Impact of COVID-19 on Vulnerable Communities
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction: Previously estimated effects of social distancing do not account for changes in individual behavior before the implementation of stay-at-home policies or model this behavior in relation to the burden of disease. This study aims to assess the asynchrony between individual behavior and government stay-at-home orders, quantify the true impact of social distancing using mobility data, and explore the sociodemographic variables linked to variation in social distancing practices.
   Methods: This study was a retrospective investigation that leveraged mobility data to quantify the time to behavioral change in relation to the initial presence of COVID-19 and the implementation of government stay-at-home orders. The impact of social distancing that accounts for both individual behavior and testing data was calculated using generalized mixed models. The role of sociodemographics in accounting for variation in social distancing behavior was modeled using a 10-fold cross-validated elastic net (linear machine learning model). Analysis was conducted in April.July 2020.
   Results: Across all the 1,124 counties included in this analysis, individuals began to socially distance at a median of 5 days (IQR=3-8) after 10 cumulative cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in their state, with state governments taking a median of 15 days (IQR=12-19) to enact stay-at-home orders. Overall, people began social distancing at a median of 12 days (IQR=8-17) before their state enacted stay-at-home orders. Of the 16 studies included in the review, 13 exclusively used government dates as a proxy for social distancing behavior, and none accounted for both testing and mobility. Using government stay-at-home dates as a proxy for social distancing (10.2% decrease in the number of daily cases) accounted for only 55% of the true impact of the intervention when compared with estimates using mobility (18.6% reduction). Using 10-fold cross-validation, 23 of 43 sociodemographic variables were significantly and independently predictive of variation in individual social distancing, with delays corresponding to an increase in a county's proportion of people without a high school diploma and proportion of racial and ethnic minorities.
   Conclusions: This retrospective analysis of mobility patterns found that social distancing behavior occurred well before the onset of government stay-at-home dates. This asynchrony leads to the underestimation of the impact of social distancing. Sociodemographic characteristics associated with delays in social distancing can help explain the disproportionate case burden and mortality among vulnerable communities.

AB  - Post-armed conflict societies usually continue to suffer intergroup tensions and delegitimization of the other group's collective narratives. This study aimed to explore intergroup relations in the context of post-armed conflict between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo. We expected subjective experience of interpersonal power (SEIP) to mediate the relationships between sense of community coherence (SOCC) and perceptions of contradictory collective narratives. Data were collected in Kosovo by self-administered questionnaires among 202 Albanians (87 women) and 122 Serbs (49 women) from 18 to 69 years old. The results confirmed the suggested model, and SEIP mediated the relationships between SOCC and perceptions of the ingroup's and outgroups' collective narratives among both Serb and Albanian participants. The discussion is focused on the roles of SEIP, SOCC, and perceptions of ingroup and outgroup collective narratives for the maintenance of intergroup tension in a post-armed conflict context.

AB  - This data article describes the attitudes of German and Chinese respondents to some measures taken against the COVID-19 pandemic such as social distancing and face masks wearing, as well as their trust in government actions. The data were collected through six online surveys conducted between March 23 to September 15 2020 from 865 participants in Germany, 135 in China and 169 participants with Chinese roots in Germany. The data were partly used in related research papers in which the theoretical background, analysis of the survey variables and the interpretation of the findings are presented in detail [1,2]. These survey data can be used in future studies of individual perception of the measures taken in the fight against the pandemic. The data cover topics which include, in particular, worries about the pandemic, estimations and expectations concerning the further development of the pandemic, perception of government responses and media coverage, attitudes towards social distancing and other countermeasures, and COVID-19-related conspiracy theories. Differences between Chinese and German respondents on some of these issues can also be studied with this dataset. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Virtual reality (VR) has been widely applied in medical health areas and the entertainment and tourism industries, in which elderly people are a primary target. However, most studies on VR have focused on how people respond to this new technology and its effects on younger generations. Our study explored the differences in VR experience and acceptance between elderly adults and college students. A mixed method approach including both experiments and in-depth interviews was applied in this study. Our results show that elderly adults reported a higher level of telepresence and stronger emotional responses than young adults in VR viewing regardless of the VR device. The ways in which elderly people processed and evaluated VR content and devices were different from those of young people. Elderly people reported more positive attitudes toward the video they watched than young people, but this did not necessarily lead to more positive attitudes toward the viewing experience.

KW  - effectiveness of media online learning
AB  - The author intends to investigate the role of social distancing laws in the new normal as well as the effectiveness of forced shift to media online learning. This research indicates that student involvement had a moderating influence during the epidemic. This study is based on social learning theory (SLT), which endeavors to emulate the behavior, perceptions, and emotions of other individuals. The data were obtained from various Chinese universities. We gathered data utilizing the stratified sample approach as well as Google Form. A total of 256 students enrolled in a variety of programs at Chinese universities completed a questionnaire for this investigation. The direct, mediating, and moderating effects of the variables were evaluated using partial least square structural equation modeling in this study (PLS-SEM), using the Smart-PLS software 3.0. According to the findings, forced shift to media online learning acts as a mediator between the lack of social interaction, perceived harm, perception of maintaining social distancing, and the law, and the effectiveness of media online learning has a significant effect on the effectiveness of media online learning. In addition, student engagement appears to be a moderator between the forced shift to media online learning and its effectiveness. A future study might concentrate on gaining a deeper understanding of the numerous online engagement-promoting behaviors. Teachers must go above and above to provide themes that enable pupils to connect while learning. Instructors and educational institutions will benefit from the research since it will allow them to define methods for boosting social interaction in online learning and analyze methods for enhancing the efficacy of media in online learning.

AB  - Objective: Attitude toward aging is an important indicator for measuring the wellbeing of older people, and a vital part of active and healthy aging. We aimed to assess the relationship between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging held by older people and to determine the mediating role of health.
   Method: We analyzed the data of 10,792 Chinese people over age 60 from the 2014 Chinese Longitudinal Aging Social Survey. We used multiple linear regression models and the two-stage least-squares model to explore the correlation between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging. Furthermore, we applied structural equation modeling to test for mediation effects of different aspects of health.
   Results: We found that volunteer service was significantly associated with attitudes toward aging (p = 0.335, p < 0.001), while self-assessed health, physical health, and mental health played a mediating role between volunteer service and attitudes toward aging held by older adults.
   Conclusions: In exploring ways to cope with the challenges brought about by the aging of the population, we found that participating in volunteer services not only improves older people's self-assessed physical, and mental health, but also improves their positive attitudes toward aging. Therefore, under the framework of active and healthy aging, volunteer service and participation in social activities can enhance social vitality and welfare, reduce social burden, and improve quality of life.

AB  - Prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, discussions about online learning referred to the use of e-learning platforms and social networks as auxiliary tools in the educational process. Due to the pandemic, universities were forced to adopt an exclusive online teaching process and most universities today use platforms dedicated to online learning such as Moodle platforms. In this context, we were interested in analyzing the attitude of students regarding the way social networks could be integrated into the educational process, and if the positive attitude of students towards social networks and their use for academic purposes, proven in previous studies, remains positive under the conditions generated by the pandemic. In this regard, the present study aimed at identifying the attitude of Romanian students towards the use of Facebook and Instagram as educational tools and the circumstances in which students believe these platforms could be used by them and their teachers. An online survey was conducted on 872 students from public higher education institutions in Romania. Based on the exploratory factor analysis and the parametric test, the empirical results show that students have a slightly positive attitude towards using Facebook in the educational process, but they have a more reticent, less positive attitude towards using Instagram. Thus, the most appropriate contexts in which these platforms could be used are represented by extracurricular activities. A higher preference for the use of Facebook rather than Instagram, was identified among master and PhD students. No major differences were revealed in student subgroups sorted by gender or study domain.

AB  - To understand why bereaved people who are highly distressed significantly underutilize grief counseling and therapy, we surveyed adults (N = 156) to investigate community attitudes toward grief counseling. Overall attitude was positive and women reported a significantly more positive attitude than men; there were no associations between attitude and age, country of birth, previous counseling, or bereavement experience. After controlling for gender, beliefs and affects explained attitudes toward grief counseling; behavioral responses did not. Targeting beliefs about grief counseling may promote positive attitudes so that people most likely to benefit from intervention will be more likely to seek it.

AB  - In 2020, the World Health Organization has characterized COVID-19, a disease caused by infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, as a pandemic. Although a few vaccines and drugs have been approved to, respectively, prevent or treat the disease, several clinical trials are still ongoing to test new vaccines or drugs to mitigate the burden of the pandemic. Few studies have shown the role of host genetics in disease prognosis and drug response highlighting the importance of diverse participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The goal of this study is to assess public attitudes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan toward participating in COVID-19 clinical trials and to identify the factors that may influence their attitude. An online questionnaire was developed and distributed among the target group through social media platforms. The number of responses was 1,576. Three quarters (74.9%) of participants heard about clinical trials before, 57.6% of them had a positive attitude toward participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. The conduct of clinical trials in accordance with the scientific, research, and ethical guidelines was a strong predictor of willingness to participate in clinical trials. Other positive factors also included protection of family from COVID-19 and contributing to the return to normal community life as well as receiving additional healthcare benefit was the fourth significant predictor. On the other hand, the thought that clinical trials can have a negative impact on the health of participants strongly predicted the unwillingness of individuals to participate in such trials. This was followed by having limited information about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 and the lack of trust in physicians and hospitals. In general, Arab citizens are accepting the concept and have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 clinical trials. Increasing awareness of COVID-19 and clinical trials, enforcing the concept of altruism, and placing clear policies in conducting clinical trials are needed to increase participation in clinical trials among Arabs.

AB  - As a consequence of increasing human-wildlife encounters, the associated potential for human-wildlife conflict rises. The dependency of conservation management actions on the acceptance or even the participation of people requires modern conservation strategies that take the human dimension of wildlife management into account. In the first place, conservationists therefore need to understand how people perceive wildlife. In the present study, we examined how wildlife perception varies with people's socio-demographic backgrounds in terms of age, gender, and education as well as the settlement structure of people's living environment and their general life satisfaction, using the red fox (Vulpes vulpes) as a model species. We used an interview-based survey of 2,646 participants, representative for the German population, for investigating their knowledge about, risk perception of, and attitude toward red foxes. We found a negative correlation between age and the risks perceived regarding foxes. Moreover, men held a more positive attitude and perceived less risk than women. Higher education was also associated with lower risk perception and a more positive attitude. The results further indicated that people who live in rural areas perceived higher risks regarding foxes and showed a less positive attitude than people in urban or suburban areas. Finally, people who perceived higher risks and held a less positive attitude supported lethal population management actions more often. However, we also found that perceived risks decreased with participants' general life satisfaction. Hence, wildlife perception is affected by various factors. Understanding the factors affecting wildlife perception is crucial for environmental communication and for fostering acceptance of conservation measures to improve conservation strategies.

AB  - In recent years, the price of small agricultural products has both plummeted and skyrocketed, which has a great impact on people's lives. Studying the factors affecting the price fluctuation of small agricultural products is of great significance for stabilizing their price. With the development and application of social media, farmers and consumers are more greatly influenced by online public opinion, resulting in irrational planting behavior or purchasing behavior, which has a complex impact on the price of small agricultural products. Taking garlic as an example, we crawled through network public opinions about garlic price from January 2015 to December 2020 using web crawler technology. Then, the network public opinions were quantified using a natural language processing and time-varying parameter vector autoregression (NLP-TVP-VAR) model to empirically analyze their dynamic influence on garlic price fluctuation. It was found that both public attitude and public attention have a short-term influence on garlic price fluctuation, and the influences of each differ according to direction, intensity and timing. The influence of public attitude on garlic price fluctuation is positive, while the influence of public attention on garlic price fluctuation is largely negative. The influence intensity of public attitude is stronger than of public attention on garlic price fluctuation. The influence of public attitude on garlic price fluctuation shows a trend of intensifying, while that of public attention has been weaker than in previous years. In addition, based on the results of our study, we present some recommendations for improving the comprehensive information platform and price fluctuation early warning system for the whole industry chain of small agricultural products.

AB  - This article is aimed to examine the effect of Uyghur's (minority group) positive and negative extended contact with Han (majority group) within the background of China. One affective (intergroup anxiety) and two cognitive (perceived in-group and out-group norms) variables were tested as potential mediators. A sample of 875 Uyghur minority college students ranging in age from 17 to 25 years completed self-reported measures of direct contact, positive and negative extended contact, intergroup anxiety, perceptions of in-group and out-group norms, out-group attitudes, and contact intentions. Results revealed that both positive and negative extended contact were associated with out-group attitudes and contact intentions, over and above the effect of direct contact. The effects of both forms of extended contact were mediated by intergroup anxiety, perceived in-group, and out-group norms. Notably, positive extended contact exerted larger effects than negative extended contact. This research highlights the significance of considering both positive and negative extended contact and the potential of extended contact as a means to ameliorate intergroup relations from the perspective of minority groups.

AB  - Although the effects of direct and indirect forms of contact on intergroup relations are well documented, little is known about their longitudinal co-development. Based on the social-psychological literature, we hypothesize that indirect contact predicts future direct contact by reducing intergroup anxiety. Across five longitudinal studies (Study 1: German adults, N = 560; Study 2: German, Dutch, and Swedish school students, N = 6,600; Study 3: Northern Irish children, N = 1,593; Study 4: Northern Irish adults, N = 404; Study 5: German adults, N = 735), we systematically examined this effect, and further tested the mediating role of intergroup anxiety in Studies 3 to 5. Cross-lagged models provided consistent evidence for the positive effect of indirect contact on future direct contact, whereas a reduction in intergroup anxiety mediates this effect in most models. Results highlight the importance of indirect contact, which has the potential to increase direct contact, and thus promote social cohesion in diverse contexts, over time.

AB  - This study examines the social and professional distance characterizing the source-reporter relationship and provides an opportunity to develop a theoretical and methodological model integrating coorientation measures with third-person perceptions. A web survey of 206 public relations practitioners and journalists in South Korea showed both false dissensus and social distance among each professional group as enacted through the source-reporter relationship. Public relations professionals and journalists disagreed with each other and inaccurately predicted responses of the other. Their inaccurate projection of the views of the other profession was greater than their disagreement on two dimensions of conflict and strategy. This study illuminates dimensions of the third-person perception of public relations professionals and journalists, insofar as both journalists and public relations professionals suggested social distance from the other profession similar to the distance they perceived from the general public.

AB  - This study expands the consequences of agenda-setting theory beyond political attitudes, arguing its significance as a mediator between media use and political participation. The results suggest that citizens learn from the media about the efficacy and integrity of political institutions, and their performance on key issues. Consequently, the information acquired through news media becomes an important factor for trust formation and participation in different forms of political actions, which are not limited to electoral activities. The implications of these results for democracy building are discussed.

AB  - A politics of resentment has shaped a low-dialogue political environment in the United States, feeding into populism, and characterized by perceived distributive injustice, detachment between politicians and "the people", and political polarization. In this political environment, independent of editorial lines, news can spread based on populist content features and drive the political divide even further. However, we still do not understand well, how the forces of political disconnect as well as potentially unifying elements such as political knowledge and the willingness to connect with the other (political) side predict audience interest in populist news featuring people-centrism, anti-elitism, restoring popular sovereignty, and the exclusion of others. To better understand what drives (dis-)interest in populist news features, we combined self-report data from a non-student US sample (N = 440) on political attitudes with unobtrusively measured data on their selective exposure to populist news. We analyzed the data using zero-inflated negative binomial regression models, in which we simultaneously modeled selective exposure to and avoidance of populist news. The findings indicate that especially the will to connect with others explained exposure to news about anti-elitism, especially among Democrats, while Republicans' news avoidance seems to be specifically geared toward people-centrism. Populist communication features promoting "us" vs. "them" dichotomies seem to not automatically resonate with the views of resentful voters and their motivated reasoning.

AB  - The practice of adopting Anglo names among ethnic minorities and foreign individuals may be intended to smooth interactions with majority group members, but it may also have negative implications for minorities themselves. Two studies investigated the associations among adoption of Anglo names, self-esteem, and other psychological outcomes. Chinese college students studying in the United States completed a battery of questions regarding adoption of Anglo names, self-esteem, mental and physical health, and well-being. In Study 1, path analyses indicated that adoption of Anglo names was negatively associated with self-esteem, and self-esteem mediated the relationships between adopting Anglo names and other psychological outcomes. In Study 2, path analyses replicated the results of Study 1. However, contrary to predictions, perceived discrimination did not predict adoption of Anglo names in the path model. These findings point to negative consequences associated with adopting Anglo names. These results contribute to the literature on the importance of names and shed light on interventions to improve intergroup relations and curriculum development in language teaching.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) among healthcare workers at District 2 Hospital in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC). Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed between January 2020 and February 2020 at District 2 Hospital. A systematic random sampling strategy was carried out and the data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire of the knowledge and attitude of healthcare workers regarding COVID-19. Descriptive analysis was reported to describe the demographic, mean knowledge and attitude score of healthcare workers. Inferential statistics including t-test, ANOVA and Spearman's correlation were used to evaluate the relationship between study variables. Results: A total of 327 eligible healthcare workers had a mean score of knowledge and attitude of 8.17 +/- 1.3 (range 4-10) and 1.86 +/- 0.43 (range 1-5), respectively. They showed good knowledge and a positive attitude. However, approximately two thirds of the participants knew the mode of transmission, the isolation period and treatment (67.0%, 65.8%, and 58.4%, respectively), and 82.3% and 79.8%, respectively, held positive attitude regarding the risk of personal and family members getting illness. There was a negative correlation between knowledge scores and attitude scores (r=-0.21, P<0.001). Additionally, healthcare workerspredominately used social media to inform themselves about COVID-19 (91.1%). Conclusions: The majority of healthcare workers had good knowledge and positive attitude toward COVID-19. However, the level of some knowledge and attitude lower than that expected for their position level towards the virus. Additional education interventions and campaigns are required for healthcare workers.

AB  - We consider how social and psychological connections among CEOs explain the propensity for corporate leaders to distance themselves socially from journalists who engage in negative reporting about firm leadership at other companies, and we examine the consequences for the valence of journalists' subsequent coverage. Our theoretical framework suggests that journalists who have engaged in negative coverage of a firm's leadership and strategy are especially likely to experience distancing from other leaders who (a) have friendship ties to the firm's CEO, (b) are demographically similar to the CEO on salient dimensions, or (c) are socially identified with the CEO as a fellow member of the corporate elite. Our theory and findings ultimately suggest that, due to the multiple sources of social identification between CEOs, journalists who engage in negative coverage of firm leadership tend to experience social distancing from multiple CEOs, and that such distancing has a powerful influence on the valence of journalists' subsequent reporting about firm leadership and strategy across all the firms they cover. We also extend our theoretical framework to suggest how the effect of social distancing on the valence of journalists' coverage is moderated by the early and late stages of the journalists' career.

AB  - Technology, particularly information technology (IT), is changing rapidly and offers many advantages for users. IT has the potential to improve one's quality of life, but only if used. Research has shown that, in most developed and developing nations, senior use of IT lags behind that of other segments of society. This "gray divide" is a concern for government, business, and others. Concern about senior adoption and use of IT has been the motivation for numerous studies and is the motivation for this study of Chinese seniors. This exploratory study examines urban Chinese seniors' IT use, computers and mobile phones in particular, but also their attitudes and behaviors as they relate to the use of those devices. More specifically it examines several potential factors that motivate or hinder senior's use of information technology, including self-efficacy, satisfaction, comfort with technology, and both positive and negative attitudes. This study provides some insight into the quantity and diversity of Chinese senior technology use in urban China. Particularly noteworthy, the study found that technology ownership was quite high, and in general the Chinese seniors studied had positive attitudes and beliefs concerning information technology. This is generally good news for the Chinese government, which must efficiently provide services for the growing population of Chinese seniors, as well as for businesses that wish to capitalize on one of the largest senior populations in the world.

AB  - Objective: To investigate attitudes towards schizophrenia and people with schizophrenia presented in YouTube videos.
   Methods: We searched YouTube using the search terms "schizophrenia" and "psychosis" in Finnish and Greek language on April 3rd, 2013. The first 20 videos from each search (N = 80) were retrieved. Deductive content analysis was first applied for coding and data interpretation and it was followed by descriptive statistical analysis.
   Results: A total of 52 videos were analyzed (65%). The majority of the videos were in the "Music" category (50%, n = 26). Most of the videos (83%, n = 43) tended to present schizophrenia in a negative way, while less than a fifth (17%, n = 9) presented schizophrenia in a positive or neutral way. Specifically, the most common negative attitude towards schizophrenia was dangerousness (29%, n = 15), while the most often identified positive attitude was objective, medically appropriate beliefs (21%, n = 11). All attitudes identified were similarly present in the Finnish and Greek videos, without any statistically significant difference.
   Conclusions: Negative presentations of schizophrenia are most likely to be accessed when searching YouTube for schizophrenia in Finnish and Greek language. More research is needed to investigate to what extent, if any, YouTube viewers' attitudes are affected by the videos they watch.

AB  - The multicultural perspective is an ideological orientation that values the recognition and inclusion of diverse ethnic and cultural groups as sources of identity and culture that are favorable to society, because they promote positive intergroup relations and social equality. However, there are conditions that moderate the constructive effects such a perspective potentially yields. In this research, we used experimental procedures to examine the effects of a multicultural perspective on levels of implicit and explicit prejudice aimed at Gitanos (Spanish Roma). In Study 1, we manipulated the content of a newspaper article to generate three conditions, which were (a) the multicultural perspective, (b) the use of counter-stereotypical exemplars, and (c) the control. In Study 2, we not only evaluated the effect of the manipulation of the multicultural perspective relative to the control, we also assessed the extent to which symbolic and realistic outgroup threats moderate the effect of a multicultural perspective on implicit prejudice. Results showed lower levels of implicit prejudice in the multicultural condition than in the control condition. The multicultural perspective effectively reduced implicit prejudice when the perceived threat was low, but yielded no such observable effect when the perceived threat was high.

AB  - Background: Although a wide range of preventive and clinical interventions has targeted cardiovascular risk management (CVRM), outcomes remain suboptimal. Therefore, the question is what additional determinants of CVRM and outcomes can be identified and addressed to optimize CVRM. In this study, we aimed to identify new perspectives for improving healthcare delivery and explored associations between information exchange networks of health care providers and evidence-based CVRM.
   Methods: This observational study was performed parallel to a randomized clinical trial which aimed to improve professional performance of practice nurses in the Netherlands. Information exchange on medical policy for CVRM ("general information networks") and CVRM for individual patients ("specific information networks") of 180 health professionals in 31 general practices was measured with personalized questionnaires. Medical record audit was performed concerning 1620 patients in these practices to document quality of care delivery and two risk factors (systolic blood pressure (SBP) and LDL cholesterol level). Hypothesized effects of five network characteristics (density, frequency of contact, centrality of CVRM-coordinators, homophily on positive attitudes for treatment target achievement, and presence of an opinion leader for CVRM) constructed on both general and specific information exchange networks were tested and controlled for practice and patient factors using logistic multilevel analyses.
   Results: Odds for adequate performance were enhanced in practices with an opinion leader for CVRM (OR 2.75, p <.05). Odds for achievement of SBP targets were reduced in practices who had networks with low homophily on positive attitudes for SBP and LDL targets (homophily for SBP targets OR 0.57, p <.05 and OR 0.60, p <.05, homophily for LDL targets OR 0.59, p <.05 and OR 0.61, p <.05 in general and specific information networks, respectively). No effects of network characteristics on cholesterol were found.
   Conclusions: Delivery of evidence-based CVRM is associated with homophily of clinical attitudes and presence of opinion leaders in primary care teams. These results signal the potential of social networks to be taken into account in further attempts to improve the implementation of evidence-based care for CVRM. Future research is needed to identify and formulate optimal strategies for using opinion leaders to improve CVRM. Future interventions may be more effective if they target a common vision on CVRM within practices.

AB  - Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to identify strategies that counteract these negative representations. Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70% more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130% increase in acceptance of sharks and a 46% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors), and negative framing influenced negative changes (25% more negative attitudes toward sharks, a 18% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a 3% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for encouraging tolerance for sharks.

Design/methodology/approach Using the data collected from two US 4-year public universities, this study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test the impacts of the key variables, direct-negative and indirect-negative contact experience, on the students' attitudes toward the police. This study also tests whether indirect negative contact with the police is a stronger factor than direct negative contacts among racial/ethnic minority people. Findings Results show that both direct-negative and indirect-negative contacts are stronger predictors of the dependent variable. In particular, the indirect-negative contact has significant direct and indirect effects through social distance on the dependent variable in racial minorities. The study also shows that indirect contact more strongly affects racial minorities than direct-negative contact experiences do. Originality/value This study is the first sophisticatedly to examine students' negative contact experiences into two variables: direct-negative and indirect-negative contacts with the police.

AB  - Objective To understand if attitudes to aging mediate the reciprocal effects of health anxiety and physical functioning among older adults with medical conditions. We examined: (1) if these effects are reciprocal; (2) if attitudes to aging (psychological loss, psychological growth, physical change) play a mediating role in these effects. Design A sample of 226 community-dwelling older adults (T1 age range = 65-94, mean age = 73.59, SD = 6.29) reporting at least one chronic medical condition completed two phone interviews across six months. Main outcome measures Background measures, health anxiety, physical functioning, and attitudes to aging at T1 and T2. Results T2 attitudes to aging served as a mediator controlling for T1 attitudes. There was a direct effect of worse physical functioning at T1 on increased health anxieties at T2. Negative (but not positive) attitudes to aging mediated that effect. The reversed temporal sequencing (T1 health anxiety leading to T2 physical functioning) was significant only when mediated by negative attitudes to aging. Conclusions Findings suggest that viewing aging as mostly a time of losses (but not as a time of gains) serves as an important mechanism through which health anxieties and physical functioning affect each other among older adults having chronic medical conditions.

AB  - Several cross-sectional studies have examined factors associated with support for tobacco control policies. The current study utilized a longitudinal design to test smoking status and attitude toward smoking measured in adolescence as prospective predictors of support for tobacco control policies measured in adulthood.
   Participants (N = 4,834) were from a longitudinal study of a Midwestern community-based sample. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses tested adolescent smoking status and attitude toward smoking as prospective predictors (after controlling for sociodemographic factors, adult smoking status, and adult attitude toward smoking) of support for regulation of smoking in public places, discussion of the dangers of smoking in public schools, prohibiting smoking in bars, eliminating smoking on television and in movies, prohibiting smoking in restaurants, and increasing taxes on cigarettes.
   Participants who smoked during adolescence demonstrated more support for discussion of the dangers of smoking in public schools and less support for increasing taxes on cigarettes but only among those who smoked as adults. Those with more positive attitudes toward smoking during adolescence demonstrated less support as adults for prohibiting smoking in bars and eliminating smoking on television and in movies. Moreover, a significant interaction indicated that those with more positive attitudes toward smoking as adolescents demonstrated less support as adults for prohibiting smoking in restaurants, but only if they became parents as adults.
   This study's findings suggest that interventions designed to deter adolescent smoking may have future benefits in increasing support for tobacco control policies.

AB  - Criminalization of social groups can create new norms for intergroup relations. An example for this is the 2018 amendment to the Hungarian Fundamental Law, which openly criminalizes homeless people. In our research, we investigated whether criminalization of homelessness can become a source of justifying violence against homeless people in the Hungarian context. We assumed that right-wing authoritarianism and social dominance orientation would positively predict support for violence against the homeless, and the acceptance of a criminalizing law can serve as a justification for this. Our hypotheses were tested using a convenience (N = 196) and a representative sample of the population of Budapest (N = 674). We found that both RWA and SDO predicted support for violence, and this connection was mediated by the new law. We also found that justification was influenced by educational level, as the association between SDO and violence increased with higher levels of education.

AB  - The present research identified why and under what conditions perpetrator groups expect forgiveness from victims when focused on common humanity. In Experiment 1 (N = 41), thinking about victims as fellow humans increased expectations of forgiveness among perpetrator group members. Experiment 2 (N = 74) revealed the important role of subjective temporal distance in qualifying the effect of appealing to common humanity. Forgiveness expectations increased when a transgression was perceived as temporally distant rather than close. Experiment 3 (N = 70) found that expecting forgiveness was associated negatively with remorse for wrongdoing and revealed reduced empathy for victims as a mediator of the effect. Taken together, the findings reveal that factors shown to encourage forgiveness among victims can also create corresponding expectations among perpetrators. Unfortunately, this process is more likely to damage than repair intergroup relations.

AB  - Focusing on exposure level and attitudes of the Israeli public, in the context of gender differences, we look at the #MeToo campaign in social media. To identify whether attitudes toward #MeToo mirror attitudes toward media as a channel of social norms, data were gathered from a survey distributed to 617 participants: 253 (40.9%) men and 364 (59.1%) women, with an average age of 34.5, SD 10.83. More than 90% of the participants were familiar with the #MeToo campaign. Most participants supported the campaign and its objectives, while positive attitudes toward the media were significantly related to positive attitudes toward the #MeToo campaign. Significant gender differences were found in attitudes toward the ability of the media to influence social norms and toward the #MeToo campaign. Women have more positive associations with #MeToo than men; hence, the #MeToo campaign is representative of women taking a positive stance toward media and social change. This research offers a new multiple model for predicting attitudes toward media campaigns, revealing that attitudes toward the #MeToo campaign are influenced by perception of the media.

AB  - Consumer research has demonstrated that emotions play an important role in the decision-making process. Individuals may use consumption or purchasing as a way to manage their emotions. This research develops a model to help explain the process by which individuals engage in consumption to manage their emotions, and examines the efficacy of an advertisement for a hedonic product that uses affect-laden language to stimulate such a process. Results suggest that favourable emotional responses from an advertisement can lead to positive attitudes towards the advertisement, prefactual thinking in the form of hedonic rationalisations and greater behavioural intentions. Additionally, guilt from consuming and purchasing these hedonic products can be mitigated, which is also associated with greater behavioural intentions. Findings have implications for marketers and advertisers of hedonic products.

AB  - Objectives Radiologists' perception is likely to influence the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) into clinical practice. We investigated knowledge and attitude towards AI by radiologists and residents in Europe and beyond. Methods Between April and July 2019, a survey on fear of replacement, knowledge, and attitude towards AI was accessible to radiologists and residents. The survey was distributed through several radiological societies, author networks, and social media. Independent predictors of fear of replacement and a positive attitude towards AI were assessed using multivariable logistic regression. Results The survey was completed by 1,041 respondents from 54 mostly European countries. Most respondents were male (n = 670, 65%), median age was 38 (24-74) years, n = 142 (35%) residents, and n = 471 (45%) worked in an academic center. Basic AI-specific knowledge was associated with fear (adjusted OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.10-2.21, p = 0.01), while intermediate AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.40, 95% CI 0.20-0.80, p = 0.01) or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 0.43, 95% CI 0.21-0.90, p = 0.03) was inversely associated with fear. A positive attitude towards AI was observed in 48% (n = 501) and was associated with only having heard of AI, intermediate (adjusted OR 11.65, 95% CI 4.25-31.92, p < 0.001), or advanced AI-specific knowledge (adjusted OR 17.65, 95% CI 6.16-50.54, p < 0.001). Conclusions Limited AI-specific knowledge levels among radiology residents and radiologists are associated with fear, while intermediate to advanced AI-specific knowledge levels are associated with a positive attitude towards AI. Additional training may therefore improve clinical adoption.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a research study on the attitude of Indian teacher educators towards technology-enabled learning (TEL); if any age, gender, teaching position, and mode of teaching differences existed in their attitude; and their attitude to TEL post-pandemic when the imposed remote teaching may cease to exist. An online survey was conducted on 20 teacher education institutions, to which 112 educators responded. The results indicated that teacher educators had positive attitude towards TEL generally; that age, gender and teaching position did not influence their attitude to TEL, though open and distance learning (ODL) teacher educators showed more positive attitude than their campus-based counterparts. Their attitude towards use of TEL, post-Covid, focused more on the parameters of open educational resources (OER), institutional repository, multimedia-based teaching, and faculty capacity building. The results have been discussed in relation to previous research studies, the existing teacher education policy, and institutional contexts of teacher education.

AB  - Making the work of security organizations known to school children is a means of mitigating feelings of insecurity provoked by the diffusion of information on terrorist attacks in communications media and through social media. Whilst there is a longer tradition of projects to educate school children on the police and the armed forces, no comparable projects have been found on the intelligence services. With the objective of filling this gap, the authors designed and produced two animated educational videos for Spanish school children on the Spanish intelligence service: The National Intelligence Center (CNI). In this paper, the impact of the videos is measured in relation to the knowledge, the stereotypes, and the attitudes of school children towards the CNI. To do so, two questionnaires were administered to 1,092 school children aged 8 and 12, before and after viewing the videos. The results of the questionnaire prior to screening the videos showed that the school children held no knowledge of the intelligence services, and expressed highly developed stereotypes, and moderately negative attitudes towards them. Student-t tests for related samples were used to confirm the responses, on the basis of which it was found that the videos modified both knowledge and stereotyping, as well as attitudes towards the CNI. Specifically, following the screenings the knowledge of the school children improved, stereotyping diminished, and positive attitudes increased.

AB  - We examined the associations between intimate partner violence (IPV) before and during pregnancy, negative attitudes toward pregnancy, and mother-to-fetus bonding. Participants were 636 pregnant women in the third trimester, who completed the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale, Violence Against Women Screen, and ad hoc questions (for IPV before pregnancy, negative attitudes, and demographics). We found association between IPV during pregnancy and mother-to-fetus bonding failure was mediated by negative attitudes toward pregnancy in the third trimester. IPV before pregnancy was associated with negative attitudes at the beginning of pregnancy, which predicted negative attitudes in the third trimester and mother-to-fetus bonding failure. Careful assessments and psychological interventions are needed to reduce negative attitudes toward pregnancy among abused women in antenatal health settings to prevent mother-to-fetus bonding failure.

AB  - The current work assessed the impact of the 2012 Paralympic Games on psychological factors operating during interactions between physically disabled and nondisabled group members. In a two-wave longitudinal design, the pre- to post-Paralympic increase in exposure to Paralympic media coverage led to more positive in-group norms about disabled people's competence and improved intergroup contact quality among both physically disabled and nondisabled participants. Moreover, more positive norms about disabled people's competence partially mediated the relationship between media exposure and contact quality. However, exposure to Paralympic media coverage did not appear to impact embarrassment about intergroup contact within either group. Findings are discussed in terms of the efficacy and limitations of Paralympic media coverage to improve intergroup relations in the mixed physical ability context.

AB  - Background: Quality assurance has become an important issue. Many societies are adopting quality assurance programs in order to monitor and improve quality of care. Aim: To assess the opinion of gastroenterologists towards quality assurance on the endoscopy department.
   Methods: A survey was sent to all gastroenterologists (n = 319)in the Netherlands. It assessed their opinion on a quality assurance program for endoscopy units, including its design, logistics, and content.
   Results: 200 gastroenterologists (63%) completed the questionnaire. 95% had a positive opinion towards quality assurance and 67% supposed an increase in quality. 28% assumed a negative impact on the time available for patient contact by introducing a quality assurance program and 35% that the capacity would decrease. A negative attitude towards disclosure of results to insurance companies (23%) and media (53%) was reported. Female gastroenterologists were less positive to share the results with other stakeholders (p < 0.05).
   Most important quality measurements were assessment of complications (97%), standardised reporting (96%), and adequate patient information (95%).
   Conclusion: Gastroenterologists have a positive attitude towards quality assurance. However, concerns do exist about time investment and disclosure of results to others. Information provision and procedure characteristics were considered the most important aspects of quality assurance. (C) 2010 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background:HIV-related stigma is associated with increased risk-taking behavior, reduced uptake of HIV testing, and decreased adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Although ART scale-up may reduce HIV-related stigma, the extent to which levels of stigma in the general population have changed during the era of ART scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa is unknown.Methods:Social distance and anticipated stigma were operationalized using standard HIV-related stigma questions contained in the Demographic and Health Surveys and AIDS Indicator Surveys of 31 African countries between 2003 and 2013. We fitted multivariable linear regression models with cluster-correlated robust standard errors and country fixed effects, specifying social distance or anticipated stigma as the dependent variable and year as the primary explanatory variable of interest.Results:We estimated a statistically significant negative association between year and desires for social distance (b = -0.020; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: -0.026 to -0.015) but a statistically significant positive association between year and anticipated stigma (b = 0.023; P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval: 0.018 to 0.027). In analyses stratified by HIV prevalence above or below the sample median, declines in social distancing over time were more pronounced among countries with a higher HIV prevalence.Conclusions:Concomitant with ART scale-up in sub-Saharan Africa, anticipated stigma in the general population increased despite a decrease in social distancing toward people living with HIV. Although ART scale-up may help reduce social distancing toward people living with HIV, particularly in high-prevalence countries, other interventions targeting symbolic or instrumental concerns about HIV may be needed.

AB  - The changes in teaching due to COVID-19-related restraints generated distress among teachers, putting their job-related efficacy and satisfaction at risk. This study deepens the community-related protective and risk factors in teachers' experience. An online questionnaire detecting social distancing burnout, job-related distress experience, efficacy and satisfaction, and Sense of Community (SoC) was administered to 307 Italian teachers. A multiple mediation model was tested with Structural Equation Modeling. Evidence showed that social distancing burnout could increase teachers' distress rates and, through them, impact their job-related efficacy and satisfaction; however, its effects on the latter depended on the kind of distress mediating. Conversely, SoC could support their job-related efficacy and satisfaction, yet no association with their distress rates emerged. The role of social distancing and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)-related distress as the main threats for teachers stems, along with the one of job distress and the community of belonging as assets on which teachers relied.

AB  - Background: Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) continues to have serious effects causing high mortality and morbidity worldwide with developments of several new strains.
   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine and adherence to precautionary measures among the Majmaah community.
   Methodology: A Cross-Sectional study was conducted among Majmaah population using a self-administered online questionnaire, collected during 7th of February to 5th of March 2021. The questionnaire collected socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitude, use of precautionary measures and acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Individuals residing in the city of Majmaah aging 18 years old or more of both sexes were involved in the study. Data analysis was performed by SPSS, version 24.
   Results: Of the 457 participants surveyed, majority of the participants were female (69.6%) as compared to the males (30.4%,). About half of the participants (48.8%) had good knowledge. In addition, 55.1% showed low positive attitude toward COVID-19. There was significant association of COVID-19 attitude with participants' socio-demographics according to gender (p<0.05). The use of precautionary measures identified in the study were high (46.4%) and 67.8% of participants were willing to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
   Conclusion: The study concluded that majority of the participants in the study were female who had a low positive attitude towards COVID-19. The application of precautionary measures varied with age and the level of education. Two third of participants showed acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Those who had good knowledge, moderate positive attitude, and high positive application of precautionary measures towards COVID-19 were willing to get the vaccine. More education programs to the community of Majmaah city about COVID-19 precautionary measures and efficacy of vaccine are recommended.

AB  - Adolescent mental health has become a growing concern. One unique challenge to adolescents' willingness to seek professional mental health support is the concern of confidentiality breach by their parents. This concern may carry more weight in collectivistic cultures, such as China. The current study utilized a large parent sample (N = 460) recruited from six high schools and attempted to integrate cultural self-construal and parenting styles in the context of parental attitudes toward mental health professionals and desires to breach confidentiality. Parental independent self-construal was related to more positive attitudes toward mental health professionals through higher authoritative parenting and negatively associated with authoritarian parenting. On the other hand, interdependent self-construal was related to less positive attitudes toward mental health professionals via higher authoritarian parenting and lower authoritative parenting. More positive attitudes toward mental health professionals, in turn, were related to lower desire to breach confidentiality. Permissive parenting did not play a significant role in this process. The present study illustrates the importance of understanding culturally specific factors and parental influences in therapeutic practices.

AB  - We explored whether the existence of gender bias causes gender gaps in STEM engagement. In Experiment 1 (n=322), U.S. women projected less sense of belonging, positivity toward, and aspirations to participate in STEM than did men when exposed to the reality of STEM gender bias. These gender differences disappeared when participants were told that STEM exhibits gender equality, suggesting that gender bias produces STEM gender gaps. Experiment 2 (n=429) explored whether results generalized to a specific STEM department, and whether organizational efforts to mitigate gender bias might shrink gender gaps. U.S. women exposed to a biased chemistry department anticipated more discrimination and projected less sense of belonging, positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men. These gender differences vanished when participants read about an unbiased department, again suggesting that gender bias promotes STEM gender gaps. Further, moderated mediation analyses suggested that in the presence of gender bias (but not gender equality), women projected less positive attitudes and trust and comfort than did men because they experienced less sense of belonging and anticipated more discrimination. Results were largely unaffected by whether departments completed a diversity training, suggesting that knowledge of diversity initiatives alone cannot close STEM gender gaps.

AB  - Imagined intergroup contactthe mental simulation of a (positive) interaction with a member of another groupis a recently developed, low-risk, prejudice-reducing intervention. However, regulatory focus can moderate of the effects of prejudice-reducing interventions: a prevention focus (as opposed to a promotion focus) can lead to more negative outcomes. In two experiments we found that a prevention focus altered imagined contact's effects, causing the intervention to backfire. In Experiment 1, participants who reported a strong prevention-focus during imagined contact subsequently reported higher intergroup anxiety and (indirectly) less positive attitudes toward Asians. We found similar moderating effects in Experiment 2, using a different outgroup (gay men) and a subtle regulatory focus manipulation. Theoretical and practical implications for imagined contact are discussed.

AB  - This study attempt to examine the risk reduction mechanism of the COVID-19 outbreak in Pakistan. World Health Organization (WHO) declared the emergency and provided guidelines to reduce the risk of a pandemic. Thus, people tried to adopt multiple health safety measures to reduce the risk of a pandemic outbreak. Therefore, this study was designed to conduct an online survey technique to collect information from 1264 individuals in Pakistan. The rationale to select the technique was based on the pandemic situations in the country i.e. COVID-19. Moreover, it was used to main social distancing and following the health safety measures. Thus, a well-structured questionnaire was administered based on an attitudinal scale and google form was used. The inclusion criteria were defined on the questionnaire such as an independent age bracket (18-60), resident of Pakistan, using social media, and literate. The response was stopped after reaching the sample at 1264 participants. The study findings reveal that social isolation, social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) had a significant positive impact on risk reduction of COVID-19 among individuals. Moreover, hand and respiratory hygienic along with the risk of infection also significantly contributing to minimizing the pandemic outbreak.

AB  - This study examines the influence of authentic leadership on employees from public organizations analyzed through self-determination theory. Over the years, researchers analyzed different particularities of authentic leadership and its importance in nowadays' society. However, fewer researchers were interested in analyzing the influence of authentic leadership on employees through self-determination theory, especially in the perception of public ethical behavior. The theoretical model of this study proposes that authentic leadership is negatively correlated with public employees' positive attitude toward unethical behavior, namely corrupt acts. Also, authentic leadership and job satisfaction are positively related with public employees' work motivation. This positive relationship contributes to the decrease level of public employees' positive attitude toward corruption acts. The study was realized in different public organizations from Republic of Moldova. The total sample is composed by 98 participants. The hypotheses were tested through Multiple Hierarchical Regression. The study results showed that authentic leadership has a positive impact on work motivation. However, job satisfaction does not have any influence on public employees' perception of corruption acts. By contrast, authentic leadership behavior does have a positive impact on public employees' perception of corruption acts, but only when they perceive these acts as less serious.

AB  - Objectives: The current experiment was conducted among ice hockey fans, and brings together theories of intergroup relations and self and identity literature. It investigated if perceiving strong norms in favor of derogating against fans of outgroup teams, and engaging in these behaviors oneself, leads to an increased compartmentalization of these behaviors (i.e., such that they are restricted to a particular compartment within the self). This association was expected to be especially strong, when derogatory behaviors are portrayed as illegitimate. We also explored whether this compartmentalization then flows on to vitality as a well-being indicator.
   Method and design: Ice hockey fans supporting a diversity of NHL teams were recruited (N = 116). The legitimacy of the derogatory behaviors was manipulated by making salient either: that these behaviors have harmful consequences for outgroup members (illegitimate condition) vs. that such behaviors can benefit the ingroup (legitimate condition).
   Results: The expected mediated model was supported among the entire sample. The association between engaging in the derogatory behaviors and their compartmentalization in the self was also moderated by the experimental manipulation: While participants in the illegitimate condition reported a positive link between engaging in these behaviors and their compartmentalization, participants in the legitimate condition did not show a significant association between these variables, suggesting no need for them to restrict these behaviors within themselves.
   Conclusions: Results are discussed in light of normative approaches, intergroup theories, and the self. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Individuals with addiction are shown to suffer from stigmatization by health professionals.While medical students in general have been shown to express negative attitudes towards individuals with addiction, little is known about mental health students' attitudes towards this population.
   Method: Undergraduate and graduate students (N-265), currently studying mental health professions (psychology, social work, criminology) or non-mental health professions, filled out questionnaires assessing their levels of negative implicit attitudes towards individuals with addiction, social rejection and addiction-specific stereotypes.
   Results: Mental health students expressed less negative attitudes towards individuals with addiction compared to non-mental health students. Undergraduate psychology students expressed more negative attitudes compared to graduate psychology students and graduate criminology students expressed more social rejection compared to undergraduate criminology students.
   Conclusions: Social contact focused interventions, targeting addiction-related social rejection, should be integrated into mental health academic programs.

AB  - It has been suggested that pets provide the opportunity for humans to develop more positive attitudes and relationships toward a wider range of animal types-including toward non-pet animals-this is called the "pets as ambassadors" hypothesis. In this study, we build both on research conducted on human-animal relations and in social psychology to investigate the hypothesis, as well as two likely mechanisms involved in this effect: inter- group anxiety (toward animals) and inclusion of animals in the self. An online questionnaire was completed by 238 Canadian participants (M = 28.6 years old, SD = 8.53; 102 women). Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we tested a model whereby contact with pets predicted greater inclusion of ani- mals in the self and lower intergroup anxiety toward animals in general. In turn, these two psychological processes predicted more positive attitudes toward a broad range of animal types (e.g., wild/pest animals, animals used for human purposes) and animals in general. Finally, these positive attitudes toward animals predicted more pro-social behavioral intentions toward animals. The hypothesized model showed a good fit. Bootstrapping analyses further con- firmed the mediating roles of inclusion of animals in the self and intergroup anxiety toward animals in the associations between contact with pets and attitudes toward animals in general. The hypothesized model also presented a more satisfactory fit compared with an alternative model. Altogether, these findings underline the importance of contact with pets in fostering more positive human-animal relations and promoting animal welfare. These results also support the applicability of social psychological theories and principles in the realm of human-animal relations.

AB  - This study proposed a new perspective to look at the consequences of the formation of immigrant communities in globalized societies, by investigating the impact of two forms of group indispensability on majority attitudes towards immigrants. Specifically, it explored whether perceived indispensability of different immigrant groups to the national identity and their contributions to the functioning of the host society are related to the development of more positive attitudes towards them. We also explored whether such effects would be mediated by the inclusion of immigrants within the national common identity and whether these effects would be stronger among host country members with a stronger civic than ethnic conception of national citizenship. Results supported these predictions among a sample of native Portuguese citizens (N=118). As predicted, these effects were driven by perceptions of different types of indispensability for three immigrant groups in Portugal, who differed in their historical relations with the host society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Among surgeons, professional use of social media (SM) is varied, and attitudes are ambiguous. We sought to characterize surgeons' professional use and perceptions of SM.
   DESIGN: Surgical faculty and trainees received institutional review board-approved e-mail surveys assessing SM usage and attitudes. Regression analyses identified predictors of SM attitudes and preference for professional contact.
   SETTING: Surveys were administered to surgical faculty, fellows, and residents at 4 academic medical centers between January and April 2016.
   PARTICIPANTS: Of 1037 surgeons, clinical fellows, and residents e-mailed, 208 (20%) responded, including 132 faculty and 76 trainees.
   RESULTS: Among 208 respondents, 46 (22%) indicated they preferred some form of SM as their preferred networking and communication modality. A total of 145 (70%) indicated they believe SM benefits professional development. The position of clinical resident predicted preference to maintain professional contact via SM (p = 0.03). Age <55 predicted positive attitude (p = 0.02) and rank of associate professor predicted negative attitude toward SM (p = 0.03). Lack of time as well as personal and patient privacy concerns were cited most commonly as reasons for not using SM.
   CONCLUSIONS: Most of surgeons responding to our survey used some form of SM for professional purposes. Perceived barriers include lack of value, time constraints, and personal and patient privacy concerns. Generational differences in surgeon attitudes suggest usage of SM among surgeons will expand over time. (C) 2017 Association of Program Directors in Surgery. Published by Elsevier Inc.

TI  - Cross-National Focus Group Response to Autonomous Vehicles
T2  - TRANSPORTATION RESEARCH RECORD
LA  - English
AB  - The development of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is advancing quickly in some enclaves around the world. Consequently, AVs exist in the public consciousness, featuring regularly in mainstream media. As the form and function of AVs emerge, the attitudes of potential users become more important. The extent to which the public trusts AV technology and anticipates benefits, will drive consumer willingness to use AVs. Broadly, public attitudes will determine whether AVs can attract public investment in infrastructure and become a feature of the future transport mix or fail to realize the potential their developers assert. As part of UK Autodrive, a program trialing the introduction of AVs in the United Kingdom, researchers conducted focus groups in five UK cities, and a comparison focus group in San Francisco (December 2017 to September 2018) using representative samples (total n = 137). Focus group facilitators guided discussions in three areas considered central to usage decisions: trust in the technology, ownership models, and community benefit. This paper describes findings from a quasi-quantitative study supported with qualitative insights. This research provides three key takeaways centering on trust in the technology and in delivering benefit. First, some participants gain trust through experience and others through evidence. Second, participants had difficulty discriminating between AV developers, indicating a need for industry cooperation. Third, partnerships were found to demonstrate trust, highlighting the need for more and deeper partnerships moving forward. Generally, participants had positive attitudes toward AVs and expect AVs to provide benefits. However, these attitudes and expectations could change as AV development progresses.

AB  - Fictional brands are brands that exist only in the world of fiction and not the real physical world. Reverse product placement consists of transforming these fictional brands into products and services in the real physical world. This paper posits that consumers, despite having no preexisting experience of fictional brands in the real world, may develop positive attitudes towards fictional brands; hence the fundamental managerial question is to ascertain whether these positive attitudes can drive purchase intention to justify the investment into a real product or service based on the fictional brand. Using two fictional service brands, 'MacLaren's Pub' and 'Central Perk', featured respectively in How I Met Your Mother and Friends, this study confirms the existence of protobrands, and shows that attitudes towards a fictional brand are driven by perceived service quality, identification with the brand and attitudes towards the television programme. The study goes on to provide evidence that attitudes towards the fictional brand can influence purchase intention of a future defictionalised brand in the real world. The paper contributes to product placement and branding literature in a new emerging area.

AB  - Background The causes of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception are unknown, with infection as the most likely culprit. Recently, social distancing measures were implemented during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to decrease transmissible infectious diseases, creating an opportune setting to study the role of infection on the pathogenesis of intussusception on a population level. Objective To investigate the impact of social distancing on intussusception. Materials and methods We retrospectively reviewed air contrast enemas and pylorus ultrasounds performed between March 2010 and March 2021 to identify cases of ileocolic intussusception and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (HPS), using the latter as a negative control. The study time frame was divided into two periods: pre-pandemic (March 2010-February 2020) and pandemic (April 2020-March 2021). The number of cases that occurred in these two time periods were compared using the Poisson regression model. Results Of the 407 cases of idiopathic ileocolic intussusception identified, 396 occurred in the pre-pandemic time period (mean = 39.6 per 12-month period) and 11 occurred in the 12-month pandemic time period. The mean monthly number of intussusceptions showed a decline of 72% (95% confidence interval [CI] 49-85%) between the pre-pandemic and pandemic time periods (3.3 vs. 0.9 monthly cases; P < 0.001). In contrast, the mean monthly number of HPS did not differ significantly (P = 0.19). Conclusion Social distancing-imposed to curb the spread of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic-resulted in a significant decline in ileocolic intussusception, lending strong support to the theory that infection is the dominant cause of intussusception.

AB  - I examined the different effects that source cues (in-group vs. out-group membership) and message approaches (rational vs. emotional appeals) have on the attitudes of consumers with individualistic and collectivistic cultural orientations toward charity advertising and donation intention. Participants (105 and 99 college students from Korea and the US, respectively) viewed a charity donation appeal advertisement, then rated their attitude toward the advertisement and donation intention. Results showed that compared with the individualistic U.S. students, collectivistic Korean students had a more positive attitude toward the advertisement and a higher donation intention when the in-group source cue and emotional message approach were used. In contrast, rational message appeals were more effective for U.S. students, and no significant differences were observed among this group regarding the in-group and out-group source cue types. My findings implied that charity advertising campaigners may need to use different approaches in terms of group membership and message approaches depending on cultural orientation, thereby motivating people to have a positive attitude toward charity advertising and donation intention.

AB  - Scholarship on newborn screening, dried bloodspot retention, and large population biobanking call consistently for improved public engagement. Communication with participants likely occurs only in the context of collection, consent, or notification, if at all. We ran an 11-week advertising campaign to inform Michigan Facebook users unlikely to know that their or their children's dried bloodspots (DBSs) were stored in a state biobank. We investigated the pattern and content of comments posted during the campaign, focusing on users' questions, attitudes and concerns, and the role the moderator played in addressing them. We used Facebook data to quantitatively assess engagement and employed conventional content analysis to investigate themes, attitudes, and social dynamics among user and moderator comments. Five ad sets elicited comments during campaign weeks 4-8, reaching similar to 800,000 Facebook users ($6000). Gravitating around broad, underlying ethical, legal, and social issues, 180 posts from 129 unique users related to newborn screening or biobanking. Thirty six conveyed negative attitudes and 33 conveyed positive attitudes; 53 posed questions. The most prevalent themes identified were consent, privacy, bloodspot use, identifiability, inclusion criteria, research benefits, (mis)-trust, genetics, DBS destruction, awareness, and the role of government. The moderator's 81 posts were responsive-answering questions, correcting or clarifying information, or providing information about opting out. Facebook ad campaigns can improve engagement by pushing out relevant content and creating dynamic, responsive, visible forums for discussion. Reduced control over messaging may be worth the trade-off for creating accessible, transparent, people-centered engagement on public health issues that are sensitive and complex.

AB  - Global attitude certainty consists of two subconstructs: attitude clarity-certainty that one is aware of one's true attitudes-and attitude correctness, certainty that one's attitudes are morally correct and valid. Attitude correctness is more often associated with group-related psychological and behavioral outcomes than attitude clarity. As such, we expected that attitude correctness, but not attitude clarity, would be associated with more negative attitudes toward outgroups when group boundaries are defined by attitudes. Across four studies, greater attitude correctness related to more negative attitudes toward attitudinal outgroups regardless of context (e.g., political, religious); attitude clarity's relationship to prejudice was inconsistent (Studies 1a and 2: positive or no relationship; Study 3: negative; Studies 1b and 4: no relationship). In Studies 2 and 3, mediational analyses showed that greater attitude correctness was associated with stronger beliefs that group boundaries are sharp and distinct (i.e., discreteness beliefs), which in turn was associated with greater prejudice. Finally, Study 4 demonstrated that the attitude correctness-prejudice link was associated with greater intention to engage in competitive behaviors in a conflict resolution scenario with an outgroup member.

AB  - Faced with the threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, many nations have mandated sets of requirements, such as social-distancing measures. However, compliance with such measures is likely to be shaped by a range of factors. Here, we proposed and tested a mediation model in which rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories and/or theorists mediates the relationship between rational thinking style and compliance with mandated requirements. An online, nationally representative sample of the adult population in the United Kingdom (N = 520) completed a previously validated measure of rational thinking style, as well as novel measures of rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists and compliance with mandated requirements. Intercorrelations between scores on all three measures were significant and positive. Mediation analysis indicated that rational thinking style and rejection of COVID-19 conspiracy theories/theorists, respectively, were directly associated with compliance, and that the mediated association was also significant. These results may have implications for practical policy aimed at promoting greater compliance with mandated requirements, including social distancing.

AB  - On HIV blogs, people living with HIV share their intimate thoughts and experiences with the world in the form of personal online diaries. While previous research investigated the reasons why patients engage in blogging activities, the effects of such diaries on nondiseased recipients are largely unexplored. Following an experimental design, this study (n = 261) tested whether a one-time exposure to a personal HIV blog has greater persuasive effects on its readers than an institutional HIV website providing the same content. Results showed that although source credibility was perceived as higher when reading the HIV website from an official institution, blog readers had more positive attitudes and a higher self-efficacy toward condom use than website readers. Implications for health message design are discussed.

TI  - The Effect of Background Music in Shark Documentaries on Viewers' Perceptions of Sharks
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the ongoing need for shark conservation and management, prevailing negative sentiments marginalize these animals and legitimize permissive exploitation. These negative attitudes arise from an instinctive, yet exaggerated fear, which is validated and reinforced by disproportionate and sensationalistic news coverage of shark 'attacks' and by highlighting shark-on-human violence in popular movies and documentaries. In this study, we investigate another subtler, yet powerful factor that contributes to this fear: the ominous background music that often accompanies shark footage in documentaries. Using three experiments, we show that participants rated sharks more negatively and less positively after viewing a 60-second video clip of swimming sharks set to ominous background music, compared to participants who watched the same video clip set to uplifting background music, or silence. This finding was not an artifact of soundtrack alone because attitudes toward sharks did not differ among participants assigned to audio-only control treatments. This is the first study to demonstrate empirically that the connotative attributes of background music accompanying shark footage affect viewers' attitudes toward sharks. Given that nature documentaries are often regarded as objective and authoritative sources of information, it is critical that documentary filmmakers and viewers are aware of how the soundtrack can affect the interpretation of the educational content.

AB  - Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of social distancing resulting from COVID-19 in hospitalizations for infections of the upper airways (URTI), such as acute laryngitis, tracheitis, and otitis media in children aged 0 to 9 years in Brazil, considering that they share the same forms of transmission. Methods: Data on hospitalizations for acute airway changes and their complications in children <9 years old were obtained from the Database of the Brazilian Department of Public Health Informatics for the period 2015 to 2020. These data were also analyzed by macroregions of Brazil (North, Northeast, Southeast, South, and Midwest). The effect of the social distancing strategy on the increase of acute laryngitis, tracheitis, otitis media, and mastitis, as absolute and relative reductions, was calculated by analyzing the annual calculation of 2015-2019 vs 2020. Results: All the hospitalizations compared in the Unified Health System (SUS) for laryngitis and acute tracheitis and otitis media decreased, considering all states of Brazil. The largest reduction in hospitalization reduction was in the North, with - 94% in 2015-2019 vs 2020 in cases of laryngitis and acute tracheitis, and in the Midwest, with - 85% in 2015-2019 vs 2020 in cases of otitis media. Conclusion: Hospitalizations for laryngitis, acute tracheitis, and acute otitis media in children <9 years old decreased between March and July 2020 in Brazil, when social distancing measures were adopted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

KW  - EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES

KW  - PATIENT COMPLIANCE
AB  - Purpose
   Virus epidemics may be mitigated if people comply with directives to stay at home and keep their distance from strangers in public. As such, there is a public health interest in social distancing compliance. The available evidence on distancing practices in public space is limited, however, by the lack of observational data. Here, we apply video observation as a method to examine to what extent members of the public comply with social distancing directives.
   Data
   Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage of interactions in public was collected in inner-city Amsterdam, the Netherlands. From the footage, we observed instances of people violating the 1.5-meter distance directives in the weeks before, during, and after these directives were introduced to mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Results
   We find that people complied with the 1.5-meter distance directives when these directives were first introduced, but that the level of compliance started to decline soon after. We also find that violation of the 1.5-meter distance directives is strongly associated with the number of people observed on the street and with non-compliance to stay-at-home directives, operationalized with large-scale aggregated location data from cell phones. All three measures correlate to a varying extent with temporal patterns in the transmission of the COVID-19 virus, temperature, COVID-19 related Google search queries, and media attention to the topic.
   Conclusion
   Compliance with 1.5 meter distance directives is short-lived and coincides with the number of people on the street and with compliance to stay-at-home directives. Potential implications of these findings are that keep- distance directives may work best in combination with stay-at-home directives and place-specific crowd-control strategies, and that the number of people on the street and community-wide mobility as captured with cell phone data offer easily measurable proxies for the extent to which people keep sufficient physical distance from others at specific times and locations.

AB  - Humans have large social networks, with hundreds of interacting individuals. How does the brain represent the complex connectivity structure of these networks? Here we used social media (Facebook) data to objectively map participants' real-life social networks. We then used representational similarity analysis (RSA) of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity patterns to investigate the neural coding of these social networks as participants reflected on each individual. We found coding of social network distances in the default-mode network (medial prefrontal, medial parietal, and lateral parietal cortices). When using partial correlation RSA to control for other factors that can be correlated to social distance (personal affiliation, personality traits. and visual appearance, as subjectively rated by the participants), we found that social network distance information was uniquely coded in the retrosplenial complex, a region involved in spatial processing. In contrast, information on individuals' personal affiliation to the participants and personality traits was found in the medial parietal and prefrontal cortices, respectively. These findings demonstrate a cortical division between representations of non-self-referenced (allocentric) social network structure, self-referenced (egocentric) social distance, and trait-based social knowledge.

AB  - Rationale: Low-VT ventilation lowers mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) but is underused. Little is known about clinician attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation use and their association with actual low-VT ventilation use.
   Objectives: The objectives of this study were to assess clinicians' attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation (VT,6.5 ml/kg predicted body weight) in patients with ARDS, to identify differences in attitudes and perceived barriers among clinician types, and to compare attitudes toward and perceived barriers to actual low-VT ventilation use in patients with ARDS.
   Methods: We conducted a survey of critical care physicians, nurses, and respiratory therapists at four non-ARDS Network hospitals in the Chicago region. We compared survey responses with performance in a cohort of 362 patients with ARDS.
   Results: Survey responses included clinician attitudes toward and perceived barriers to low-VT ventilation use. We also measured low-VT ventilation initiation by these clinicians in 347 patients with ARDS initiated after ARDS onset as well as correlation with clinician attitudes and perceived barriers. Of 674 clinicians surveyed, 467 (69.3%) responded. Clinicians had positive attitudes toward and perceived few process barriers toARDS diagnosis or initiation of low-VT ventilation. Physicians had more positive attitudes and perceived fewer barriers than nurses or respiratory therapists. However, use of low-VT ventilation by all three clinician groups was low. For example, whereas physicians believed that 92.5% of their patients with ARDS warranted treatmentwith low-VT ventilation, they initiated low-VT ventilationfor a median (interquartile range) of 7.4% ( 0 to 14.3%) of their eligible patients with ARDS. Clinician attitudes and perceived barriers were not correlated with low-VT ventilation initiation.
   Conclusions: Clinicians had positive attitudes toward low-VT ventilation and perceived few barriers to using it, but attitudes and perceived process barriers were not correlated with actual low-VT ventilation use, which was low. Implementation strategies should be focused on examining other issues, such as ARDS recognition and process solutions, to improve low-VT ventilation use.

AB  - During unusual times involving discontinued face to face sessions in formal education settings, mobile learning (m-learning) involving social networking sites has become a popular alternative since students are always in possession of handheld electronic devices. When connection through technology was the only option due to social distancing in current pandemic, students who were already active extensive users of social networks found online learning as a new way of getting formal education. The objective of this study was to explore how the state of student's behavioral intention for social media based online learning is driven by external factors like subjective norm and self-efficacy. To fulfill this aim, this study uses a quantitative approach to study the factors that mediate the decision behavior of students towards social media employed as a learning platform and use of m-learning involving social networks. A sample of management science students (n= 255) from four universities participated in the research. Analysis of data suggested that subjective norm and self-efficacy were significant predictors for student participation in e-learning initiatives involving social media and networks. The proposed serial mediation model revealed that self-efficacy and perceived usefulness in that order were playing a positive significant role in student use of social networking for learning. No significant differences were observed between either gender when self-efficacy, perceived usefulness, and use of social media in education were considered.

AB  - Promotions for online sports betting during televised sports broadcasts are regularly viewed by millions of Australians, raising concerns about their impacts on vulnerable groups including at-risk and problem gamblers. This study examined whether responses to these promotions varied with problem gambling severity amongst 455 Australian Internet sports bettors participating in an online survey. Results indicated that young male Internet sports bettors are especially vulnerable to gambling problems, particularly if they hold positive attitudes to gambling sponsors who embed promotions into sports broadcasts and to the promotional techniques they use and this heightens the risk that alluring messages contribute to excessive gambling. As problem gambling severity increased, so too did recognition that these promotions have impacted negatively on their sports betting behaviour. Because a plethora of sports betting brands and promotions are now heavily integrated into sports coverage, social marketing efforts are needed to offset their persuasive appeal and counter the positive attitudes towards them that appear linked to excessive gambling amongst Internet sports bettors.

AB  - Political polarization has dominated news coverage of Americans' responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research note, we report findings from two experimental studies, in which we present respondents with news stories about COVID-19 mitigation measures that emphasize partisan difference or accord. The stories present the same numeric facts about public opinion, but highlight either the partisan gap that existed at the time of the study, or the fact that large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats supported the measures at the time. Results from our first study, conducted late April 2020, show that a media frame drawing attention to shared concern across party lines produced a less polarized response to social-distancing restrictions than a frame that drew attention to partisan difference. Our findings suggest that the extensive media coverage about the red-blue divide in COVID-19 opinions reinforced partisan polarization. These results, however, did not replicate in a second study conducted much later in the pandemic. Qualitative data collected across the two studies demonstrate the degree to which polarization had rapidly become a dominant narrative in Americans' thinking about COVID-19.

AB  - Postnatal depression and bonding failure after childbirth are major mental health issues. We investigated 99 pregnant women on three occasions (late in pregnancy and 5 days and 1 month postnatally). Anxiety during pregnancy predicted postnatal depression and bonding failure, whereas negative attitudes towards pregnancy predicted bonding failure. The effect of negative attitudes towards pregnancy on postnatal depression was possibly mediated by bonding failure. Postnatal depression and bonding failure are correlated with different risk factors and run rather independently over the course of the puerperium. Postnatal depression may be predicted by bonding failure.

AB  - Building on social distancing theories, we present how brands use social media content involving COVID-19 and how consumers respond to it. Drawing from the literature on social marketing, societal marketing, corporate social responsibility (CSR), brand activism, and crisis communication, we theoretically classify branded COVID-19 content in social media environments. We argue that brands - limited to the German market - utilise COVID-19 in manifold ways, involving themselves in social causes and, furthermore, in many cases, assuming a role as a spokesperson for crisis communication. Our findings demonstrate that the Coronavirus pandemic and the corresponding reinforcement of social distancing act as amplifiers of consumer sensitivity. However, even in situations of external crisis, marketing managers can build brand equity by showing empathy.

AB  - Morality is an abstract consideration, and language is an important regulator of abstract thought. In instances of moral ambiguity (e.g., ethically ambiguous business practices), individuals may pay particular attention to matters of interactional justice (i.e., how consumers are treated with politeness and dignity by the brand in question). Politeness in language has been linked to greater perceptions of social distance, which we contend is instrumental in regulating attitudes toward a brand. We posit that politeness in a brand's advertising will impact consumers who are attuned to violations of interactional justice [i.e., those with low belief in a just world (BJW)]. In three studies, we demonstrate that the politeness used in advertising as well as consumers' individual differences in BJW affect judgments and attitudes toward brands. Specifically, individuals with a low just world belief are more likely to harbor negative attitudes towards a brand with ethically ambiguous business practices if the language used in advertising is impersonal (politer) than when the language used in advertising is personal (less polite). Importantly, for individuals with a low BJW, lowered trust due to the advertisement's language mediated the relationship between politeness and attitudes toward the brand. Theoretical and managerial implications of this research are discussed.

TI  - Misinformation on COVID-19 origin and its relationship with perception and knowledge about social distancing: A cross-sectional study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the vast scientific evidence obtained from the genomic sequencing of COVID-19, controversy regarding its origin has been created in the mass media. This could potentially have a long-term influence on the behavior among individuals, such as failure to comply with proposed social distancing measures, leading to a consequent rise in the morbidity and mortality rates from COVID-19 infection. Several studies have collected information about knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding COVID-19; however, very little is known about the relationship of the perceptions of the individuals regarding the origin of the virus with the knowledge and perception about social distancing. This study aimed at ascertaining this relationship. For such purpose, a web-based cross-sectional study was conducted among a sample population from five provinces of the Dominican Republic from June to July of 2020. The data collection instrument exploited in the study was a self-designed questionnaire distributed throughout different social media platforms. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented and a total of 1195 respondents completed the questionnaire. The collected data was analyzed using SPSS. Descriptive statistics, stepwise multiple linear regression, and one-way multivariate analysis were implemented to test the hypotheses. The level of education was significantly associated (P = .017) with individuals' perception about the origin of COVID-19, whilst only age (P = .032) and education level (P < .001) statistically significantly predicted 'knowledge about social distancing'. Perception of COVID-19 origin was statistically significant associated (P = < .001) with the measures of the dependent variables (knowledge and perception on social distancing). The present study has established a possible link between the 'perception of COVID-19 origin' and 'the perception and knowledge about social distancing'.

AB  - This study is among the first to cross-culturally compare the associations between social media use and emerging adults' drinking behavior in an accepting (Belgium) and comparatively restricted (USA) Western drinking culture. A cross-sectional survey was administered among 770 college students (n(USA) = 253, 24% male; n(Belgium) = 487, 34% male) aged 18-20 years. Structural equation modeling was used and demonstrated that the association between exposure to others' alcohol-related content on social media and drinking intentions operated similarly via more positive descriptive and injunctive norms for both populations, whereas the association between self-sharing and drinking intentions operated similarly via more positive attitudes. However, only among Belgian students was sharing alcohol references also related to drinking intentions through descriptive norms. Overall, this study points to the generalizability of attitudes and social norms as mechanisms of alcohol-related social media (self-)effects among emerging adult college students across Western drinking cultures.

AB  - Using a survey of more than 5,000 American consumers, this study examines connections between attitudes toward same-sex marriage and media consumption. A positive attitude is predicted by being liberal and less religious, supporting gender and racial equality, willing to try anything once, considering television the primary form of entertainment, watching political talk shows, and reading blogs. The theoretical and methodological contributions and real-world implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Aim. This article's goal is to present the discourse concerning paid maternity leaves in the USA in major American media outlets between the years 2014 and 2018. It is an attempt to answer the question whether maternity, caregiving work or family values are contradictory to American work ethic and regulations of the labour market.
   Methodology. The work is devoted to content analysis of the four most popular American online media, both liberal and conservative. Their content search engines are used to find information and articles on paid maternity leaves and to group them into different categories.
   Results. Three main categories are distinguished in terms of the content of 302 articles, namely articles with a positive attitude towards paid maternity leaves (248 articles - 82.10%), articles with a negative attitude (20 articles - 6.60%), and neutral articles (34 - 11.30%). In general, Americans see the long-term benefits of paid maternity leaves, but they differ when it comes to the methods of their introduction.
   Conclusions. There is a conflict between maternity, family values, American work culture, and regulations of the labour market. In American society, individualism, competition, and masculinity of the business culture do not support the values of nurturing and caregiving.
   Originality. Except for the USA, there is no other country among OECD states which does not provide paid parental leaves for working mothers. Because of the fact that the United States is known to be one of the most developed countries in the world, this information may be considered worth-studying.

AB  - The uptake of mobile media with internet connection has increased rapidly in almost every part of the world, and this has significantly changed how public transport passengers use their travel time. Studies have documented that use of mobile information and communication technologies (ICT) while traveling has the potential to enrich use of travel time and in some cases, strengthen positive attitudes towards public transport. The alternative hypothesisthat mobile communication technologies make travelers more critical and demanding, e.g., due to the risk of interferencehas so far hardly been explored through empirical studies. Based on a web-based survey of travelers in two of the largest cities in Norway (Oslo and Trondheim), this paper investigates how use of smart devices are related to general attitudes toward public transportation services. A segmentation of travelers in three clusters based on their mobile use habits, shows that the most active group of mobile media usersa group of younger and middle-aged urban dwellerswere those who bore the most critical attitudes to the public transport services. In contrast, the groups that used their mobile phones rarely, or less actively, on their public transport trips were more satisfied. The findings suggests that a new generation of equipped travelers has developed expectations regarding their public transport journeys that service providers might have problems to fulfill in current times. Thus, there is a risk of the most active smartphone users developing negative attitudes to public transport if (or when) their experiences are not improved.

AB  - There remains an obvious gap in the acculturation literature, which relates to cultural change associated with the majority/dominant group. This paper explores how majority members react to a perceived expectation from minority members that majority members should undergo cultural change. A study was conducted exploring how majority members' perceptions of a demand by minority members that the majority should adopt the minority culture affects the majority members' preferences for minority acculturation, and whether effects are mediated by perceptions of symbolic threat. Two hundred sixty-six participants who self-reported being white British completed an online survey. A model was hypothesized whereby a perception that minority members demand that the majority takes on the minority culture predicted perceived symbolic threat, which was in turn negatively associated with a desire that minority members should maintain the minority culture, and positively with a desire that minority members should adopt the majority culture. Results supported the hypothesized model, with all individual paths and indirect effects significant in the hypothesized directions. Symbolic threat mediated the effect of perceived demand for minority culture adoption on majority preferences for minority acculturation. Findings are discussed in relation to implications for intergroup relations in culturally plural societies.

AB  - Smoking is one of the more common preventable threats to public health, and it remains a serious cause of death around the world. Remarkably, the mean age of the onset of cigarette smoking is decreasing. Therefore, it is necessary to increase our knowledge concerning the attitude among high school students towards cigarette smoking. The present study sought to examine the associations among social anxiety, emotional intelligence, and attitudes towards cigarette smoking, and to examine emotional intelligence as a mediator between social anxiety and attitude towards cigarette smoking. The participants comprised 950 high school students who completed the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale, Assessing Emotions Scale, and Attitudes Towards Cigarette Smoking Scale. Structural equation modelling analyses indicated that high levels of emotional intelligence are negatively associated with positive attitude towards cigarette smoking and social anxiety is associated with a positive attitude towards cigarette smoking in high school students. Emotional intelligence partially mediated the relationship between social anxiety and attitude towards cigarette smoking. These relationships varied as a function of gender.

AB  - Background: News media coverage is a powerful influence on public attitude and government action. The digitization of news media covering the current opioid epidemic has changed the landscape of coverage and may have implications for how to effectively respond to the opioid crisis.
   Objective: This study aims to characterize the relationship between volume of online opioid news reporting and opioid-related deaths in the United States and how these measures differ across geographic and socioeconomic county-level factors.
   Methods: Online news reports from February 2018 to April 2019 on opioid-related events in the United States were extracted from Google News. News data were aggregated at the county level and compared against opioid-related death counts. Ordinary least squares regression was used to model opioid-related death rate and opioid news coverage with the inclusion of socioeconomic and geographic explanatory variables.
   Results: A total of 35,758 relevant news reports were collected representing 1789 counties. Regression analysis revealed that opioid-related death rate was positively associated with news reporting. However, opioid-related death rate and news reporting volume showed opposite correlations with educational attainment and rurality. When controlling for variation in death rate, counties in the Northeast were overrepresented by news coverage.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that regional variation in the volume of opioid-related news reporting does not reflect regional variation in opioid-related death rate. Differences in the amount of media attention may influence perceptions of the severity of opioid epidemic. Future studies should investigate the influence of media reporting on public support and action on opioid issues.

AB  - Political participation is a prerequisite for democracy. Therefore, political sociologists have advised to socialize people by encouraging political participation from a young age onward. Parents are one of the most important political socialization agents, especially at a young age. Although the intergenerational transmission of political attitudes has been studied quite intensively, the transmission of the political participation intention has been neglected. This study explores the effect of both mothers' and fathers' political activity on their offspring's intention to participate. Using a data set from 2085 Belgian parent child triads, we tested the direct and indirect transmission of political participation intention. We found that although there is a direct transmission of political participation intention, after controlling for political discussion, political interest and socio-economic status, this effect is completely mediated. Therefore, we conclude that intergenerational transmission is an indirect process, supported by a high socio-economic status, more political interest and a more politicized family environment in which politics is clearly perceived as salient.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, students have been forced to learn at home. Authentic contexts are essential to designing useful learning activities. Therefore, this study used mobile technology, namely Ubiquitous Geometry (UG), to merge authentic contexts into learning activities and investigate the influence of authentic contextual learning (ACL) on students' and parents' perceptions. This is because parents inevitably have an effect on students' learning at home, which has not been clearly addressed in past studies. This study investigated students' and parents' perceptions in terms of technological and pedagogical aspects of the implementation of ACL supported by UG while learning at home. We conducted one experiment on 20 fifth-grade students and their parents. In the students' acceptance model, the results indicated that students' ease of use and usefulness significantly influenced their positive attitude toward ACL supported by UG, and the positive attitude also significantly influenced intention to continue using our proposed system in both the technological and pedagogical aspects. In the mutual influence between students' and parents' acceptance model, it was found that parents significantly influenced their children's perceptions of ACL at home. In the mediation analysis, we found parents' ease of use and intention to use could mediate the relation between students' positive attitude and intention to use in the pedagogical aspect. From the interview, we found that parents thought that the learning activity in authentic contexts was useful and encouraged their children to do more engagement. However, in the technological aspect of the mutual influence between students' and parents' acceptance model, no mediation existed. This might be because parents worried their children were overusing mobile devices.

AB  - Nativism is one of the defining phenomena of the contemporary era. Yet, we know little about how malleable citizen attitudes associated with nativism and nationalism are to priming effects when media frames which deal with key issues such as immigration are introduced. In this article, we present the findings from a survey experiment fielded to a nationally representative sample of voters in Australia in May 2019. In it, we explore whether the attitudes of voters for different political parties can be primed by introducing two contrasting media frames to measure these effects. We find positive and negative frames have no effect on the attitudes of voters for Australia's populist radical right party, but that the former has an effect on centre-right voters in Australia. Such findings have important implications for our understanding of political communication and the malleability of political attitudes.

AB  - During intractable conflicts, competitive victimhood refers to the subjective belief that one's own ingroup has suffered more than the outgroup. Although competitive victimhood is considered an important inhibitor of reconciliation processes, no research has attempted to examine ways of reducing it. The present study aims to fill this gap. Kosovar Albanians students (N = 170) were asked to report their perception of ingroup and outgroup victimhood during the protracted violence between Serbs and Albanians in Kosovo. Our findings revealed that frequent and high-quality extended contact with outgroup members and identification with a common ingroup reduced competitive victimhood. The effects of extended contact and common ingroup identification were fully mediated by increased perspective taking and trust toward the outgroup, and by decreased outgroup infrahumanization. The implications of these results for restoring fractured intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, several countries implemented social distancing measures to contain virus transmission. However, these vital safety measures have the potential to impair mental health or wellbeing, for instance, from increased perceived loneliness. Playing social video games may offer a way to continue to socialize while adhering to social distancing measures. To examine this issue further, the present online survey investigated social gaming during the pandemic and its association to perceived loneliness within a German-speaking sample. Results indicated a small positive correlation between general gaming frequency and perceived loneliness. Detailed analysis revealed a negative association between perceived loneliness and increased social forms of video gaming. Specifically, gamers with a higher social motive for gaming perceived less loneliness, but gamers with a dominant escape motive demonstrated a positive link to perceived loneliness. The use of social gaming in times of social distancing seems to play a small but significant factor in perceived loneliness compared to other demographical data. The findings are discussed with respect to methodological limitations, effect sizes, and sample characteristics. The results enrich the current knowledge on video gaming and its link to social wellbeing and provide a more nuanced picture than simplistic investigations of screen time.

AB  - Empirical insights on the attitudinal correlates of direct democracy are inconclusive. On the one hand, direct democracy bears a conceptual resemblance with populist ideas. On the other hand, participatory democrats advocate the use of direct democracy precisely on grounds that it promises to educate citizens. This paper complements tests of arguments positing an educative potential of direct democracy with tests of its populist potential. We make use of original survey data collected in the German Bundeslander, which present a relatively underappreciated, yet interesting and representative case for studying direct democracy. Multilevel models indicate that political attitudes are neither more populist nor more supportive of the political system among citizens in direct democratic contexts. The story is more complicated though as the relationship between direct democracy and populist attitudes is conditional on the ideological orientation of a citizen.

AB  - Objectives To investigate the knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes towards pediatric dental radiography and its associated factors among Turkish parents seeking dental care for their children. Materials and methods This cross-sectional study enrolled 483 parents of children aged 6-15 years. Data were collected using the questionnaire including socio-demographic characteristics, knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes based on The Health Belief Model and planned behavior theory. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate statistics were performed. Results More than half of parents had correct knowledge on their rights to access health information, the radiation risk and exposure from dental X-rays, children's vulnerability to radiation, and using lead apron. Most parents (70.4%) perceived dental X-rays as valuable. They had limited knowledge regarding the permanent damage and negative attitudes regarding its safety and goodness. There were positive correlations between knowledge-attitudes, knowledge-perceived benefits, and attitudes-perceived benefits (all p values < 0.01). Having a previous dental X-ray (p = 0.014) and not having parents' information needs (p = 0.007) were associated with higher attitudes. Increasing education levels, having a educational need and higher perceived benefit were found to be predictors of higher parental knowledge. Conclusion Turkish parents had some knowledge and positive attitudes towards pediatric dental X-rays but not at optimum levels. Parents' education levels, information needs, and beliefs were the most important factors affecting parental knowledge. Attitudes towards radiation safety and goodness should be improved.

AB  - The Covid-19 outbreak was declared a public health emergency by the World Health Organization in January 2020. As a consequence, several protective measures were urged by national governments in order to limit the spread of the pandemic. Drawing on the literature on health behaviours, in the present study, we investigated the psychological factors (i.e., attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control, intentions, and risk perception) that were associated with two highly recommended behaviours: frequent hand washing and social distancing (i.e., staying at home except for essential reasons). The study employed a correlational design with a follow-up. A questionnaire including measures of psychological predictors was administered via social media to a sample of 403 adults residing in Italy during the lockdown. Self-reported behaviours were assessed one week later. Findings showed that attitudes, social norms, perceived behavioural control were significantly related to hand washing and social distancing through intentions. Risk perception was a significant predictor of social distancing but not of hand washing. These findings suggest that intervention and communication strategies aimed at encouraging preventive measures during the Covid-19 pandemic should be organized taking into account multiple factors which partially differ depending on the type of behaviour considered.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has become a major public health challenge globally with countries of the world adopting unprecedented infection prevention and control (IPC) measures to urgently curtail the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) of the people toward COVID-19 is critical to understanding the epidemiological dynamics of the disease and the effectiveness, compliance and success of IPC measures adopted in a country. This study sought to determine the levels of KAP toward COVID-19 among residents of north-central Nigeria. A cross-sectional online survey with a semi-structured questionnaire using a Snowball sampling technique was conducted during the national lockdown. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics, analysis of variance (ANOVA), Pearson's correlation and regression tests. From a total of 589 responses received, 80.6, 59.6, 90.4 and 56.2% were from respondents between ages 18-39 years, males, had a college (Bachelor) degree or above and reside in urban areas respectively. Respondents had good knowledge (99.5%) of COVID-19, gained mainly through the internet/social media (55.7%) and Television (27.5%). The majority of the respondents (79.5%) had positive attitudes toward the adherence of government IPC measures with 92.7, 96.4 and 82.3% practicing social distancing/self-isolation, improved personal hygiene and using face mask respectively. However, 52.1% of the respondents perceived that the government is not doing enough to curtail COVID-19 in Nigeria. Pearson's correlation showed significant relationship between knowledge of COVID-19 and attitude towards preventive measures (r = 0.177, p = 0.004, r = 0.137, p = 0.001). Although 61.8% of the respondents have no confidence in the present intervention by Chinese doctors, only 29.0% would accept COVID-19 vaccines when available. This study recorded good knowledge and attitudes among participants, however, community-based health campaigns are necessary to hold optimistic attitudes and practice appropriate intervention measures devoid of misconceptions.

AB  - Social psychologists are increasingly interested in the temporal dimensions of social life and in identity continuity in particular. Focusing on ethnicity and national identity we discuss the implications of perceived group continuity and collective self-continuity, and their interplay, for group dynamics. Using the social identity perspective and theories of identity motivation, we show, first, that the need for collective self-continuity forms a unique motivational basis for group identification. Second, we demonstrate that people are more likely to derive a sense of collective self-continuity from groups that are seen as relatively stable and immutable over time (i.e., essentialist in-groups). Third, we find that existential threats to group identity strengthen a sense of collective self-continuity, which, in turn, increases in-group defence mechanisms in the form of negative attitudes towards immigrant out-groups and towards social developments that potentially undermine in-group continuity. Fourth, we discuss empirical findings that indicate that group-based nostalgia for the nation is an identity management strategy in response to in-group continuity threats and that nostalgia leads to immigrant out-group exclusion.

AB  - Background: The legalization of medical and recreational cannabis is a topic of continued debate in countries around the world. It has been suggested that medical cannabis legalization influences cannabis legalization for recreational purposes through increased media attention toward the positive health effects of cannabis. However, the nature of media coverage is likely to vary across mass media and online sources (internet and social media). In addition, effects of information engagement on attitudes may vary depending on whether information was actively sought or obtained incidentally during patterns of regular media use (scanned).
   Methods: This study uses data from an online survey of Israeli adults (N = 554) to test the association between information seeking and scanning about medical cannabis (from mass media and online sources) and attitudes toward medical cannabis. Furthermore, we test indirect effects of media engagement on attitudes toward cannabis legalization through medical cannabis attitudes.
   Results: Seeking and scanning for information about medical cannabis from online sources, but not from mass media sources, were associated with positive attitudes toward medical cannabis. Engagement with medical cannabis information from online sources was also indirectly associated with greater support for cannabis legalization, through positive attitudes related to medical cannabis.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that one mechanism through which medical cannabis legalization is associated with cannabis legalization for all purposes is public engagement with information about medical cannabis in the media, particularly from the internet and social media channels. As increasingly more jurisdictions are expected to legalize medical cannabis, with resulting increase in media attention, support for recreational cannabis legalization may be expected to grow.

AB  - Objectives To answer four questions: What are attitudes, knowledge and social norms around sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs)? What are current levels of trust in messages on SSBs? What is current support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the UK soft drinks industry levy (SDIL)? What is the association between attitudes, knowledge, social norms, trust, SSB consumption and sociodemographic factors; and support for, and perceived effectiveness of, the SDIL?
   Design Cross-sectional online survey.
   Setting UK.
   Participants UK respondents to the 2017 International Food Policy Study aged 18-64 years who provided information on all variables of interest (n=3104).
   Outcome measures Self-reported perceived effectiveness of, and support for, the SDIL.
   Results Most participants supported the SDIL (70%), believed it would be effective (71%), had a positive attitude to SSBs (62%), had knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity (90%), and trusted messages from health experts (61%), but not those from the food and beverage industry (73%). Nearly half (46%) had negative social norms about drinking SSBs. In adjusted models, older age, non-consumption of SSBs, social norms to not drinks SSBs, knowledge of the link between SSBs and obesity and trust in health expert messages were associated with greater support for the SDIL, whereas having dependent children and trusting messages from the food and beverage industry were associated with less support. In adjusted models, older age was associated with lower perceived effectiveness of the SDIL, whereas social norms to not drink SSBs, negative attitudes to SSBs and trusting messages from health experts and the food and beverage industry were associated with greater perceived effectiveness.
   Conclusions There was strong support for the SDIL and belief that it would be effective. Those with more 'public health' orientated norms and trust were generally more likely to support the SDIL or believe that it would be effective.

AB  - Background HIV stigma has well-documented negative impacts on HIV testing, transmission risk behavior, initiation of and adherence to antiretroviral therapy, and retention in care. We sought to assess the extent to which anticipated HIV stigma is based on misperceptions of normative attitudes toward persons with HIV, and to determine whether persons with HIV have stronger misperceptions compared with HIV-negative persons or persons of unknown serostatus. We also sought to estimate the association between normative attitudes about persons with HIV and personal attitudes about persons with HIV, and to determine the extent to which anticipated stigma mediates this association.
   Methods We conducted a whole-population survey of 1776 persons living in 8 rural villages in southwestern Uganda. Negative attitudes toward persons with HIV, and anticipated stigma, were measured using a newly validated 15-item scale measuring multiple dimensions of HIV stigma, including social distance, blaming attitudes, and concerns about reciprocity. We used multivariable regression to estimate the association between normative attitudes about persons with HIV and personal attitudes toward persons with HIV, and to determine the extent to which perceptions of normative attitudes (anticipated stigma) mediated this association.
   Results Study participants believed that negative attitudes toward persons with HIV were more pervasive than they actually are. Perceptions of the extent to which these negative attitudes are normative mediated more than one-third of the association between normative attitudes and their personal attitudes. In contrast to what we originally hypothesized, persons with HIV were less likely to misperceive these norms and perceived normative attitudes to be less stigmatizing than did others in the general population.
   Conclusions Interventions designed to accurately describe normative attitudes toward persons with HIV may reduce HIV stigma without directly focusing on the educational components that are typically embedded in anti-stigma interventions.

AB  - In spite of their subtle nature, subliminal cues of group devaluation can have profound effects on members of targeted groups. Across three studies, we examine factors that allow people to counteract subliminal cues of group devaluation. We do this in the context of Spanish-German intergroup relations following the 2008 financial crisis. Throughout the crisis, narratives in politics and the media have drawn on national stereotypes to legitimize the economic situation in Spain. We argue that this represents a threat to our Spanish participants and that exposure to subliminal cues that reflect this threat will trigger responses that counteract this threat. Indeed, results showed that when subliminal associations legitimize the disadvantage faced by the group, our Spanish participants reversed the subliminal associations to which they were exposed. These findings show that Spanish participants are able to counteract the devaluation of their national in-group, even when that devaluation occurs outside of conscious awareness.

TI  - Attitude of Students in Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine Toward Donation After Cardiac Death
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
AB  - Background. This study aimed to investigate the attitude of students at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine toward organ transplantation and donation after cardiac death (DCD).
   Material and Methods. A questionnaire including 16 single-choice questions about organ transplantation and donation was designed, and a survey was conducted using this questionnaire on 300 randomly selected respondents at Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai, China.
   Results. The ratio of male to female was 1:2.4. Of the participants, 98.1% had heard of organ transplantation, and 68.2% had received the information through network news. Only 10.6% expressed a positive attitude toward organ transplantation in China. Further, 39.8% of the participants were willing to donate their organs after death, while 51.9% of the participants hesitated because of perceived opacity in how donated organs were used. Even among those who did not share this concern, only 46.2% considered it. However, 80.7% were in favor of organ donation between relatives. Separately, 67.4% and 60.2% of the participants were interested in participating in activities and publicity related to organ donation, respectively.
   Conclusions. A majority of the participants had an understanding of organ transplantation and had obtained this information through media. Most showed a positive attitude toward donation between relatives, but only some of them indicated willingness to donate their organs. Generally, acceptance and awareness of organ transplantation need to be improved. Media outreach and education might have a profound influence.

AB  - Social strategies are a central component of intercultural competence, and are vital in understanding, theoretically and practically, the immigration and acculturation process. This study focused on an immigrant group experiencing identity threat, namely young Ethiopians in Israel, and examined their perceptions of social strategies in intergroup relations. Thematic analysis was performed on two types of qualitative data: (1) newspaper articles in which members of the Ethiopian community addressed aspects of their social strategies (31 reports collected from seven newspapers and magazines) and (2) data from two focus groups conducted afterwards with young adult members of the Ethiopian community (five to seven participants in each group). A major pattern emerging from the immigrants' reports is the adoption of the hosts' perspective and attitudes regarding the effective norms of social behavior. In their daily coping, on the other hand, the immigrant youth tended to exhibit a complex and at times ambivalent variety of behavioral patterns in their social interactions with members of the host culture. This spectrum of social strategies suggests dynamic processes of trial and error and reflects the unique complexity of intercultural competence. Findings were analyzed in terms of the immigrants' perception of the threat to their identity and of their ways of coping with those threats. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: We assessed the knowledge of and attitudes toward HIV/AIDS and antiretroviral therapy (ART) in people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA).
   Methodology: A descriptive, cross-sectional study design was employed. A structured interviewer-administered questionnaire was administered to consecutive, consenting PLWHA who had been receiving treatment for a minimum of three months. The level of ART adherence was calculated manually for each respondent.
   Results: In total 318 PLWHA completed the questionnaire. The mean and median time on ART was 17.8 months and 19 months respectively. The mean age of the respondents was 39.1 +/- 9.6 years. The majority of these respondents (76.9%) had completed secondary education. Over 80% of the respondents reported knowing that HIV can be transmitted through blood transfusions and unprotected sexual intercourse. Seventy-six per cent of the respondents reported knowing that ART suppresses HIV activity. However, 33% of the respondents denied being HIV positive, while 22.6% reported that they felt that taking ART was shameful. Over 32% of the respondents reported that good adherence to ART would raise suspicions about their HIV status, and 66.7% had not yet disclosed their HIV status to anyone. Most (77.7%) respondents had good knowledge of HIV/AIDS while 75.2% had good knowledge of ART. Also 78.9% had positive attitude to HIV/AIDS while 73.9%) had positive attitude to ART. Respondents with good knowledge about HIV/AIDS and a positive attitude about the disease tended to be more adherent to ART (p<0.01).
   Conclusions: The majority of respondents had good knowledge of and a positive attitude toward HIV/AIDS and ART adherence.

AB  - Examinations of the relationship between attitudes about police and news media have regularly been undertaken since the Rodney King incident in 1991. Although cultivation theory, which argues greater news consumption will result in adoption of views of policing provided in the news, offers an appropriate theoretical framework for media studies of this kind, this body of research has largely lacked theoretical grounding. This study tests underlying premises of cultivation regarding the roles of overall news consumption, consumption of different types of news mediums, and exposure to negative news coverage in determining public perceptions of common policing outcomes. It also tests the mostly neglected area of how audiences perceive news they are consuming by considering how fair they deem the news portrayal of police to be. Using a sample of residents from a mid-sized city in California, results indicate consumption of Internet news is related to negative attitudes about police and exposure to negative news about police impacts perceptions, but only if the coverage is seen as fair. Implications for future research and advancement of cultivation as a theoretical framework in this area are discussed.

AB  - Racial, ethnic, religious, and sexual minority populations are growing rapidly in the West. We investigate predictors and consequences of threat responses to perceived minority group size, and perceptions of minority group size itself. Study 1 (N = 274) finds that right-wing adherence predicts greater size threat, whereas lower numerical ability predicts larger perceived group size (confirmed in Studies 2-3). Study 2 (Sample 1, N = 124; Sample 2, N = 263) finds that the relation between right-wing adherence and prejudice toward minorities exhibits an indirect effect via group size threat (but not perceived size), explaining 35-66% of this relation. Study 3 (N = 310) finds a comparable indirect effect explaining 27-40% of this relation, even after statistically controlling for indirect effects of realistic, symbolic, and terroristic threat. These findings provide novel insights into psychological processes surrounding perceived minority group size, identifying size threat as especially crucial in understanding intergroup relations.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) contribute to increased length of hospital stay, higher mortality and higher health-care costs. Prevention and control of HAIs is a critical public health concern. This study assessed the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) of standard infection control precautions among health-care workers (HCWs) in Qassim, Saudi Arabia. A cross-sectional online survey among HCWs was conducted using a structured questionnaire. Predictors of KAP were investigated using multivariate logistic regression analyses and independent sample t-tests. A total of 213 HCWs participated in the survey. The prevalence of good (& GE;80% correct response) knowledge, attitude, and practice were 67.6%, 61.5%, and 73.2%, respectively. The predictors of good knowledge included the age of the HCWs (> 34 years) (adjusted odds ratio: 30.5, p < 0.001), and training (13.3, p < 0.001). More than 6 years of work experience was a significant predictor of having a positive attitude (5.5, p < 0.001). While the predictors of good practice were having > 6 years of experience (2.9, p < 0.01), previous exposure to HAIs (2.5, p < 0.05), and training (3.5, p < 0.01). However, being female (0.22, p < 0.001) and older (> 34 years) (0.34, p < 0.01) were negatively associated with knowledge. Results indicate that arranging training for HCWs might be useful in improving their knowledge of standard infection control precautions and is also expected to facilitate positive attitude and practice.

AB  - Rights framing - presenting intergroup inequality as violating a minority group's basic rights - challenges the status quo of intergroup relations because it implies that the solution lies in a fundamental structural change. We suggest that majority-group members may show a backlash response to this challenge. Three studies revealed that Israeli Jews' support for policies that empower Israeli Arabs was lower when exposed to rights framing, compared to distress framing, i.e., presenting inequality as causing distress to the minority group (Studies 1-2), or a no-framing, control condition (Studies 2-3). This effect was mediated by increased zero sum perceptions (Study 2). When rights framing was combined with a manipulation highlighting intergroup positive interdependence (thus countering zero-sum perceptions), its negative effect disappeared (Study 3). Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The present research examined peoples (mis)interpretations of prosocial intergroup behaviors by investigating whether a helper's familiarity with the context influences the empathy and altruistic (vs. instrumental) motives recipients of help attribute to helpers. In four experiments we recruited participants from different cultural backgrounds (Kosovan Albanians and Swiss) and different age groups (adolescents and adults), and considered two different perspectives: participants either imagined themselves in a predicament (i.e., a mental stimulation) or learned about a fellow ingroup member in the same predicament (i.e., a real situation). In all experiments, we manipulated both helper categorization (ingroup vs. outgroup) and familiarity with the context (i.e., whether the situation happened in an ingroup vs. outgroup context). Results showed that participants attributed less empathy and less altruistic (vs. instrumental) motives to the helper and were less willing to accept help in the outgroup helper condition than in the ingroup helper condition. However, this pattern occurred mostly within ingroup contexts. Finally, perceptions of a helper's ability to provide a solution mediated the observed effects on the main dependent variables. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations.

AB  - Intergroup relations theory posits that cross-group friendship reduces threat perceptions and negative emotions about outgroups. This has been argued to mitigate the negative effects of ethnic diversity on generalized trust. Yet, direct tests of this friendship-trust relation, especially including perceptions of threat and negative affect as mediators, have remained rare at the individual level. In this article, we bridge this research gap using representative data from eight European countries (Group-Focused Enmity). We employ structural equation modelling (SEM) to model mediated paths of cross-group friendship on generalized trust via perceptions of threat and negative affect. We find that both the total effect as well as the (mediated) total indirect effect of cross-group friendship on generalized trust are weak when compared with similar paths estimated for prejudice.

AB  - This research provides a new perspective to understand user participation in social media by focusing on the user-platform relationship. By drawing on the theory of psychological ownership, this study argues that the key to promoting user participation is to create feelings of ownership toward social media, as this signifies a strong psychological bond between users and the platform. The model was tested using a web-based survey with respondents that were recruited from Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that self-investment and perceived control positively influenced users' psychological ownership toward social media, which in turn increased user participation. However, unlike previous literature on psychological ownership, this study found a negative association between intimate knowledge, that is, the degree of acquaintance as well as the number of experiences with social media, and users' psychological ownership. The results further showed that the paths toward achieving a sense of psychological ownership varied according to the extent to which users interact with others whom they perceive to be psychologically close to themselves, which is referred to as social distance. The theoretical and managerial implications for social media practitioners are also discussed.

AB  - This study examines the dynamic, real-time interplay between the emotional content of political television ads and individuals' political attitudes during ad processing based upon the Dynamic Motivational Activation (DMA) theoretical framework. Time-series cross-sectional models were developed to test the effects of three motivational inputs of emotional ads (arousing content, positivity, and negativity) and viewers' evaluation of the featured candidates on four psychophysiological responses (heart rate, skin conductance level, corrugator electromyography, and zygomatic electromyography). As predicted by the DMA, physiological responses during ad viewing were affected by their own first- and second-order dynamic system feedback effects. These results not only support the predicted dynamic nature of the physiological system but also help disentangle message effects from the moderating and accumulating effects of the physiological system itself. Also as predicted, message motivational inputs interacted with viewers' political attitudes to determine psychophysiological responses to the ads. Supporters of opposing political candidates showed cardiac-somatic response patterns indicative of disparate attention to the advertised information. Attentional selectivity can be a critical component in determining how information processing influences campaign message reception and effects.

AB  - Grounded in construal-level theory (CLT), this experiment examines how messages with different temporal frames (i.e., present- vs. future-framed) influence individuals' perceptions of, and reactions to, water conservation. One hundred ninety-three participants, 99 from China and 94 from the United States, participated in this study. Results indicated that a present-framed message results in more positive attitudes toward water conservation than the future-framed message. Participants who scored higher on individual future-time orientation show stronger behavioral intention to conserve water than participants who scored lower. A significant interaction between temporal message framing and country emerged such that the future-framed message resulted in greater behavioral intention for Chinese participants than their U.S. counterparts whereas the present-framed message did not differentially influence Chinese and U.S. participants. Implications of findings for theory-building and application are discussed.

AB  - Background We aimed to assess the feasibility of using multiple technologies to recruit and conduct cognitive interviews among young people across the United States to test items measuring sexual and reproductive empowerment. We sought to understand whether these methods could achieve a diverse sample of participants. With more researchers turning to approaches that maintain social distancing in the context of COVID-19, it has become more pressing to refine these remote research methods. Methods We used several online sites to recruit for and conduct cognitive testing of survey items. To recruit potential participants we advertised the study on the free online bulletin board, Craigslist, and the free online social network, Reddit. Interested participants completed an online Qualtrics screening form. To maximize diversity, we purposefully selected individuals to invite for participation. We used the video meeting platform, Zoom, to conduct the cognitive interviews. The interviewer opened a document with the items to be tested, shared the screen with the participant, and gave them control of the mouse and keyboard. After the participant self-administered the survey, the interviewer asked about interpretation and comprehension. After completion of the interviews we sent participants a follow-up survey about their impressions of the research methods and technologies used. We describe the processes, the advantages and disadvantages, and offer recommendations for researchers. Results We recruited and interviewed 30 young people from a range of regions, gender identities, sexual orientations, ages, education, and experiences with sexual activity. These methods allowed us to recruit a purposefully selected diverse sample in terms of race/ethnicity and region. It also may have offered potential participants a feeling of safety and anonymity leading to greater participation from gay, lesbian, and transgender people who would not have agreed to participate in-person. Conducting the interviews using video chat may also have facilitated the inclusion of individuals who would not volunteer for in-person meetings. Disadvantages of video interviewing included participant challenges to finding a private space for the interview and problems with electronic devices. Conclusions Online technologies can be used to achieve a diverse sample of research participants, contributing to research findings that better respond to young people's unique identities and situations.

T2  - NPJ SCIENCE OF FOOD
LA  - English
AB  - sThis paper analyzes the awareness and attitudes of the Chinese public toward genetically modified (GM) foods with different types of labeling and evaluates the impact of public confidence in the government management of GM food labeling has on their attitude. From 2015 to 2016, we conducted a series of surveys to collect data from 1730 respondents, which included consumers, farmers, media, and local agricultural officials in agricultural departments. The results show similar to 60% of the Chinese public do not know that they usually consume or purchase GM products or products containing GM ingredients. Nearly 80% of the Chinese public are accepting foods labeled as not containing GM ingredients, 57% are accepting foods without labeling, and similar to 40% are accepting GM-labeled foods. The respondents with a lack of confidence in the government are less likely to embrace GM foods. Those that are more aware of GM products are more likely to accept GM labeled foods. The group having the most positive attitude toward GM-labeled foods is the media, followed by agricultural officials, while the group having the most negative attitude toward GM labeled foods is farmers. Our findings provide an empirical basis to inform GM food labeling policy discussions and possible revisions, which may promote the development of GM foods in China.

AB  - This paper offers a social phenomenological reading of the globally binding practice of 'social distancing' in light of the precautionary measures against the spreading of the Covid-19 virus. Amid speculation about the far-reaching effects of temporarily applicable measures and foresights about the advent of an ethos that has been heralded by the media as the 'new normal', the ubiquitous phenomenon of social distancing calls for a fundamental ontological elucidation. The purported hermeneutic that is situated in the broader place branding and experiential marketing literatures places Covid-19 in the shoes of Being, and, therefore, imagines how Being would behave ontologically if it were a virus. By arguing that the virus does operate like Being, five theses are put forward as experiential interpretive categories with regard to the ontological status of Covid-19. The adopted approach makes the following contributions to the extant literature: First, it addresses a wholly new phenomenon in place branding, namely a pre-branded place whose meaning is non-negotiable, globally applicable and seemingly equivalent to pure void. Second, it advances the application of phenomenological research in place branding and experiential consumption by highlighting the aptness of the so far peripheral (in the marketing discipline) strand of Heideggerian fundamental ontology. Third, it extends the meaning of place in the place branding literature, by showing how spatialization is the outcome of temporalization, in line with the adopted phenomenological perspective.

AB  - In this study based on an actual event, we examined how group members cognitively, affectively, and behaviorally respond to devaluation of ingroup's social status. Integrating predictions from Social Identity Theory (SIT; Tajfel and Turner 1986) and Intergroup Emotions Theory (IET; Smith et al. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 93(3), 431-446 (2007)), we explored how appraisals about ingroup's perceived decrease in status (i.e., stability and legitimacy of status change and permeability of group boundaries) are associated with discrete group-level emotions (e.g., anger, shame), and how those emotions in turn predict different coping strategies Blanz et al. European Journal of Social Psychology, 28(5), 697-729 (1998). Analyses of the results showed that: First, preference for each coping strategy varied according to appraisals of ingroup status, and the patterns were largely consistent with what SIT predicts. Second, different group-level emotions were reported according to appraisals of ingroup status. Third, inclusion of group-level emotions as mediators of associations between ingroup status appraisals and coping strategies significantly increased the explanatory power of the path models. In sum, this study demonstrated how the two theories on intergroup relations can be used together to offer a more detailed account of group identity management. For future direction, experimental or longitudinal designs as well as cross-cultural comparisons were suggested.

AB  - Adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) often experience social marginalisation. This study uses a vignette-based design to clarify whether diagnostic disclosure affects social marginalisation in workplace contexts. It investigates two potential mediators of this relationship: affective response to and theory of mind for people with ASD. Participants (n = 170) read a description of a hypothetical co-worker with ASD traits, whose diagnosis was either disclosed or concealed. Providing a diagnostic label significantly reduced participants' desire to socially distance themselves from the target. This effect was mediated by positive affective responses. Diagnostic disclosure did not influence theory of mind for people with ASD but did increase tendencies to attribute primary emotions to the target; however, this did not relate to social distance outcomes.

AB  - Objectives The aims of the present studies were to investigate the effect of interconnectedness in reducing stigmatization of people with mental illness and the ways compassion mediates the effect of interconnectedness on stigma. Methods Two studies were conducted using college students as participants. In study 1, path analysis was employed to investigate the associations between interconnectedness, compassion, and stigma among people with mental illness. In study 2, an experiment with three conditions (i.e., interconnectedness, compassion, and active control conditions) was conducted to investigate the effect of interconnectedness on stigma reduction. This study also attempted to investigate causally the mediating role of compassion on the effect of interconnectedness on stigma. Results Study 1 (n = 135) found that compassion significantly mediated the relationship between interconnectedness and social distance [beta = 0.09, 95% CI (0.03 to 0.24), p < 0.001] and interconnectedness and personal advocacy [beta = 0.14, 95% CI (0.10 to 0.35), p < 0.001]. Results of repeated measures ANOVA in study 2 (n = 157) found that induction of interconnectedness led to significantly lower social distance but no significant increase in personal advocacy for people with mental illness. No significant effect was found in the compassion condition. Results of path analysis showed that the interconnectedness condition resulted in a higher post-experimental compassion score, which in turn predicted a higher follow-up personal advocacy score 2 weeks later. The compassion condition, however, could not predict a higher post-experimental interconnectedness score. The mediation effect of compassion was supported. Conclusions The present study suggests that interconnectedness might reduce stigmatization of people with mental illness directly or through compassion.

AB  - Illegal immigration is a contentious issue on the American policy agenda. To understand the sources of public attitudes toward immigration, social scientists have focused attention on political factors such as party identification; they have also drawn on theories of intergroup contact to argue that contact with immigrants shapes immigration attitudes. Absent direct measures, contextual measures such as respondents' ethnic milieu or proximity to salient geographic features (such as borders) have been used as proxies of contact. Such a research strategy still leaves the question unanswered - is it contact or context that really matters? Further, which context, and for whom? This article evaluates the effects of party identification, personal contact with undocumented immigrants, and contextual measures (county Hispanic population and proximity to the US-Mexico border) on American attitudes toward illegal immigration. It finds that contextual factors moderate the effects of political party identification on attitudes toward illegal immigration; personal contact has no effect. These findings challenge the assumption that contextual measures act as proxies for interpersonal contact.

AB  - Embracing sustainability in the 21st century entails developing environmental identity, so that attitudes towards energy sustainability result from the core values of one's individual and social identity. This study aims to explore the shift in the formation of environmental identity and attitudes towards energy sustainability throughout the course of the two-year study period (2018-2020). A dataset of 8,677,961 tweets, Facebook posts and comments and 325,228 news articles was collected to carry out quantitative analysis of the distribution of the posts, likes, and comments. A correlation with media coverage of energy and green topics was sought to establish the impact of the media on public debate. A qualitative analysis of posts and tweets was carried out to establish dominant themes. The findings of the study reveal that both positive attitudes towards energy sustainability and environmental identity have been consolidated throughout the two-year study period. Social media users are not only increasingly interested in green issues but also produce more reactions towards posts related to sustainability topics. The results also suggest that sustainable values and green behavior are independent from the media coverage of current events and the perceived threat to one's health from COVID-19. Social networking sites provide a context in which users not only reinforce their beliefs and values, but also mimic the behavior of other users, which leads to the formation of a social media identity bubble that reinforces shared identity-in this case, environmental identity. This study offers a multidisciplinary perspective on sustainable development that will be able to drive equitable energy security and environmental security.

AB  - Ecolabels are regarded as an exceptional marketing and advertising tool that informs contemporary consumers about the green traits of a product. They provide information that motivates consumers to exhibit a positive attitude and actual behavior towards a green product purchase. Despite the growing interest in the relationship between green attitude and the corresponding green purchase behavior, studies that investigate the influence of ecolabel features on this relationship are rather scarce. In the present study, a survey carried out in Greece with a sample of 571 participants, examined the direct and indirect effects of ecolabel credibility and ecolabel involvement on attitude and actual behavior about green product purchase. A multiple mediation model about green purchase behavior was developed. Results highlighted the crucial role of ecolabel credibility that positively influences attitude towards green product purchase as well as ecolabel involvement. Moreover, emphasis was given on the concepts of attitude towards green product purchase and ecolabel involvement that proved to be significant mediators of this model. Findings can provide useful guidance to green marketers so that they can generate effective strategies based of ecolabels and favor a positive attitude towards green product purchase that ultimately will enhance green product purchase behavior.

AB  - Public attitude surveys are the prime method used to assess public attitudes to science and technology, but can also be very problematic-as evidenced in the number of different polls that come up with different findings. Toward better understanding of what drives public attitudes, it has become more relevant to find out "Why" people think what they do about science and technology than to know "What" they think. Recent research into how values drive attitudes has been very important to our increased understanding. However, in a post-truth, post-trust, post-expert world-where notions of truth, trust, and expertise are now commonly contested-we need to also better understand the social and media environments we are now living in, and how they affect attitudes to new technologies.

AB  - Health anxiety has been linked with fear and anxiety regarding COVID-19. Higher levels of health anxiety likely increased social distancing and self-isolating during the pandemic. We investigated relations among health anxiety, fear of missing out (FOMO) on rewarding social experiences from social distancing, and consequential levels of problematic smartphone use (PSU) and gaming disorder (GD). We surveyed a broad sample of 812 U.S. and Canadian participants during the pandemic, in late-May 2020, using the Short Health Anxiety Inventory, FOMO Scale, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and GD test. Significant bivariate relationships were found among health anxiety, FOMO, PSU, and GD severity. Using structural equation modeling, FOMO mediated relations between health anxiety and both PSU and GD severity. We discuss FOMO as an important variable explaining problematic digital technology use to compensate for unmet social needs from social distancing. We discuss these findings within the context of the Interaction of Person-Affect-Cognition-Execution theoretical model of problematic internet use. Results offer novel insight into the role of health anxiety on FOMO from unmet social needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, and consequential problematic internet use.

AB  - The present research examined the differential relationship between distinct construals of collective victimhoodspecifically, inclusive and exclusive victim consciousnessand intergroup attitudes in the context and aftermath of mass violence. Three surveys in Rwanda (N=842), Burundi (N=1,074), and Eastern DRC (N=1,609) provided empirical support for the hypothesis that while exclusive victim consciousness predicts negative intergroup attitudes, inclusive victim consciousness is associated with positive, prosocial intergroup attitudes. These findings were significant when controlling for age, gender, urban/rural residence, education, personal victimization, and ingroup superiority. Additionally, exclusive victim consciousness mediated the effects of ingroup superiority on negative intergroup attitudes. These findings have important theoretical implications for research on collective victimhood as well as practical implications for intergroup relations in regions emerging from violent conflict.

AB  - Introduction: Because of shortage of personnel for the Danish mammography screening programme, the aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of radiologists and radiographers towards a future implementation of radiographers reading screening mammograms.
   Materials and methods: Seven combined phenomenological and hermeneutical interviews with radiographers and radiologists were performed. Stratified selection was used for sampling of informants. The interviews were analysed against theory about quality, organization and profession.
   Results: Quality related possibilities: radiographers do routinely measure the performance quality, radiographers obtain sufficient reading qualifications, and skill mix improves quality. Quality related obstacles: radiologists do not routinely measure performance quality. Organization related possibilities: shortage of radiologists, positive attitudes of managers, and improved working relations. Organization related obstacles: shortage of radiographers and negative attitudes of managers. Professional related possibilities: positive experience with skill mix. Professional related obstacles: worries about negative consequences for the training of radiologists, and resistance against handing over tasks to another profession.
   Conclusion: Attitudes towards radiographers reading screening mammograms are attached to either quality-, organisational or professional perspectives. Radiographers are capable of learning to read mammograms at sufficient performance level but routine measurement of performance quality is essential. Resistance against skill mix may be caused by an emotionally conditioned fear of losing demarcations. The main motive for skill mix is improvement of the utilization of resources. No evidence was found regarding the organisational and financial consequences of skill mix. Despite of this all radiologists and radiographers experienced with skill mix were strong advocates for reading radiographers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, promotion is an institutionally mediated effort to bolster or redirect a person's health, strength, and other assets to build resilience. We analyse a Swedish version of the Life in Action promotion programme used in secondary schools in three municipalities. Focusing on types of alienation as framed in the programme, we argue that Life in Action's treatment of the psyche as an object in need of conscious monitoring, nurturing, and enhancement of qualities such as positive attitude and self-discipline signals the teenage participants' required alienation. Concluding the article, we discuss how this type of alienation may already be present in participating students, and also how it may be necessary for young people about to enter work-life in the era of late capitalism.

AB  - Mounting reports in the media suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has intensified prejudice and discrimination against racial/ethnic minorities, especially Asians. Existing research has focused on discrimination against Asians and is primarily based on self-reported incidents or nonrepresentative samples. We investigate the extent to which COVID-19 has fueled prejudice and discrimination against multiple racial/ethnic minority groups in the United States by examining nationally representative survey data with an embedded vignette experiment about roommate selection (collected in August 2020; n = 5,000). We find that priming COVID-19 salience has an immediate, statistically significant impact: compared to the control group, respondents in the treatment group exhibited increased prejudice and discriminatory intent against East Asian, South Asian, and Hispanic hypothetical room-seekers. The treatment effect is more pronounced in increasing extreme negative attitudes toward the three minority groups than decreasing extreme positive attitudes toward them. This is partly due to the treatment increasing the proportion of respondents who perceive these minority groups as extremely culturally incompatible (Asians and Hispanics) and extremely irresponsible (Asians). Sociopolitical factors did not moderate the treatment effects on attitudes toward Asians, but prior social contact with Hispanics mitigated prejudices against them. These findings suggest that COVID-19-fueled prejudice and discrimination have not been limited to East Asians but are part of a broader phenomenon that has affected Asians generally and Hispanics as well.

AB  - The tragic Christchurch massacre brought the dangers of social 'othering' to the forefront of public attention. While the extreme nature of the attack shocked majority and minority groups alike, overt and latent discrimination are common experiences for many minorities in Aotearoa. Focusing on the impact of discrimination, this research examines the mechanism through which discrimination negatively affects intergroup trust, utilizing the multidimensional Intergroup Trust Model. We investigate trust through a study of police-minority relations, comparing the Aotearoa Maori perspective with the Black American perspective. Mediation analysis, based on a multidimensional approach to trust, suggests a similar mechanism across both groups: Perceived discrimination's impact on trust is mediated by a lack of compatibility-based trust, the perception that they are 'others' to the police. Taken together, the results provide insight on how discrimination erodes intergroup relations and indicate that its damaging impact can be repaired by strengthening groups' perceived compatibility with one another and highlighting shared parallel similarities.

AB  - Objective To examine perceptions, behaviors, and impacts surrounding COVID-19 early in the pandemic response. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey of 1,030 U.S. adults was administered on March 31st, 2020. This survey examined attitudes toward media, government, and community responses to COVID-19 by political ideology and sociodemographic factors. Knowledge, anxieties, and impacts of COVID-19 were also assessed. Results Conservatives were more likely to report that COVID-19 was receiving too much media coverage and people were generally overreacting; liberals were more likely to report the government had not done enough in response to the pandemic. Females and those with lower income experienced more COVID-19 related economic anxieties. Those working and with children at home reported higher social, home, and work disruption. Social distancing behaviors were more common among liberals and were associated with increases in depressive symptoms. General knowledge about COVID-19 was widely exhibited across the sample, however, Black and Hispanic respondents were less likely to correctly answer questions about the availability of a vaccine and modes of transmission. Conclusions Public health experts should consider the political climate in crafting messaging that appeals to the values of those across the political spectrum. Research on the COVID-19 pandemic should continue to monitor the effects of social distancing on mental health and among vulnerable populations.

KW  - panel data
AB  - Over the last decade, issues related to immigration have become increasingly salient across Western democracies. This increasing salience has made it more important to understand people's attitudes toward immigration, including the effects of media use on those attitudes. Differentiating between attitudes toward different types of immigration, attitudes toward immigration from different parts of the world, and perceptions of immigration's impact, this article investigates the effects of media use on attitudes toward and perceptions of immigration in Sweden. Based on a three-year, three-wave panel study, it investigates the effects of media use on the individual level. Among other things, results show that there are limited effects of using traditional news media but more substantial effects on people's immigration attitudes of using anti-immigration, right-wing alternative media and pro-immigration, left-wing alternative media. These findings imply that it is highly relevant to account for media use, especially alternative media use, when studying public attitudes toward immigration. Further, we find that variations in people's immigration attitudes, to a high degree, depend on the type of immigration and on where migrants are coming from. This finding underlines the importance of measuring both of these aspects when the aim is understanding general attitudes toward immigration and/or key predictors behind immigration attitudes.

AB  - Many studies of intergroup relations have examined the effects of group identity on various types of intergroup cognition and behavior. However, few studies have focused on the perceived group identity of outgroup members. This study examined the effects of perceptions of outgroup identity on anticipated rejection by an outgroup. In Study 1, we administered a questionnaire pertaining to 30 social groups to Japanese undergraduate and vocational students. The collective images and intro-individual processes relating to perceived outgroup identity were investigated by applying correlation analysis and multilevel structural equation modeling. In Study 2, we conducted an experiment in which we manipulated the participants' perceptions of relative levels of outgroup members' identity. Both studies demonstrated, as predicted, that people anticipated rejection by strongly identified outgroup members more than by weakly identified outgroup members. Furthermore, in Study 2, anticipated same-group favoritism mediated the relationship between the manipulation of perceived outgroup identity and anticipated rejection. These findings suggest the important role of perceived outgroup identity in intergroup cognition.

AB  - The study aimed to measure Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) and fear level towards COVID-19 and explore its cross-cultural variances in knowledge by sociodemographic factors among the general population of 8 different countries over 5 continents. It was a cross-sectional online survey. This survey was conducted in April 2020 among 1296 participants using the "Google Form" platform. Considering the social distancing formula and pandemic situation, we collect data using popular social media networks. Univariate and bivariate analyses were used to explore the collected data on KAP, fear, and sociodemographic factors. Overall knowledge score was 9.7 +/- 1.7 (out of 12), and gender differences (female vs male: 9.8 +/- 1.6 vs 9.5 +/- 1.9) were significant (p = 0.008) in the bivariate analysis. Knowledge score variances were found significant in some regions by gender, marital status, and education qualification. The highest and lowest mean knowledge scores were recorded in the Middle East (10.0 +/- 1.7) and Europe (9.3 +/- 2.0). Despite having a high fear score (22.5 +/- 5.6 out of 35), 78.35% of respondents were positively and 81.7% in a good practice level. Fear score rankings: Middle East (1st; 23.8 +/- 5.5), Europe (2nd; 23.2 +/- 5.8), Africa (3rd; 22.7 +/- 5.0), South Asia (4th; 22.1 +/- 5.7), Oceania (5th; 21.9 +/- 5.8), and North America (6th; 21.7 +/- 5.5). Fear and knowledge were not correlated. KAP and fear variation exist among geographical regions. Gender, marital status, and education qualification are factors in knowledge variances for some regions. KAP and fear measures can help health education programs consider some sociodemographic factors and regions during an outbreak of highly contagious disease and uplift a positive attitude and good practice.

AB  - During the COVID-19 emergency, people must face the invisible threat of uncertain death and comply with social distancing and other related protective measures. But social networking sites (SNSs) like WeChat have emerged as alternative contexts where people can maintain self and obtain gratification, despite the disclosure of self to others often being a challenging issue. To examine the effect of personality factors on people's self-disclosure on SNSs, we develop a model based on the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory. We suggest that people's narcissism traits and two types of time perspective (i.e. future and present-hedonistic) have positive effects on their self-disclosure. In addition, we propose that virtual presence and hedonic gratification mediate the effects of both future time perspective and present-hedonistic time perspective. We obtain a sample of 516 WeChat users in China and take ex-ante and post-hoc measures to deal with common method variance. By means of partial least squares-structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) methods, we validate both our measurement model and the structural model, so we confirm all the hypothesized causal paths in the proposed model. Our study broadens the boundaries of the time perspective theory and the socioemotional selectivity theory, and offers new insights for addressing some of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - This study offers new insights into the power of peer networks for shaping intergroup relations in a diverse school. Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of sixth-eighth graders (N = 524; M-ageT1 = 11.87; 48% girls; 9% Asian American/Pacific Islander, 28% African American, 13% Latino, 1% Native American, 31% White, 5% Other, and 11% Multiracial) in the Midwestern United States. Students with more positive intergroup contact attitudes (ICA) were most likely to be friends with similarly minded students. Students with more positive ICA were less likely to select friends of the same race/ethnicity than those with less positive ICA. Finally, students' ICA became more similar to their friends' ICA over time. Results implicate school-level norms and contagion in students' ICA.

AB  - Electoral systems are assumed to enhance political efficacy and encourage participation through party mobilisation because they create incentives for parties (or candidates) to mobilise voters. This paper makes use of survey data collected after elections in more than 30 countries, spanning a variety of party systems in both established and new democracies, to examine how party mobilisation varies across context and what difference it makes. The results demonstrate that political efficacy and behaviour are enhanced when parties mobilise voters. This is most likely to occur in systems where parties compete in a narrow issue space. In contrast, citizens are less likely to come into contact with parties in polarised systems. This has consequences for both political attitudes and engagement.

AB  - The central aim of this study is to build upon previous research by investigating the role of product involvement, prior brand attitude, persuasion knowledge and game attitude in the brand attitude changes and purchase intentions of children after playing an advergame. In all, 279 respondents between the ages of 10 and 12 years participated in the study. First, they were asked to complete a pre-test survey addressing product involvement and prior brand attitude towards several products and brands. Two weeks later, the respondents were asked to play an advergame and complete a survey addressing brand attitude, purchase intention, persuasion knowledge and attitude towards the game. Our analysis reveals that a positive attitude change is more likely when the game player has already evaluated the brand positively. Furthermore, game attitude is positively related to attitude changes towards the advertised brands, consistent with affect transfer theory. Counterintuitively, a higher level of persuasion knowledge is associated with a higher intention to buy the advertised product. Finally, children who had a more positive attitude towards the game were more likely to report higher purchase intentions, indicating that games which provide good experiences positively influence behavioural intentions. We conclude the paper by discussing the study's limitations and suggestions for future research.

AB  - The results of research linking age and sexual risk among men who have sex with men have been inconsistent. This study assessed the relationship between age and sexual risk among 193 Black men who have sex with men in Pretoria. Older men who have sex with men reported engaging in more frequent unprotected insertive anal intercourse. We examined whether components of Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills model mediated this relationship. Results showed that (1) older age predicts less positive attitudes toward condoms, (2) less positive attitudes predict more frequent unprotected insertive anal intercourse, and (3) attitudes mediate the relationship between age and frequency of unprotected insertive anal intercourse. We consider two possible explanations for these findings: a developmental trajectory and a cohort effect.

AB  - This study investigates how personality relates to citizens' willingness to extend political, social, and cultural rights for minorities, including voting rights for immigrants, religious rights for Muslims, and affirmative action measures. Moving beyond explanations centred on intergroup relations, we argue that political efficacy (i.e. beliefs about personal political competences and the responsiveness of political elites) operates as a mechanism linking personality and policy preferences on minority rights. We test these arguments using mediation models on data from a large-N survey conducted in Germany in 2016. Results show that high openness, high agreeableness, and low conscientiousness predict permissive views on minority rights. In addition to indirect effects via group-specific attitudes, we find empirical support for substantial links via political efficacy. In particular, people high in conscientiousness or high in neuroticism have lower faith in government responsiveness, which in turn is related to less willingness to approve minority rights.

AB  - Introduction: The aim was to investigate the adequacy of preventive measures, awareness, and attitudes of pharmacy university students in the Punjab province, Pakistan, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: This cross-sectional survey was designed at a private university in Faisalabad, Pakistan. The questionnaire was developed on Google forms and distributed to students of five universities in the Punjab province via WhatsApp groups. Results: The comparison of COVID-19 knowledge for specific questions showed that non-pharmacy students (NPS) had significantly better knowledge about the source of the virus (p<0.001), while pharmacy students (PS) had better knowledge regarding COVID-19 treatment (p=0.01). The PS's perception of the dangerousness and risk of contracting COVID-19 infection was better than NPS's perception (p=0.026; p=0.019, respectively). The regression analysis revealed that the knowledge score was negatively associated with the female gender, and females were less likely to have a positive attitude. Conclusion: The authors' results suggest that PS had good knowledge, positive attitude, and preparedness towards COVID-19. However, there are still misconceptions and confusion about the disease.

AB  - This study examined the mediating effect of perceived causal attribution of crisis on the relationship between perceived violation of social missions and public attitude, in addition to examining the moderating effects of both the medium and framing of online articles on the relationship between perceived violation of social missions and public attitude and that between perceived causal attribution and public attitude. The study conducted a quantitative content analysis of 511 comments obtained from 16 online articles for analysing a social enterprise crisis. The results supported that perceived causal attribution mediated the effect of perceived violation of social missions on public attitude. In addition, episodically framed articles enhanced the effect of perceived violation of social missions on public attitude, whereas Facebook articles enhanced the effect of perceived causal attribution on public attitude. Implications for public relations practitioners and journalists are discussed in this article.

AB  - ObjectiveWe examined the effects of control motivation on in-group positivity. Past research suggests that people compensate for low personal control by increasing support for social in-groups. We predicted that the effect of personal control on in-group positivity would depend on the type of in-group positivity. Low personal control should increase compensatory, narcissistic in-group positivity, whereas high personal control should increase secure, non-narcissistic in-group positivity.
   MethodThese hypotheses were tested in a cross-sectional survey (Study 1 N=1,083, 54% female, M-age=47.68), two experiments (Study 2 N=105, 50% female, M-age=32.05; Study 3 N=154, 40% female, M-age=29.93), and a longitudinal survey (Study 4 N=398, 51% female, M-age=32.05).
   ResultsIn all studies, personal control was negatively associated with narcissistic in-group positivity but positively associated with non-narcissistic in-group positivity. The longitudinal survey additionally showed that the positive relationship between personal control and non-narcissistic in-group positivity was reciprocal. Moreover, both types of in-group positivity differentially mediated between personal control and out-group attitudes: Narcissistic in-group positivity predicted negative attitudes, and non-narcissistic positivity predicted positive attitudes.
   ConclusionsThese findings highlight the role of individual motivation in fostering different types of in-group positivity and intergroup outcomes.

AB  - This study presents the psychometric proprieties of the Italian version of the Social Dominance Orientation(7) (SDO7) Scale, originally developed by Ho et al. (2015). We recruited a convenience sample (N = 497) to answer an online self-report questionnaire, including the SDO7 Scale and other relevant convergent and divergent measures. The confirmatory factor analysis revealed that SDO7 presents a satisfactory fit to the data, both as a two-correlated factor structure and as a one-dimensional measure. The two-correlated factor structure is confirmed as composed by two subdimensions as in the original version: the SDO-Dominance (SDO-D) and the SDO-Anti-Egalitarianism (SDO-E). Since the total SDO7 score measures people's support for asymmetrical group relationships, the SDO-D is concerned with people's support for dominant-submissive forms of intergroup relationships whereas the SDO-E refers to the desire to support intergroup inequalities. The scale and subscales also present satisfactory indexes of reliability as well as convergent and divergent validity.

AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N53,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right-and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

AB  - Given evidence linking sugary drinks consumption to weight gain, public health proponents are increasingly interested in ways to reduce sugary drinks consumption. This study explored the use of media, specifically, anti-sugary drinks television ads, as a tool for addressing sugary drinks consumption. Ad-related discussion and social norm perceptions are important to media's effects, but to date, these two influences have not been examined separately. To better parse these effects, college students (N=109) viewed anti-sugary drinks ads either with or without the presence of a friend (a manipulation of social norm perceptions), and either discussed or did not discuss the ads after viewing them. Changes in baseline sugary drinks health knowledge, attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption, and intentions to reduce sugary drinks consumption were examined at post-exposure and one-week follow-up. Consumption levels were also examined at baseline and follow-up. After viewing the ads, participants across conditions reported better sugary drinks health knowledge, more positive attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption, greater intentions to reduce sugary drinks consumption, and lower sugary drinks consumption, although not all effects were maintained at follow-up. Friend presence and discussion did not have substantial effects on outcomes; however, participants that viewed the ads in the presence of a friend maintained positive attitudes toward reducing sugary drinks consumption at follow-up, while those without a friend did not. Results suggest anti-sugary drinks ads are a promising tool for addressing sugary drinks consumption, and that social norm perceptions likely play an important role in explaining media effects.

AB  - Extensive scholarly attention is devoted to citizens' preferences for alternative models of political decision-making. However, few efforts were made to identify who these citizens are and why they display a certain preference. To address this void in the literature, our article analyzes the determinants of preferences for citizens as decision-makers. It uses individual-level data from a 2014 survey on a probability representative sample in Germany and tests the effects of political attitudes toward institutions of representative democracy, interest in politics, and civic involvement. It controls for consumption of political news, education, and age.

AB  - The study aims at establishing the benefits of actively utilizing the intangible resources of solid waste management customers in designing and implementing solid waste collection services, using the social media platforms. While Ghana generates high volumes of solid waste on a daily basis, less than half of it is effectively collected and disposed of. This calls for the adoption of innovative strategies to better connect and serve customers. Adopting a marketing approach to solid waste management has not been given much needed attention in Ghana and Africa, and this research sought to contribute in that direction. There is high usage of mobile telephony services in Ghana which a waste firm can explore to change negative attitude to waste disposal by the populace. Online co-creation is seen as a modern marketing approach leading to behavioral change in consumers. In this regard, the study looked at customer online co-creation in the solid waste collection sector in Ghana. The study adopted the survey strategy using structured questionnaire as the measure instrument, and data analyzed using both the structural equation model (SEM) and hierarchical multiple regression. The key findings are that customer intangible resources (online experience and skills) can be tapped by waste firms to co-create services that would generate positive attitude towards sanitation issues and the willingness to advocate the services and programs of the firm. Similarly, waste firms must invest in well-functioning and information rich digital platforms, and to devise innovative strategies to direct traffic to these platforms for effective customer participation.

AB  - Aims: Post-traumatic growth (PTG) refers to positive changes that result from coping with a major life crisis or a traumatic event. Factors influencing PTG in youth have not been well characterized but could have a great impact on overall maturation.
   Methods: Fourth to ninth graders (n = 3337) attending elementary or junior high schools located in a district severely damaged by the Great East Japan Earthquake completed a questionnaire, including the revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children (PTGI-C-R) along with the Post Traumatic Stress Symptoms for Children 15 items (PTSSC-15), 31 months after the event. Experience of the disaster, prior traumatic experiences, and attitudes toward memories of the disaster (rumination) were scored by their caregivers and teachers, and effects of these factors on PTG were evaluated.
   Results: There were no significant associations between PTGI-C-R and sex or experiences of the disaster. However, PTGI-C-R was negatively correlated with age (r = -0.132, P < 0.001). There was significant but very weak negative correlation between PTGI-C-R and PTSSC-15 among the children (r = -0.096, P < 0.001). PTGI-C-R was significantly associated with positive attitudes to memorial services (P < 0.001) and media coverage (P < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Positive attitudes to deliberate rumination may facilitate PTG in children following natural disasters.

AB  - Objectives: To examine how dementia is associated with COVID-19 risk and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, and whether mitigation behaviors mediate the relationship between dementia and COVID-19 risk.
   Methods/Design: We analyzed 2019 and 2020 data from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, a national prospective cohort study of United States older adults age 65+. Outcomes were COVID-19 diagnosis and adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing).
   Results: Among the 3257 older adults in this study, 485 (14.9%) had dementia in 2019 and 98 (3.1%) were COVID-19 positive in 2020. Dementia significantly increased the odds of COVID-19 by 129% (odds ratio [OR] = 2.29, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.32-3.97). and remained elevated after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 0.90-3.11). Dementia significantly decreased the odds of handwashing by 72% (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.17-0.44), which remained lower after adjusting for sociodemographics and health (OR = 0.53, 95% CI 0.23-1.21). Dementia was not significantly associated with mask-wearing and social distancing. The relationship between dementia and COVID-19 was primarily mediated by functional impairment, income, and residential setting.
   Conclusions: Dementia was associated with an increased COVID-19 risk and lower adherence to handwashing among U.S. older adults. Adherence to COVID-19 mitigation behaviors did not mediate COVID-19 risk by dementia status. For older adults with dementia, COVID-19 risk could be decreased by prioritizing health interventions.

AB  - Background: A diagnosis of epilepsy has a major effect on children; especially among schoolchildren. Studies have shown that a significant proportion of teachers and students have negative attitude and misunderstanding towards epilepsy making it difficult for a child with epilepsy. At the same time, there is a dearth is dearth of literature regarding interventions to bring about a change in the attitudes of children.
   Methodology: The aim of the present study was to study the outcome of a school-based health education program for epilepsy awareness among schoolchilcIren.The objectives were to assess the level of knowledge, attitude, and practices about epilepsy and relationship among these variables. A total of 70 children, from 8th-lOth grades were selected randomly for the study. For the study purpose, knowledge, attitude, and practices of epilepsy instrument were developed and face validated by experts.
   Results: Results show that the mean, median, and mode age of the respondents in the study were 1455 ( 1.33), 15, and 14 years, respectively. The gender distribution of the respondents was 54.9% boys and 45.1% girls. With regard to knowledge, attitude, and practices in epilepsy, knowledge strongly and positively correlated with attitude (p - 0.001, r - .423) and practice domains (p - 0.001, r - .486). Postattitude and (p - 0.001, r - .338) practice were positively correlated, which shows that positive attitude brings positive practice. Hence, it is
   concluded that a training program brings desirable change in the knowledge, attitude, and practice domains among children. Conclusion: Health education programs for schoolchildren arc very important to bring changes in their attitude, behavior, and practices. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BackgroundThe patient perspective on the use of screening for high risks of adverse health outcomes in Emergency Department (ED) care is underexposed, although it is an important perspective influencing implementation in routine care. This study explores the experiences with, and attitudes towards geriatric screening in routine ED care among older people who visited the ED.MethodsThis was a qualitative study using individual face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Interviews were conducted in older patients (>= 70years) who completed the 'Acutely Presenting Older Patient' screener while visiting the ED of a Dutch academic hospital. Purposive convenience sampling was used to select a heterogeneous sample of participants regarding age, disease severity and the result from screening. Transcripts were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis.ResultsAfter 13 interviews (7 women, median age 82years), data saturation was reached. The participants had noticed little of the screening administration during triage and screening was considered as a normal part of ED care. Most participants believed that geriatric screening contributes to assessing older patients holistically, recognizing geriatric problems early and comforting patients with communication and attention. None of the participants had a negative attitude towards screening or thought that screening is discrimination on age. Care providers should communicate respectfully with frail older patients and involve them in decision-making.ConclusionsOlder patients experienced geriatric screening as a normal part of ED care and had predominantly positive attitudes towards its use in the ED. This qualitative study advocates for continuing the implementation of geriatric screening in routine ED practice.

AB  - Background. There has been an increase in the number of patients waiting for organ transplantation.
   Methods. A questionnaire on knowledge and attitude toward organ donation was completed by 434 allied health students.
   Results. Overall knowledge about the various aspects of organ donation was adequate and was higher among women and clinical students. Although the majority were willing to be living donors for their families, very few students supported deceased organ donation, and even fewer of them had thought about an organ donation card. Despite the good knowledge, an overall positive attitude toward deceased donation was held by only 44% of the students. In contrast, the attitude toward directed living organ donation to family members was favorable in 83.1% of the respondents, which seems to be influenced by cultural and sociodemographic factors. Our findings indicate that the most frequent cause of refusal to donate organs among students with negative attitudes was the mistrust of medical staff regarding brain death diagnosis (49.9%), followed by bodily concerns (18.1%) and religion (9.9%). Quite a few of our respondents supported commercial donation, which was attributed to the less knowledgeable groups. Respondents who were willing to donate organs indicated that the reason was for helping others and sympathy. This study identified that the main source of information about organ donation for the respondents was television, followed by relatives/friends and the internet.
   Conclusions. The misconception of the students toward deceased donation needs to be improved by integrating the concepts of brain death within the curriculum of allied health students.

AB  - Understanding patterns and motivations for social spacing greatly illuminates the structure and internal dynamics of given groups or social systems. The highly social, polygynous greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata, represents an excellent model for social spacing analysis, since the choice of individual roost-sites within a day-roost constitutes an enduring, often repeated decision about relative proximity to conspecifics. Day-roost colonies consist of one or multiple harem groups, each with several females and a single male. Additionally, non-harem males without females may be present. A social-distance-time-budget metric revealed that harem males, females, and non-harem males differed significantly in their respective spatial associations while roosting. Harem males and females were most closely associated, with harem males located at the center of harems instead of at the borders. Non-harem males associated significantly closer with one another than with harem females that they were trying to access. The signaling modality mediating social interactions depended on the respective social distances between communicating bats. Our results suggest a concentric social organization based around harem males, which may select roost sites in closest possible proximity to females to enhance courtship signal strength. This constitutes an interesting deviation from the normative form of harem maintenance, patrolling borders, in mammals.

AB  - Introduction: : Depression is associated with difficulties in interpersonal relationships, of which communication is an integral part. Communication can not only be effected by verbal means, but also non-verbally by touch. Against this background, the aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between depression, interpersonal problems and the attitude towards social touch.
   Methods: : 147 individuals (115 females; 21-71 years old) seeking treatment in a clinic for outpatient psychotherapy took part in the survey. Three questionnaires evaluating the level of depression (Beck Depression Questionnaire), the degree of interpersonal problems (Inventory of Interpersonal Problems) and the attitude towards social touch (Social Touch Questionnaire, were administered.
   Results: : Highly depressed individuals had a more negative attitude towards social touch than non-to lowly depressed individuals. Highly depressed individuals particularly reported to dislike physical touch by not well-known people, but not by close ones. Highly depressed individuals also reported more interpersonal problems, with the level of depression predicting the degree of interpersonal problems. This relationship was partially mediated by the attitude towards social touch in general and, to a greater extent, by the dislike of physical touch by people not well-known in particular.
   Discussion: : Given the role of social touch in the relationship between depression and interpersonal problems, the attitude towards touch may be taken into consideration in the therapy of depressed patients. We assume that a more positive attitude towards social touch can influence the ability to create and maintain interpersonal relationships.

AB  - Research has shown that citizens with populist attitudes evaluate the news media more negatively, and there is also suggestive evidence that they rely less on established news sources like the legacy press. However, due to data limitations, there is still no solid evidence whether populist citizens have skewed news diets in the contemporary high-choice digital media environment. In this paper, we rely on the selective exposure framework and investigate the relationship between populist attitudes and the consumption of various types of online news. To test our theoretical assumptions, we link 150 million Web site visits by 7,729 Internet users in France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States to their responses in an online survey. This design allows us to measure media exposure more precisely than previous studies while linking these data to demographic attributes and political attitudes of participants. The results show that populist attitudes leave pronounced marks in people's news diets, but the evidence is heterogeneous and highly contingent on the supply side of a country's media system. Most importantly, citizens with populist attitudes visit less Web sites from the legacy press, while consuming more hyperpartisan news. Despite these tendencies, the Web tracking data show that populist citizens still primarily get their news from established sources. We discuss the implications of these results for the current state of public spheres in democracies.

AB  - Reduced counterarguing - the generation of questions and arguments in response to a message - has been proposed to be a mechanism of persuasion in a variety of contexts, yet many questions remain unanswered regarding the factors that influence this process. Building upon past theorizing in narrative persuasion, this present work investigates whether signaling of persuasive intent (signaling vs. no signaling) and the fictional presentation of texts (fact vs. fiction) decrease counterarguing and, in turn, increase persuasion. Using a 2 x 2 factorial design across four topics at three time points, hypotheses were tested with narratives regarding four controversial political issues, presented either with or without signaling of persuasive intent and in either a news or short fiction format. The online experiment demonstrated that the narratives impacted political attitudes, even when captured in a later follow-up session. However, neither persuasive signaling nor fictional presentation influenced counterarguing or the extent of attitude change, captured both immediately after narrative exposure and again in a follow-up survey two days later.

AB  - This study focuses on the effect of the sustainable marketing of three types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiatives sponsorship, cause-related marketing, and philanthropy on consumer evaluations with the moderating effect of psychological distance (social distance and spatial distance). Four hundred and eighty subjects participated in a 3x2x2 between-subjects factorial design experiment. The results of the analyses were significant and in the direction hypothesized. Philanthropy was found to have a stronger effect on consumer evaluations, followed by sponsorship and cause-related marketing. However, the relationship between CSR initiatives and consumer evaluations was significantly stronger when consumers perceived the focal brand with low social distance as well as the cause with low spatial distance. The findings thus provide support for the importance of psychological distance in moderating CSR initiatives. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.

AB  - This study analyzed the impact of the November 2015 Paris attacks on online hate. On the basis of social identity based theories of group relations, we hypothesized that exposure to online hate will increase in social climate of fear, uncertainty, and polarization. We expected that the increase of hate will be evident in the case of online hate associated to ethnicity or nationality, religion, political views, or terrorism, but not specifically other hate-associated categories. Societal level determinants of the temporal changes in online hate exposure have not been tested before. Our study utilized two cross-sectional, demographically balanced datasets to analyze the change in online hate exposure among Finnish young people aged 15 to 30. The first sample was collected in May-June 2013 and the second one in December 2015, only 1 month after the November 2015 Paris attacks. The results supported the hypotheses indicating that the quantity and quality of online hostilities are affected by the wider societal conditions. We suggest that more evidence of societal level determinants of online hostility is needed in order to understand online hate exposure rates at different times. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Today most of the organizations are increasing their digital affiliation for marketing purposes. This study intends to develop a conceptual structure between caused-related marketing and social media marketing. Three principle objective to conduct this research are: (i) to test whether a change of perception happens in a viral cause related marketing effort (ii) to test the viability of cause related content floating on various social media sites (aim to create awareness through social media); (iii) to analyze the role of users' age. A survey was conducted with 382 social media users and their responses were recorded after they viewed an online cause related content about education supported by a NGO (Non-Government Organization). The research outcome points out that psychological behaviour will enhance positive attitude towards: cause related content (HI) and. cause based user alliance association (H3). Additionally, psychological behaviour also enhances positive attitude towards brand associated with cause related campaigns (H2). The intention to share cause-related campaigns will increase when psychological behaviour exists for: the content (H4), the brand associated(H5) and user alliance association(H6).

T2  - ANALYSES OF SOCIAL ISSUES AND PUBLIC POLICY
LA  - English
AB  - South-North and North-North migration patterns have received significant interest in the literature, and recently, studies have begun to investigate South-South migration. However, as yet, very few studies have addressed North-South migration or investigated the psychological facilitators and barriers that drive this growing migration pattern. With a sample from a representative group of Hong Kong adults, we evaluated the role of positive attitude in shaping the intention to migrate from Hong Kong, a more-developed economy (a metropolitan area), to the Greater Bay Area (GBA) cities in Mainland China, considered a less-developed economy (with less metropolitan areas). We found positive attitude toward GBA cities in Mainland China promoted migration intention both directly and indirectly, as mediated by situational concerns and experience of visiting Mainland GBA cities. The impact of a positive attitude on a field visit was found to be weaker among wealthier adults relative to their economically disadvantaged counterparts. The effect of a field visit on migration intention was found to be stronger among wealthier adults relative to their economically disadvantaged counterparts. The findings suggest that an understanding of social psychology has implications for policy makers through highlighting the different approaches and entry points that could be adopted to encourage migration by people of varying economic status.

AB  - (1) Background: Increasing waves of immigration have not only changed the demographic features of European societies but have also had important implications for intergroup relationships. Based on the theoretical model of intergroup threat theory, this study examined whether and to what extent intergroup anxiety mediates the relationship between antecedents and attitudes toward asylum seekers. (2) Method: In a sample of 470 Italians (mean age 30.21), using a survey-based study, we assessed the antecedent of intergroup anxiety (national identification) and its consequences (classical and modern prejudice). (3) Results: The results supported most of the expected predictions. While intergroup anxiety was positively associated with prejudice toward asylum seekers, national identity was positively related to intergroup anxiety and prejudice. Moreover, the relationships between antecedents and consequences were mediated by intergroup anxiety. (4) Conclusion: This study has identified antecedents that can potentially increase or decrease intergroup anxiety and proposes certain strategies for improving social inclusion policies and relationships between asylum seekers and settled communities. The implications for future studies are discussed.

TI  - Nationwide survey on attitudes and perceived barriers toward provision of pharmaceutical care among final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the United Arab Emirates
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Pharmaceutical care (PC) practice is still limited in the United Arab Emirates. It is crucial to understand pharmacy students' attitudes and their perceived barriers towards PC provision, to evaluate the effectiveness of theoretical and practical curricula in creating positive attitudes toward PC. This study aims to assess attitudes of final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), and the barriers perceived by them to practice PC. A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted in February and March, 2020, involving colleges in UAE offering undergraduate pharmacy programs and having students in their final year. Participants filled a questionnaire covering attitudes' items, based on the Pharmaceutical Care Attitudes Survey (PCAS), and several perceived barriers. A stratified sample of 193 students participated from six universities, 85% were females, 92.2% and 64.8% completed or engaged in community and hospital pharmacy training respectively, at the time of the study. Attitudes' items receiving the highest agreement were PC will improve patient health (95.3%), all pharmacists should perform PC (93.3%) and PC would benefit pharmacists (92.7%). However, 44.6% agreed PC is not worth the additional workload. Females showed higher attitudes' total scores, median (IQR): 55 (51-58) and 52 (49-55.5) for females and males respectively, P = 0.032. Having incomplete courses was also associated with lower scores, median (IQR): 55 (51-58) and 52 (48.5-55.5) for "No" and "Yes" respectively, P = 0.048. Poor image of the pharmacist's role and lack of private counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the most perceived barriers, with around 78% agreement. In conclusion, final year undergraduate pharmacy students in the UAE have positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. The current curricula may be satisfactory in fostering positive attitudes among students. Poor image of the pharmacist's role and lack of counseling area or inappropriate pharmacy layout were the main barriers identified, among other barriers.

AB  - Influenza is associated with a substantial disease burden, and influenza vaccination is recommended to all healthcare workers. We aimed to assess healthcare workers' knowledge, attitudes, and practices about influenza and its vaccine in Chongqing, China. A cross-sectional study was conducted at selected hospitals from September to November 2019, in which healthcare workers filled in a self-administered questionnaire. Both sentinel (42.92%) and non-sentinel hospitals (57.08%) were included. The majority were nurses (52.48%) and physicians (32.37%). Half (50.42%) of the respondents had a good command of knowledge, and the proportion of healthcare workers having a positive attitude accounted for 62.68%. The primary information sources were colleagues (58.81%), followed by television, newspapers and media (30.18%). The number of healthcare workers reported having got vaccinated last year was only 237 (16.78%), and the main reason was protecting themselves from influenza (93.25%). While the most common reasons given for not getting vaccinated were having no time (65.70%), believing it is unnecessary to get vaccinated (29.62%), worrying about the quality of influenza vaccine (27.49%) or the adverse reactions (25.70%). Factors associated with self-reported high vaccination were sentinel hospital (aOR: 1.427; 95% CI: 1.057-1.925), high-risk department (aOR: 1.919; 95% CI: 1.423-2.589), positive attitude (aOR: 2.429; 95% CI: 1.697-3.477) and taking the initiative to learn influenza information (aOR: 3.000; 95% CI: 1.983-4.538). We concluded that healthcare workers in Chongqing had some misconceptions although many of them showed a positive attitude toward the influenza vaccine. Various strategies, including educational training and on-site vaccination, are necessary to improve the knowledge and overall vaccination coverage.

AB  - This study tested how source knowledge affects enjoyment of self-deprecating humor about a minority group. Participants made aware that the source of a message poking fun at people with disabilities was himself disabled had more positive evaluations of the cartoon and author than participants unaware of his disability. Participants initially given no source information judged the author more positively the second time when they were given follow-up source information. Finally, some effects were moderated by the disability status of the message receiver, such that having a disability or knowing someone who does predicted higher liking of the cartoons when the author is disabled but lower liking when he is not. The results suggest a role for self-deprecating humor in intergroup relations, and predict when such humor will be accepted by minority and non-minority group members.

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to test knowledge and attitudes of physical educators in Palestine toward epi-lepsy and students with epilepsy. The study also aimed to identify the variables that were associated with adequate knowledge and positive attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy. Methods: This study was done in a cross-sectional design among physical educators in Palestinian schools. The questionnaire tested knowledge and attitudes of physical educators using 18-item and 12-statement tests, respectively. Results: Complete questionnaires were returned by 226 physical educators (response rate = 75.3%). The median knowledge score of the physical educators on the 18-item knowledge test was 50% [33.0%, 61.0] and the median attitudes score of the physical educators on the 12-statemtns was 50.0% [42.0, 58.0]. Higher knowledge scores were associated with age, teaching experience, educational level, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Higher attitude scores were associated with gender, age, educational level, place of residence, type of school, having known/interacted with people with epilepsy, and receiving education about epilepsy. Conclusion: Knowledge gaps and negative attitudes toward epilepsy and students with epilepsy were identified among physical educators in Palestine. Appropriately designed interventions are still needed to improve knowledge and correct attitudes of physical educators about epilepsy and students with epilepsy. (c) 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Covid-19 has been causing severe loss to the human race. Considering the mode of spread and severity, it is essential to make it a habit to follow various safety precautions such as using sanitizers and masks and maintaining social distancing to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Individuals are widely educated about the safety measures against the disease through various modes such as announcements through online or physical awareness campaigns, advertisements in the media, and so on. The younger generations today spend considerably more time on mobile phones and games. However, there are very few applications or games aimed to help in practicing safety measures against a pandemic, which is much lesser in the case of Covid-19. Hence, we propose a 2D survival-based game, SurviveCovid-19, aimed to educate people about safety precautions to be taken for Covid-19 outside their homes by incorporating social distancing and usage of masks and sanitizers in the game. SurviveCovid-19 has been designed as an Android-based mobile game, along with a desktop (browser) version and has been evaluated through a remote quantitative user survey, with 30 volunteers using the questionnaire based on the MEEGA+ model. The survey results are promising, with all the survey questions having a mean value greater than 3.5. The game's quality factor was 69.3, indicating that the game could be classified as excellent quality, according to the MEEGA+ model.

AB  - Background and objectives
   Practice-based research (PBR) is of pivotal importance for hospital pharmacists which not only up-grades the profession but also improves the patient care. This study aimed to evaluate the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR among hospital pharmacists in Pakistan.
   Methods
   A descriptive, cross sectional study design was employed. Data were collected between 1st December, 2017 and 1st March, 2018 from 130 hospital pharmacists employed in 41 hospitals of Lahore, Pakistan. A survey instrument comprising of six sections was designed to determine the attitude, perception, willingness, motivation and barriers to PBR. Data were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 21.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). The normality of the data was determined through Shapiro-Wilks and Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests. Independent Samples Mann-Whitney U Test and Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test were carried out to test if there were differences among the characteristics of the hospital pharmacists. Logistic regression analysis was used to figure out the factors associated with attitude, perceptions, willingness and motivation towards PBR. A p-value <0.05 was used for statistical significance of differences.
   Results
   A total of 141 pharmacists were approached. Among them, 130 responded to the survey (response rate 92%). Out of a maximum score i.e., 5 (100%) the respondents obtained a median score of 4 (IQR = 0) for attitude, perception and motivation towards PBR; whereas, a median score of 4 (IQR = 1) was obtained for willingness thus demonstrating fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR. The most common barrier limiting the pharmacists' participation in PBR was lack of time (23.8%) followed by lack of incentives (16.2%) and lack of support (14.6%). Results of the logistic regression analysis revealed that hospital pharmacists practicing in the inpatient settings had 4.56 times more positive attitude towards PBR (OR = 4.56, 95% CI = 1.07 - 19.42, p-value = 0.040) as compared to those practicing in the outpatient settings. The male hospital pharmacists (OR = 8.86, 95% CI = 1.15-53.74, p-value = 0.017), those practicing in the outpatient (OR = 23.51, 95% CI = 2.04-271.53, p-value = 0.011) and inpatient settings had increased motivation towards PBR (OR = 12.24, 95% CI = 1.61-94.66, p-value = 0.016).
   Conclusion
   Despite the presence of several barriers, the respondents had fair positive attitude, good perceptions, increased motivation and willingness towards PBR which is a promising finding.

AB  - Physical Education (PE) in school aims to help pupils experience the joy of movement through various forms of physical activity and to acquire a positive attitude to physical activity and exercise. The teacher's task is to mediate the joy of movement and instil a positive attitude to exercise in the pupils. Drawing on the methodology of van Manen [(2002). Writing in the dark: Phenomenological studies in interpretic inquiry. London: The Althouse Press], this article takes a closer look at mediating the joy of movement and conveying attitudes through legitimate, expert and referent power [French, J. R. P., & Raven, B. (1959). The bases of social power. In D. Cartwright (Ed.), Studies in social power (pp. 150-167). Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan] as narrated by an experienced Norwegian PE teacher. The teacher's narrative is interpreted within a framework where these typologies of power refer to the teacher's formal position in PE classes and the teacher's athletic skills and teaching qualities. The teacher's narrative indicates that legitimate, expert and referent power influence pupils' views on PE, attitudes and effort in class. Referent power provides the potential to instil attitudes in the pupils, even to the point of getting them to enjoy taking exercise to the limit. It even embraces teachers' potential to influence pupils by displaying their own active lifestyle, which goes beyond teaching itself. However, some problematic and unresolved issues are pointed out within this approach. A didactic approach, where the teachers use their own lifestyle as a pedagogical tool, may prompt a negative rather than a positive reaction from pupils, because they may be (mis) construed as being too eager and physically active to the extreme. Referent power depends on establishing credibility with the pupils, and conveying attitudes through referent power implies a didactic instability. On the other hand, the approach may be a good strategy for achieving what teachers should be trying to achieve, which is to convey and instil the joy of movement and a positive attitude to physical exercise in the pupils.

AB  - This paper identifies and empirically analyses the relationship between various social media motivational factors influencing attitude of Indian consumers towards eco-friendly products and their willingness to pay a premium price for them. Data was collected from 536 respondents who not only uses various social media channels for purchases and gaining information but also prefers eco-friendly products across India. EFA and SEM techniques were used. The findings confer consumer's concern for the environment is being shaped by six main social media motivational factors namely word of mouth, interaction, entertainment, trendiness, dependency and trust. The concern of the consumers impacts their attitude and the positive attitude so formed has a significant and positive impact on willingness of consumers. This research takes a lead in analysing the construct willingness to pay a premium for green products because this has been comparably less explored in Indian context.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate undergraduate students' attitudes to using visual media tools in the chemistry laboratory. One hundred and fifteen undergraduates studying science education at Dokuz Eylul University, Turkey participated in the study. They video-recorded chemistry experiments with visual media tools and assessed them on a social website. A Likert scale consisting of 29 items was developed to obtain the students' views on using visual media tools in the chemistry laboratory. The scale has a four-factor structure. The Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficient was 0.95. In conclusion, this study found that using visual media tools in the general chemistry laboratory provides a positive contribution to students' behaviours and skills, improves students' learning attitudes to chemistry laboratory courses and increases their interest in visual media tools. The students also showed positive attitudes to the applicability of such tools.

AB  - Purpose The consumption of animal-based food products faces several sustainability challenges. To date, however, meat intake plays an important role in everyday food choices. With their ability to change the opinions of a critical mass, opinion leaders in food choices are assumed to play a predominant role in influencing future dietary styles. Thus, the objective of this study was to identify opinion leaders in food choices and their personal meat consumption behaviour as well as their attitude towards policy interventions aiming to meat reduction. Design/methodology/approach The sample consisted of 1,479 German participants aged between 15 and 29 years who were online surveyed in autumn 2020. A latent profile analysis (LPA) identified three distinct groups of opinion leader in the younger generation labelled "non-opinion leaders", "weak opinion leaders" and "opinion leaders". The identified profiles were used to understand opinion leaders and their food choices by using chi-square tests as well as univariate ANOVA with Tukey or Games-Howell post hoc tests. Findings Opinion leadership in food choices was associated with a higher interest in meat-reduced dietary styles and with more positive attitudes towards innovative food ideas. Moreover, opinion leaders were associated with politicised food decisions, indicating that their food choices align with their political and social interests. Originality/value The results contribute to a better understanding of the development of future dietary styles, provide evidence for a shift towards more sustainable dietary patterns in the near future and highlight that food decisions are no longer solely decisions on an individual basis but rather becoming of political relevance.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of study was to assess the relation between attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of nursing and paramedic students in a country in the north east of our country.
   Methodology: A descriptive, cross-sectional study was used. The study population consisted of 205 nursing and paramedic students in 2014-2015 academic year. The sample consisted of 160 students. Data were collected with the "Demographic Information Form", "The Attitudes Towards Domestic Violence Scale (ATDV)", and "The Gender Roles Attitudes Scale (GRA)". Data were analysed using descriptive statistics such as number, percentage, mean, standard deviation, median, 25th quarter and 75th quarter, Spearman's correlation analysis, and Mann Whitney U test.
   Results: The students had equalitarian gender roles and positive attitudes towards domestic violence. Spearman's correlation analysis indicated a positive moderate relation between the attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of the students (r=0.670, p<0.05). Female students had more egalitarian attitudes towards gender roles and more positive attitudes towards domestic violence than male students (p<0.05).
   Discussion: In conclusion, there is the relation between attitudes towards gender roles and domestic violence of nursing and paramedic students. In order that students can have positive attitudes towards domestic violence, inclusion of gender equality course in the curriculum has been recommended.

AB  - Communicators typically tune messages to their audience's attitude. Such audience tuning biases communicators' memory for the topic toward the audience's attitude to the extent that they create a shared reality with the audience. To investigate shared reality in intergroup communication, we first established that a reduced memory bias after tuning messages to an out-group (vs. in-group) audience is a subtle index of communicators' denial of shared reality to that out-group audience (Experiments 1a and 1b). We then examined whether the audience-tuning memory bias might emerge when the out-group audience's epistemic authority is enhanced, either by increasing epistemic expertise concerning the communication topic or by creating epistemic consensus among members of a multiperson out-group audience. In Experiment 2, when Germans communicated to a Turkish audience with an attitude about a Turkish (vs. German) target, the audience-tuning memory bias appeared. In Experiment 3, when the audience of German communicators consisted of 3 Turks who all held the same attitude toward the target, the memory bias again appeared. The association between message valence and memory valence was consistently higher when the audience's epistemic authority was high (vs. low). An integrative analysis across all studies also suggested that the memory bias increases with increasing strength of epistemic inputs (epistemic expertise, epistemic consensus, and audience-tuned message production). The findings suggest novel ways of overcoming intergroup biases in intergroup relations.

AB  - Aims Based on findings from population surveys, we provide an overview of the public's emotional reactions to people with mental illness. Methods A literature search for populations studies using measures of emotional response to people with mental illness was carried out. In addition, data on the public's emotional reactions, originating from representative surveys conducted in Germany in the years 1990, 1993 and 2001, were analysed. Results Positive emotional reactions to people with mental illness are most prevalent, followed by fear and anger. This pattern appears relatively stable across different cultures. In recent years, the emotional response of the public remained unchanged or even deteriorated. The public seems to react quite differently to people with different mental disorders. Emotional reactions have a substantial effect on the desire for social distance. The association between familiarity with mental disorder and the desire for social distance is to a considerable extent mediated through emotions. Conclusions The public's emotional reactions to people with mental disorder are relatively under-researched. More research may help better understand the complexities of the stigma surrounding mental illness. Interventions aimed at reducing the stigma of mental illness may benefit from paying more attention to emotions.

AB  - Background: To assess the attitude to and perception of transvaginal sonography (TVS) among Nigerian women of mixed educational status in order to ascertain factors that may prevent them from submitting to TVS when recommended.
   Methods: A Cross-sectional survey was adopted for the study. In all, one missionary, one government and eight private hospitals were enlisted. The instruments for data collection were visual analogue scale (VAS), to ascertain patients' pain/discomfort experience, and a researcher-developed semi-structured questionnaire. The level of pain/discomfort on the VAS was categorized into four on a scale of 100. The categories were: 0-5 (no pain), 6-40 (mild pain), 41-74 (moderate pain), and 75-100 (severe pain).
   Results: Majority (50.6%) of the respondents who attained secondary education had positive attitude to TVS. Also majority of the respondents (63.1%) preferred female sonographers. Majority of the respondents (54.1%) perceived TVS as not embarrassing, 78% did not consider it stressful, 96.9% reported that the sonographers were professional, 46.7% felt that a chaperon was needed, 98.4% reported there were enough privacy and 84. 7% reported they needed prior information. Most of the respondents (82%) were willing to consent to TVS in future, 90.5% reported no pain, 8.6% reported mild pain/discomfort and 0.9% reported moderate pain.
   Conclusions: Majority of our respondents had positive attitude to TVS and were willing to consent to TVS in future, hence it was acceptable to them. It was however observed that acceptability increased with increasing academic status.

AB  - Guided by the appraisal-tendency framework and construal level theory, this study investigates how emotional appeals (guilt vs. shame) and social distance frames (distant vs. proximal) influence college students' attitude toward bystander action campaign and intention to intervene in sexual violence situations. The findings indicated a two-way interaction effect between these two message factors on campaign attitude and behavior intention. Additionally, self-efficacy was found to be the mediator that underlying the proposed match-based effects. The findings provide theoretical implications into persuasive communication in the context of campus sexual violence bystander intervention and offer practical insights to advertisers and social/health marketers.

AB  - Wilderness medicine (WM) education has traditionally been conducted as in-person training. The current COVID-19 pandemic has forced medical schools to cancel clerkships and clinical electives and pivot to remote education. With online media modalities, it is possible to conduct a WM student elective remotely. The use of recorded audio lectures, instructional videos, choice-based simulations, and video conferencing allows students access to nearly all necessary content under the guidance of instructors. Although hands-on practicums are still essential to WM education, the process outlined here enables a temporary alternative during the time of necessary social distancing.

AB  - The success of health protection measures depends on public compliance. This paper aims to understand the influence of three different types of communication (i.e., news media, social media, and interpersonal communication) on people's engagement in health protective behavior during a public health crisis. Our C-ENT model of health protective behavior proposes that communication raises perceptions of efficacy, norms, and threat, which in turn influence health protective behavior (communication -> efficacy, norms, threat: C-ENT). We test the model for the case of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic, based on a representative online survey during the first week of the lockdown in Switzerland (N = 1005). The results support the C-ENT model and illustrate the important role of communication engagement during a public health crisis. News media use was associated with perceptions of behavior-related efficacy and norms and disease-related threat, and these perceptions were positively associated with compliance with social distancing. Social media use and interpersonal communication were related with perceived norms. Social media use was negatively and interpersonal communication positively associated with health behavior-supporting normative perceptions. Our findings suggest taking the distinct pattern among communication types (i.e., news media, social media, and interpersonal communication), perceptions, and behavior into account in order to understand existing dependencies and design respective communication strategies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to measure university student attitudes toward their LGBT peers across a range of demographic factors. We surveyed 416 undergraduates at a midsize Midwestern American public university to measure attitudes toward LGBT people. Results from a general Attitudes scale and two subscales, Morality and Friendship, were analyzed across gender, age, ethnicity, LGBT status, and years spent at the university. Results were also broken out into attitudes about LGB vs. transgender people, and attitudes about gay or bisexual men vs. lesbian or bisexual women. We found that female gender, LGBT identification, age, and number of years spent at the university were associated with more positive attitudes about LGBT people. We did not find any association between ethnicity and attitudes. We also found that attitudes toward gay or bisexual men were less positive than attitudes toward lesbian or bisexual women, and that attitudes toward transgender individuals were less positive than attitudes toward LGB people. These results suggest that anti-bias campus trainings may be most effective when tailored for males, younger students, and non-LGBT students. Trainings should also focus on transgender issues, as this is a population about which many students have negative attitudes.

AB  - Objectives: Investigate the knowledge and attitudes of family physicians towards coronavirus disease (COVID-19). Methods: Data were collected from family medicine residents at King Fahd Medical City in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, using an online questionnaire that assessed demographics, knowledge about COVID-19, and attitudes towards the disease. Data were analyzed using Stata software version 14. Results: A total of 179 participants (median age: 28 years) responded; 94 (52.5%) were female. Average knowledge score on a scale of 0-10 was 8.64 +/- 0.97. Knowledge scores were similar between males and females (mean deviation *MD+ = -0.14, p = 0.3). Fourth-year residents had higher knowledge scores compared to those in their first (MD = 1.2, p<.001), second (MD = 0.82, p = 0.001), or third (MD = 0.69, p = 0.02) years. Mean attitude score on a scale of 0-18 was 15.6 +/- 1.3. Females exhibited slightly higher positive attitude scores (MD = 0.44, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Residents demonstrated high knowledge and positive attitudes towards COVID-19. More experienced physicians exhibited higher knowledge scores; attitude scores were independent of experience.

AB  - A mathematical model of COVID-19 is presented where the decision to increase or decrease social distancing is modelled dynamically as a function of the measured active and total cases as well as the perceived cost of isolating. Along with the cost of isolation, we define an overburden healthcare cost and a total cost. We explore these costs by adjusting parameters that could change with policy decisions. We observe that two disease prevention practices, namely increasing isolation activity and increasing incentive to isolate do not always lead to optimal health outcomes. We demonstrate that this is due to the fatigue and cost of isolation. We further demonstrate that an increase in the number of lock-downs, each of shorter duration can lead to minimal costs. Our results are compared with case data in Ontario, Canada from March to August 2020 and details of expanding the results to other regions are presented.

AB  - There are complex relationships among individual, family, community, and social factors related to breastfeeding. Immigrant mothers, specifically, face several unique challenges to practicing breastfeeding while negotiating these factors within two cultural worlds. Grounded in the theory of planned behavior and the ecological perspective, our qualitative study findings unveil a part of the complex and dynamic process of breastfeeding decision-making among Korean immigrant mothers in the United States. To elicit mothers' underlying beliefs of attitude and intention toward breastfeeding as immigrants, we conducted in-person interviews with 13 pregnant and postpartum Korean immigrant mothers, ages ranging from 30 to 39. The findings revealed that Korean mothers held positive attitudes toward breastfeeding. However, translation of these positive attitudes toward breastfeeding into actual practice depended on the feasibility of actual breastfeeding by mothers. To overcome several barriers to breastfeeding, such as inadequate milk supply, health concerns, employment status, and the relationship with a firstborn child, many Korean mothers combined breastfeeding with formula feeding. The factors that shaped the development of beliefs and behavioral intentions toward breastfeeding among Korean immigrant mothers included the dynamic family interactions with their children, husbands, mothers, mothers-in-law, and sisters; support from friends and infant care experts; information available through various technology and media; and Korean-specific cultural traditions. Our findings suggest possible directions for future cross-cultural research on breastfeeding within diverse family contexts, and may inform the design of population specific intervention programs.

AB  - Previous findings demonstrate that believing in the value of diverse groups is related to positive attitudes toward immigrants. Based on these results, we hypothesized that pro-diversity beliefs are negatively related to discrimination of immigrants. In a representative multinational survey study (Study 1; N = 6,500), we demonstrate that diversity beliefs of nonimmigrant citizens from seven different European countries are negatively related to their discriminatory behavioral tendencies against immigrants. Moreover, it is revealed that this relationship is mediated by reduced realistic and symbolic threat. These findings are replicated in an experimental study (Study 2; N = 64), which confirms that diversity beliefs causally influence discriminatory behavioral tendencies. However, in the economic context of Study 2, the relationship is mediated by realistic but not by symbolic threat.

AB  - Shopping at low-cost supermarkets has been associated with higher obesity rates. This study examined whether attitudes toward healthy eating are independently associated with diet quality among shoppers at low-cost, medium-cost, and high-cost supermarkets. Data on socioeconomic status (SES), attitudes toward healthy eating, and supermarket choice were collected using a telephone survey of a representative sample of adult residents of King County, WA. Dietary intake data were based on a food frequency questionnaire. Thirteen supermarket chains were stratified into three categories: low, medium, and high cost, based on a market basket of 100 commonly eaten foods. Diet-quality measures were energy density, mean adequacy ratio, and total servings of fruits and vegetables. The analytical sample consisted of 963 adults. Multivariable regressions with robust standard error examined relations between diet quality, supermarket type, attitudes, and SES. Shopping at higher-cost supermarkets was associated with higher-quality diets. These associations persisted after adjusting for SES, but were eliminated after taking attitudinal measures into account. Supermarket shoppers with positive attitudes toward healthy eating had equally higher-quality diets, even if they shopped at low-, medium-, or high-cost supermarkets, independent of SES and other covariates. These findings imply that shopping at low-cost supermarkets does not prevent consumers from having high-quality diets, as long as they attach importance to good nutrition. Promoting nutrition-education strategies among supermarkets, particularly those catering to low-income groups, can help to improve diet quality.

AB  - Crises are inevitable for any company, and the fate of a company's image rests in how well they are responded to. Few studies have experimentally tested the impact that common types of company responses can have on consumers' perceptions when a negative complaint has been made online. This research sought to expand the strategies put forth for crisis management by image restoration theory (IRT) using best practice research within the context of social mediated crisis communication. An online experiment examined the effect of a company's response to an online complaint (i.e., professional apology, personal apology, deleting the comment, ignoring the comment, control group) on participants' perceptions of the company (i.e., perceptions of company caring, attitude). The potential for perceptions of company caring to mediate the relationship between these expanded strategies and IRT's ultimate aim of attitude change was also tested. An apology, whether professional or personal, improved participants' perceptions compared to deleting or ignoring the complaint. Caring significantly mediated the relationship between response strategy and participant attitude. Compared to a control group, which had no transgression, ignoring or deleting the complaint led to negative attitudes about the company, while responding to the complaint with a personal or professional apology led to positive attitudes about the company via perceptions of company caring. Results indicate that online complaints could also be seen as opportunities to improve a company's image, as attitudes toward the company were highest when a transgression occurred and was responded to positively, compared to not having the transgression take place at all (i.e., control condition). Potential extensions to current image repair strategies in the social media environment are discussed.

AB  - Is subjective ill-being, defined as the inverse of subjective well-being, related to Islamophobia in Germany? We conducted a study guided by two goals to answer this question. The first goal was to test the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is associated with Islamophobia. The second goal, contingent on the results of testing for the association between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia, was to test a set of variables presumed to moderate this relationship-positive and negative contact with Muslims, right-wing political views, political participation, the importance of political life, and cultural diversity orientation. Data from the GESIS Panel, a probability-based panel representative of the German-speaking population aged between 18 and 70 years permanently residing in Germany, were used to test the study hypotheses. The data provided support for the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is indeed associated with Islamophobia in Germany (r = .12, p < .01). The data provided support for only one of the moderator hypothesis, namely cultural diversity orientation. Specifically, the data showed that the relationship between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia is stronger for those who have low (rather than high) cultural diversity orientation.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to investigate how an athlete's participation in either an individual or team sport is related to their attitude toward sport psychology consulting and their willingness to consult a sport psychology practitioner.
   Method: The Sport Psychology Attitudes-Revised form (SPA-R) (Martin, et al., Sport Psychol 16:272-90, 2020) was completed by 120 athletes from individual and team sports. A 2 (Type of sport: individual and team) x 2 (Gender) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was conducted with attitudes towards sport psychology as dependent variables. To identify attitudes that accentuated the differences related to type of sport, follow-up univariate analyses were performed.
   Results: Results revealed that overall athletes involved in individual sports reported more positive attitudes towards sport psychology consulting than athletes involved in team sports. In particular, the athletes involved in individual sports were more likely to have greater confidence in sport psychology consulting. The findings also show that gender may mediate this association, indicated by a nearly significant two-way interaction effect for gender and type of sport (individual versus team) regarding confidence in sport psychology. The source of this marginal result was a larger effect of sport type for females than for males.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study imply that athletes involved in individual sports are more likely to have positive attitudes towards sport psychology compared to athletes competing in team-based sports, with females more likely to view sport psychology positively than compared to their male counterparts. The results may go some way to assist sport psychologists to understand and address athletes' concerns and to improve receptivity to sport psychology services.

AB  - Objective: This study assessed knowledge and attitudes of undergraduate nursing students toward epilepsy and patients with epilepsy (PWEs). Associations between different sociodemographic and academic variables and knowledge and attitude scores were also assessed.
   Methods: The present study was conducted in a cross-sectional observational design among Palestinian undergraduate nursing students using a prevalidated and reliable questionnaire of 38 items. After collecting sociodemographic and academic characteristics, students answered a knowledge test (16 items) and attitude test (13 items).
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 342 nursing students. The median knowledge score was 65.6 with an interquartile range (IQR) of 31.3, and the median attitude score was 81.5 with an IQR of 20.0. Multiple linear regression analyses showed that higher knowledge scores were predicted by being female in gender (p-value <0.05), had a course/studied about epilepsy (p-value <0.001), self-rated knowledge about epilepsy as high (pvalue <0.05), and ever witnessing a PWE experiencing seizures (p-value <0.001). Higher attitude scores were predicted by self-rated knowledge about epilepsy as high (p-value <0.001), had a course/studied about epilepsy (p-value <0.05), and ever witnessed a PWE experiencing seizures (p-value <0.05).
   Conclusion: Nursing students had moderate knowledge of epilepsy and had generally positive attitudes toward PWEs. Findings of this study highlighted knowledge gaps and areas for improvement. As knowledge scores were positively correlated with attitudes, probably, findings of this study might suggest that educational/training interventions can improve knowledge as well as positive attitudes of nursing students with regard to epilepsy and PWEs.

AB  - Background: A common reason for bystanders failure to perform CPR in real or hypothetical situations is their lack of confidence in themselves. CPR self-training, which uses learner-operated virtual media rather than a live instructor, has not been assessed for its ability to influence learners' attitudes toward performing CPR in a real emergency. The aim of this study was to compare attitude effects associated with traditional, live instruction versus self-training or no instruction.
   Method: Data from 1069 lay learners were collected. Learners were assigned randomly to a traditional instructor-led course, a video-based self-training course, or a no-training control group. All learners completed pre-training and post-training questionnaires that assessed competence, confidence, and willingness to perform CPR. Learners' objective performance of CPR was also assessed, post-training, via a recording manikin.
   Results: ANOVA revealed that, in all 3 groups, all 3 attitudes changed significantly from pre- to post-questionnaire; further, the amount of attitude change did not differ reliably among the 3 groups (P < .05). Of the objective measures, ventilation performance was the only one consistently and positively correlated with attitudes (P < .05). Despite focus group comments that suggested self-trained learners' concerns about the rudimentary nature of their training, these concerns did not manifest as a hindrance to positive attitude change.
   Conclusions: Live training does not pose any measurable advantage for developing learners' positive attitudes. The counterintuitive finding that controls experienced similar levels of attitude change suggests that mere exposure to CPR testing can have positive effects on attitudes.

AB  - Two experiments carried out in Spain and the Netherlands tested the joint effects of imagined contact and similarity with a narrative protagonist on attitudes and behavioral intentions related to stigmatized immigrants. We advance a concept of optimal reception condition: imagining a positive interaction with an immigrant before reading a testimonial of an immigrant who is similar to the native audience. The optimal reception condition induced greater identification and transportation than the reference condition, leading to more positive attitudes and a higher intention of intergroup contact. The findings are discussed in the context of research on narrative persuasion and prejudice reduction.

AB  - This study develops the concept of brand interactivity based on the characteristics and definitions of interactivity and applies it to advergames. Brand interactivity is significant in advertising research and practice because this concept extends the perspective of interactivity from media to brands. The results of an experiment indicate that consumers have more positive attitudes toward a brand and stronger purchase intentions when playing advergames with brand interactivity rather than without brand interactivity. As this study shows, the role of brand interactivity in advergames provides insights for advertising scholars and practitioners seeking ways to improve consumers' experience with brands through interactive media.

AB  - Background: Health behavior is influenced by culture and social context. However, there are limited data evaluating the scope of these influences on COVID-19 response.
   Objective: This study aimed to compare handwashing and social distancing practices in different countries and evaluate practice predictors using the health belief model (HBM).
   Methods: From April 11 to May 1, 2020, we conducted an online, cross-sectional survey disseminated internationally via social media. Participants were adults aged 18 years or older from four different countries: the United States, Mexico, Hong Kong (China), and Taiwan. Primary outcomes were self-reported handwashing and social distancing practices during COVID-19. Predictors included constructs of the HBM: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues to action. Associations of these constructs with behavioral outcomes were assessed by multivariable logistic regression.
   Results: We analyzed a total of 71,851 participants, with 3070 from the United States, 3946 from Mexico, 1201 from Hong Kong (China), and 63,634 from Taiwan. Of these countries, respondents from the United States adhered to the most social distancing practices (chi(2)(3)=2169.7, P<.001), while respondents from Taiwan performed the most handwashing (chi(2)(3)=309.8, P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analyses indicated that self-efficacy was a positive predictor for handwashing (odds ratio [OR](United States) 1.58, 95% CI 1.21-2.07; ORMexico 1.5, 95% CI 1.21-1.96; ORHong Kong 2.48, 95% CI 1.80-3.44; ORTaiwan 2.30, 95% CI 2.21-2.39) and social distancing practices (ORUnited States 1.77, 95% CI 1.24-2.49; ORMexico 1.77, 95% CI 1.40-2.25; ORHong Kong 3.25, 95% CI 2.32-4.62; ORTaiwan 2.58, 95% CI 2.47-2.68) in all countries. Handwashing was positively associated with perceived susceptibility in Mexico, Hong Kong, and Taiwan, while social distancing was positively associated with perceived severity in the United States, Mexico, and Taiwan.
   Conclusions: Social media recruitment strategies can be used to reach a large audience during a pandemic. Self-efficacy was the strongest predictor for handwashing and social distancing. Policies that address relevant health beliefs can facilitate adoption of necessary actions for preventing COVID-19. Our findings may be explained by the timing of government policies, the number of cases reported in each country, individual beliefs, and cultural context.

AB  - Simulation-based training has seen an increased use of extended reality, that is, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR) and mixed reality (MR) displays. The health professions have been using VR for simulation-based training more extensively than others. This method can offer the possibility of immediate feedback, which promotes more accurate training to self-correct mistakes in environments that are otherwise risky or provide unsafe conditions. The nuclear industry has attempted to seize the same digital and educational transformation to train their personnel to handle dangerous scenarios. We ran a pilot study with the aim of evaluating the VR training scenario developed for the specific target group and the acceptance of the VR technology itself for this kind of training. We used the Kirkpatrick framework to evaluate the training and the VR-HAM acceptance model to evaluate the acceptance of VR. A VR scenario was developed to test specific technical skills of nuclear power plant personnel. The 13 participants showed results within the basic level of the Kirkpatrick framework and held both positive reactions and concerns, that is, they enjoyed the training with VR and expressed concerns regarding the stability of the VR technology. The participants also showed positive attitudes towards the perceived ease of use and usefulness of the VR-HAM and its various constructs. Even though the COVID-19 pandemic limited our testing, we could show valuable data and positive attitudes and perceived ease by the participants. Simulation-based VR training could be an important complement to traditional training methods, especially where safety is a priority, but we still need to provide solid evidence.

AB  - This paper argues that the enjoyment of interactive media, especially interactive narratives, can be explained via perceptions of control. Specifically, control over a character's choices, lead to higher perceptions of control which increased user enjoyment. Three different experiments using varying narratives, grammatical perspectives and story outcomes support these arguments consistently. This series of studies demonstrates that perceptions of control over media characters facilitate positive attitudes toward media content, corroborating and expanding upon earlier entertainment research. This research demonstrates a low-tech application of content-based user control in new media environments. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fake news has recently garnered increased attention across the world. Digital collaboration technologies now enable individuals to share information at unprecedented rates to advance their own ideologies. Much of this sharing occurs via social networking sites (SNSs), whose members may choose to share information without consideration for its authenticity. This research advances our understanding of information verification behaviors among SNS users in the context of fake news. Grounded in literature on the epistemology of testimony and theoretical perspectives on trust, we develop a news verification behavior research model and test six hypotheses with a survey of active SNS users. The empirical results confirm the significance of all proposed hypotheses. Perceptions of news sharers' network (perceived cognitive homogeneity, social tie variety, and trust), perceptions of news authors (fake news awareness and perceived media credibility), and innate intentions to share all influence information verification behaviors among SNS members. Theoretical implications, as well as implications for SNS users and designers, are presented in the light of these findings.

AB  - Purpose: Using the theory of reasoned action (TRA), this research examined predictors of sexual intercourse among first-and second-year college women. Methods: Participants completed a confidential self-administered questionnaire on their attitude, subjective norm, and intention regarding sexual intercourse and their behavioral beliefs about the consequences of abstinence and sexual intercourse. Results: At baseline, 58 (34%) of the 172 participants (mean age = 18.2; SD = 0.56) reported ever having sexual intercourse, and 41 (24%) reported having sexual intercourse within the last three months. Proportional-odds analysis on baseline data revealed that attitude and subjective norm were associated with a greater intention to have intercourse, as was relationship status (i.e. being in a relationship), a variable external to the TRA. Three-month follow-up questionnaires were completed by 165 (96%) of the participants. Logistic regression indicated that baseline intention and relationship status predicted self-reported sexual intercourse three months later. Examination of the relation of behavioral beliefs to attitude revealed that beliefs about the positive consequences of abstinence were associated with a negative attitude toward intercourse, whereas beliefs about the negative consequences of intercourse were unrelated to attitude toward intercourse. Being in a relationship and alcohol use were also related to positive attitude toward intercourse. Conclusions: These results suggest that, for college women, the TRA is a useful model of sexual behavior and that abstinence interventions may be a viable risk-reduction approach if the abstinence message is framed to emphasize the positive consequences of abstinence rather than the negative consequences of sexual intercourse.

AB  - Background and aims: Excessive use of social networking sites (SNS) has recently been conceptualized as a behavioral addiction (i.e., "disordered SNS use") using key criteria for the diagnosis of substance dependence and shown to be associated with a variety of impairments in psychosocial functioning, including an increased risk of problem drinking. This study sought to characterize associations between "disordered SNS use" and attitudes towards alcohol, drinking motives, and adverse consequences resulting from alcohol use in young adults. Methods: Undergraduate students (n = 537, 64.0% female, mean age = 19.63 years, SD = 4.24) reported on their use of SNSs and completed the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, Temptation and Restraint Inventory, Approach and Avoidance of Alcohol and Drinking Motives Questionnaires, and Drinker Inventory of Consequences. Results: Respondents meeting previously established criteria for "disordered SNS use" were significantly more likely to use alcohol to cope with negative affect and to conform to perceived social norms, reported significantly more conflicting (i.e., simultaneous positive and negative) attitudes towards alcohol, and had experienced significantly more, and more frequent adverse consequences from drinking in their inter-and intrapersonal, physical, and social functioning, compared to individuals without problems related to SNS use. Discussion and conclusions: Findings add to an emerging body of literature suggesting a link between excess or maladaptive SNS use and problems related to alcohol in young adults and point to emotion dysregulation and coping motives as potential shared risk factors for substance and behavioral addictions in this demographic.

AB  - Objectives: A three-member central Rapid Response Team (RRT) was deputed to Union Territory of Ladakh on 26th March 2020, to assess the situation and support the preparedness measures including implementation of cluster containment plan and social distancing measures for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Methods: Central RRT addressed the panchayat sarpanch and religious leaders, sensitized doctors and paramedical staff on COVID-19 situation; conducted situational analysis, review of records and logistics, key informant interviews of senior administrative and healthcare officials, focus group discussions with local community people and field visits to various hospitals, isolation centers, quarantine facilities, and containment zones. Results: A total of 14 COVID-19 cases with no deaths were reported and nine patients had recovered till 4 April 2020. The median (range) age of positive cases was found to be 32.5 (6 months-76 years) years and overall attack rate was 1.65 per 1000 population. Ladakh Government declared Chuchot Gongma, Yokma and Sankoo as the containment zones and deputed surveillance teams. A total of 2397 persons were quarantined and 496 samples were tested from Ladakh. COVID-19 sample testing, Srinagar-Leh highway opening and Iran pilgrimage returnees were the major challenges identified. Conclusions: The Ladakh government must continue the robust surveillance system and stringent strategies in key areas for management of COVID-19 namely - aggressive screening and testing, isolation, quarantine, hand hygiene, respiratory etiquettes and social distancing.

AB  - During outbreaks of infectious diseases with high morbidity and mortality, individuals closely follow media reports of the outbreak. Many will attempt to minimize contacts with other individuals in order to protect themselves from infection and possibly death. This process is called social distancing. Social distancing strategies include restricting socializing and travel, and using barrier protections. We use modeling to show that for short-term outbreaks, social distancing can have a large influence on reducing outbreak morbidity and mortality. In particular, public health agencies working together with the media can significantly reduce the severity of an outbreak by providing timely accounts of new infections and deaths. Our models show that the most effective strategy to reduce infections is to provide this information as early as possible, though providing it well into the course of the outbreak can still have a significant effect. However, our models for long-term outbreaks indicate that reporting historic infection data can result in more infections than with no reporting at all. We examine three types of media influence and we illustrate the media influence with a simulated outbreak of a generic emerging infectious disease in a small city. Social distancing can never be complete; however, for a spectrum of outbreaks, we show that leaving isolation ( stopping applying social distancing measures) for up to 4 hours each day has modest effect on the overall morbidity and mortality.

AB  - Social networks have become one of the major and important parts of daily life. Besides sharing ones views the social networking sites can also be very efficiently used to judge the behavior and attitude of individuals towards the posts. Analysis of the mood of public on a particular social issue can be judged by several methods. Analysis of the society mood towards any particular news in form of tweets is investigated in this paper. The key objective behind this research is to increase the accuracy and effectiveness of the classification by the process of Natural Language Processing (NLP) Techniques while focusing on semantics and World Sense Disambiguation. The process of classification includes the combination of the effect of various independent classifiers on one particular classification problem. The data that is available in the form of tweets on twitter can easily frame the insight of the public attitude towards the particular tweet. The proposed work implements a hybrid method that includes Hybrid K, clustering and boosting. A comparison of this scheme versus a K-means/SVM approach is provided. Results are shown and discussed.

AB  - Although civic engagement and human rights are critical values in social work education, few empirical studies have explored the association between civic engagement and human rights exposure and attitudes. This study aims to examine the relationship between the exposure to human rights information, human rights attitudes, normative beliefs, and civic engagement behaviors among university students. A total of 214 students at a public university in the Midwest of the United States responded to the study survey. Findings indicate that students with more exposure to human rights issues showed more civic engagement. This relationship between human rights exposure and civic engagement was mediated by students' attitudes toward human rights, but not moderated by normative beliefs. In addition, students majoring in social work revealed higher civic engagement and more positive attitudes toward human rights issues than those in other disciplines.

AB  - Minimal studies have investigated individuals' evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation simultaneously, with most research focusing on one or the other. In a sample of 246 heterosexual undergraduates, the present study found that evaluations of antigay hate crimes and hate crime legislation were unrelated. Higher social dominance orientation (SDO) and crime control orientation scores were associated with more positive evaluations of antigay hate crimes. Positive evaluations of hate crime legislation were associated with more positive attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. We also found that the relationship between SDO and evaluations were mediated by crime control beliefs (for hate crimes evaluations) and antigay attitudes (for hate crime legislation evaluations). The present findings have possible implications for the manner in which organizations advocate for the extension of hate crime legislation to include sexual orientation.

Thus, to communicate internationally, cultivating a maximized listening proficiency for and positive attitudes toward global Englishes speakers with diverse accents is ever more important. However, with their preference for American English and its popular culture, it is uncertain whether Swedish youth learners are developing these key linguistic qualities to be prepared for the globalized use of English. To address this, we randomly assigned 160 upper secondary students (mean age = 17.25) into six groups, where each group listened to one of six English speakers. The six speakers first languages were Mandarin, Russian/Ukrainian, Tamil, Lusoga/Luganda, American English, and British English. Through comparing the six student groups, we examined their listener intelligibility (actual understanding), listener comprehensibility (feeling of ease or difficulty), accentedness perception (perceiving an accent as native or foreign), and accentedness acceptance (showing a positive or negative attitude toward an accent) of diverse English accents. The results showed that the intelligibility scores and perception/attitude ratings of participants favored the two speakers with privileged accents-the American and British speakers. However, across all six groups, no correlation was detected between their actual understanding of the speakers and their perception/attitude ratings, which often had a strong correlation with their feelings of ease/difficulty regarding the speakers accents. Taken together, our results suggest that the current English education needs innovation to be more aligned with the national syllabus that promotes a global perspective. That is, students need to be guided to improve their actual understanding and sense of familiarity with Global English speakers besides the native accents that they prefer. Moreover, innovative pedagogical work should be undertaken to change Swedish youths' perceptions and attitudes and prepare them to become open-minded toward diverse English speakers.

AB  - Past research has supported the hypothesis that the relationship between harsh childhood punishment and adult political attitudes is due to the displacement of negative emotions that arise onto punitive public policies, e.g., support for the death penalty (Milburn, Conrad, Sala, & Carberry, 1995). Cognitions associated with childhood punishment may also impact adult political attitudes, yet their effects have not yet been examined, despite research that shows that punitive childhood experiences increase the tendency to attribute hostility to others. Thus, we investigated whether the tendency to make hostile attributions about others' behavior influences a person's authoritarianism, controlling for their parents' political orientation. Respondents completed an online survey concerning their childhood punishment experiences, their parents' political orientation, their trait anger, their level of hostile attribution bias (HAB), and their authoritarianism. Multiple regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) found that higher childhood punishment has a significant direct effect on higher levels of authoritarianism, even after controlling for parents' political orientation, and that trait anger and HAB appear to mediate the effects of childhood punishment experiences on authoritarianism,. These results support the process of affect displacement as an important influence on adult punitiveness and political orientation.

AB  - This article examines how Palestinians' intergroup contact experiences relate to their attitudes towards interactions with Israelis (i.e., normalization). We draw on four recent advances in intergroup contact literature. First, recent research indicates that positive contact can impede disadvantaged groups' motivation to challenge inequalities. Second, increased endorsement of normalization mediates this sedative effect of positive contact on motivation to resist in the West Bank. Third, negative contact has been related to increased motivation for social change. Fourth, institutions and societal norms shape the meaning of intergroup contact and its effect on intergroup relations. We hypothesize that negative experiences at checkpoints can act as reminders of institutionalized inequalities and thus attenuate sedative effects. Furthermore, we explore the contextual boundary conditions of such reminder effects. Analyses of cross-sectional survey conducted among a representative sample (N = 1,000) in the West Bank including Jerusalem showed that (1) positive intergroup contact related to normalization endorsement (sedative effect), (2) negative intergroup contact related to decreased normalization endorsement (mobilizing effect), and (3) negative contact experiences (at checkpoints) canceled out the effect of positive contact (reminder effect), but only in Jerusalem. Results suggest that the impacts of intergroup contact need to be interpreted in light of institutionalized forms of group inequality and segregation.

AB  - Securing long-lasting positive intergroup relations is of high priority in the multi-cultural European Union. Developing and promoting integration within the school context is a matter of interest to both researchers and practitioners. This study investigated the effects of a mastery-oriented motivational climate intervention using the TARGET framework on students' psychological integration (identification with, and inclusion in physical education [PE] class), in culturally diverse school classes. The intervention was conducted using a quasi-experimental design in 7th to 9th graders over 18 weeks. Two school classes were assigned to an intervention group (n =38) and three school classes received regular PE instruction. The intervention group was compared with a control group (n = 56). Results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on students' feelings of inclusion in PE class in the intervention condition compared to the control condition. Mediation analysis revealed that this effect operated through decreased performance climate perceptions. Our findings suggest that such an intervention using the TARGET framework may affect students' feelings of inclusion within the PE class through differences in performance climate perceptions. Findings highlight the importance of perceived motivational climate in PE for students' psychological integration in culturally diverse PE settings and suggest the effectiveness of a motivational climate intervention.

AB  - Inaccurate perceptions about body image can be identified not only among physically inactive people, but also among those doing sports on a regular basis. Corporate marketing communication further increases these uncertainties and doubts, thus the former readily become actual consumers of dietary supplements. The results of our primary research (n=737) describe the sports-related activities, attitudes, and segmentation of those regularly engaged in sports, including details about the dietary supplements market. Our results indicate that the group of people engaged in sports on a regular basis is far from homogeneous. As many as 56.4% of them generally have a positive attitude towards dietary supplements, and constitute the potential consumers of this product range. Opinion leaders (coaches), reference groups, and word-of-mouth advertising (fellow sportspeople) were found to play the key role in the choice of dietary supplements.

AB  - While there is a proliferation of research on emotion detection, little research has focused on emotion induction in HCI literature. We propose an emotion-induction model that points out the two fundamental design goals (i.e., sensemaking vs. exploration) as antecedents of the four different types of emotions, which, in turn, introspectively reinforce cognitive outcomes (i.e., attitude; behavioral intention). Design elements that facilitate the sensemaking goal (i.e., coherence; legibility) induce emotions along a low-arousal-positive (LAN) to a high arousal-negative (HAN) continuum (e.g., "quiescence" to "agitation"). By contrast, the design elements that facilitate exploration goal (i.e., mystery; complexity) induce emotions along a high-arousal-positive (HAP) to a low arousal-negative (LAN) continuum (e.g., "cheerfulness" to "dejection"). Among them, only the two types of emotions (i.e., HAP; HAN) have a significant mediation effect of reinforcing attitude. The HAP emotions (e.g., cheerfulness) signal a success in exploration efforts. The HAN emotions (e.g., agitation) signal a failure in sensemaking efforts. Thus, the design elements for sensemaking goals are responsible for the emotions that enhance positive (but not negative) attitude, while the design features for exploration are responsible for the emotions that enhance negative (but not positive) attitude. Incidentally, our data reveals that people place more weight on emotional signals that are consistent with their concurrent motivational concern than those inconsistent with it.

AB  - Background: This study examined the effects of alcohol portrayals on transportation and attitude toward a movie. In addition, we examined whether positive and negative movie alcohol portrayals affect transportation into and attitude toward the movie.
   Methods: A within-subject design was used in which participants were exposed to 8 different movie clips containing alcohol (positive or negative context) or no alcohol portrayals in a controlled laboratory setting. A total of 159 college students (84 males and 75 females) ages 18 to 30 participated in the experiment. Transportation and attitude toward the movie were measured after each movie clip.
   Results: Participants were more transported into and had a more positive attitude toward movie clips with alcohol portrayals compared to the same movie clips with no alcohol portrayal. In addition, participants were more transported into movie clips with negative alcohol (NA) portrayals compared to clips with positive alcohol (PA) portrayals. For attitude toward the movie, opposite results were found. Participants had a more positive attitudes toward clips with PA portrayals compared to clips with NA portrayals.
   Conclusions: The way alcohol is portrayed in movies may contribute to how people evaluate and get transported in movies.

AB  - Research on the contact hypothesis has highlighted the role of contact in improving intergroup relations. Most of this research has addressed the problem of transforming the prejudices of historically advantaged communities, thereby eroding wider patterns of discrimination and inequality. In the present research, drawing on evidence from a cross-sectional survey conducted in New Delhi, we explored an alternative process through which contact may promote social change, namely by fostering political solidarity and empowerment amongst the disadvantaged. The results indicated that Muslim students' experiences of contact with other disadvantaged communities were associated with their willingness to participate in joint collective action to reduce shared inequalities. This relationship was mediated by perceptions of collective efficacy and shared historical grievances and moderated by positive experiences of contact with the Hindu majority. Implications for recent debates about the relationship between contact and social change are discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations.

AB  - Purpose: Combinations of risk behaviors are common in popular media, which make it difficult to understand how exposure to risk content affects adolescent risk behaviors. The purpose of this study was to determine whether media effects associated with exposure to multiple risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) in television content have specific or more general effects on attitudes and norms associated with performing these behaviors.
   Methods: Adolescents aged 14-17 years from an opt-in Qualtrics panel (n = 338) were randomized into one of four conditions, which varied the presence of risk behaviors (i.e., combined alcohol and sex, sex only, alcohol only, and no risk) that were featured in a brief video clip from a popular television show. We tested the content effects on behavioral attitudes and norms for performing each of the behaviors.
   Results: Analysis of variance analyses showed that exposure to combined alcohol and sex resulted in more positive attitudes toward engaging in combining alcohol and sex, drinking, and smoking. Exposure to the sex only, alcohol only, and no risk videos did not influence any attitudes or norms.
   Conclusions: A brief exposure to combined risk behaviors in media may increase positive attitudes related to the combination behavior (alcohol and sex), a component behavior (alcohol), and also more general risk-taking behaviors (smoking).

AB  - Reduced consumption of meat, particularly red meat, is associated with numerous health benefits. While past research has examined demographic and cognitive correlates of meat-related diet identity and meat consumption behaviour, the predictive influence of personal values on meat-consumption attitudes and behaviour, as well as gender differences therein, has not been explicitly examined, nor has past research focusing on 'meat' generally addressed 'white meat' and 'fish/seafood' as distinct categories of interest. Two hundred and two Australians (59.9% female, 39.1% male, 1% unknown), aged 18 to 91 years (M=31.42, SD =16.18), completed an online questionnaire including the Schwartz Values Survey, and measures of diet identity, attitude towards reduced consumption of each of red meat, white meat, and fish/seafood, as well as self-reported estimates of frequency of consumption of each meat type. Results showed that higher valuing of Universalism predicted more positive attitudes towards reducing, and less frequent consumption of, each of red meat, white meat, and fish/seafood, while higher Power predicted less positive attitudes towards reducing, and more frequent consumption of, these meats. Higher Security predicted less positive attitudes towards reducing, and more frequent consumption, of white meat and fish/seafood, while Conformity produced this latter effect for fish/seafood only. Despite men valuing Power more highly than women, women valuing Universalism more highly than men, and men eating red meat more frequently than women, gender was not a significant moderator of the value attitude behaviour mediations described, suggesting that gender's effects on meat consumption may not be robust once entered into a multivariate model of MRD attitudes and behaviour. Results support past findings associating Universalism, Power, and Security values with meat-eating preferences, and extend these findings by articulating how these values relate specifically to different types of meat.

AB  - Despite the importance of cultural difference perceptions in intergroup relations, prior work has paid insufficient attention to the intersection between intergroup contact, perceived cultural distance, and policy support. Using cross-sectional data from a community sample of 210 Turkish citizens, this study examined whether perceived cultural distance would mediate the link between intergroup contact and support for Syrian refugee rights. The results showed that perceived cultural distance mediated the relationship between contact quality, but not contact quantity, and support for refugee rights. This mediated relationship was further moderated by political orientation, such that perceived cultural distance mediated the role of contact quality in support for refugee rights only among participants with a leftist (vs. rightist) orientation. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings were discussed, along with a reflection on future research directions.

AB  - Although Moral Foundations Theory claims that the foundations of morality are universal, there are still few studies addressing it through non-English measures. In the current research, 540 persons filled out a Swedish translation of the Moral Foundations Questionnaire, and 332 of them filled out political attitude measures. Confirmatory factor analyses suggested that the fit of the five-factor model was better than alternative models but not optimal, replicating previous findings. Concerns with fairness and prevention of harm predicted political identity leftward, mediated mainly by preference for equality, and concerns with loyalty, authority, and sanctity predicted political identity rightward, mediated mainly by resistance to change and system justification, as hypothesized. Fairness and authority concerns were the best predictors of political ideology. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Mediated intergroup contact and extended contact hypothesis research shows that observing a positive intergroup interaction can result in improved attitudes toward the outgroup. This experiment tested the common ingroup identity model and how the creation of a superordinate identity among characters in a television narrative influences viewers' willingness to interact with outgroup members and attitudes toward the outgroup. Results reveal that self-efficacy, anxiety, and inclusion of the outgroup in the self mediated the relationship between exposure to narratives featuring intergroup interdependence and both positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. That is, participants who watched a narrative featuring high levels of intergroup teamwork reported increased feelings of self-efficacy when considering future outgroup interactions, which was associated with lower levels of outgroup anxiety. Lower levels of anxiety were then associated with increased inclusion of the outgroup in the self, which was ultimately associated with more positive attitudes toward and greater willingness to interact with the outgroup. These results suggest that, even when comparing the effects of two narratives that portray an identical, positive outcome, positive effects on attitudes toward and willingness to interact with outgroup members are stronger when ingroup and outgroup members display interdependence. This research represents a step toward understanding the ways that the common ingroup identity model might help explain the extended contact hypothesis and the mechanisms by which narratives can affect attitudes toward and willingness to interact with outgroup members.

AB  - Psychological intimate partner violence (IPV) is the most prevalent form of IPV and is often thought to precede physical IPV. However, psychological IPV often occurs independently of other forms of IPV, and it can often emerge during routine relationship interactions. Using data from imprisoned male offenders we investigate the effect of hostile and benevolent sexist attitudes on psychological IPV and the hypothesized mediating role of positive attitudes toward IPV and this effect when accounting for broader risk factors at the levels of community (social disorder), family-of-origin (conflictive climate in family of origin), and personality (antisocial personality traits) variables. The sample involved 196 male inmates of the Penitentiary Center of Villabona (Asturias, Spain). Structural equation models result showed significant total, direct and indirect effect of hostile sexism on psychological IPV, but not of benevolent sexism. When individual, family-of-origin, and community variables were considered, however, hostile sexism showed only an indirect effect on psychological IPV via positive attitudes toward abuse. These results are discussed in light of the debate of the role of sexist attitudes in the psychological IPV explanation when broader models are considered.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Primary malignant melanoma of the esophagus accounts for 0.1%-0.2% of all esophageal malignancies, including melanotic and amelanotic melanomas. Primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus is extremely rare, and only about 20 cases have been published in the literature to date. Most primary malignant melanomas of the esophagus are diagnosed following development of metastatic lesions and thus have a very poor prognosis. The median survival duration of patients with metastatic melanoma has been reported to be 6.2 mo.
   CASE SUMMARY
   A 49-year-old woman was referred to our hospital with a diagnosis of esophageal cancer. Endoscopy, biopsy, imaging evaluation, and physical examination at our hospital indicated a diagnosis of advanced primary amelanotic malignant melanoma of the esophagus. Immunohistochemical staining confirmed melanoma. Nuclear medicine examination revealed a left iliac bone metastatic lesion. After discharge, the patient self-administered apatinib for 3 mo, followed by oral treatment with Chinese medicines (also self-administered) for 2 mo. No treatments had been taken since then. The patient has survived with no growth out to the most recent follow-up (24 mo post diagnosis), and she always presented with a positive attitude about her condition during this period.
   CONCLUSION
   Survival following metastatic melanoma might be related to the pharmaceutical and Chinese medicine treatment and the patient's positive attitude.

AB  - In the United States, intention to get the COVID-19 vaccine varied across age and racial/ethnic groups, but attitudes toward getting vaccinated were an important predictor across all adults
   Background COVID-19 vaccine uptake is an urgent public health priority. Purpose To identify psychosocial determinants (attitudes, normative pressure, and perceived behavioral control) of COVID-19 vaccination intentions for U.S. White, Black, and Hispanic adults, and how COVID-19 misperceptions, beliefs about the value of science, and perceived media bias relate to these determinants. Methods Longitudinal online survey using two national samples (18-49 years old/50 years and older), each stratified by racial/ethnic group (n = 3,190). Data were collected in October/November 2020 and were weighted by race group to be representative. Results Path analyses showed that more positive attitudes about getting vaccinated predict intention across age and racial/ethnic groups, but normative pressure is relevant among older adults only. Belief in the value of science was positively associated with most determinants across all groups, however the association of COVID-19 misperceptions and perceived media bias with the determinants varied by age group. Conclusions Messages that emphasize attitudes toward vaccination can be targeted to all age and racial/ethnic groups, and positive attitudes are universally related to a belief in the value of science. The varying role of normative pressure poses messages design challenges to increase vaccination acceptance.

AB  - The World Health Organization declared waterpipe smoking as a growing public health concern. Our study aimed to assess waterpipe smoking knowledge and attitude among current waterpipe smokers in comparison with nonsmokers and to evaluate its association with current and cumulative waterpipe smoking. A cross-sectional study was carried between May and December 2018 using a multistage cluster sample across Lebanon. Nonsmokers or exclusive current waterpipe smokers were eligible to participate. A total of 4046 adult individuals participated in the study, 38.3% (n = 1550) being current waterpipe smokers. Current waterpipe smoking was positively associated with female gender [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.79, 95%CI 1.40-2.28] and having a mother who is a regular smoker (aOR 1.47, 95%CI 1.15-1.88) while it was negatively associated with better knowledge about waterpipe smoking harm (aOR 0.95, 95%CI 0.93-0.97) and positive attitude toward waterpipe smoking ban (aOR 0.98, 95%CI 0.96-0.99). Cumulative waterpipe smoking was negatively associated with female gender (beta = - 0.012), higher education level (beta = - 0.28), and positive attitude toward WPS ban (beta = - 0.06). Waterpipe smoking is largely present among the Lebanese population, with waterpipe smokers showing lower knowledge about harm and more intolerant attitude about banning. Health awareness supported by media campaigns and governmental initiatives should be conducted to educate people and change their perceptions regarding waterpipe smoking.

AB  - Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is defined as safe and effective for the general public to use, without seeking therapy from a health professional. As primary social media and internet users, university and college students are more likely to be exposed to unverified sources of health information. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of students at institutions of higher learning in Brunei with regard to the safe use of OTC medicines. A cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online questionnaire, adapted from the literature with additional information from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the educational resources in understanding OTC medicine for consumers. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections: demographic information, knowledge of OTC medicines, attitudes, and practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. A total of 335 students returned a completed questionnaire. The students had a mean knowledge score of 7.1 out of 9, with more than half (53.4%) having good knowledge (knowledge score > 7), and only a small percentage (5.7%) with poor knowledge. Almost all of the students (99.7%) had a positive attitude toward OTC medicine use. Few of the students practiced improper habits in terms of OTC medicine use, such as not reading the instructions or taking more than the recommended dose. Awareness of proper OTC medicine use among students in institutions of higher learning is necessary to prevent the rise of inappropriate user practices.

AB  - The present study contributes to the investigation of communicative norms and social support in Social Network Sites (SNSs). We suggest that a positivity bias restricts the availability of social support users receive from others via public responses to negative status updates. Moderated mediation analyses of the data of an online experiment (N = 870, M-age = 25.16 years, 64% female) show that users are less willing to comment on negative status updates than on positive ones. In contrast, users are more willing to respond to negative status updates with private messages. These effects are moderated by the strength of the relationship between sender and receiver of the status update and mediated by perceived message appropriateness and support urgency. The results suggest that SNS users canalize supportive reactions to negative experience of their close SNS friends through private modes of communication. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research examined the characteristics and predicting indicators of netizens which contribute to "Human Flesh Searching" and internet vigilantism. Human Flesh Searching (HFS) is a form of collective online behavior where netizens contribute information to social media and/or networking platforms about a certain event or a target individual or group to achieve what they regard as justice. It has been used to identify and investigate crime. Some netizens go further and take justice into their own hands by punishing alleged criminals and deviants through online shaming. Using the results of a survey conducted in Hong Kong, the research found both gender and time spent online are not significant variables to predict netizens' intention to contribute to HFS. A positive attitude toward HFS was the strongest predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism was also a strong predictor of HFS intention. Vigilantism not only affects HFS intention directly, but also indirectly through a positive attitude on HFS. Fairness might negatively influence people's HFS intention and attitude toward HFS; however, this influence was found to be weak in the present study. Social Justice might not affect HFS intention directly, yet it might exert its effect via a positive attitude toward HFS. That is, netizens who intend to contribute to HFS are those who have less confidence in the criminal justice system and believe highly that people should take justice into their own hands.

AB  - This article examines water crises in three megacities (Sao Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Jakarta) in the Global South. While crises can delegitimize the dominant water policy and lead to policy change, this does not necessarily come about in all cases. Drawing data from key informant interviews, newspaper articles and policy documents, and using Steven Lukes' three faces of power framework, we observe how crisis framing has reinforced large infrastructures for water supply and flood protection. In the three case studies, powerful actors combined the three faces of power to shape public opinion in pursuit of their own agendas.

AB  - Though the political advertising literature has documented the effects of political advertising on political attitudes and voting behavior, less attention has been paid to the role of political advertising in stimulating information search. This study seeks to examine the impact of political advertising on real world information seeking using CMAG data from the Wisconsin Ad Project combined with Google Trends search data. Results suggest that increased advertising volume is associated with increased online information seeking. Additionally, this study tests the feasibility of using Google Trends search data as a proxy measure of political information seeking.

AB  - Social distancing including lockdowns are acceptable measures to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. In this cross sectional study, we surveyed the impact of these measurements on sexual behavior and pre-exposure prophylaxis for HIV (PrEP) use among MSM. A digital questionnaire was distributed via social media and geographically based meeting applications after the first lockdown (March-April 2020). 1194 MSM responded, 91.8% were HIV negative, 19.4% of them used PrEP regularly, and 8.2% were people living with HIV (PLWH). Median age was 34.5 years. 54.4% reported that they kept strictly social distancing guidelines. Low education, hazardous sexual behavior, moderate/severe, and depression predicted low compliance with social distancing guidelines. 66.7% reported a significant decrease in the number of casual sex partners. 55% of those who took PrEP reduced their PrEP intake. Many of the PLWH and PrEP users reduced their medical follow-up. In light of the continuous outbreak and the risk of further outbreaks in the future consideration should be given to provide continuing access to HIV and sexual health clinics.

AB  - The present study examined gender differences in young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery as well as the joint effects of media and peers on their attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. A survey of 555 university students in Singapore showed that young people of both sexes generally held positive attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. We observed no significant gender disparities in their acceptance of cosmetic surgery or intention to undergo cosmetic surgery. We tested the influence of the presumed media influence model, and our findings supported direct and indirect models of media influence on young people's attitudes toward cosmetic surgery. The indirect model was mediated by perceived influence of cosmetic surgery-related media on peers. We also found that men were more susceptible to the influence of presumed media influence than women were. Practice implications of our study for educators include open discussions regarding cosmetic surgery and the influence of media and peers among young people, as well as differentiating intervention programs for emerging adult women and men.

AB  - According to intergroup emotion theory, the impact of many intergroup events on intergroup outcomes is mediated by group-directed emotions. We demonstrate that the ability of apology to reduce retribution against and increase forgiveness of a transgressing outgroup is contributed to by discrete intergroup emotions. We examined both negative (anger and fear) and positive (respect and satisfaction) emotions directed toward the transgressing outgroup. Apology reduced the desire for retribution whereas lack of apology increased it, and outgroup-directed anger uniquely mediated this effect. In contrast, apology increased and lack of apology decreased forgiveness, particularly when the ingroup responded to the transgression, and only outgroup-directed respect mediated this effect. These results provide the first evidence that intergroup emotions can mediate the impact of apology on intergroup relations outcomes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Much of what we know theoretically and empirically about attitudes toward racialized minorities in the US is predicated on early research on white opinion toward Black Americans. Although Muslim Americans have garnered considerable political attention and have been exposed to tremendous scrutiny and discrimination since 9/11, not many theoretical insights apart from generalized ethnocentric accounts have been offered to explain unfavorable attitudes toward this population, let alone the prevalence of community-level opposition toward proposed mosque projects. We offer a theoretical perspective grounded in orientalist notions of Islam and set group-specific measures focused on the perceived beliefs and behaviors of Muslim Americans against indicators of generalized ethnocentrism. Our findings highlight the limitations of applying general models of intergroup relations to understanding the dynamics of prejudice toward Muslim Americans. We conclude by encouraging scholars to consider more distinctive, group-specific constructs that could aid advocacy groups and policymakers to combat prejudice and discrimination against American Muslims.

AB  - The middle class is an important engine of political development and social change, but their political attitudes and values are mostly unclear in the Internet era. The author found that the use of modern information technology does not have a significant impact on Chinese and Japanese middle classes' trust in their national and local governments. However, the impact of technology on the middle classes' pride in their government system, and the wish to live under their current political system vary wildly between China and Japan. Modern information technology significantly reduces the Chinese middle class's pride in their government and their wish to live under the current political system, but it does not have the same impact on Japanese middle class. These findings provide effective guidance and references for the improvement of national image. Based on ROC (relative operating characteristics) curve analysis, the logistic regression model presents a good fitting effect.

AB  - Off-site construction (OSC) has become the direction of China's construction transformation owing to the disappearance of demographic dividend and demand of environmental sustainability. Although the Chinese government has made efforts to promote OSC, its development progress remains slow. According to technology acceptance theory, the positive attitude and sufficient understanding of the public are of great significance to the advancement of new technology transformations. No relevant study has investigated people's awareness of OSC, and social media platforms provide big data for social science research. Accordingly, this study adopts web crawler technology combined with two methods of text mining, which are topic modeling and sentiment analysis, to explore public attitude toward OSC based on data collected from SinaWeibo. The research findings of this study are as follows: The attention status of the public toward OSC was greatly fluctuated but generally showed an upward tendency. The release of relevant government policies also significantly influenced the attention status of the public. What the public most concern about OSC was the building attributes and performance, such as connection issues, earthquake resistance, and waterproof property. Moreover, the Chinese public had relatively positive sentiments on OSC, and most of them expressed their interest and curiosity about OSC. The leading causes of public negative sentiments were safety issues, technical level, high prices, simplistic design and unemployment, indicating that popularization of the updated information on building performance, supportive policy and long-term significance of OSC was far from enough.

AB  - Accurate understanding of COVID-19 safety recommendations early in the outbreak was complicated by inconsistencies in public health and media messages. We sought to characterize high-risk adults' knowledge of COVID-19 symptoms, prevention strategies, and prevention behaviors. We used data from the Chicago COVID-19 Comorbidities (C3) survey collected between March 13 thru March 20, 2020. A total of 673 predominately older adults with >= 1 chronic condition completed the telephone interview. Knowledge was assessed by asking participants to name three symptoms of COVID-19 and three actions to prevent infection. Participants were then asked if and how they had changed plans due to coronavirus. Most participants could identify three symptoms (71.0%) and three preventive actions (69.2%). Commonly reported symptoms included: fever (78.5%), cough (70.6%), and shortness of breath (45.2%); preventive actions included: washing hands (86.5%) and social distancing (86.2%). More than a third of participants reported social distancing themselves (38.3%), and 28.8% reported obtaining prescription medication to prepare for the outbreak. In multivariable analyses, no participant characteristics were associated with COVID-19 knowledge. Women were more likely than men, and Black adults were less likely than White adults to report practicing social distancing. Individuals with low health literacy were less likely to report obtaining medication supplies. In conclusion, though most higher-risk individuals were aware of social distancing as a prevention strategy early in the outbreak, less than half reported enacting it, and racial disparities were apparent. Consistent messaging and the provision of tangible resources may improve future adherence to safety recommendations.

AB  - The refugee crisis in the summer of 2015 mobilized thousands of volunteers in Hungary to help refugees on their journey through Europe despite the government's hostile stance. We conducted a survey (N = 1459) among people who were active in supporting refugees and providing services to them to test the hypothesis of whether volunteers in the context of this humanitarian crisis had social change motivations similar to those engaged in direct political activism. Hierarchical regression analysis and mediation analysis revealed the importance of opinion-based identity and moral convictions as predictors of volunteerism, while efficacy beliefs and anger only predicted political activism. Our findings suggest that volunteers engaged in helping refugees based on motivations previously described as drivers of mobilization for political activism, but chose volunteerism to alleviate the problems embedded in the intergroup situation. Although the context of the refugee crisis in Hungary may have been somewhat unique, these findings have implications for other asymmetrical politicized intergroup relations in which advantaged group members can choose to offer humanitarian aid, engage in political actions to change the situation, or do both.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of a peer feedback tool and a reflection tool on social and cognitive performance during computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL). A CSCL-environment was augmented with a peer feedback tool (Radar) and a reflection tool (Reflector) in order to make group members aware of both their individual and their group behavior. Radar visualizes how group members perceive their own social and cognitive performance and that of their peers during collaboration along five dimensions. Reflector stimulates group members to reflect upon their own performance and the performance of the group. A 2 x 2 factorial between-subjects design was used to examine whether Radar and Reflector would lead to better team development, more group satisfaction, lower levels of group conflict, more positive attitudes toward problem-based collaboration, and a better group product. Results show that groups with Radar perceived their team as being better developed, experienced lower conflict levels, and had a more positive attitude towards collaborative problem solving than groups without Radar. The quality of group products, however, did not differ. The results demonstrate that peer feedback on the social performance of individual group members can enhance the performance and attitudes of a CSCL-group. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

TI  - Findings of a Cross-Sectional Survey on Knowledge, Attitudes, and Practices about COVID-19 in Uganda: Implications for Public Health Prevention and Control Measures
T2  - BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
AB  - Background. The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) morbidity is rising in Uganda. However, data are limited about people's knowledge, attitudes, and practices. Objective. To determine knowledge about COVID-19, attitudes towards presidential directives and Ministry of Health (MoH) guidelines, and adherence to practicing public health preventive measures (KAP) in Uganda. Methods. This cross-sectional survey was conducted between April 28 and May 19, 2020. Data were collected using online social media platforms, websites, and popular media outlets. We descriptively summarized data and categorized KAP scores as knowledgeable about COVID-19, positive attitude towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines, and adherent to public health preventive measures, respectively. We tested sex differences in KAP using tests of significance and established independently associated factors using modified Poisson regression analysis, reported using adjusted prevalence risk ratio (aPR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results. We studied 362 participants with the following sociodemographic characteristics: 86 (23.8%) aged 25-29 years, 212 (58.6%) males, 270 (74.6%) with tertiary or university levels of education, and 268 (74.0%) urban residents. Of the 362 participants, 264 (93.9%) were knowledgeable about COVID-19 (94.1% males and 93.8% females), 51.3% had positive attitudes towards presidential directives and MoH guidelines (51.0% male and 51.8% female), and 175 (48.3%) were adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (42.9% males and 56.0% females). Compared to males, our data shows that females were more adherent to practicing public health preventive measures (aPR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.01-1.53), knowledgeable about COVID-19 (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.95-1.07), and had positive attitudes towards directives and guidelines (aPR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.82-1.25). Conclusions. This study shows that public health prevention efforts should be directed to closing the identified gaps in KAP among Ugandans in order to halt the spread of COVD-19 in Uganda as well as the East African region.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to every country worldwide. A call for global vaccination for COVID-19 plays a pivotal role in the fight against this virus. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, public willingness to get vaccinated has become an important public health concern, considering the vaccine hesitancy observed worldwide. Social media is powerful in monitoring public attitudes and assess the dissemination, which would provide valuable information for policy makers. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the responses of vaccine positivity on social media when major public events (major outbreaks) or major adverse events related to vaccination (COVID-19 or other similar vaccines) were reported. Methods: A total of 340,783 vaccine-related posts were captured with the poster's information on Weibo, the largest social platform in China. After data cleaning, 156,223 posts were included in the subsequent analysis. Using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries, posts were classified into 2 categories, positive and negative. After model training and sentiment analysis, the proportion of positive posts was computed to measure the public positivity toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines in China tends to fluctuate over time in the range of 45.7% to 77.0% and is intuitively correlated with public health events. In terms of gender, males were more positive (70.0% of the time) than females. In terms of region, when regional epidemics arose, not only the region with the epidemic and surrounding regions but also the whole country showed more positive attitudes to varying degrees. When the epidemic subsided temporarily, positivity decreased with varying degrees in each region. Conclusions: In China, public positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines fluctuates over time and a regional epidemic or news on social media may cause significant variations in willingness to accept a vaccine. Furthermore, public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination vary from gender and region. It is crucial for policy makers to adjust their policies through the use of positive incentives with prompt responses to pandemic-related news to promote vaccination acceptance.

AB  - This article examined the relationship between ideology and conspiratorial thinking and the related mediating effect of ingroup favoritism in a non-Western society. We investigated patriotism and nationalism as two favorable orientations toward national ingroups. We also examined their relationship with the general conspiracy mentality and the specific conspiracy beliefs that have emerged during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results revealed that conservative ideology was associated with conspiratorial beliefs in China regardless of the specific conspiracy theories related to ingroups or outgroups, which indicates such tendencies may exist universally across cultures. Patriotism was not associated with conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19, whereas nationalism was negatively associated with the conspiracy theories about China (an ingroup) and positively associated with conspiracy theories about the US (an outgroup). Moreover, nationalism mediated the relationship between ideology and specific conspiracy beliefs during the pandemic. The general conspiracy mentality did not predict conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19. The results indicate that believing conspiracy theories is not only the result of a stable conspiracy mentality but is also influenced by ideology and intergroup relations.

AB  - Based on an integrated model of doctor-patient psychological mechanisms, the formation mechanism of doctor--patient trust was systematically demonstrated from the healthcare professional (HCP)'s perspective integrating intergroup relations (expectations), interpersonal relations (communication), and psychosocial (stereotypes). The results of a survey of 3000 doctors and nurses from 14 provinces in eastern, central, and western China support the rationality of an integrated model of doctor-patient psychological mechanisms. The establishment of doctor-patient trust is influenced by the direct role of primary intergroup factors, the indirect role of immediate interpersonal interactions, and the moderating role of social psychology. Specifically, (1) doctor-patient trust is directly predicted by HCP's expectation and indirectly influenced by communication; (2) stereotypes regulate the relationship between HCP's expectation, communication, and doctor-patient trust: the activation of positive stereotypes enhances the positive relationship among the three; Negative stereotypes only positively contribute to mediated pathway-communication behaviors and have a weaker facilitation effect compared to positive stereotypes.

AB  - Purpose: To assess the knowledge and attitudes of Saudi patients toward the safety of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 142 Saudi patients at King Khalid hospital, Asir, Saudi Arabia. Data were collected using a self-questionnaire based on MRI safety issues gained from the literature. The questionnaire was divided into two sections, one containing the respondents' sociodemographic information and the other assessing their knowledge and attitudes toward participating in MRI.
   Results: A total of 142 patients responded to the survey, and their average age was 31.5 +/- 4 years. The majority were married and held a bachelor's degree. The mean knowledge score regarding MRI safety was 0.29 +/- 0.25, which reflects poor knowledge, whereas the attitude score was 0.67 +/- 0.20, reflecting a moderately positive attitude. Awareness and attitude among patients improved as education levels increased. Finally, only 53.5% of the respondents were aware of the noise produced by the MRI scanner.
   Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the awareness of MRI safety among patients in the Asir Region is poor, although they showed positive attitudes toward the issue. Thus, education is necessary for patients to improve awareness of MRI safety to facilitate MRI examinations, which will help decrease scan time and image artefacts.

AB  - This article presents a Portuguese translation and cultural modification of the Organizational Justice Scale of Niehoff and Moorman (1993). The scale was tested in two correlational studies, one with 115 employees from the technical staff of a Portuguese organization and a second with 59 Portuguese teachers, testing the scale's discriminant validity through comparison with other measures such as psychological contract violation, organizational identification, work motivation, job satisfaction and perceived ability-job fit. The scale showed satisfying consistency and in a factorial analysis of the Portuguese version; the item distribution per factor was the same as that of the original scale (Niehoff & Moorman, 1993). The Portuguese Organizational Justice scale showed adequate reliability and validity. Therefore, this Portuguese version can be considered a suitable instrument to assess organizational justice among the Portuguese population.

AB  - With the rise of COVID-19, the sustainability of air transport is a major challenge, as there is limited space in aircraft cabins, resulting in a higher risk of virus transmission. In order to detect possible chains of infection, technology-supported apps are used for social distancing. These COVID-19 applications are based on the display of the received signal strength for distance estimation, which is strongly influenced by the spreading environment due to the signal multipath reception. Therefore, we evaluate the applicability of technology-based social distancing methods in an aircraft cabin environment using a radio propagation simulation based on a three-dimensional aircraft model. We demonstrate the susceptibility to errors of the conventional COVID-19 distance estimation, which can lead to large errors in the determination of distances and to the impracticability of traditional tracing approaches during passenger boarding/deboarding. In the context of the future connected cabin, a robust distance measurement must be implemented to ensure safe travel. Finally, our results can be transferred to similar fields of application, e.g., trains or public transport.

AB  - The order in which individuals receive information about wildlife may influence their attitude toward wildlife differently. We explored order effects of a threat message that induced more fear versus a suffering message that elicited more compassion on attitude toward wildlife. Specifically, we focused on bats, a risk-laden species also suffering massive mortalities due to a disease affecting bat populations across the United States. We randomly assigned 1,506 U.S. adults to one of eight message conditions as part of a 2 (message order: suffering -> threat vs. threat -> suffering) x 2 (suffering messages) x 2 (threat messages) between-subjects factorial design or a control (no message) condition. We found a significant two-way interaction between message order and biospheric values on attitude toward bats. For people with high biospheric values, reading a suffering message first led to a more positive attitude than reading a threat message first, whereas reading a threat message first led to a more positive attitude than reading a suffering message first for people with low biospheric values. Compassion but not fear mediated these effects. Theoretical and practical implications are provided.

AB  - Integrating the psychological theories of 'cue utilization' and 'trust online', this study identifies the cues in Instagram posts that build trust, in turn mediating consumers' positive attitudinal responses toward the branded products. The survey data from 260 Instagram users support the hypotheses that the 'popularity' and 'quality of the argument' of posts positively influence consumer trust toward a post, which builds positive attitudinal responses toward the branded products. The study supports the conclusion that consumers rely on the cues of popularity and quality of the argument of a post when they make use of cues for reducing uncertainty in purchasing apparel online. Two theoretical orientations are useful for explicating consumer attitudinal behaviors toward Instagram posts. Practical implications for enhancing the quality of Instagram posts by means of cues that create trust in posts are discussed.

AB  - Low-status groups report lower levels of well-being than do high-status groups. Although system justification theory posits that the endorsement of system-justifying beliefs should decrease this well-being gap, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this hypothesized palliative effect have evaded empirical scrutiny. We address this oversight by arguing that system-justifying beliefs confer palliative benefits upon low-status groups by decreasing perceptions of group-based discrimination. Using nationally representative data from New Zealand (N = 12,959), we demonstrate that ethnic minorities (Study 1a) and women (Study 1b) generally report lower levels of well-being than do New Zealand Europeans and men, respectively. Nevertheless, as hypothesized, these differences were mitigated by the endorsement of ethnic- and gender-specific system justification, respectively. Mediated moderation analyses further revealed that part of the palliative effects of system justification occurred via reductions in perceived group-based discrimination. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Increasing diversity and the anticipation of its resulting cultural change is raising vociferous protestations among White Americans. Here, we explore moderation and mediation of its intergroup implications. Among a nationally representative sample of White Americans, Study 1 (n = 2,257) revealed that living in a region that experienced a greater (vs. lesser) increase in racial diversity in recent years was associated with more anti-immigrant attitudes, but only among those who were highly White-identified. In an experiment, Study 2 (n = 420, White Americans) revealed that collective nostalgia (i.e., longing for the ingroup's past) mediated the relation between anticipated cultural change resulting from shifting demographics and anti-immigrant attitudes, but only for those who were highly White-identified. Thus, anti-immigrant sentiment among White Americans in response to changing demographics and culture is seen primarily among those personally invested in their White racial identity, an effect partly explained by a longing for bygone days.

AB  - Little is known about how environmental concern in young adulthood may shape childbearing attitudes and intentions. Here, we examine the relationship between individual environmental concern, fertility intentions, and attitudes toward reproduction in a sample of Canadian university students, N = 139. General environmental concern and pollution-related health concerns both predicted a less positive attitude toward having children. Further, attitude toward having children mediated the negative relationship between pollution-related health concerns and personal fertility intentions. This study offers an important early step in empirical examination of the association between environmental concern and fertility.

AB  - Individuals can react to the same media content in significantly different ways depending on their emotions, yet only little attention has been paid to this topic in the context of interactive media usage. Filling this gap, the current study investigates how the valence of emotion affects the persuasive impact of interactive health messages. We conducted a 2 (emotion: positive vs. negative) x 2 (interactivity: interactive website vs. non-interactive webpage) between-subjects factorial design experiment (N = 225) and measured participants' interface assessment, website/message attitudes, behaviour intentions and recognition memory. The results showed that interactivity elicited more favourable interface assessments and website attitudes only for those experiencing positive emotions, which indirectly enhanced their message attitudes and behavioural intentions toward the anti-drug-driving message. In contrast, negative emotions aided recognition memory of the interactive part of the website. The findings bridge the human-computer interaction and cognitive psychology literature and suggest how user emotions can be used as a design strategy to enhance positive attitudes toward websites.

AB  - Increasingly, adults and children socialise and communicate online. Children's safe and secure online communication with people from all over the world can increase their understanding of other cultures, which is an important goal in today's multicultural world. Our research studied such interactions between children from three countries, Hungary, Mexico, and the USA. The goals of our research were to study how children represent their identity online and what the implications are for the design of children's online communities. We used qualitative methods to derive a deep understanding of children's behaviours and motivations. Our results show that children exposed their true and complete identities online. They focused on sharing and learning about personal, ethnic, and gender identities via online media and largely ignored cultural identity. They learned about children from other countries and developed positive attitudes towards them. Based on our results we describe design guidelines for children's online identity tools.

AB  - This mixed-methods study investigates the effects of student attitudes and behaviours on the outcomes of learning mathematics with computer tools. A computer tool was used to help students develop the mathematical concept of function. In the whole sample (N = 521), student attitudes could account for a 3.4 point difference in test scores between individuals on a 10-point scale General attitude towards mathematics positively predicted test scores. However, more able students who were well-disposed towards mathematical computer tools achieved lower scores Self-reported behaviours were unrelated to test scores Detailed observation of a small number of students (N = 8) revealed that positive attitudes towards mathematics and mathematical computer tools augmented exhibited learning behaviours, and that both a positive attitude to mathematical computer tools and exhibited learning behaviours benefited tool mastery. Although tool mastery and test scores are intimately related, reflective processes appear to mediate this relationship Promoting learning with mathematical computer tools needs to take several factors into account, including improving student attitudes, raising levels of learning behaviours, and giving sufficient opportunity for constructing new mathematical knowledge within meaningful mathematical discourse (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Context Knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes toward palliative care (PC) constitute barriers to its access. Few studies have focused on the intrinsic relationship between these variables, and none has examined the relationship between them and self-care self-efficacy. Objective To examine the direct and indirect effects of self-care self-efficacy, knowledge, and beliefs on attitudes toward PC. Methods A cross-sectional predictive study was conducted. Self-care self-efficacy, knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs about PC were analyzed using information from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS 5, cycle 2, 2018). Data from 1,162 participants were considered. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to represent the statistical mediation model with latent and observable variables. Results The structural model presents positive coefficients indicating that self-care self-efficacy significantly predicts knowledge (beta = 0.127, p < 0.001) and beliefs (beta = 0.078, p = 0.023). Similarly, knowledge is associated with attitudes (beta = 0.179, p < 0.001) and beliefs (beta = 0.213, p < 0.001). The beliefs measure is also significantly related to attitudes (beta = 0.474, p < 0.001). In addition, this structural multiple mediation model shows optimal goodness-of-fit indices: chi(2)/df = 3.49, CFI = 0.983, TLI = 0.976, RMSEA = 0.046 [90% CI: 0.037-0.056], SRMR = 0.038. Conclusion Self-care self-efficacy is significantly associated with knowledge and beliefs about PC, which in turn are related to each other. Altogether, these variables predict positive attitudes toward PC. Understanding the relationship between these variables is relevant for targeting-specific populations and designing timely strategies to improve access to PC.

AB  - Pressure injury is a serious and preventable problem in intensive care units. Translating guidelines into clinical practice can reduce the incidence of pressure injury. Identifying clinical status, barriers and facilitators contribute to guideline implementation. To identify the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pressure injury prevention in Chinese critical care nurses. Secondary data were extracted from a multicentric clinical trial. Knowledge and attitudes toward pressure injury prevention were assessed by a fourteen-item questionnaire. The observed practices were recorded using a case report form. The report complies with the STROBE statement. A total of 950 critical care nurses in 15 hospitals from six provinces of China were investigated. A total of 53.1% of nurses received a median score of 6 points or less. Knowledge regarding the repositioning procedure, risk assessment, and heel pressure injury prevention was insufficient. Over 99% of nurses strongly or somewhat agreed that pressure injury prevention was very important and that they were willing to take measures to prevent pressure injury. A total of 27 781 patient days of pressure injury prevention practice were recorded. Repositioning was the most commonly used prevention measure, followed by support surfaces and prophylactic dressings. A combination of repositioning, support surface, and prophylactic dressing was lacking. Chinese critical nurses showed a low level of knowledge and a positive attitude toward pressure injury prevention. Practices of pressure injury prevention were unsatisfactory. There is a clear gap between the guidelines and clinical practices. The barrier (low-level knowledge) and facilitator (positive attitude) were identified in this study. According to these findings, strategies need to be developed to promote guideline implementation.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity is a major public health burden in Qatar. Pharmacists can play an important role in providing weight management services (WMSs). This study aimed to explore their attitudes, practice, perceived competence, and role in WMSs in Qatar. Methods: A mixed-method explanatory sequential design was applied in the study. A validated online questionnaire was administered followed by qualitative individual and focus group interviews. Results: Two-hundred seventy community pharmacists completed the survey (response rate 45%). More than half of them indicated that they often or always explain to patients the risks associated with overweight and obesity (56.2%), recommend weight loss medications, herbs or dietary supplements (52.4%), and counsel about their proper use and/or side effects (56.9%). Conversely, the majority of the pharmacists rarely or never measure patients' waist circumference (83.8%) or calculate their body mass index (72.1%). Over 80% had very positive attitudes towards their role in weight management. Around three-quarters of the participants agreed or strongly agreed that difficulty in following-up with patients (80.7%), lack of private consultation area (75.7%), and lack of pharmacist's time (75.2%) are barriers for implementing WMSs. More than 60% stated that they are fully competent in 7 out of 24 WMSs listed. Some themes generated include pharmacist's role and impact in weight management, need for training about weight management, and impact of social media on patients' perceptions. Conclusion: Qatar community pharmacists reported positive attitudes towards the provision of WMSs. However, they identified several barriers against provision of WMSs. Several strategies are proposed to overcome barriers and to improve the provision of WMSs in community pharmacies in Qatar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Robots are gaining attention as a potential solution to aging.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to explore the attitude of robot assistance in Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) among elderly people living independently.
   METHODS: The one-on-one interview, buddy robot video and questionnaire survey were used to analyze mean, median, range, and the test results of non-parametric statistical methods such as Wilcoxon sign-rank test statistic and one-sample Wilcoxon sign-rank test statistic, so as to explore the attitude of the elderly living independently towards robot-assisted ADLs and the acceptance of the use of robots in 32 ADLs.
   RESULTS: The results showed that there were significant differences in the attitudes, usability and ease of use of elderly people towards robot assistance before and after watching the Buddy Robot video and they had a more positive attitude after watching the video. According to the results, the elderly was more receptive to the use of robots in activities such as "reminding to carry objects" and "reminding to take medicine", while they were less receptive to the use of robots in the group or private activities such as "playing mahjong" and "taking a bath".
   CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that the elderly had a positive attitude towards the use of robot-assisted ADLs, and there were differences in the acceptance of robot-assisted ADLs. The results are helpful to understand the assistance needs and attitudes of the elderly, and provide a reference for the design of assistive robots that meet user needs, and ultimately improve the ability of the elderly to live independently at home.

AB  - Introduction: Practice placements are essential for radiotherapy students to learn and embed the necessary skills for practice; thus, each placement should afford an optimum learning experience. A key finding from the Phase 3 student arm of recent doctoral research suggests that for some students an optimum learning experience is not guaranteed. Using students' own words, this paper seeks to increase radiographers' awareness of how their behaviours can affect students' placement learning, and aims to help improve the placement learning experience for both.
   Method: A three-phase, U.K.-wide, mixed methods study was conducted. In the Phase 3 student arm, qualitative data were gathered via focus groups/interviews from volunteer student radiographers. Data were transcribed, manually coded, and analysed thematically by the Researcher using the applied research methodology Framework Analysis.
   Results: The analysed data were complimentary to radiographers, overall, but common themes were identified criticising certain of their attitudes and behaviours. Students exhibited fragility in response to perceived negative attitudes and behaviours, and failed to develop resilience in response to further similar experiences. This had a negative effect on their placement learning. Positive attitudes from radiographers enhanced students' placement learning. The placement experiences of radiotherapy students are consistent with those of other AHP and nursing students identified in the literature.
   Conclusion: Increasing radiographers' awareness of the negative and positive effects of their behaviours and attitudes will help improve students' placement learning experience. Students' resilience may be improved by teaching them coping strategies to use on placement.
   Implications for practice: The retention of radiotherapy students is an urgent concern for the radiotherapy profession therefore it is important to take steps to improve it. Enhancing students' placement experience may contribute to increased retention. Crown Copyright (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The College of Radiographers. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to segment US green consumers based on their personal, social, and environmental motivations for purchasing pro-environmental products. By using two-step cluster analysis, this study revealed six green consumer segments, each with a distinct combination of motivations. The different segments display a wide range of demographic characteristics, knowledge of pro-environmental products, pro-environmental product use behavior, skepticism, and attitudes toward pro-environmental advertising. This study found that green consumers, who have strong environmental motivations, have high knowledge about pro-environmental products, use a higher number and more varied selection of such products, tend to have less skepticism toward pro-environmental advertising, and have more positive attitudes toward such advertising. The study expands the motivations used in green consumer segmentation, delivering a more detailed analysis of the drivers of green consumer behavior. It also helps to explain the contradictions in the literature as to whether or not green consumers are open to or skeptical of green advertising.

KW  - Vaccine attitudes
AB  - Social media vaccine misinformation can negatively influence vaccine attitudes. It is urgent to develop communication approaches to reduce the misinformation?s impact. This study aimed to test the effects of fact checking labels for misinformation on attitudes toward vaccines. An online survey experiment with 1198 participants recruited from a U.S. national sample was conducted in 2018. Participants were randomly assigned to six conditions: misinformation control, or fact-checking label conditions attributed to algorithms, news media, health institutions, research universities, or fact-checking organizations. We analyzed differences in vaccine attitudes between the fact-checking label and control conditions. Further, we compared perceived expertise and trustworthiness of the five categories of fact-checking sources. Fact-checking labels attached to misinformation posts made vaccine attitudes more positive compared to the misinformation control condition (P = .003, Cohen?s d= 0.21). Conspiracy ideation moderated the effect of the labels on vaccine attitudes (P = .02). Universities and health institutions were rated significantly higher on source expertise than other sources. Mediation analyses showed labels attributed to universities and health institutions indirectly resulted in more positive attitudes than other sources through perceived expertise. Exposure to fact-checking labels on misinformation can generate more positive attitudes toward vaccines in comparison to exposure to misinformation. Incorporating labels from trusted universities and health institutions on social media platforms is a promising direction for addressing the vaccine misinformation problem. This points to the necessity for closer collaboration between public health and research institutions and social media companies to join efforts in addressing the current misinformation threat.

AB  - Introduction
   Japanese encephalitis (JE) is a major cause of high morbidity and mortality in several states across India. However, in 2014, a sharp rise was observed in the number of cases of JE in north-eastern Assam state, and 51% of the total cases of JE in India were reported from the Assam in the same year. In this regard, a study was conducted to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare workers in Darrang, a district of Assam highly affected by JE.
   Methods
   A cross sectional study was conducted for 2 months among HCWs in the major district hospital of Darrang, Assam. A pre-tested, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from the participants. Convenience sampling approach was used to collect data from different departments of the hospitals. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were used to express the results.
   Results
   The knowledge of HCWs regarding JE was poor with a mean knowledge score of 11.02 +/- 2.39 (out of 17), while their attitudes were positive with a mean attitudes score of 43.16 +/- 2.47 (ranging from 13 to 52). Overall, 40.4% and 74.3% of participants demonstrated good knowledge and positive attitudes respectively. Cut-off score for good knowledge and positive attitudes toward JE was set as >= 12 and >40 respectively. Older participants (40-49 years) and experienced workers (>10 years) were significantly associated with good knowledge as compared to their referent group (p<0.05), while knowledge of nurses and other orderlies were significantly lower than physicians (p<0.01). Similar factors were associatedwith the positive attitudes of the participants with the exception of experience. Television was the major source of information regarding JE reported by HCWs (79%).
   Conclusion
   Although the knowledge was not optimized, HCWs exhibited positive attitudes towards JE. Future research is required to design, implement and evaluate interventions to improve the knowledge of JE among HCWs.

AB  - Background The social distancing during COVID-19 is likely to cause a feeling of alienation, which may pose a threat to the public's mental health. Our research aims to examine the relationship between negative emotions and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), considering the mediation effect of alienation and how it is moderated by anxiety and depression.
   Methods For this, the current study conducted a cross-sectional survey on 7145 participants during the outbreak of COVID-19, via online questionnaires comprised of a self-designed Negative emotions questionnaire, Symptom Check List 90 (SCL-90), PTSD Checklist-civilian version (PCL-C), and Adolescent Students Alienation Scale (ASAS).
   Results A total of 6666 pieces of data from the general population were included in the statistical analysis. The descriptive statistics showed a relatively mild level of mental disorders. Besides, results of Conditional Process Model analysis supported our hypotheses that negative emotions and alienation were both predictors for PTSD symptoms, and their direct and indirect effects were all moderated by the level of anxiety.
   Limitations This study was limited by the generality and causality of the conclusion. The moderating effect of depression was left for further study due to the collinearity problem of variables.
   Conclusions Social distancing may have an impact on individuals' mental health by the feeling of alienation, which was moderated by affective disorders. Clinical psychologists should identify individuals' particular cognition and mental disorders to provide a more accurate and adequate intervention for them.

AB  - Previous studies have found that "disgust-sensitive" individuals have negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people, but the underlying mechanisms for such attitudes remain unclear. Based on moral foundations theory, the current paper assumes that the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality are mediated by moral foundations. In order to test this assumption, the current authors examined the questionnaire answers from a total of 452 Chinese undergraduates who participated in this study. The results showed that disgust sensitivity was positively correlated with negative attitudes toward homosexuality, and positively correlated with moral concerns in five domains (care, fairness, loyalty, authority, and sanctity). Authority and sanctity were both associated with attitudes toward homosexuality, while only sanctity mediated the relationship between disgust sensitivity and attitudes toward homosexuality. Overall, the results suggest that considering moral foundations (especially sanctity) may lend more insight to the associations between disgust sensitivity and negative attitudes toward gay and lesbian people.

AB  - The shared experience of societal discrimination and affirmation can provide a basis for empathy among members of different marginalized groups. However, the potential mechanisms and moderating conditions involved in this process have been little studied. This experiment examined how perceived societal (in)equity of one's own group may influence one's reaction to other marginalized groups. We randomly assigned 310 cisgender White lesbian, gay. and bisexual (LGB) adults to conditions varying in LGB (in)equity salience (discrimination, affirmation, control) and in the target outgroup identity (transgender, Black). Participants completed a survey assessing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the outgroup, that is, indicators of allyship. Based on the emerging theory of stigma-based solidarity, we expected LGB discrimination to improve intergroup relations with transgender people (i.e. a group readily sharing a common superordinate identity with LGB people) but worsen relations with Black people (i.e. a group not readily sharing a common superordinate identity). Counter to expectations, allyship variables were not predicted by discrimination as a main effect or in interaction with outgroup identity. However, we found support for the mediating role of emotions in explaining the indirect effect of discrimination on allyship. For example, discrimination produced greater outgroup identification by elevating negative affect, but only when the outgroup was transgender people. Results for transgender and Black targets converged for outcomes requiring participants to consider societal injustice toward the outgroup. We observed only one effect for affirmation: It reduced LGB people's empathic anger for both transgender and Black people. Results may inform efforts of coalition building.

AB  - This exploratory study engages with eight case studies of music performances broadcast online to investigate the role of music in facilitating social cohesion, intercultural understanding and community resilience during a time of social distancing and concomitant heightened racial tensions. Using an online ethnographic approach and thematic analysis of video comments, the nature of audience engagement with music performances broadcast via YouTube during COVID-19 lockdown of 2020 is explored through the lens of ritual engagement with media events and models of social capital. The eight case studies featured virtual choirs, orchestras and music collaborations of various genres, including classical, pop and fusion styles drawing from European, Asia Minor, South African, West African, North African, Arabic, South Asian, and East Asian cultural origins. Five overarching themes resulted from thematic analysis of video comments, including Interaction, Unity, Resilience, Identity, and Emotion. The paper contributes important theorisation that ritual engagement and social learning fosters intercultural understanding through engaging with music both cognitively and emotionally, which can in turn shape both individual and collective identity. Online platforms provide scope for both bonding and bridging opportunities. Community resilience is supported through the sharing of knowledge, sustaining music practice during social distancing, as well as emotional support shared among audience participants, with potential wellbeing outcomes.

AB  - Islamist terrorist attacks and existing terror threat can seriously affect intergroup relations and policy making. Drawing on hostile media effect theory and intergroup threat theory, we hypothesized that perceived threat of terror influences perceived news media bias in favor of Muslims as well as support for surveillance policies that are perceived to be restrictive for Muslims. In addition, we assumed that media bias positively predicts surveillance policy support. Results of a quota-based two-wave panel survey (N-T2 = 524) revealed that perceived threat of terror increased perceived media bias in favor of Muslims over time, but did not have a direct effect over time on support for surveillance policies. However, perceived media bias was found to be a positive predictor of support for surveillance policies over time. In addition, support for policies was a positive predictor of perceived terror threat over time, suggesting a vicious cycle.

AB  - Background: Recent implementation of national health coverage and the increasing health burden in Indonesia require health professionals, including pharmacists, to work more collaboratively to improve access and quality of health care. Nevertheless, relatively little is known about Indonesian pharmacists' attitude towards collaboration.
   Objective: To assess and compare the attitude of Indonesian pharmacy students and pharmacists towards collaboration with physicians.
   Methods: A survey of 95 pharmacy students (Universitas Surabaya) and 114 pharmacists (public health facilities in East Java) in Indonesia was conducted using the validated questionnaire, Scale of Attitudes Toward Physician-Pharmacist Collaboration (SATP2C), which was translated in Bahasa Indonesia. The questionnaire contained 16 items which were based on a 4-point Likert scale. Descriptive statistics were used to summarise the responses, (i.e., individual scores, factor scores and total scores).
   Results: Response rates of 97.9% and 65.8% were reported for students and pharmacists, respectively. The mean total score of SATP2C among Indonesian students and pharmacists were 56.53 versus 56.77, respectively; indicating positive attitudes toward collaboration. Further analysis of each item of SATP2C confirmed the positive attitudes in which mean and median scores of were reported for most items in both groups. Significant differences between students and pharmacists were found regarding the following items: (i) 'there are many overlapping areas of responsibility between pharmacists and physicians' (3.28 versus 2.89, respectively; p<0.001), (ii) 'pharmacist should clarify a physician's order' (3.54 versus 3.71, respectively; p=0.046); and (iii) 'physicians should consult with pharmacists about adverse reactions or refractory to drug treatment' (3.60 versus 3.44, respectively; p=0.022).
   Conclusions: Indonesian pharmacists reported positive attitudes toward collaboration with physicians. Further research is needed to understand other factors contributing in translating those positive attitudes into actual practice, and thus, providing a good foundation for policy makers, researchers and practitioners to support pharmacist-physician collaboration in Indonesia.

AB  - This study tests whether the consequences of cross-cutting exposure (CCE) to political news on affective polarization depend on the type of media individuals consume. Findings from the 2020 American National Election Studies panel data suggest that CCE to cable TV news, a medium frequently described as uncivil, may increase negative affect toward the out-party candidate, and that such effect may be mediated by feelings of anger and certainty in one's political attitudes. These insights draw attention to elite incivility, in addition to citizens' partisan predispositions, as a potential contributor to the growing affective divide in American politics.

AB  - The polarized divide in current U.S. politics continues to separate citizens and impede political decision-making. Ameliorating this polarization may require addressing intergroup anxiety. The current work examines the buffering effect of endorsing the open marketplace of ideas and openness to engaging in political conversations with people who hold opposing political views on partisans' intergroup anxiety. In Study 1 (N=319), openness to diverse political discussions negatively predicted postelection intergroup anxiety among Obama supporters in the 2012 U.S. election. Among Romney supporters, endorsement of the open marketplace and openness to diverse political discussions negatively predicted intergroup anxiety. Study 2 (N=349 Democrats and Republicans), employed an experimental design and produced results consistent with Study 1. For Democrats and Republicans, openness to participating in political discussions characterized by multiple political perspectives was associated with reduced intergroup anxiety. Regardless of the threat of their candidate losing the 2016 election, Republicans (compared to Democrats) expressed reduced intergroup anxiety when endorsing the open marketplace of ideas and being open to engaging in diverse political discussions. Results are discussed in terms of contact theory within the context of the American political system.

AB  - Awe is an emotional response to perceptually vast stimuli that transcend current frames of reference. Guided by prior work documenting that awe promotes humility, increases perceptions of uncertainty, and diminishes personal concerns, across 3 studies (N = 776) we tested the hypothesis that awe results in reduced conviction about one's ideological attitudes. In Study 1. participants induced to experience awe, relative to those feeling amusement or in a neutral control condition, expressed less conviction regarding their attitudes toward capital punishment. In 2 subsequent studies, we showed that experiencing awe decreased perceptions of ideological polarization in the U.S. vis-a-vis racial bias in the criminal justice system (Study 2) and reduced desired social distance from those with different viewpoints regarding immigration (Study 3)-effects that were partially mediated by reduced conviction. These findings indicate that awe may lead to uncertainty and ambivalence regarding one's attitudes, a form of epistemological humility, and that this in turn may promote reduced dogmatism and increased perceptions of social cohesion.

AB  - Social dominance orientation and political orientations are strongly correlated, leading to the notion that right-wing individuals possess a dominant personality disposition. Expressing some caveats toward such an assumption, in four studies we tested the link between political orientation and dominant personality. We assessed dominant personality partly by the use of a newly developed measure of domineering, without reference to intergroup relations or political ideals, and partly by the use of an existing clinical measure of domineering (CAT-PD). The results revealed that all measures of dominance including social dominance were significantly intercorrelated and, in line with previous research, related to both personality (agreeableness) and prejudice. Also, the correlation of political orientation with domineering was significantly lower than that with social dominance. More importantly, in all studies, social dominance fully mediated (or confounded) the relations between domineering and political orientation. Together these findings suggest that a dominant personality is reflected in political orientation only if social dominance (support for group based hierarchies) is also adopted by the individual.

AB  - Aim This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward COVID-19 among youth in Bangladesh.
   Subject and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted from 5 May to 25 May 2020. People aged between 18 and 35 years were approached via social media to complete an online questionnaire that consisted of socio-demographic information and KAP toward COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and multiple logistic regression analyses were conducted.
   Results Out of 707 survey participants, 57.1% were male, the majority were students (60.3%), aged 24-29 years (61.5%), having a bachelor's degree (57%), having family income 25,000-50,000 BDT (40.5%) and living in urban areas (64.4%). Participants gathered information on COVID-19 mostly through social media (70.4%). Overall, 61.2% had adequate knowledge with 78.9% having a positive attitudes toward COVID-19 and only 51.6% had good practices. Most (86.8%) of the participants were confident that COVID-19 will be successfully controlled and Bangladesh was handling the COVID-19 health crisis well (84.20%). Only 75.2% of participants always washed their hands with soap or hand-sanitizer, and 70.6% wore a mask when going outside the home. Factors associated with adequate knowledge were being female, having a master's degree and above, and living in an urban area (p < 0.05). Participants having adequate knowledge of COVID-19 had higher likelihood of positive attitudes (OR: 6.41, 95% CI = 2.34-25.56, p = 0.000) and good practices (OR: 8.93, 95% CI = 3.92-38.42, p = 0.000).
   Conclusion The findings highlight the need for tailored education programs for COVID-19 which incorporates consideration of associated factors to improve the level of public knowledge, attitudes, and practices.

AB  - As some nature experiences, such as viewing wild animals, may be difficult to implement in science education, immersive virtual reality (VR) technologies have become a promising tool in education. However, there is limited knowledge regarding the effectiveness of nature experiences in VR. In this study, 50 German university students (M = 23.76 years, SD = 3.73 years) from diverse disciplines were randomly assigned to an immersive (head-mounted display; Oculus Quest) or a nonimmersive setting (external computer screen; desktop computer) and individually watched two 360 degrees videos from the social media site YouTube about wolves in their natural habitat. Besides measuring participants' attitudes towards wolves, we investigated their feeling of presence in the virtual environments with the Spatial Presence Experience Scale (SPES) and the retrospective emotions of interest, joy, and fear with the Differential Affect Scale (M-DAS). The immersive head-mounted display induced higher levels of presence and interest compared to the nonimmersive external computer screen. While higher interest in the screen setting was associated with more positive attitudes towards wolves, such a correlation could not be found in the head-mounted display setting. Thus, our study found that immersive technology could induce interest in a nature experience related to the tested socio-scientific issue, even among people who did not already hold positive attitudes toward the issue. Overall, our findings suggest that 360 degrees videos using immersive technology provide nature experiences with positive affective learning outcomes, even though the study focused on nature experiences in VR and was not an educational experience per se. As we were unable to assess the role of novelty of VR experiences, the application of VR technologies and its effects in larger teaching and learning settings needs to be evaluated in further studies.

AB  - Background and objectives: Enteral nutrition (EN) support plays a vital role in reducing malnutrition in hospitalised patients, and its provision is primarily a nurse's role. Therefore, nurses need to have adequate knowledge and a positive attitude regarding EN. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) regarding enteral nutrition of nursing personnel at 1 Military Hospital and to determine the need for updated in-service training.
   Method: A descriptive, cross-sectional study with an analytical component was used to collect data from military nurses through a validated self-administered questionnaire. A score of 80% and above was rated as adequate knowledge. Descriptive statistics were employed to describe the results and correlations were used to determine relationships between continuous variables.
   Results: In total, 207 (86.2% response rate) questionnaires were completed. The median knowledge score was 46.3% (mean 45.8 +/- 13.7%, range 6.3-81.2%). Only one participant achieved the target score of >= 80%, and 16.3% scored >= 60%. No significant differences were found between knowledge and professional rank (p = 0.14) and knowledge and years of working experience (r -= -0.01; p -= 0.85). A positive attitude towards EN was found and 96.1% of participants expressed the need for additional in-service training.
   Conclusion: The nursing personnel have inadequate EN knowledge, irrespective of their professional rank and experience. However, they are perceived to have positive attitudes towards the importance and administration of EN. Therefore, in-service training should be conducted regularly to mitigate the gap in knowledge.

AB  - White British Muslims pose a challenge to racialised representations of British Muslims as non-white, foreign and Other. By drawing on tools from Critical Discourse Analysis to develop Social Representations Theory on a micro-analytic level, and making connections with other relevant social psychological theories on intergroup relations, this article examines the constructions of white British Muslims as a threat in six national and two Muslim British newspapers. It looks at how discourses are used to create, perpetuate and challenge the hegemonisation' of social representations in majority and minority press. The findings show that white British Muslims are portrayed as a threat not just despite of, but because of, their position as part of the white British' ingroup. Consequently, the threat they pose often leads to their Muslimness being emphasised. This was, at times, contested, however, either through direct challenges, or by making the threat ambivalent by drawing on their whiteness.

AB  - This paper reports the findings of a study that aimed to identify the music beliefs and values of educators in early childhood education and care settings in Australia. The aims of the study were 2-fold: to adapt and pilot a survey of music beliefs and values which might be implemented subsequently nationally in childcare settings; and, secondly, to identify the music beliefs and values held by early childhood and care educators concerning music in children's learning. The research questions that guided this component of the study were: What is the profile of early childhood and care educators? What beliefs and values for music engagement are held by early childhood and care educators? What shapes early childhood and care educators'music beliefs and values? Findings indicated that educators' beliefs and values on all items are above the mid-point indicating overall positive attitudes toward music despite the majority having no formal qualifications in music or a history of instrumental performance and/ or singing. Given the overall positive attitudes toward music we suggest there is enormous potential within this population for further professional learning and development targeted at music and its potential wider benefits in young children's learning and lives.

AB  - Social psychological models of group identity and collective action should be particularly adept at providing psychological explanations for growing rates of populism in the Western World. Because populism tends to arise in times of societal shifts that reflect both economic and cultural changes, populist attitudes are likely grounded in perceptions of intergroup relations and collective attitudes. We surveyed 95 demonstrators at the 2016 Republican National Convention and 108 demonstrators at the Democratic National Convention. Results support the idea that relative anger prototypicality, in this case, the extent to which people believe that their own anger toward politicians is representative of most Americans' anger, predicts feelings of group-based relative deprivation. Importantly, these feelings of deprivation mediate the relationship between prototypical anger and populist attitudes. These findings provide a unique picture of current political engagement, motivated by feelings of shared anger and collective feelings of lacking representation and voice.

AB  - Using structural equation modeling, this study examined the effects of peer environments on collegiate interracial friendship and how such effects vary by students' race. The results show that the peer environment of Greek life mediated the relationship between structural diversity and interracial friendship in college, in that students attending institutions with greater structural diversity were less likely to frequently interact with peers from Greek life, which had a positive effect on interracial friendship. This mediation effect was consistent for all four racial groups of the study. This study also uncovers unique findings related to Latino/as and interracial friendship: that structural diversity has an indirect effect on interracial friendship via participation in ethnic student organizations for Latino/a students and that participation in ethnic student organizations is also directly and positively linked to interracial friendship for this group. The study discusses implications for understanding intergroup relations and patterns of interracial friendship.

AB  - We investigated the endorsement of an expanded construct of environmental justice (ExEJ) that includes the rights of nature, other species, and future generations. We contextualized this study in terms of the environmental challenges posed by hydraulic fracturing. We used structural equation modeling to test a model that hypothesized that attitudes toward fracking would mediate an endorsement of ExEJ. We tested multiple factors that research suggests contribute to those attitudes using a student and non-student sample from a state experiencing fracking activity. Results suggest that self-transcendent factors directly predicted ExEJ endorsement, while self-focus factors predicted positive attitudes toward fracking, and a varied set of factors predicted a negative fracking attitude. Attitudes had no direct effect on ExEJ. Patterns of result suggest self-transcendent factors and avenues for change facilitate ExEJ, while self-enhancement factors influence positive fracking attitudes. Interpretations of these patterns are offered.

AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

AB  - Democratic school climate, critical reflection, and student participation at school have been linked to the development of civic and political attitudes. The study aims to identify the contribution of these characteristics to the development of civic and political attitudes and their impact on students' participation (civic, political, activist, and lifestyle/online). Questionnaire data were collected in two waves with 1589 students from four European countries (Italy, Sweden, Germany, and the Czech Republic). Structural equation modelling tested the effects of school characteristics on different types of participation, mediated by institutional trust, political efficacy, and political interest. The results highlight the importance of opportunities for active involvement and critical reflection in fostering interest, efficacy, and all forms of participation activities. Democratic school climate was found to positively impact institutional trust and efficacy, but not participation. The findings highlight the need for a school environment that invites critical reflection and gives value to students' participation.

AB  - Cross-ethnic friendships offer a unique opportunity for improving intergroup relations and reduce prejudice, yet ethnic segregation of friendship networks is often seen as a major obstacle to the integration of immigrant students in educational contexts. This article examines the role of perspective-taking abilities and prejudice towards low social class peers on the probability of cross-ethnic friendships in a sample of 242 students from five multicultural classrooms in Chile (M-age = 12.3; SD = 0.69, 45% girls). It was expected that students who reported high levels of perspective-taking abilities and low levels of prejudice towards low social class peers were more likely to form and maintain cross-ethnic friendships. Longitudinal network analysis (RSiena) was used to examine these hypotheses, confirming the role of both variables in fostering (and reducing) friendships among Chilean and immigrant adolescents. Results are discussed in light of an intersectional framework between social class and ethnicity. Implications for social-emotional interventions in multicultural educational contexts are also discussed.

AB  - Background
   The COVID-19 outbreak raised questions about how people experience their mental health, quality of life (QoL), wellbeing and loneliness in the context of social distancing, and the use of social media during this time
   Aims
   To examine the experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and loneliness and use of social media among people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia.
   Methods
   A cross-country comparative survey of people living in Norway, USA, UK and Australia. Relevant statistical analyses were used to examine differences between the countries and to explore associations between demographic, mental health and psychosocial variables and use of social media.
   Results
   There were 3810 respondents from four countries, of which 50 - 74% showed a high level of emotional distress. The Norwegian population reported significantly better mental health, QoL and wellbeing and lower levels of loneliness compared to the other countries. High-frequent use of social media after the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with poorer mental- and psychosocial health.
   Conclusions
   The results suggest that the COVID-19 outbreak took a toll on people's experience of mental health, QoL, wellbeing and experienced loneliness, and high-frequent use of social media was associated with these factors.

AB  - Is a powerful person more or less generous than a powerless person in terms of charitable giving request? In this work, we argue that power's effect on charitable giving depends on donation target. Across two studies, having high power decreased donation to a specific person, whereas having high power increased donation to a charitable organization. Moreover, the effect of power on donation across donation targets was mediated by the felt social distance toward the population in need. We discuss the theoretical implications for contemporary debates about power's effects and practical implications of power for designing effective donation appeals.

AB  - Pandemics such as that of COVID-19 affect a relatively large number of people and impose new rules and social habits on the world population. Information about the pandemic is constant in the media. Moreover, social distancing has been adopted in Brazil to prevent the spread of COVID-19, which may have economic and psychosocial consequences. This study aimed to verify the factors associated with indicators of mental disorders symptoms in residents of Rio Grande do Sul during the initial period of the social distancing policy. The study was approved by CONEP. There were 799 participants, aged between 18 and 75 years (M = 36.56; SD = 12.88); 82.7% were women, who answered a sociodemographic questionnaire of social distancing and the Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20). The results indicated that having decreased income in the period, being part of the risk group and being more exposed to information about deaths and infected, are factors that can significantly harm mental health in this pandemic period. Investigating social determinants that contribute to greater vulnerability to the mental illness of the population is vital in the field of collective health for the planning of public actions and policies.

AB  - Quantified self refers to the process consumers collect, analyze to reflect, control, and optimize their behaviors, thus obtaining self-knowledge. Since the COVID-19 pandemic has changed our lives dramatically, this research aims to explore how mortality salience caused by COVID-19 affects people's quantified self behavior. The current study used an online survey and the experimental method to test multiple research hypotheses. The results indicated that mortality salience has a positive impact on quantified self; perceived control mediates the relationship between mortality salience and the quantified self, and social distance plays a moderating role between mortality salience and perceived control. The conclusions provide a new way to help people deal with anxiety and fear brought by the COVID-19, and enhance public health and well-being.

AB  - Despite the significant increase in the use of nanotechnology in academic research and commercial products over the past decade, there have been few studies that have explored scientists' perceptions and attitudes about the technology. In this article, we use survey data from the leading U.S. nano-scientists to explore their perceptions about two issues: the public communication of research findings and media coverage of nanotechnology, which serves as one relatively rapid outlet for public communication. We find that leading U.S. nano-scientists do see an important connection between the public communication of research findings and public attitudes about science. Also, there is a connection between the scientists' perceptions about media coverage and their views on the timing of public communication; scientists with positive attitudes about the media are more likely to support immediate public communication of research findings, while others believe that communication should take place only after research findings have been published through a peer-review process. We also demonstrate that journalists might have a more challenging time getting scientists to talk with them about nanotechnology news stories because nano-scientists tend to view media coverage of nanotechnology as less credible and less accurate than general science media coverage. We conclude that leading U.S. nano-scientists do feel a sense of responsibility for communicating their research findings to the public, but attitudes about the timing and the pathway of that communication vary across the group.

AB  - The Olympic Games are one of the most popular global mega-media events. However, the ways in which the opening of the 2012 Olympic Games in London were reported varied significantly from one country to another. In order to compare how different countries represented this event, we conducted a qualitative discourse analysis of three days of television news coverage from 10 channels in five countries: the United States, China, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom. We explored whether different locations, political systems, and television systems affect how the same event is reported. We found that while European public service broadcasters (BBC and ARD) were more serious, critical, and political than their commercial counterparts (ITV and RTL), the Japanese commercial broadcaster's coverage of the event was more critical than that of the public service broadcaster, which was popularized and nationalistic throughout. In China, the more market-oriented Dragon TV was more evaluative in its reporting than the state-run CCTV. NBC, which monopolized the broadcast rights in the United States, emphasized the universal values of the Olympics and avoided nationalism. In light of our results, future attention should be directed toward the role of commercial broadcasting in a contemporary globalized world in which ideological constellations are changing.

AB  - Purpose This paper investigates the use of Twitter for studying the social representations of different regions across the world towards new food trends. Design/methodology/approach A density-based clustering algorithm was applied to 7,014 tweets to identify regions of consumers sharing content about food trends. The attitude of their social representations was addressed with the sentiment analysis, and grid maps were used to explore subregional differences. Findings Twitter users have a weak, positive attitude towards food trends, and significant differences were found across regions identified, which suggests that factors at the regional level such as cultural context determine users' attitude towards food innovations. The subregional analysis showed differences at the local level, which reinforces the evidence that context matters in consumers' attitude expressed in social media. Research limitations/implications The social media content is sensitive to spatio-temporal events. Therefore, research should take into account content, location and contextual information to understand consumers' perceptions. The methodology proposed here serves to identify consumers' regions and to characterize their attitude towards specific topics. It considers not only administrative but also cognitive boundaries in order to analyse subsequent contextual influences on consumers' social representations. Practical implications The approach presented allows marketers to identify regions of interest and localize consumers' attitudes towards their products using social media data, providing real-time information to contrast with their strategies in different areas and adapt them to consumers' feelings. Originality/value This study presents a research methodology to analyse food consumers' understanding and perceptions using not only content but also geographical information of social media data, which provides a means to extract more information than the content analysis applied in the literature.

AB  - We investigated the role of self-motivated behaviour in promoting intergroup member contact for intergroup harmony. A multi-ethnic group of 68 freshmen students attending a Nigerian state university were participants (female = 43.8%; Mean age = 22.15 years, SD = 2.35 years; Igbo = 45.6%, Hausa/Fulani = 20.4%, Yoruba = 24.5%, and others = 9.5%). By religious affiliation, the students comprised Christians (62%) and Muslims (38%). The students took part in an intergroup contact learning assignment designed for them to interact with others outside their class cohort and from a different ethnic group to themselves. They completed measures of self-motivated behaviours defined by self-efficacy, self-interest, learning predisposition, as well as intergoup harmony. Tests of mediation revealed significant positive indirect effects of intergroup member contact on intergroup harmony through self-efficacy, self-interest, and learning behaviour. Self-motivated behaviour fully mediated the relationship between intergroup contact and intergroup harmony among students in Nigerian multi-ethnic settings. Self-motivated behaviour may facilitate peace-building and intergroup harmony, for management of intergroup relations, among Nigerian major ethnic groups premised on intergroup contact.

AB  - The spread of misinformation on the internet regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, such as unproven or fake cures, has been a serious concern. However, the extent to which social media usage affects individuals? health behavior, particularly when reliable information is scarce, is not well understood. This study evaluates the impact of social media usage on individuals? responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as demand for necessities and social distancing. We conduct an original online survey of 1804 Japanese respondents in March 2020. Japan is suitable because it confirmed COVID-19 cases earlier than most other countries. Scientific evidence about the coronavirus and protective measures was scarce in the initial pandemic phase, despite the spread of unconfirmed rumors. Our analysis focuses on the usage of Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram. We use the entropy balancing method to control for heterogeneity in observed characteristics between social media users and non-users. The results show that while users are more likely to maintain social distancing practices, they are also more likely to take measures whose reliability is not scientifically confirmed, such as eating fermented soybeans. Although previous studies emphasize the negative effects of social media, our results suggest that it has both bright and dark sides.

AB  - The present study examined the role of positive outcome expectancy in the relationship between peer/parental influence and Internet gaming addiction (IGA) among adolescents in Taiwan. Two thousand, one hundred and four junior high students completed the Chen Internet Addiction Scale for IGA, Parental Influence for IGA, peer influence for IGA, and Positive Outcome Expectancy of Internet Gaming Questionnaire. Results showed that the three types of peer influences (positive attitudes toward Internet gaming, frequency of Internet game use, and invitation to play) and positive outcome expectancy were significantly and positively correlated with IGA. Moreover, peer influence was also positively correlated with positive outcome expectancy. On the other hand, positive outcome expectancy and parental influences had a low correlation. Structural equation modeling analysis revealed that positive outcome expectancy did not mediate the relationship between either type of parental influences and IGA, and only the parent's invitation to play Internet games directly predicted IGA severity. However, peers' positive attitude or the frequency of peers' Internet game use positively predicted IGA and was fully mediated through positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming. In addition, the frequency of peers' invitation to play Internet games directly and indirectly predicted IGA severity through a partial mediation of positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming. The overall fit of the model was adequate and was able to explain 25.0 percent of the variance. The findings provide evidence in illuminating the role of peer influences and positive outcome expectancy of Internet gaming in the process of why adolescents may develop IGA.

AB  - Governments offer scholarships to foreign nationals expected to become influential in their home countries and shape public opinion to the benefit of their sponsor. This is known as the opinion leader' model. The histories of three British scholarship programs whose directors now subscribe to the opinion leader' model suggest they were actually set up for other reasons. Beliefs about what the programs are for have shifted toward the opinion leader' model even as they have continued to do the same things. The pattern of changing objectives seems to fit a Kingdonian model of the policy process.
   Many governments offer scholarships specifically to foreign citizens. In recent years both policymakers and academics have associated these scholarships with political influence, arguing that they generate sympathetic and influential alumni who support positive relationships between their home country and their sponsor. Digging deeper into the histories of several scholarship programs which are now being portrayed in this way shows they were actually set up for very different reasons. Explanations for why scholarships are being given to foreign citizens have changed over time, consistent with a Kingdonian model of the policy process. We need to be cautious about taking these claims at face value, an important reminder for foreign policy analysts more generally.

AB  - Objective: To measure highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI)-related knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAPs) among Cambodian women. Methods: This cross-sectional study selected 246 married women aged between 1855 years who had backyard poultry and lived at least one year in the areas of the survey through multi-stage cluster sampling. An average score of correct answers was generated to evaluate respondents' knowledge (Good/Poor), attitudes (Positive/Negative), and practices (Good/Bad). Results: We reported that about half of the respondents had good knowledge and good practices and four-fifth of them had positive attitudes towards HPAI. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated through a logistic regression model to explore contributing factors that raise their KAP levels. Most of the sources were significant in increasing knowledge of the respondent, like television (OR=1.6, 95% CI=1.02.7), radio (OR=2.5, 95% CI=1.34.9), leaflets/booklets (OR=2.1, 95% CI=1.23.9), school students (OR=18.4, 95% CI=2.4142.9), village health volunteers (OR=4.5, 95% CI=2.210.9) etc. Factors such as television (OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.16.4), leaflets/booklets (OR=2.6, 95% CI=1.45.1), and public health staff (OR=2.2, 95% CI=1.24.1) had similar influence on practices. Although, we found similar effect on raising the attitudes of the responded, it was not significant. Conclusions: We report a satisfactory level of positive attitudes, and moderate level of knowledge and practices related to HPAI among Cambodian women. Raising KAPs through television, radio and other medias may be more efficient than using usual information, education and communication materials to prevent HPAI.

AB  - Electronic Mediated Communication (EMC) has become highly prevalent in our daily lives. Many of the communication formats used in EMC are text-based (e.g., instant messaging), and users often include visual paralinguistic cues in their messages. In the current study, we examined the usage of two such cues - emoji and emoticons. Specifically, we compared self-reported frequency of use, as well as attitudes (6 bipolar items, e.g., "fun" vs. "boring") and motives for their usage (9 motives, e.g., "express how I feel to others"). We also examined these indicators according to age and gender. Overall, participants (N = 474, 72.6% women; M-age = 30.71, SD = 12.58) reported using emoji (vs. emoticons) more often, revealed more positive attitudes toward emoji usage, and identified more with motives to use them. Moreover, all the ratings were higher among younger (vs. older) participants. Results also showed that women reported to use emoji (but not emoticons) more often and expressed more positive attitudes toward their usage than men. However, these gender differences were particularly evident for younger participants. No gender differences were found for emoticons usage. These findings add to the emerging body of literature by showing the relevance of considering age and gender, and their interplay, when examining patterns of emoji and emoticons use.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the level of informed decision making in a randomized controlled trial comparing colonoscopy and CT-colonography for colorectal cancer screening.
   Methods: 8844 citizens aged 50-75 were randomly invited to colonoscopy (n = 5924) or CT-colonography (n = 2920) screening. All invitees received an information leaflet. Screenees received a questionnaire within 4 weeks before the planned examination, non-screenees 4 weeks after the invitation. A decision was categorized as informed when characterized by sufficient decision-relevant knowledge and consistent with personal attitudes toward participation in screening.
   Results: Knowledge and attitude items were completed by 1032/1276 colonoscopy screenees (81%), by 698/4648 colonoscopy non-screenees (15%), by 824/982 CT-colonography screenees (84%) and by 192/1938 CT-colonography non-screenees (10%). 1027 colonoscopy screenees (>99%) and 815 CT-colonography screenees (99%) had adequate knowledge; 915 (89%) and 742 (90%) had a positive attitude. 675 non-screenees invited to colonoscopy (97%) and 182 invited to CT-colonography (95%) had adequate knowledge; 344 (49%) and 94 (49%) expressed a negative attitude.
   Conclusion: A large majority of screenees made an informed decision on participation. Almost half of responding. non-screenees, made an uninformed decision, suggesting additional barriers to participation.
   Practice implications: Efforts to understand the additional barriers will create opportunities to facilitate informed participation to colorectal cancer screening. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined the relationship between religious orientation and death attitudes in Christian U.S. students and Muslim Turkish students. It also assessed whether meaning in life mediated these relationships. Multivariate statistics and path analyses were conducted to identify significant predictors of death attitudes in these groups. Intrinsic religiosity was more consistently associated with positive attitudes toward death than extrinsic religiosity, and these patterns remained consistent across groups. Meaning in life mediated some of these relationships, although not consistently. Evidence suggesting differential relationships between religiosity and death attitudes across groups was found, although the overall results suggest more similarities than differences.

AB  - This study investigates whether the declining economic performance and social status of traditional news media, which are two dimensions indicating the professional disruption of journalism, are associated with journalists' engagement in public relations (PR). The results of a cross-sectional survey reveal two paths to the PR-journalism boundary crossing, although the level of boundary crossing is overall controllable. First, economic disruption indirectly predicts journalists' engagement in media pitching and media event planning through their identification with colleagues who have engaged in PR. Second, perceived waning social status both directly and indirectly predicts their engagement in media pitching and media catching, with their disidentification with PR practitioners as a mediator in the indirect relationship. These findings suggest that, while professional disruption may induce journalists to seek more information subsidy, their professional identity can be a source of both resistance against and support for this trend. Theories on social identity and intergroup relations are adopted to explain this dilemma.

AB  - Background From 2015 to 2018, the Netherlands faced an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by serogroup W. To counter the rise in infections, the government introduced a catch-up menACWY vaccination campaign for teenagers in 2018 and 2019. The outbreak situation induced substantial media attention and a run on menACWY vaccines outside the vaccination campaign. This study aimed to gain insights into the dynamics of public perceptions of and responses to the outbreak and the menACWY vaccination, and into the media coverage about the outbreak. Methods Three repeated surveys (N = 1110) between 2017 and 2019 were sent to parents of teenagers invited for a menACWY catch-up vaccination, other parents, and individuals with no under-age children. These surveys assessed IMD risk perceptions, attitudes towards the menACWY vaccination, trust in involved institutions, and willingness to vaccinate with the menACWY vaccine. Changes in the public perceptions and responses were studied with linear multilevel regression analyses. In addition, 103 national newspaper articles from the period 2017-2019 were thematically coded with themes about IMD and the menACWY vaccination. Results The survey results showed clear increases in perceived IMD severity, positive attitude towards the menACWY vaccination, and willingness to vaccinate over time. Perceived IMD vulnerability remained low across all three waves, and trust in involved institutions increased slightly. Differences between the survey groups were limited. The newspaper articles discussed the rise in infections extensively, the disease symptoms, and the possible fatal outcome of IMD. In addition, while many articles discussed the menACWY vaccine shortage, few discussed the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. Conclusion The real-time insights into the interrelated dynamics of public perceptions, responses, and media coverage provide an integrated portrait of the social developments during this outbreak. The focus on IMD severity and the absence of doubt in the public discussion about vaccine safety may have played an important role in the societal response to this outbreak and the recommended vaccine.

A survey shows the motives for following political leaders on the social media platform and how followers' motives are associated with their demographics and political attitudes. Findings indicate that information/guidance motives are the most important for following political leaders on Instagram, with social utility being the next highest motive. Also, males use Instagram more for social utility purposes than females, and having an entertainment motive is related to being young. The results also provide insight into how the politically active can be more influential on Instagram.

AB  - Objective: Health misinformation on social media threatens public health. One question that could lend insight into how and through whom misinformation spreads is whether certain people are susceptible to many types of health misinformation, regardless of the health topic at hand. This study provided an initial answer to this question and also tested four hypotheses concerning the psychosocial attributes of people who are susceptible to health misinformation: (1) deficits in knowledge or skill, (2) preexisting attitudes, (3) trust in health care and/or science, and (4) cognitive miserliness. Method: Participants in a national U.S. survey (N = 923) rated the perceived accuracy and influence of true and false social media posts about statin medications, cancer treatment, and the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccine and then responded to individual difference and demographic questions. Results: Perceived accuracy of health misinformation was strongly correlated across statins, cancer, and the HPV vaccine (rs >= .70), indicating that individuals who are susceptible to misinformation about one of these topics are very likely to believe misinformation about the other topics as well. Misinformation susceptibility across all three topics was most strongly predicted by lower educational attainment and health literacy, distrust in the health care system, and positive attitudes toward alternative medicine. Conclusions: A person who is susceptible to online misinformation about one health topic may be susceptible to many types of health misinformation. Individuals who were more susceptible to health misinformation had less education and health literacy, less health care trust, and more positive attitudes toward alternative medicine.

AB  - Group-based emotions play an important role in helping people feel that they belong to their group. People are motivated to belong, but does this mean that they actively try to experience group-based emotions to increase their sense of belonging? In this investigation, we propose that people may be motivated to experience even group-based emotions that are typically considered unpleasant to satisfy their need to belong. To test this hypothesis, we examined people's preferences for group-based sadness in the context of the Israeli National Memorial Day. In two correlational (Studies 1a and 1b) and two experimental (Studies 2 and 3) studies, we demonstrate that people with a stronger need to belong have a stronger preference to experience group-based sadness. This effect was mediated by the expectation that experiencing sadness would be socially beneficial (Studies 1 and 2). We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding motivated emotion regulation and intergroup relations.

AB  - This study tested the relationships of individualism, power distance, and mastery orientation to 2 employee attitudes (organizational trust and organizational commitment) that are associated with employees' psychological benefits within the organization. Results from university employees (N = 706) showed that individualism negatively, whereas mastery positively, related to trust and commitment. Power distance positively related to trust only. The moderating role of mastery was also identified. These findings can help employment or organizational counselors to appreciate value-related factors that facilitate employees in psychologically integrating into the organization and to explore new ways for employers to foster employees' positive attitudes.

AB  - Using Cognitive Dissonance and Balance Theory, this study investigates factors that predict how and why MMO players inaccurately report their game playing time. It was hypothesized that players belonging to categories other than the stereotypical game player (e. g. younger, less educated, male) would be likely to underreport playing time. It was also hypothesized that those players who held less positive attitudes toward the game would be more likely to underreport their playing time. Comparing people's self-reported weekly usage of an MMO, EverQuest II, with their actual average weekly usage of the game, data showed that age, education, lack of enjoyment playing the game, and lack of an online sense of community predicted greater levels of underreporting.

AB  - Across one longitudinal and two cross-sectional surveys in Northern Ireland, we tested a model of intergroup relations in which out-group attitudes and behavioral tendencies are predicted by cross-group friendship and positive intergroup appraisals, mediated by intergroup emotions and out-group trust. In study 1, out-group friendship at time 1 predicted out-group trust at time 2 (one year later), controlling for prior out-group trust. In study 2, positive and negative intergroup emotions mediated the effects of friendship on positive and negative behavioral tendencies and attitudes. In study 3, a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that trust and emotions are distinct constructs with unique predictive contributions. We then tested a model in which cross-group friendship predicted intergroup emotions and trust through intimate self-disclosure in out-group friendships. Our findings support an integration of an intergroup emotions framework with research highlighting the importance of cross-group friendship in fostering positive intergroup outcomes.

AB  - In North America, Asians reliably report higher levels of stigma toward people with depression than do Europeans. Possible methods of reducing this discrepancy have rarely been explored. Asian undergraduate students (n = 132) were presented with one of four antistigma videos with two actresses: one portraying a student with depression and the other a professor. The videos used the concept of social proof, presenting either positive or negative descriptive norms, to effect change in stigma, measured by social distance. It was hypothesized that the positive descriptive norms intervention would show significantly greater positive change in social distance compared with the negative descriptive norms intervention. All videos were effective in reducing preferred social distance toward people with depression relative to the control condition. The effectiveness of the positive descriptive norm video was mediated through descriptive norms and self-efficacy. The effectiveness of the negative descriptive norm video was mediated through injunctive norms and perceived value of support. The findings can help guide interventions that aim to encourage social engagement with people with depression among Asian student populations. Manipulating social norms and increasing self-efficacy may be especially effective.

AB  - Introduction Exposure to media content can shape public opinions about tobacco. In early September 2019, the outbreak of e-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) became headline news in the United States.
   Methods In August and September 2019, we conducted two cross-sectional online surveys with current and former smokers assessing attitudes and beliefs about e-cigarettes. Study one (n = 865) was collected before the EVALI outbreak was widely covered and study two (n = 344) was collected after the outbreak had become nation-wide news. We examined differences in perceptions and beliefs between time points.
   Results E-cigarette harm perceptions increased between study one (mean = 2.67) and study two (mean = 2.90, p < .05). Ever-users of e-cigarettes largely account for this change. Endorsement of the belief that e-cigarettes were risky and more likely to cause lung damage compared to cigarettes increased between studies (p < .05). Seventy eight percent of participants at study two were aware of the vaping illness story. Being aware of the story was associated with more endorsement of the belief that e-cigarettes were risky to use, but not that using e-cigarettes would make the participant more likely to get damaged lungs.
   Discussion When the stories about the health and safety of tobacco products dominate the public information environment, it presents an opportunity to change beliefs that are frequently targeted by paid health campaigns. Changes in participant's perceptions of e-cigarettes were associated with coverage of this large news story, underscoring the importance of working to ensure that coverage is a scientifically accurate as possible.

AB  - Genetic analysis has become integral to many large cohort studies. However, little is known about longitudinal cohort study participants' attitudes toward genetics and genetic testing. We analyzed data from a survey of participants in the Jackson Heart Study (n = 960), Framingham Heart Study (n = 955), and Framingham Heart Study-Omni Cohort (n = 160). Based on a three-question attitude scale, most participants had positive attitudes toward genetic testing (median score = 4.3-5/5). Participants were also asked to select words to describe their attitudes toward genetics. More respondents endorsed the positive words "hopeful" (60%-70%), "optimistic" (44%-64%), "enthusiastic" (35%-43%), or "excited" (28%-30%) than the negative words "cautious" (35%-38%), "concerned" (25%-55%), "worried" (6%-13%), "pessimistic" (2%-5%), or "horrified" (1%-5%). Characteristics associated with favorable attitudes were greater genetics knowledge, higher subjective numeracy, experience with genetic testing, less frequent religious attendance, and not being employed. These findings demonstrate variation in attitudes even among participants in long-standing cohort studies, indicating a need for ongoing participant engagement and education.

AB  - The migrant caravan is comprised of thousands of people traveling from Central America to the Mexico-U.S. border seeking refuge from their home countries. In news coverage, images of the caravan regularly portray large groups of immigrants walking toward the border. What are the consequences of this depiction on attitudes toward immigration? We suggest that images of groups of immigrants, in contrast with images of individual immigrants, will tend to decrease support for immigration. In 2019, we preregistered and ran a web-based survey experiment in the United States in which respondents read a news story with either an image of immigrants in a crowd setting, an image of an individual immigrant, or a control condition. The group treatment produces no systematic increase in anti-immigrant sentiment relative to the control. However, we do find differences in the group and individual treatments for respondents who are high in threat sensitivity. Findings are discussed as they relate to recent work on the roles of both fear and person positivity in attitudes about immigration, as well as the potential importance of editorial choices in the portrayal of immigration to the United States.

AB  - Face-to-face (F2F) embodied interaction is the initial ingredient of interaction ritual (IR), the buildup of shared emotion, mutual focus of attention, and rhythmic entrainment that produces interpersonal solidarity. What happens when a natural experiment (the COVID-19 epidemic) prevents most F2F encounters or limits the modes of micro-interactional communication by masking? The paper examines evidence of the effects of masking and social distancing on public behavior, family life, remote schooling and remote work, prohibition of large audiences and assemblies, and attempts to substitute non-embodied electronic media. Most effects are consistent with IR theory predictions.

AB  - Intergroup changes occur often between subgroups who are asymmetric in status (e.g., size, power, prestige), with important consequences for social identification, especially among the members of lower-status groups. Mergers offer an example of such changes, when subgroups (merger partners) merge into a common, superordinate group (post-merger group). Lower-status subgroups frequently perceive they are less represented in the post-merger group, therefore committing less to the changes a merger implies. Five studies offered an intergroup relations' perspective on mergers (N's = 479, 150, 266, 113, and 229, respectively), examining how functional indispensability (instrumental contribution of the ingroup) positively influences perceptions of representativeness in the post-merger group (relative ingroup prototypicality), which, in turn, affect post-merger identification and, finally, change commitment. Additionally, the role of cognitive information processing (heuristic vs. systematic) on prototypicality was explored. Results suggest that functional indispensability impacts relative ingroup prototypicality (Studies 1-5), and this may be moderated by information processing (Study 2). Moreover, prototypicality and identification with the superordinate post-merged group mediated the effect of functional indispensability on change commitment (Studies 1-3). These findings provide important theoretical insights into prototypicality perceptions held by lower-status merger partners and minority groups in general, by identifying functional indispensability as a source of prototypicality other than relative status. In addition, by proposing a functional approach to the relations between social groups, these findings suggest better practices for managing structural changes, such as combining sources of strategic/functional and identity fit when announcing an intergroup change.

AB  - Background: The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has become a major threat to human life around the world. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding COVID-19 among people with chronic diseases at the outpatient departments in Ho Chi Minh City.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out between February and March 2020 using a convenience sampling strategy in three hospitals in Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) via the use of a structured self-administered questionnaire. Factors relating to practices, prevalence ratio (PR), and 95% confidence interval were estimated by using the Poisson regression with robust options. P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically different.
   Results: A total of 522 participants had a mean age of 51.5 +/- 10.6 years. Most of them reported seeing information regarding the COVID-19 pandemic (93.7%) via television and social media (72.8% and 62.1%, respectively). Just over two-thirds of the participants (68.4%) answered with sufficient knowledge of COVID-19. Most respondents had a positive attitude toward COVID-19 (90.8%), although some misconceptions existed. Almost over three-fourths of them (77.2%) maintained good practices for prevention. The rate of good practices in those who had sufficient knowledge was 1.24 times greater than that among those who had insufficient knowledge (PR 1.24, 95% CI: 1.10-1.41, P<0.05). Also, the rate of good practices in males was lower than that of females (PR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.83-0.99, P<0.05).
   Conclusion: There still exists an amount of insufficient knowledge and negative attitude regarding COVID-19, which may be barriers to good prevention practices among chronic illness patients. Education programs need to continue via television and social media and emphasize that people with chronic diseases are more likely to experience severe symptoms, including death from COVID-19. Additionally, management authorities should prolong specific policies to protect the more vulnerable in our community.

AB  - Prostate cancer (PC) screening aims to detect PC in early stages, amenable to curative treatment and reduction in disease morbidity and mortality. However, PC screening may be associated with overdiagnosis and complications of unnecessary treatment for indolent disease. Therefore, careful patient selection for PC screening is critical to avoid overestimation and missed diagnosis. The aim of this study was to assess physicians' knowledge and attitude towards early detection of PC in Jordan and whether their knowledge is an important predictor of their attitude. An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data on demographics, knowledge, and attitude of physicians regarding early detection of PC. The participants' responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression. Around 296 physicians agreed to participate in this study. Most respondents were males (75.7%), residents (34%), practiced medicine more than 15 years (29%) and graduated (81.4%) from local universities. Surprisingly, only 28.4% recognized PC as a non-self-detected disease and less than one-half (48.6%) were aware that PC screening tests are not enough to exclude a diagnosis of PC. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 59%. Around two-thirds of participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of PC (median attitude POMP score was 66%). Higher attitude scores were significantly associated with younger age, those working in private hospitals, and those having higher knowledge POMP score (P < .05). This study highlighted that most physicians demonstrated a positive attitude towards PC screening but with moderate level of knowledge that is considered an important predictor of their attitude towards PC early detection. Thus, improving knowledge and awareness of physicians should be considered as a strategy to improve their attitude towards prostate screening practices and informing men of the importance of regular screening.

AB  - Play in work, as one specific type of work designs, is regarded as the possible solution to experienced burnout and could bring the desirable outcomes to organizations. Drawing on Affective Events Theory (AET), we argued that workplace events (such as play) cause emotional reactions on the part of employees (i.e., burnout), which in turn influence workplace attitudes and behaviors (i.e., innovation behaviors). A total of 439 employees completed surveys, and the results showed that play in work positively relates to innovation behaviors. We also examined individual's attitude toward workplace fun to further understand the impact of individual differences on the relationship between play in work and their feelings and subsequent behaviors. We found that the positive attitude toward fun moderated the indirect relationship between play in work and innovation behaviors via experienced burnout. Based on AET, our results showed that play in work could reduce employees' experienced burnout which in turn lead to their innovation behaviors. Such an effect of play in work are stronger when an individual has more positive attitude toward fun at work. Practically, it is suggested that play in work would contribute to favorable outcomes in the workplace, but managers should pay attention to individual differences in attitude toward workplace fun to ensure the maximum benefit of play.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (hereafter COVID-19) was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. People were admitted to hospitals complaining of fever, fatigue, cough, and difficulty breathing. Consequently, the strategy being adopted to limit the spread of COVID-19 is to encourage people in society to follow preventive measures. We aimed to estimate how the knowledge of and compliance with safe distancing measures affected the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in Saudi Arabia during Holy Ramadan. A cross-sectional survey was implemented in the central regions of Saudi Arabia from 24th of April to 22nd May to coincide with Ramadan. The study was conducted using a Google forum distributed through social media. Participants were recruited through convenience sampling of the Saudi population. In total, 1515 participants completed the survey. A significant difference between males and females was observed in answering questions about committing to: not attending gatherings, keeping a safe distance, not making physical contact, and staying at home during partial lockdown. In general, participants in our study demonstrated excellent adherence to all social distance measures, considered essential for limiting the spread and progression of COVID-19. However, attitudes regarding reduced physical contact was poor in the Makkah region, which necessitates greater efforts to educate and inform people about the associated risks.

AB  - Background Social distancing presents a significant obstacle for relationships and threatens mental health. Identifying maladaptive, voluntary coping strategies may inform how to maintain interpersonal relationships and mental health during quarantine. Co-ruminating with peers on negative events, moods and fears has adjustment trade-offs of increasing depression and anxiety risk while also enhancing friendship quality. Similarly, social media use is associated with social benefits and risk to mental health. We extend prior research by examining whether co-ruminating on COVID-19, social media use, and social media use focused on COVID-19 during social isolation was associated with heightened depression and anxiety symptoms but also lower loneliness and higher social support during initial lockdown measures in the USA. Methods Adults were recruited through social media (n = 345) to complete self-report surveys on co-rumination, social media use, social distancing, social support from March-May 2020. During this cross-sectional assessment, in addition to completing surveys on current depressive symptoms and state and health anxiety, participants also provided retrospective report of their perceived health anxiety levels six months prior. Results Co-ruminating on COVID-19 with peers and greater time on social media focused on COVID-19 predicted perceived increases in health anxiety and were also associated with higher depressive symptoms and state anxiety, even after controlling for significant demographic predictors. Further, in the context of social distancing, both interaction strategies failed to confer social benefits. Conclusions Results have direct implications for maintaining psychosocial health during social distancing restrictions. Adults may modify how they engage with peers by limiting COVID-19 content on social media and COVID-19 discussion.

AB  - We sought to examine how the near-lockdown measures, announced by the Israeli government in an effort to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, impacted the self-rated health (SRH), health behaviors, and loneliness of people with chronic illnesses. An online cross-sectional survey was carried out about one month (20-22 April 2020) after the Israeli government reinforced the severe social distancing regulations, among a convenience sample of 315 participants (60% women) with chronic conditions (27% metabolic, 17% cardiovascular, 21% cancer/autoimmune, 18% orthopedic/pain, 12% mental-health). Results suggested that about half of the participants reported a decline in physical or mental SRH, and as many as two-thirds reported feeling lonely. A significant deterioration in health behaviors was reported, including a decrease in vegetable consumption (p= 0.008) and physical activity (p< 0.001), an increase in time spent on social media (p< 0.001), and a perception among about half of the participants that they were eating more than before. Ordinal regression suggested that a decline in general SRH was linked with female gender (p= 0.016), lack of higher education (p= 0.015), crowded housing conditions (p= 0.001), longer illness duration (p= 0.010), and loneliness (p= 0.008). Findings highlight the important role of loneliness in SRH during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Future studies are warranted to clarify the long-term effects of social-distancing and loneliness on people with chronic illnesses.

TI  - Knowledge and attitude toward hemoglobinopathies premarital screening program among unmarried population in western Saudi Arabia
T2  - SAUDI MEDICAL JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - Objectives: To assess the knowledge and attitude toward hemoglobinopathies premarital screening (PMS) program among unmarried population in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 1039 unmarried males and females from the general population who fulfilled the eligibility criteria. Data was collected from July-December 2017, using an electronic questionnaire to assess the socio-demographic data, knowledge and attitudes of the participants regarding PMS.
   Results: Approximately half of the participants had poor knowledge scores (51.1%), while 28.4% of them had fair and 20.5% had good scores. Individuals with an educational level of "university degree and above" had significantly higher knowledge than those with lower educational levels. Furthermore, 60.4% of the participants had a positive attitude toward PMS. The data was analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 21 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA); and a Chi-squared test was used for comparisons between proportions and a p-value <= 0.05 was considered significant.
   Conclusion: Participants showed a lack of knowledge regarding PMS but they had a positive attitude towards the program. More efforts are required to raise awareness in the public regarding PMS, via social media and educational lectures in schools and universities. Additionally, early genetic screening may help improve test acceptance and higher impact.

AB  - Background: The importance of net durability and the average useful life of a net is increasingly recognized as one of the critical factors that determine how often nets need to be replaced. A study to assess the effect of a net care and repair behaviour change communication (BCC) programme on net durability was conducted in one district in Eastern Uganda with a district in a neighbouring region serving as a comparison. Both districts had received LLINs in September of 2012.
   Methods: The intervention was comprised of radio programmes, school and community events. Two-stage cluster sampling household surveys to assess net condition, exposure to BCC messages, and attitudes towards net care and repair were conducted in both districts at baseline (2-3 months post net distribution) and endline (20-21 months post distribution). Net condition was assessed using the proportionate hole index, with nets being classified as either serviceable or too torn.
   Results: The intervention led to an additional 31.2 % increased exposure to net care and repair messages in the intervention district. Respondents in the intervention district had a more positive attitude towards net care and repair (32 % of respondents were classified as having a very positive attitude compared to 10 % in the comparison district), which was positively associated with the number of channels through which messages had been received (P < 0.001). Nets belonging to respondents with a very positive attitude were more often categorized as serviceable (80.2 %) compared to respondents with a poor/average attitude (66.4 %; odds ratio: 2.05, P = 0.028); however, this was only observed for the net brand with the greater physical integrity. Additionally, socio-economic status was a significant predictor of net condition. Although nets in the intervention district had significantly more repairs done per net, the act of repairing alone did not improve net condition.
   Conclusions: In conclusion, the evaluation showed that the BCC programme resulted in improved knowledge and attitudes towards care and repair, which impacted positively on net condition. Repairs alone were not sufficient to improve net condition. Additional research on which care behaviours and attitudes are most associated with improved net condition would help BCC planners hone their campaigns.

AB  - This paper investigates gender differences in political participation across 10 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region using data from the World Values Survey (2010-2014). A distinction is made between two different participation types, institutional and non-institutional. We use an ordered logit model to evaluate whether the gender gap in both forms is mediated by demographic and attitudinal controls and assess whether variables influencing participation affect men and women differently. We find that most socioeconomic resources and political attitudes are correlated with higher levels of participation. However, the analysis reveals a persistent gender gap that can be generalized to the entire spectrum of engagement in the MENA, with larger gaps for less institutionalized forms.

AB  - Objectives: Patient-centered-care (PCC) attitudes are important to enhance PCC behavior, but research on perceptions and attitudes that contribute to PCC attitudes is limited. We tested a new model, assessing whether the association between self-efficacy and PCC attitudes is mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Furthermore, we assessed medical-school-stage and gender differences in these variables.
   Methods: Medical/dentistry students (N = 653) completed self-reported questionnaires. Analyses were performed using Pearson's-correlations, PROCESS macro, and independent samples t-tests.
   Results: The association between communication self-efficacy and PCC attitudes was completely mediated by communication and empathy attitudes. Students in clinical years had more positive attitudes toward PCC and empathy, and higher communication self-efficacy. Females had more positive attitudes toward PCC, communication, and empathy.
   Conclusions: The results emphasize the importance of communication self-efficacy and the mediating role of communication and empathy attitudes in enhancing PCC attitudes. This highlights the need to focus on learners' affective matter (what they feel/think) about their competencies and attitudes.
   Practice implications: Educational interventions should improve understanding of the benefits of applying good communication skills, of learning the importance of empathy and its relevance to patient care, and strengthening students' confidence in applying these skills. Attention to these is important for enhancing students' PCC attitudes. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We conducted an online survey with 1369 US adults randomly drawn from the national panel of Qualtrics. The results show that perceived contingency plays a crucial role in predicting the adoption of AI-powered news platforms, showing a significant direct effect and an indirect effect mediated by enhanced user engagement experience and positive attitude. Furthermore, the TAM variables are still important in predicting adoption behavior.

AB  - Purpose: Self-efficacy belief procures teachers to root for each other's development in some issues such as ameliorating new methods to conduct much more effective teaching. A school with a high level of self-efficacy teachers makes a great contribution in order to corroborate self-efficacy perceptions of students. When examining it on a model with many attitudinal variables, self-efficacy belief, an important concept in terms of education quality, has been deemed significant so as to propound the effects of self-efficacy more clearly. This study aimed to determine the relationship between self-efficacy and job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement.
   Research Method: 321 teachers from 33 schools that were selected randomly with the cluster sampling method from the middle schools in the province of Hatay city center in the 2017-2018 academic year have composed the sampling of this study.
   Findings: The more teachers' self-efficacy beliefs increased, the more their job satisfaction, organizational commitment, motivation and job involvement increased. Both job satisfaction and organizational commitment partially mediated the relationship between teachers' sense of self-efficacy and motivation. Self-efficacy beliefs positively affected teachers' job involvement through the full mediation effect of job satisfaction and motivation Organizational commitment and motivation fully mediated the relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and job involvement.
   Implications for Research and Practice:It is crucial for school administrators to contribute to amend and strengthen self-efficacy perceptions of teachers if they hope teachers to take positive attitudes towards their work much more frequently and to take the edge off negative attitudes.

AB  - Introduction
   From the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, public health officials have sought to develop evidence-based messages to reduce COVID-19 transmission by communicating key information to media outlets and the public. We describe the development of an interdisciplinary rapid message testing model to quickly create, test, and share messages with public health officials for use in health campaigns and policy briefings.
   Methods
   An interdisciplinary research team from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill assembled in March 2020 to assist the state health department in developing evidence-based messages to influence social distancing behaviors in the state. We developed and iteratively executed a rapid message testing model; the components of the 4-step model were message creation, survey development, survey administration, and analysis and presentation to health department officials. The model was executed 4 times, each during a 7-day period in April and May, and each subsequent survey included new phrasing and/or messaging informed by the previous week's survey. A total of 917 adults from North Carolina participated in the 4 surveys.
   Results
   Survey participants rated messages focused on protecting oneself and others higher than messages focused on norms and fear-based approaches. Pairing behaviors with motivations increased participants' desire to social distance across all themes and subgroups. For example, adding "Protect your grandmother, your neighbor with cancer, and your best friend with asthma," to messaging received a 0.9-point higher score than the base message, "Stay 6 feet apart from others when out in public."
   Practice Implications
   Our model to promote social distancing in North Carolina during the COVID-19 pandemic can be used for rapid, iterative message testing during public health emergencies.

AB  - What Is Race? Evidence from Scientists (1952) is a picture book for schoolchildren published by UNESCO as part of its high-profile campaign on race. The 87-page, oblong, soft-cover booklet contains bold, semi-abstract, pared-down images accompanied by text, devised (so it declared) to make scientific concepts more easily intelligible to the layman'. Produced by UNESCO's Department of Mass Communication, the picture book represents the organization's early-postwar confidence in the power of scientific knowledge as a social remedy and diplomatic tool. In keeping with a significant component of the race campaign, What Is Race? presented genetics as the route to an enlightened, scientific, non-prejudiced understanding of race. This article seeks to explain the book's management, aesthetics and framing in the context of postwar disciplinary and international politics. Viewing UNESCO's race campaign as a high point for an internationalist ideology of mass education, this article also analyses the visual and literary arguments of What Is Race? and proposes that the enduring image of genetics as technical and neutral knowledge was in part shaped by UNESCO's efforts to communicate scientific authority to an apparently popular' audience.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The emergence of the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) and the measures implemented to curb its spread may have deleterious effects on mental health. Older adults may be at increased risk for adverse psychosocial outcomes because opportunities to remain socially connected have diminished. Research is needed to better understand the impact of pandemic-related stress on mental health. The purpose of this study is 3-fold: (a) to examine the influences of COVID-19 pandemic-related stress on depression, anxiety, and loneliness; (b) to assess the mediating role of coping style and social support; and (c) to investigate whether these relationships vary across age.
   Research Design and Methods: Participants (N = 1,318) aged 18-92 years completed an online survey assessing pandemic-related stress, mental health, social support, coping, and their experiences with social distancing, during the initial implementation of social distancing measures in the United States.
   Results: Social support and coping style were found to relate to psychosocial outcomes. Avoidant coping was the strongest mediator of the relationship between pandemic-related stress and psychosocial outcomes, particularly depression. Avoidant coping more strongly mediated the relationship between stress and depression in younger adults compared to older adults.
   Discussion and Implications: Results were consistent with the stress and coping framework and recent work highlighting older adults' resilience during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings highlight the associations between positive coping behaviors and psychosocial well-being and indicate that older adults may use unique adaptive mechanisms to preserve well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objectives. To determine the attitudes of patients toward long-term opioid therapy (LtOT) and the potential risk of misuse/abuse in patients with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP).
   Design. Prospective, descriptive epidemiological study.
   Setting. Multidisciplinary tertiary care pain center within the Montreal University Health Center.
   Subjects. Patients who had had at least one visit at least one year prior to the invitation.
   Methods. We used four questionnaires: demographic questionnaire, the Drug Attitude Inventory Modified (DAI-M), the Opioid Risk Tool (ORT), and the Screening Tool for Addiction Risk (STAR). All questionnaires were administered in their validated French version.
   Results. Three hundred seventy patients completed questionnaires. The response rate was 79.26%. Of those who responded, 61.62% women and 38.38% men, the mean age was 57 years. The patients had been treated with LtOT for an average of 6.31 years, and the median dose per day in morphine equivalents was 48.21mg. The DAI-M showed that 32.16% had a positive attitude toward opioids, 39.73% had a negative attitude, and 22.16% had a neutral attitude. The ORT questionnaire demonstrated that 86.2% of the patients were at low risk of abuse/misuse, 13.2% were at moderate risk, and only 0.54% were at high risk. The STAR questionnaire showed that 4.2% had a low risk of abuse/misuse.
   Conclusions. Despite public opinion, patients treated with LtOT for CNCP and followed in a tertiary care pain center are at low risk for opioid misuse/abuse. We need to refine the way of prescribing opioids, should be selective with our patients, and should relive their pain adequately. Vargas-Schaffer and Cogan

A survey-based study focusing on the impact of the shopping mall GIV on shopper behavior while considering the mediating role of shoppers' emotional states is reported. Results indicate a direct impact of positive attitudes towards color schemes, mall lighting, scent and temperature on shopper satisfaction and/or the desire to stay at the mall. Regarding the effect of emotional states, pleasure and arousal mediate the relation between several variables and the studied outcomes. Implications for theory and retailers are discussed.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The robotic surgery and procedures are increasing worldwide. It is unknown whether medical students are well prepared for their future exposure to such technology.
   OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the knowledge and attitude of medical students from Saudi Arabia (SA) towards the robotic surgery.
   METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional survey of medical students at different colleges of medicine in SA. A web-based self-administered questionnaire using google forms was completed over a 2-month period starting on June 2021. Comparison between those with and without background about robotic surgery was performed.
   RESULTS: A total of 239 medical students from both governmental (46%) and private colleges (54%) responded to the questionnaire. 51.9% were interested in the surgical field and 37.7% considered themselves tech-savvy persons. Only (22.6%) had previous background about robotic surgery mainly from internet. Many (63.2%) showed positive attitude towards robotic surgery and expected that using robots will improve surgical outcomes. 48.5% of the students expected that patients in SA will not accept the robotic surgeries. Some (51.1%) concerned that robots could replace the surgeons and could make them less professional. Many believed that SA should invest and expand the robotic surgeries (69.1%). Students with background in robotic surgery had significantly younger median age (p < 0.030), earlier academic years (p < 0.001), higher GPA (p < 0.025), and more tech-savvy personality (p < 0.000) compared to those without background.
   CONCLUSION: Most medical students are unaware of robotic surgery, but they have positive attitude with some concerns. Young students who consider themselves tech-savvy persons are in a better position, but they access their knowledge from internet rather than from their medical education. Medical curricula and residency training program should take these findings into consideration for preparing the future surgeons in SA.

AB  - Few studies have empirically examined how media stereotypes of Muslims influence Americans' support for public policies exclusively harming Muslims. Across three studies, we tested the short-term and long-term effects of news portraying Muslims as terrorists on Americans' support for public policies harming Muslims domestically and internationally. Study 1 revealed that exposure to news portraying Muslims as terrorists is positively associated with support for military action in Muslim countries. Study 2 revealed that exposure to news portraying Muslims as terrorists is positively associated with support for public policies that harm Muslims domestically and internationally; this effect was fully mediated by perceptions of Muslims as aggressive. Experimental results from Study 3 revealed that exposing participants to negative Muslim media footage, relative to neutral or no-video footage, increased perceptions of Muslims as aggressive, increased support for harsh civil restrictions of Muslim Americans, and increased support for military action in Muslim countries. Exposure to positive Muslim footage yielded opposite results. We discuss the importance of media in exacerbating aggressive attitudes and public policies in the context of intergroup relations.

AB  - Though the contemporary media environment is filled with many different sources disseminating communications about science-including journalists, politicians and opinion leaders, and researchers-few studies have examined how messages about science communicated by different sources directly influence audience opinion about scientific research itself. This experiment (N = 170) used stimuli articles that reflected different presentation sources (3: political/public relations/researcher) and types of science research (2: "hard"/"soft") to examine effects on people's attitudes toward the featured research project's (a) utility and (b) worthiness of federal grant funding, while controlling for individual differences in political attitudes and interest in science. Overall, political-source messages suppressed ratings of the project's worthiness of funding and utility, and while messages from the researcher source produced greater utility ratings compared to the public relations source for soft science projects, this pattern was reversed for hard science research. Additionally, different sources influenced people's comprehension of articles they read. We interpret these results within the larger landscape of science communication and conclude with brief practical recommendations for those engaging in science communication.

AB  - There are worldwide concerns about the rise of White nationalism and its implications for intergroup relations in multicultural societies. Social media, in particular, has allowed far-right groups to easily share their perspectives with and influence others in support of their ideologies. Yet, few studies have empirically examined what psychological factors are discussed within this content to motivate collective action. A quantitative content analysis of 100 White nationalist videos on YouTube reveals that social outgroups (Muslims, immigrants, feminists) are frequently discussed as threats to Whites' status. Not only were calls for collective action discussed in at least 12% of videos, themes surrounding White identity and injustice faced by Whites were often underlying these calls, consistent with the theoretical propositions of the Social Identity Model of Collective Action. These results are novel as they identify psychological mechanisms referenced in White nationalist social media that motivate collective actions among White Americans.

AB  - Previous research found support for an association between exposure to alcohol-related media content and alcohol attitudes, intentions and behavior. Nevertheless, research on what makes young people susceptible to the occurrence of this relationship is scarce. The current study examined the behavioral activation (BAS) and inhibition system (BIS) as moderators of the relationship between soap opera viewing and alcohol attitudes. A cross-sectional survey was carried out among a sample of 922 adolescents (M-age=14.96years, SD=.85, 56% girls). Regression analyses showed no association between total television viewing and alcohol attitudes, but did confirm that soap opera viewing is associated with positive attitudes towards alcohol use. Moderation analyses indicated that BAS did not moderate this relationship, while BIS did; the relationship between soap opera viewing and positive attitudes toward alcohol was only significant for adolescents with a low BIS-profile. These results provide support for the premise that an elevated BIS protects adolescents from the effect of soap opera viewing frequency on their alcohol attitudes.

AB  - This study tests two serial models of intergroup contact in intergroup relations between users of Spanish public libraries and the directionality of the contact-prejudice relationship. Participants were selected in libraries that meet IFLA Guidelines in Barcelona (N-Spaniards = 138 and N-Moroccans = 89) and libraries that do not meet these guidelines in Almeria (N-Spaniards = 116 and N-Moroccans = 100). They responded to a survey about the quantity of intergroup contact, anxiety, ethnocultural empathy, outgroup knowledge and prejudice. Several serial mediation analyses reveal a model where the indirect effect of quantity of contact in the library on prejudice was mediated by intergroup anxiety and ethnocultural empathy in Moroccans in Almeria and Spaniards and Moroccans in Barcelona, and it found that the direction of this relationship is from contact to attitudes, but not attitudes to contact. These results show that the mediating power of affective variables is stronger than that of cognitive variables. Explanations about the absence of significant results in Spaniards in the Almeria group are provided.

AB  - Whereas previous research has commonly studied the effects of perspective-taking for harmless targets, we examined whether the effect of perspective-taking might extend to a violent outgroup target. That is, our target not only held members of the adversary group responsible for his plight but also issued a severe threat to them (suicide bombing). We report findings from two studies that were conducted within the intergroup relations between Israelis and Palestinians, defined by a prolonged and violent conflict. Study 1 found that perspective-taking with a radicalised and threatening Palestinian target could successfully be induced among Israeli participants and, as a result, led to their improved motivation to forgive the target. Study 2 directly manipulated threat in addition to perspective-taking. Irrespective of the presence of threat, perspective-taking led to improved motivation to forgive the target as well as to increase interpersonal liking for the target. Increased liking fully mediated the effect of perspective-taking on forgiveness. Theoretical and practical implications of this research are discussed.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this article is to determine knowledge level and perception about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among people with diabetes. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 268 diabetic subjects from April 2020 to October 2020 at the outpatient department of Baqai Institute of Diabetology and Endocrinology, Karachi, Pakistan. A series of questions regarding knowledge and perception about COVID-19 were asked, and participants' demographic characteristics and source of information regarding COVID-19 were recorded and analyzed. Results: Among 268 participants, 59.7% had diabetes for more than 5 years. More than half of the subjects had heard about COVID-19 on television (63.8%). The majority of subjects had information about symptoms of COVID-19, including fever (92.2%), dry cough (79.9%), flu (78%), and shortness of breath (52.6%). Most of the participants had knowledge about preventive measures for COVID-19 such as wearing a face mask (77.6%), washing hands frequently with soap (72.8%), using hand sanitizer (72%), social distancing (47.4%), isolation and hygiene (38.8%), and quarantining (32.1%). However, less than half of the participants knew the correct meanings of social distancing (40.3%), isolation (29.1%), and quarantine (22.4%). Conclusion: Overall, most of the participants had information about common symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, dry cough, flu, and shortness of breath as they had heard about COVID-19 on television, at office, radio, and their living area. The government has taken effective measures in the prevention of COVID-19. Still, there remains a need for public awareness campaigns to combat the spread of disease.

AB  - The need for interaction that arose given the social distancing imposed on people by governments during the COVID-19 has increased the use of social media (SM). The current study distinguishes between two different patterns of SM use: problematic and intensive, and examines the impact of each specific type of SM on social and mental aspects (i.e., social support, loneliness, and life satisfaction). The sample included 363 higher education students. Data were gathered during a second lockdown using Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modeling. The model indicated two different trajectories corresponding to the two types of SM users: Intensive users reported having more family support, whereas problematic users tended to feel lonely, reported having low life satisfaction, and had less support from friends. This study may allude to the possible positive role of SM use, especially during social distancing, in alleviating social and mental burdens in times of crisis.

AB  - Objectives
   With the increasing severity of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, it is essential that dental health care professionals (DHCPs) are prepared. The study aim was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19 among DHCPs in Saudi Arabia.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study using a web-based survey was conducted. A validated and reliable questionnaire was developed that comprised 44 questions. Using Qualtrics survey software, DHCPs working in different settings were approached across five geographical regions of Saudi Arabia.
   Results
   A total of 318 respondents voluntarily participated in the survey. Most DHCPs showed a moderate level of knowledge (51.6%), a positive attitude (92.1%) and adequate practice standards (86.5%). We found that 94.7% of DHCPs had an adequate overall level of KAP. DHCPs with a doctorate significantly outscored DHCPs with other educational levels with respect to knowledge and practice. Older (51-60 years) DHCPs reported significantly more knowledge than younger DHCPs.
   Conclusion
   DHCPs displayed an average level of knowledge that needs to be enhanced through continuing education programmes. However, they showed a positive attitude and an acceptable level of practice, as they were abiding by guidelines issued from various international and national health agencies.

AB  - In this paper the incidental language acquisition of 11-year-old Flemish children (n = 30) who have not received any formal English instruction is investigated. The study looks into children's English proficiency and the learner characteristics that can be associated with it. In order to measure the children's English proficiency, a receptive vocabulary test and a proficiency test (which measured listening skills, speaking skills, reading skills and writing skills) were used. Information about learner characteristics was gathered through two questionnaires (for children and parents). The results show that a significant proportion of the 11-year-olds can already perform tasks at the A2 level (The Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) without having had any formal instruction. The study confirms that children learn English from the input they receive through different media (especially gaming and computer use). Furthermore, the data reveal a strikingly positive attitude towards English and demonstrate that in some situations Flemish children prefer using English over their L1 with their peers.

AB  - Surveys conducted across multiple countries show that most people view seeking lower immigration to help maintain the majority group's population share as a sign of racial self-interest-as opposed to racism. We investigated whether the belief that it is not racist to want immigration restrictions for cultural reasons is associated with ingroup identification (a positive attachment to and solidarity with one's group) or collective narcissism (a conviction that the ingroup is exceptional and deserves special treatment). We argue that if this belief reflects concern for the ingroup, it should be linked to ingroup identification. However, if it is a defensive justification of the ingroup's privileged position, it should be linked to collective narcissism. Across four studies, national (Study 1: United Kingdom, N = 467; Study 2: Poland, N = 1,285) and ethnic (Study 3a: United States, N = 2,000; Study 3b: United States, N = 2,938) narcissism emerged as predictors of the belief that ethnoculturally motivated immigration restrictions are racial self-interest (vs. racism). This belief was also associated with justifying collective violence against migrants (Study 2) and supporting the alt-right (Studies 3a-3b). We found less consistent evidence for an association between ingroup identification and immigration-restriction beliefs. We discuss implications for intergroup relations and political extremism.

AB  - Objective To describe COVID-19 related symptoms and medical care experienced in the first six months of the pandemic as well as stay-at-home order adherence, and attitudes related to COVID-19 risk and social distancing among a diverse sample of adults in the Deep South. Methods Survey data were collected from 411 Louisiana and Mississippi residents for three weeks in June 2020 through social media. Results Over half (52.5%) of participants who experienced COVID-19 related symptoms (with 41.5% experiencing at least one symptom) did not feel the severity of symptoms warranted seeking medical care. 91.6% of the Deep South adults visited certain places or did activities where visiting or gathering with other people was involved during stay-at-home mandates. Religiosity/spirituality, age, education, number of children in the home, attitudes related to COVID-19 risk of complications and social distancing were related to the greater/lesser likelihood of stay-at-home order adherence. Conclusions Various cultural and contextual factors were related to stay-at-home order adherence. Understanding how social values, life stage, socioeconomic, and geographic factors influence stay-at-home order adherence would lead to more effective policy design to improve population adherence.

AB  - Meta-dehumanization, the perception your group has been given less than human qualities, contributes to a vicious cycle of outgroup dehumanization and hostility, such as hate crimes and support for discriminatory policies. Minimal research has investigated potential benefits of meta-humanization, or perceiving your group has been given dignified qualities. Across 7 studies (N = 1,261) in Canada and the United Kingdom, we focus on Muslim-non-Muslim relations and provide the first empirical evidence to suggest that (a) there is an indirect effect of meta-humanization through outgroup humanization that reduces prejudice and (b) that perceived high intergroup threat moderates the indirect effect of meta-humanization. Studies 1a and 1b reveal that humanization mediates the indirect effect of meta-humanization on prejudice. Studies 2a and 2b replicate these results as well as demonstrate that perceived threat moderates the indirect effect, and Study 2c extends this by testing the perspective of Muslims. Studies 3a and 3b further demonstrate an interaction between high threat and meta-humanization on prejudice and interest in intergroup contact. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the growing literature on meta-dehumanization, meta-humanization, and intergroup relations more broadly.

AB  - Previous studies indicate that perception of peer norms and school norms regarding intergroup contact can significantly influence children and youth attitudes and behaviours towards outgroup members. Additionally, school climate can also play an important role in shaping quality of intergroup relations. The present study examines the role of peer and school norms regarding intergroup contact and school climate in explaining majority and minority pupils' self-reported prosocial outgroup behaviour in different types of public schools from four different multi-ethnic contexts in Croatia. Pupils (N = 1568; average age M = 15.04) attending ethnic majority, minority and mixed schools participated in this study. Results demonstrate that positive peer and school norms regarding intergroup contact as well as the lower level of ethnicity-based conflicts are associated with more self-reported outgroup prosocial behaviour. Furthermore, findings indicate a moderation effect of group status whereby the effect of quality of relationships and connectedness in school is observed for majority pupils only. The findings also indicate a moderation effect of school type and the stronger effect of peer norms on self-reported outgroup prosocial behaviour of pupils in mixed schools. The results are discussed from the perspective of current literature review and potential educational implications.

AB  - BackgroundWhile HPV vaccination uptake in Sweden is quite high, at around 80%, vaccine hesitancy remains an issue in countries throughout Europe. The latter can be related to a contemporary context of increased contestation of expert knowledge and of a large share of information on health-related issues including vaccination today being sought via the internet. Still, there is a paucity of recent research on attitudes toward the HPV vaccine in a larger sample of the population in Sweden. This survey study assesses such attitudes and any correlations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic characteristics, trust in healthcare and other societal institutions, and evaluation of the reliability of different sources of information. MethodsThe validated survey questionnaire was distributed to adult women in Sweden (n = 2,000), via a nationally representative web panel. The response rate was 37%. Aside from descriptive statistics, associations between vaccine hesitancy and sociodemographic and other variables were computed using logistic regressions and expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs). ResultsOur results show a positive attitude toward HPV vaccination overall. Still, some degree of HPV vaccine hesitancy was indicated by 33.8% of the respondents, and more pronounced hesitancy by 7.6%. Regarding vaccination in general, a very positive attitude was indicated by 55%. HPV vaccine hesitancy was associated with low education and low income and strongly associated with a lack of confidence in healthcare and other societal institutions. It was also correlated with a self-assessed lack of access to, and ability to assess the origin, quality and reliability of, information about the HPV vaccine. ConclusionEfforts to provide transparent information about HPV vaccination should be combined with healthcare providers being open to discuss vaccine concerns with patients and avoiding practices that do not promote trust.

AB  - Celebrity disclosures and narratives are popular strategies in health promotion. However, less is known about their joint effects and the mechanisms through which they function. A 2 (narrative type: celebrity vs. layperson) x 2 (personal relevance: low vs. high) online experiment (N = 248) tested the impact of different narrative types in increasing awareness about prescription opioid abuse. Results indicated that a celebrity narrative is more persuasive than its layperson counterpart. Also, personal relevance toward opioid addiction moderated the influence of narrative type. Celebrity narratives evoked more positive attitudes toward opioid prevention and greater behavioral compliance intentions with the recommended action for low-relevance individuals. Transportation and identification mediated the effects of celebrity narratives on participants' issue attitudes and behavioral intentions, but only for low-relevance individuals. Practically, the data suggest that incorporating celebrities in health narratives about opioid addiction prevention facilitates behavioral compliance, especially for individuals to whom a pressing health issue like opioid misuse is currently of low relevance.

AB  - Materialism is known to be negatively related to consumers' ethical behaviors, and prior research has often assumed that highly materialistic consumers do not behave ethically. This study challenges such conventional wisdom and investigated ways to motivate highly materialistic consumers to engage in ethical consumption behaviors by examining the moderating role of the appeal type across two studies. The results indicated that highly materialistic consumers showed more positive attitudinal and behavioral responses to ethical products and campaigns when self-benefit (vs. other-benefit) appeals are implemented; however, less materialistic consumers' responses did not depend on the appeal type. The two egoistic motivations, protective and enhancement motivations, were found to mediate the positive effect of self-benefit appeals among highly materialistic consumers. These findings suggest that materialistic and ethical values do not represent opposite ends of a single dimension, but rather indicate two independent dimensions in the same individual. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed, and suggestions for future research are offered.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of perceived threat from asylum seekers in EU (EUAS) on attitudes toward Israeli local outgroups, controlling for face to-face interaction with the latter. The study was conducted using an online survey of 1311 Israeli Jews. Realistic threat from EUAS was negatively related to positive attitudes toward three local outgroups, while the association between symbolic threat from EUAS and attitudes toward the local outgroups was insignificant. The effect of distant realistic threat was more pronounced than the effect of symbolic threat and the effect of face-to-face contact.

KW  - SELECTION
AB  - This article tests a model predicting minority language television consumption. We examine how four media gratifications (diversion, ethnolinguistic identity, surveillance, parasocial companionship) mediate the relationship between ethnolinguistic identification and choice of ingroup language television viewing. The study is performed among (minority) Hungarian speakers in Transylvania, Romania. Self-report questionnaire data from 401 Hungarian-speaking high school students in Csikszereda/Miercurea Ciuc (a majority Hungarian locale) and Brasso/Brasov (a minority Hungarian locale) allowed us to compare high and low local vitality conditions. Analysis indicates that diversion (entertainment) and ethnolinguistic identity gratifications for watching ingroup language television are the strongest mediators of the influence of identification on ingroup language television use. We examined four moderators of these indirect effects (objective vitality, subjective vitality, intergroup contact, and intragroup contact). The moderators revealed a number of rather complex effects which are discussed with regard to the local intergroup context and broader issues of media and intergroup relations.

AB  - In response to the early stages of the Coronavirus pandemic in January, 2020, an opportunity was created to apply for grant funding to host a real-time, social media teaching modality that would help Hospitality and Tourism Management (HTM) students remain engaged [and enrolled] in classes as they quickly pivoted to the practice social distancing. This new modality [ZOOM] was also intended to connect former students, alumni, and industry professionals to industry leadership through an online [streaming] format. The initial proposal indicated faculty would travel offsite, visiting alumni and former students to conduct interviews and bring the classroom to students as they returned home early. However, as the situation continued to evolve, it was determined traveling would not be feasible. As a result, the initiative evolved into the planning and facilitation of a virtual event/conference attended by approximately 500 students, alumni, and industry professionals from around the globe.

AB  - In large-scale international assessments such as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), or the Progress in International Reading Study (PISA), research has struggled to find positive associations between the frequency of educational technology use in schools and student achievement. While computer use at home showed a tendency for positive correlations with test scores, computer use in schools did not. Following a different approach, the study reanalyzes PISA 2012 data by combining frequency of use and positive perceptions with regard to educational technology as predictors for student test scores. When controlling for influential sociodemographic factors, results indicate that positive attitudes toward educational technology are associated with higher test scores in the large majority of countries. As positive attitudes are likely to be a result of positive experiences, it seems reasonable to conclude that it might be quality instead of quantity of educational technology use that matters.

AB  - Background: England's Time to Change programme to reduce mental health-related stigma and discrimination included a social marketing campaign using traditional and social media, and targeted middle-income groups aged 25-45 between 2009 and 2016. From 2017, the same age group on low to middle incomes were targeted, and the content focused on men's mental health, by changing the advertising and adapting the 'key messages'. This study investigates changes in stigma-related public knowledge, attitudes and desire for social distance in England since Time to Change began in 2008-19 and for 2017-19. Methods: Using data from a face-to-face survey of a nationally representative quota sample of adults for England, we evaluated longitudinal trends in outcomes with regression analyses and made assumptions based on a simple random sample. The pre-existing survey used a measure of attitudes; measures of knowledge and desire for social distance were added in 2009. Results: Reported in standard deviation units (95% CI), the improvement for knowledge for 2009-19 was 0.25 (0.19, 0.32); for attitudes, 2008-19, 0.32 (0.26, 0.39) and for desire for social distance, 2009-19 0.29 (0.23, 0.36). Significant interactions between year and both region and age suggest greater improvements in London, where stigma is higher, and narrowing of age differences. There were significant improvements between 2017 and 2019 in knowledge [0.09 (0.02, 0.16)] and attitudes [0.08 (0.02, 0.14)] but not social distance. Conclusion: The positive changes support the effectiveness of Time to Change but cannot be definitively attributed to it. Inequalities in stigma by demographic characteristics present targets for research and intervention.

AB  - Background Mandatory rules for social distancing to curb the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic require individuals to maintain a critical interpersonal distance above 1.5 m. However, this contradicts our natural preference, which is closer to 1 m for non-intimate encounters, for example, when asking a stranger for directions. Objective This review addresses how humans typically regulate interpersonal distances, in order to highlight the challenges of enforcing atypically large interpersonal distances. Method To understand the challenges posed by social distancing requirements, we integrate relevant contributions from visual perception, social perception, and human factors. Results To date, research on preferred interpersonal distances suggests that social distancing could induce discomfort, heighten arousal, and decrease social signaling in the short term. While the protracted effects of social distancing are unclear, we propose hypotheses on the mid- to long-term consequences of violating preferred norms of interpersonal distances. Conclusion We suggest that enforcing a physical distance of 1.5-2 m presents a serious challenge to behavioral norms. Application We address how notifications, architectural design, and visualizations could be effectively applied to promote interpersonal distance requirements.

AB  - In contrast to the common assumption that voluntary associations from male voice choirs to gymnastic clubs mediate political culture, this article stresses that leisure clubs were frequented first and foremost as places where soci-ability could unfold. This form of social exchange, which suspends differences of social status or political attitudes, is relevant for the development of the political system, as it can work as an antidote against a fundamental politicization of all social relations. In Weimar Germany, leisure clubs did not realize this potential. This article argues that this was mainly the consequence of state authorities interfering with the voluntary sector of leisure.

AB  - Adolescents' attitudes toward disadvantaged groups are surprisingly understudied. What we know from these few studies is that adolescents' attitudes tend to become more favorable over time and that adolescent girls display more favorable attitudes than do adolescent boys. However, researchers have not offered explanations for why these effects occur. We proposed that changes in social-cognitive abilities that accompany adolescent development increase perspective taking and that the increased perspective taking facilitates more favorable attitudes toward disadvantaged groups. Because girls develop social-cognitive abilities earlier than boys, girls should show greater perspective taking and thus more positive attitudes toward disadvantaged groups than should boys. Importantly, we propose that these more positive attitudes are explained better by perspective taking than by gender. Participants were late adolescents (n = 803, 53.3 % female, ages 15-19) from high schools in north-central Florida (United States) participating in an ongoing, multi-wave study. Participants completed a measure of perspective-taking and reported their attitudes toward three disadvantaged groups (Black, gay, and poor people) during their third year of high school and, again, 6 months later during their fourth year of high school. Our findings provided strong support for our theorizing. Girls generally reported warmer attitudes than did boys toward disadvantaged groups, with the gender differences in warmth tending to diminish across time. Similarly, girls were higher than boys in perspective-taking abilities at both time points, although boys increased over time whereas girls did not. Crucially, perspective taking mediated observed gender differences in attitudes, suggesting that perspective taking is a mechanism for improving attitudes toward disadvantaged groups during late adolescence.

AB  - Perspective-taking is essential for improving intergroup relations. However, it is difficult to implement, especially in violent conflicts. Given that immersive virtual reality (VR) can simulate various points of view (POV), we examined whether it can lead to beneficial outcomes by promoting outgroup perspective-taking, even in armed conflicts. In two studies, Jewish-Israelis watched a 360 degrees VR scene depicting an Israeli-Palestinian confrontation from different POVs-outgroup's, ingroup's while imagining outgroup perspective or ingroup's without imagined perspective-taking. Participants immersed in the outgroup's POV, but not those who imagined the outgroup's perspective, perceived the Palestinians more positively than those immersed in the ingroup's POV. Moreover, participants in the outgroup's POV perceived the Palestinian population in general more favorably and judged a real-life ingroup transgression more strictly than those in the ingroup's POV, even five months after VR intervention. Results suggest that VR can promote conflict resolution by enabling effective perspective-taking.

AB  - We assessed evidence for a contextual effect of positive intergroup contact, whereby the effect of intergroup contact between social contexts (the between-level effect) on outgroup prejudice is greater than the effect of individual-level contact within contexts (the within-level effect). Across seven large-scale surveys (five cross-sectional and two longitudinal), using multilevel analyses, we found a reliable contextual effect. This effect was found in multiple countries, operationalizing context at multiple levels (regions, districts, and neighborhoods), and with and without controlling for a range of demographic and context variables. In four studies (three cross-sectional and one longitudinal) we showed that the association between context-level contact and prejudice was largely mediated by more tolerant norms. In social contexts where positive contact with outgroups was more commonplace, norms supported such positive interactions between members of different groups. Thus, positive contact reduces prejudice on a macrolevel, whereby people are influenced by the behavior of others in their social context, not merely on a microscale, via individuals' direct experience of positive contact with outgroup members. These findings reinforce the view that contact has a significant role to play in prejudice reduction, and has great policy potential as a means to improve intergroup relations, because it can simultaneously impact large numbers of people.

AB  - The main purpose of this study is to explore which factors of users' perceived gratifications and technology attributes are associated with changes in the usage level of Facebook and Instagram during the past three months. We identified common gratifications (social interaction, entertainment, passing time, browsing, need for recognition) as well as technology attributes (visual element, recommendation algorithm, privacy setting, openness, simultaneousness) of Facebook and Instagram and surveyed respondents who have both Facebook and Instagram accounts (n = 613). Respondents who were more gratified with entertainment and need for recognition aspects and those who have positive attitudes toward Facebook's recommendation algorithm features were more likely to report that they have increased use of the platform during the past three months. Meanwhile, respondents who were gratified with the browsing aspect of gratifications and those who have positive attitudes toward levels of openness on Instagram tended to report that they have increasingly used the platform during the past three months.

Results from a 2 (type of information tailoring: personalization vs. customization) x 2 (level of locational congruity: high vs. low) x 2 (level of product involvement: high vs. low involvement) between-subjects experiment (N = 115) showed that customization and locational congruity were effective strategies for inducing positive attitudes about LBA and its service quality. In addition, the ad's perceived intrusiveness was found to mediate the effects of product involvement on participants' attitudes toward LBA. Implications of the findings are discussed.

The results revealed that positive attitudes and perception of control predicted a stronger intention to do physical activity. The intention to do physical activity was the only predictor of adherence to physical activity. Planning mediated the relationship between trust in the physician and adherence. Implications for patients with type 2 diabetes are discussed.

AB  - Background and aimsBased on the principles of scaffolding for motivation and on the assumptions of self-determination theory, two studies aimed to assess the role played by perceived parental autonomy-supportive scaffolding on child homework autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, affect, and engagement.
   Samples and resultsThe results of Study 1, which involved 122 parents and their children, showed that the higher the parental autonomous motivation, the more their children perceived them as autonomy-supportive while scaffolding for motivation, and hence developed autonomous motivation, self-efficacy, and engagement in homework. In Study 2, 37 parents were involved in a four-session training programme that focused on sustaining autonomy-supportive scaffolding modalities. The training decreased parental negative affect, prevented child negative affect increase, and maintained child homework motivation.
   ConclusionsThe discussion focuses on the strength that parents have with regard to helping their children develop less negative, and potentially also more positive attitude towards homework, through autonomy support as a scaffold for motivation.

AB  - Workers' perception that their job experience enriches their family life has been considered a mechanism that explains their positive attitudes toward the organization where they work. However, because women and men live their work and family differently, gender may condition this relationship between the work-family enrichment and workers' attitudes. With a sample of 1885 workers from one Portuguese bank, with 802 women, the current study investigated the relationship between work-family enrichment and organizational affective commitment as well as the role of sex as a moderator of this relationship. The hypotheses were tested by using regression analysis. The results indicated that the perception held by workers that their work enriches their family is positively correlated with their affective commitment toward the organization. Furthermore, the data revealed that this relationship is stronger for women than for men. Study results have implications for management, particularly for human resource management, enhancing their knowledge about the relationship of work-family enrichment and workers' affective commitment toward organization.

AB  - In this article we revisit the gateway hypothesis, which argues that political satire programs open the door to people using more hard news content. Using over-time survey data, we examine whether use of satire leads people to use more cable news. Although our cross-sectional analyses replicate previous results attempting to assess the gateway hypothesis, our over-time data suggest that satire does not lead to increased use of news programming on cable outlets. However, we did find support for the gateway hypothesis when looking at a mediation model where political attitudes serve as the intervening variable between satire use and cable news use.

AB  - This article reports the results of a meta-analysis of 81 research reports containing 122 intervention-control comparisons of structured programs to reduce prejudice or promote positive intergroup attitudes in children and adolescents. Overall, the analysis revealed a mean effect size of d = 0.30, indicating low to moderate intervention effects. From the great variety of different approaches, interventions based on direct contact experiences along with social-cognitive training programs designed to promote empathy and perspective taking showed the strongest effect sizes. In addition, effects varied according to the program participant's social status (higher effects for majority groups), the target out-group (lower effect sizes for ethnic vs. disabled and aged out-groups), and the type of outcome assessment (higher effects for cognitive vs. affective and behavioral measures of intergroup attitudes). The discussion considers several limitations including the lack of implementation and follow-up research as well as future direction of research on promoting intergroup relations.

AB  - Research has shown that members of the national majority group generally consider host culture adoption by immigrants as desirable. However, so far, this positive effect of perceived host culture adoption on attitudes toward immigrants has not been explained. We argue that majority members infer national identification of immigrants from their cultural adoption. Moreover, we predict that this inference should decrease majority members' feeling of ingroup threat, therefore also improving their attitudes toward immigrants. We conducted two experimental studies. In Study 1, majority members who were presented an immigrant group that adopted the host culture held more positive attitudes than those who were presented one that disregarded it. In line with our hypothesis, this effect was fully mediated by perceived identification of the immigrants with the host nation, itself decreasing perception of ingroup threat. Study 2 reproduced the same experimental design, but used descriptions of individual immigrants' acculturation strategies, and the immigrant group's status - valued vs. devalued origin - was also manipulated. In addition, Study 2 focused on dimensions of the "Big Two" of social perception. Results replicated the mediational effect of perceived identification on attribution of both warmth and competence traits. The status manipulation had no significant effect and did not interact with cultural adoption. These two studies provide robust evidence that perception of host nation identification explains the effects of perceived cultural adoption on attitudes towards immigrants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the impact of the project on students' learning with a free writing activity done as pretest and posttest and used a semi-structured interview to explore their attitudes towards language learning and their perceived development of their native language. Data analysis indicated statistically significant gains in foreign language writing and positive attitudinal changes toward foreign and native language learning.

This research combines interview data (n = 12) collected, as New Zealand moved into Level 3-Restrict and then Level 4-Lockdown, with Facebook and online news media analysis to understand how religious leaders and their communities responded to COVID-19. Our data found four challenges: (1) The requirement to reassess worship practices, (2) the need to mitigate any potential for community transmission, (3) significant difficulties related to social distancing for communal religious practices, and lastly, (4) welfare and pastoral concerns for congregations and others in need.

AB  - linden m. & kavanagh r. (2012) Attitudes of qualified vs. student mental health nurses towards an individual diagnosed with schizophrenia. Journal of Advanced Nursing68(6), 1359-1368. Abstract Aim. This paper is the report of a study which sought to compare the attitudes held by student and qualified mental health nurses towards individuals with schizophrenia in the Republic of Ireland. Background. Media portrayals of individuals with schizophrenia often include images of aggression and violence. With global initiatives aimed at reducing the stigma and exclusion associated with mental illness, the attitudes of those who care for people with schizophrenia are of particular interest. Methods. A survey was administered to 66 student mental health nurses, and 121 qualified mental health nurses. Participants completed the community attitudes to mental illness scale and the social interaction scale in 2009. Multivariate analysis of variance was used to test for the effects of qualification, work setting, years of experience and education on the measures. Results. Nurses employed in a community setting held more positive attitudes, when compared with colleagues who worked in an inpatient setting, as measured by the community mental health ideology subscale, indicating their desire to promote community care for individuals with schizophrenia. Nurses working in an inpatient setting held more socially restrictive attitudes indicating that they felt individuals with schizophrenia were dangerous and should be avoided. These findings were statistically significant at the P < 0.05 level. Conclusions. Mental health nurses must be alerted to the fact that holding negative attitudes may adversely affect the therapeutic relationship and ultimately lead to stigmatization and its negative consequences.

AB  - Key questions for developmentalists concern the origins of gender attitudes and their implications for behavior. We examined whether prenatal androgen exposure was related to gender attitudes, and whether and how the links between attitudes and gendered activity interest and participation were mediated by gender identity and moderated by hormones. Gender attitudes (i.e., gender-role attitudes and attitudes about being a girl), gender identity, and gender-typed activities were reported by 54 girls aged 10-13 years varying in degree of prenatal androgen exposure, including 40 girls with classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (C-CAH) exposed to high prenatal androgens and 14 girls with non-classical (NC) CAH exposed to low, female-typical, prenatal androgens. Both girls with C-CAH and NC-CAH reported positive attitudes about being a girl and egalitarian gender attitudes, consistent with their female-typical gender identity. In contrast, girls with C-CAH had more male-typed activity interest and participation than girls with NC-CAH. Gender attitudes were linked to activities in both groups, with gender identity mediating the links. Specifically, gender-role attitudes and positive attitudes about being a girl were associated with feminine gender identity, which in turn was associated with decreased male-typed activity interests and participation, and increased female-typed activity interests. Our results are consistent with schema theories, with attitudes more closely associated with gender identity than with prenatal androgens.

AB  - Background Pharmaceutical care practice has been championed as the primary mission of the pharmacy profession, but its implementation has been suboptimal in many developing countries including Kuwait. Pharmacists must have sufficient knowledge, skills, and positive attitudes to practise pharmaceutical care, and barriers in the pharmacy practice model must be overcome before pharmaceutical care can be broadly implemented in a given healthcare system. Objective To investigate hospital pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care, perceptions of their preparedness to provide pharmaceutical care, and the barriers to its implementation in Kuwait. Setting Six general hospitals, eight specialized hospitals and seven specialized health centers in Kuwait. Method A descriptive, cross-sectional survey was distributed to all pharmacists working in the governmental hospitals in Kuwait (385 pharmacists). Data were collected via a pre-tested self-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics including percentages, medians and means Likert scale rating (standard deviations) were calculated and compared using statistical package for social sciences, version 20. Statistical significance was accepted at a p value of < 0.05. Main outcome measure Pharmacists' attitudes towards pharmaceutical care, perceptions of their preparedness to provide pharmaceutical care competencies, and the barriers to its implementation in Kuwait. Results Completed surveys were received from 250 (64.9 %) of the 385 pharmacists. Pharmacists expressed overall positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care. They felt well prepared to implement the various aspects of pharmaceutical care, with the least preparedness in the administrative/management aspects. Pharmacists with more practice experience expressed significantly more positive attitudes towards pharmaceutical care (p = 0.001) and they felt better prepared to provide pharmaceutical care competencies (p < 0.001) than those with less experience as practitioners. The respondents agreed/strongly agreed that the most significant barriers to the integration of pharmaceutical care into practice were lack of private counseling areas or inappropriate pharmacy layout (87.6 %), organizational obstacles (81.6 %), inadequate staff (79.6 %), and lack of pharmacist time and adequate technology (76.0 %). Conclusion Hospital pharmacists in Kuwait advocate implementation of pharmaceutical care while also appreciating the organizational, technical and professional barriers to its widespread adoption. Collaborative efforts between health authorities and educational institutions, and the integration of innovative approaches in pharmacy management and education could overcome these barriers and achieve the transition towards pharmaceutical care practice.

AB  - The influence of social norms in the context of intergroup relations has long been recognized by social psychologists, yet research on intergroup contact and social norms have usually remained disconnected. We explored the influence of direct and indirect friendship on attitudes towards ethnic minorities in Norway, and in particular the role of in-group norms about the social approval of intergroup contact as a mechanism that distinguishes direct from indirect contact. Using a sample of school students from 89 classrooms (N = 823), we tested this hypothesis with both one level and multi-level structural equation modelling (ML-SEM), where the amount of contact of other classroom members was considered as a form of indirect contact. The results suggest that the intergroup contact of other in-group members (in-group friends or classmates) affects attitudes towards the out-group by changing the perception of in-group norms and by reducing intergroup anxiety. In contrast, direct contact (or contact at the individual level in the case of ML-SEM), improved attitudes only by reducing intergroup anxiety, and did not affect the perception of in-group norms.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to focus on the motivation of service customers to create user-generated content (UGC) after a negative service experience. In examining this relationship, the moderating role of "extraversion" personality trait is also taken into consideration. Furthermore, the paper examines how differently motivated service customers react to a firm's service recovery strategies, whilst insights into the relationship between UGC creation and specific online platform usage are also provided.
   Design/methodology/approach - Structural Equation Modeling is used to test the conceptual model, based on an empirical dataset collected from an online survey research of 239 service customers. The dataset pertains to international travellers and their UGC behaviour after a negative travel experience.
   Findings - Altruistic, vengeance and economic motivations are strong drivers for UGC creation after a negative service experience. Motivations also correlate to participation in specific online platforms. Furthermore, it is shown that highly extraverted customers create more UGC after a negative service experience when motivated by vengeance. Finally, higher levels of altruistic and self-enhancement motivations correlate with a positive attitude towards a firm's response, whereas customers who are motivated by vengeance have a negative attitude towards a firm's response.
   Practical implications - Customers who share their negative service experience by creating UGC in social media can be segmented according to their motivation. Service providers should inspect the UGC of their customers to understand the motivation behind it. The motivation to create UGC varies across platforms, and hence, customized service recovery strategies are required.
   Originality/value - This paper examines UGC creation in relation to motivation, extraversion, and attitude towards a firm's response. This is the first reported application which collectively examines important issues like these in a unified theoretical framework.

AB  - Recently, there has been an increase in prejudice toward some groups such as immigrants. In response, governments and citizens have called for compassion. In four studies, we tested the hypothesis that people who are high in compassionate love would express less prejudice than those who are low. We found that people high in compassionate love had more positive attitudes toward out-groups, including immigrants. The relation between compassionate love and prejudice toward immigrants was mediated by inclusion of out-group members in the self. An experiment provided evidence of a causal link between compassionate love and prejudice toward immigrants. Finally, people high in compassionate love were less likely to discriminate against immigrants in a budget cutting exercise and more likely to volunteer to help them. Empathy did not account for our results. We conclude that compassionate love holds promise as a positive pathway to prejudice reduction.

AB  - This paper explores how cyber threats are represented in Swedish newspapers. The sample comprises 1269 articles from three newspapers (Aftonbladet, Gateborgs-Posten, and Svenska Dagbladet) covering 25 years (1995-2019). The study provides a text-near and detailed analysis of the threats covered. The study analyzes these threats along several dimensions: their modality (e.g. unauthorized access or manipulation); to what extent ambiguous themes (e.g. attack, crime, and warfare) are specified in context; how cyber-threat coverage has changed over time; and the event orientation of the coverage, i.e. whether articles address topical events and, if so, which ones. There are five main findings. First, the Swedish newspaper cybersecurity discourse covers multiple threats; in total, 34 themes (present in at least 4% of articles) have been identified. Second, the representation of cyber threats varies in specificity. While generic themes such as attack and warfare are mostly specified in terms of their modality, they sometimes are not, leaving the representation vague. Third, this study, given its general approach, provides insights into media representations of particular cyber threats. For example, this study finds the meaning of "hacking" in the media to be more diversified and nuanced than previously assumed (e.g. as simply meaning "computer breakin"). Fourth, newspaper coverage of cyber threats has changed over time, in both quantity (i.e. the amount of coverage has increased) and quality, as three general trends have been observed: the state-ification and militarization of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. nations and warfare as threats), the organization-ification of threats (i.e. increased attention to, e.g. government agencies and companies as threats), and the diversification and hyping of threats (i.e. cumulatively more threats are added to the cybersecurity discourse, although attention to particular threats is sometimes restricted in time). Finally, parallel to coverage of particular topical events (e.g. the "I love you" virus), newspaper representations of cyber threats largely exemplify "amplification without the event," i.e. threats are covered without linking them to topical events, as is otherwise typical of news reports. The findings in relation to previous studies of cybersecurity discourse and the implications for informal learning and threat perception are discussed.

AB  - The novel coronavirus may impact exercise habits of those with intellectual disabilities. Due to the mandated discontinuation of face-to-face research, investigators must adapt projects to protect all involved while collecting objective physical activity metrics. This brief report outlines a modification process of research methods to adhere to social distancing mandates present during COVID-19. Actions taken included electronic consent and assent forms, an electronic survey, and mailing an accelerometer with included instructions. The amended research methods were implemented without risk for virus transmission or undue burden on the research team, participant, or caregiver. Recruitment was likely impacted by the coronavirus-mediated quarantine, plausibly resulting in bias. Objective physical activity data collection can be sufficiently modified to protect those with intellectual disabilities and investigators. Future research designs may require greater participant incentives and the creation of in-home participation.

AB  - Purpose To describe the favorable procedural profile of CT colonography (CTC) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Conclusion Postponement of cancer screening due to COVID-19 has resulted in a backlog of individuals needing to undergo structural examination of the colon. The experience during the initial COVID-19 surge with urgent evaluation of the colon for transplant patients prior to transplant suggests that CTC can be done in a lower risk manner as compared to other structural examinations. The procedural profile of CTC is advantageous during this pandemic as maintaining social distancing and preserving healthcare supplies including PPE are of paramount importance. CTC is an important option to utilize in the screening armamentarium to allow effective screening of average risk asymptomatic individuals in the COVID-19 era.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the process through which institutional trust influences individuals' vaccination intentions for a coronavirus vaccine. We collected data from a national representative sample of the Spanish population (N = 500) from an online research panel to test the proposed conceptual model. Results revealed a positive association of institutional trust with coronavirus vaccination intentions. This effect was mediated by perceived vaccine safety and positive attitude toward the vaccine. Furthermore, findings corroborate the moderating effect of interdependent self-construal on the indirect relationship between institutional trust and vaccination intention, implying that this effect was stronger for individuals with higher levels of interdependent orientation. Findings have implications for the development of evidence-based health communication strategies for encouraging COVID-19 vaccination.

   Happiness has been the most important goal for humans throughout history and is a significant issue among university lecturers facing a rapid digital technology change. It is usually described as a well-being state, feeling satisfied and contented, consisting of positive happenings in an individual's life concerning the social, spiritual, economic, psychological, and physiological spheres. This research examines the relationship between happiness, attitudes toward technology, and lecturers' job performance in higher education. Design and Methodology
   This research design was a cross-sectional design that asked the respondents from lecturers of Institut Teknologi Bandung, one of the best universities with technology-based education in Indonesia, to complete a group of well-validated questionnaires. The questionnaires mentioned earlier include the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire and three other newly constructed questionnaires, made to measure attitude toward digital technology, job satisfaction, and job performance. Findings
   This research confirmed that happiness fully mediated the relationship between attitude toward digital technology and job performance. Additionally, this research also confirmed that happiness partially mediated the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance. These results implied that a positive attitude toward digital technology and higher job satisfaction would lead to happier lecturers who increase their job performance. Originality
   This study suggests that a positive attitude toward technology has a higher impact than job satisfaction as determinant factors of happiness and its association with lecturers' job performance such as universities, especially Institut Teknologi Bandung as a technologically advanced workplace environment. Additionally, the Oxford Happiness Questionnaire framework, frequently used in studies of other countries, is now being used in the context of an Indonesian case study, precisely to measure happiness among lecturers in Indonesian higher education.

TI  - Association of Mobile Phone Location Data Indications of Travel and Stay-at-Home Mandates With COVID-19 Infection Rates in the US
T2  - JAMA NETWORK OPEN
LA  - English
AB  - Question Did human mobility patterns change during stay-at-home orders and were the mobility changes associated with the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) curve? Findings This cross-sectional study using anonymous location data from more than 45 million mobile phones found that median travel distance decreased and stay-at-home time increased across the nation, although there was geographic variation. State-specific empirical doubling time of total COVID-19 cases increased (ie, the spread reduced) significantly after stay-at-home orders were put in place. Meaning These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates were associated with the reduced spread of COVID-19 when they were followed.
   This cross-sectional study uses anonymous mobile phone location data to examine travel and home dwell time patterns before and after enactment of stay-at-home orders in US states during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.
   Importance A stay-at-home social distancing mandate is a key nonpharmacological measure to reduce the transmission rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), but a high rate of adherence is needed. Objective To examine the association between the rate of human mobility changes and the rate of confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Design, Setting, and Participants This cross-sectional study used daily travel distance and home dwell time derived from millions of anonymous mobile phone location data from March 11 to April 10, 2020, provided by the Descartes Labs and SafeGraph to quantify the degree to which social distancing mandates were followed in the 50 US states and District of Columbia and the association of mobility changes with rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases. Exposure State-level stay-at-home orders during the COVID-19 pandemic. Main Outcomes and Measures The main outcome was the association of state-specific rates of COVID-19 confirmed cases with the change rates of median travel distance and median home dwell time of anonymous mobile phone users. The increase rates are measured by the exponent in curve fitting of the COVID-19 cumulative confirmed cases, while the mobility change (increase or decrease) rates were measured by the slope coefficient in curve fitting of median travel distance and median home dwell time for each state. Results Data from more than 45 million anonymous mobile phone devices were analyzed. The correlation between the COVID-19 increase rate and travel distance decrease rate was -0.586 (95% CI, -0.742 to -0.370) and the correlation between COVID-19 increase rate and home dwell time increase rate was 0.526 (95% CI, 0.293 to 0.700). Increases in state-specific doubling time of total cases ranged from 1.0 to 6.9 days (median [interquartile range], 2.7 [2.3-3.3] days) before stay-at-home orders were enacted to 3.7 to 30.3 days (median [interquartile range], 6.0 [4.8-7.1] days) after stay-at-home social distancing orders were put in place, consistent with pandemic modeling results. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that stay-at-home social distancing mandates, when they were followed by measurable mobility changes, were associated with reduction in COVID-19 spread. These results come at a particularly critical period when US states are beginning to relax social distancing policies and reopen their economies. These findings support the efficacy of social distancing and could help inform future implementation of social distancing policies should they need to be reinstated during later periods of COVID-19 reemergence.

AB  - Introduction: Health workers are at high risk of contracting the disease because they are at the forefront of assisting COVID19 patients. Globally, Indonesia has the worst death toll of health workers. Many previous studies have shown the differences in knowledge, attitudes, and behavior of health workers in handling with the COVID19 pandemic. This study aims to asses the role of knowledge, attitudes, and health workers' preparedness during the COVID-19 pandemic in Aceh Pidie Jaya District.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study and the data were collected by distributing online questionnaires about knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and preparedness related to the COVID-19 at 12 Pidie Jaya District health centers. The knowledge, behavior, and preparedness parameters used Guttman and Likert scales to measure the workers' attitudes. Chi-square test was used to evaluate the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, behavior, and preparedness.
   Results: In this study, 377 health workers were selected, the majority of respondents' education level was diploma, level 3 (257, 76.3%), and one-third of the respondents did not attend training. There are 197 (58.5%) respondents who had good knowledge, 177 (52.5%) positive attitudes, 283 (84%) good behavior, and 173 (51, 3%) well prepared. Furthermore, good knowledge, positive attitude, and good behavior had a significant correlation statistically with well prepared during the pandemic (p < 0.05).
   Discussion: Most of the health workers in Aceh Pidie Jaya have good knowledge, positive attitudes, and good behavior that create adequate preparedness. Even though training is still very limited, educational attainment would remain the cornerstone for preparedness to encounter COVID-19.

AB  - Intergroup contact and group relative deprivation have both been shown to play a key role in the understanding of intergroup relations. Nevertheless, we know little about their causal relationship. In order to shed some light on the directionality and causality of the relationship between intergroup contact and group relative deprivation, we analysed responses by East and West Germans from k= 97 different cities, collected 6 (NT1= 1,001), 8 (NT2= 747), and 10 years (NT3= 565) after reunification. Multi-level cross-lagged analyses showed that group relative deprivation at T1 led to more (rather than less) intergroup contact between East and West Germans 2 years as well as 4 years later. We found no evidence for the reverse causal relationship, or moderation by group membership. Furthermore, admiration mediated the positive effect of relative deprivation on intergroup contact for both East and West Germans. This intriguing finding suggests that intergroup contact may be used as a proactive identity management strategy by members of both minority and majority groups.

AB  - Translanguaging practice has become increasingly popular in individuals' lives, particularly in online communication among young people. A body of existing research has described translanguaging practice and its potential functions, but few studies have systematically examined individuals' attitudes towards translanguaging practices. Therefore, this paper investigates the extent to which young people consider translanguaging practices appro-priate, and how they judge the motivating factors and effects of translanguaging practices on social media. The study chose to focus on self-praise on social media as its research context, aiming to investigate Chinese young people's attitudes toward translanguaging on Weibo and examine whether their gender influences their attitudes. The results showed that Chinese young people generally perceived the use of translanguaging strategies in self-praise on Weibo as appropriate. The participants rated multi-semiotic resources the highest, significantly higher than their ratings of multimodal and multilingual resources. They held a neutral-to-positive attitude towards translanguaging on social media, and the results also revealed consistent gender differences in attitudes towards translanguaging practices in this context.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Help seeking is regarded as an important learning strategy that reflects students' metacognitive and domain-specific skills and knowledge. This study developed a proactive online discussion forum that strengthens social networks in an online discussion forum to facilitate help seeking for problem solving. This forum allowed students to proactively invite friends or potential experts to participate in problem solving. A quasi-experimental approach was conducted with a sample of 37 students. The students' behaviors of problem solving, ego network patterns of problem solving, and perceptions of help seeking were addressed as dependent variables to assess the effect of the proactive online discussion forum. The analysis results revealed that the students in the experimental group exhibited more frequent participation in problem solving, and showed more positive attitudes towards help seeking. The results also indicated that the experimental group demonstrated more in-depth participation patterns of ego networks. The findings provide some evidence for the effectiveness of the proactive online discussion forum in terms of promoting students' participation in problem solving and their attitudes towards help seeking.

AB  - To many commentators and social scientists, Americans' stances on political issues are to an important extent driven by an underlying conservative-liberal ideological dimension. Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a marker of this dimension. However, past research has not thoroughly distinguished between ideological identity (a self-categorization) and ideology (an integrated value system). This research evaluates the thesis that conservative-liberal identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism-liberalism. In Study 1, conservative-liberal identity, measured in 2000, had an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq in 2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study 2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm subsidy policy based on randomly varied cues indicating which ideological group supports which stance. This cue-based influence was mediated by adoption of attitude-supportive beliefs. Discussion addresses the joint impact of political discourse and identity-based social influence on the organization of political attitudes.

AB  - This research responds to the need to study trust in the national government (national trust) and in local government (local trust) simultaneously and investigates how decentralization reshapes political attitudes toward different layers of government. The argument is that decentralization contributes to variant patterns of political trust, defined by the relative strength of national trust and local trust, across countries. A multilevel analysis of East Asian countries shows that decentralization nurtures local trust in democracies, but decreases local trust in autocracies. Further, decentralization boosts national trust in autocracies, but not in democracies. Such a variant effect of decentralization sheds light on regime stability and viability in democratic and authoritarian countries.

TI  - The Impact of the first COVID-19 shelter-in-place announcement on social distancing, difficulty in daily activities, and levels of concern in the San Francisco Bay Area: A cross-sectional social media survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   The U.S. has experienced an unprecedented number of orders to shelter in place throughout the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We aimed to ascertain whether social distancing; difficulty with daily activities; and levels of concern regarding COVID-19 changed after the March 16, 2020 announcement of the nation's first shelter-in-place orders (SIPO) among individuals living in the seven affected counties in the San Francisco Bay Area.
   Methods
   We conducted an online, cross-sectional social media survey from March 14 -April 1, 2020. We measured changes in social distancing behavior; experienced difficulties with daily activities (i.e., access to healthcare, childcare, obtaining essential food and medications); and level of concern regarding COVID-19 after the March 16 shelter-in-place announcement in the San Francisco Bay Area versus elsewhere in the U.S.
   Results
   In this non-representative sample, the percentage of respondents social distancing all of the time increased following the shelter-in-place announcement in the Bay Area (9.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 11.9) and elsewhere in the U.S. (3.4%, 95% CI: 2.0, 5.0). Respondents also reported increased difficulty obtaining hand sanitizer, medications, and in particular respondents reported increased difficulty obtaining food in the Bay Area (13.3%, 95% CI: 10.4, 16.3) and elsewhere (8.2%, 95% CI: 6.6, 9.7). We found limited evidence that level of concern regarding the COVID-19 crisis changed following the announcement.
   Conclusion
   This study characterizes early changes in attitudes, behaviors, and difficulties. As states and localities implement, rollback, and reinstate shelter-in-place orders, ongoing efforts to more fully examine the social, economic, and health impacts of COVID-19, especially among vulnerable populations, are urgently needed.

AB  - The Virginia Tech and Columbine High shootings are 2 of the deadliest school massacres in the United States. The present study investigates in a nationally representative sample how White Americans' causal attributions of these shooting moderate their attitudes toward the shooter's race. White Americans shown a vignette based on the Virginia Tech shooting were more likely to espouse negative beliefs about Korean American men and distance themselves from this group the more they believed that the shooter's race caused the shooting. Among those who were shown a vignette based on the Columbine High shooting, believing that mental illness caused the shooting was associated with weaker negative beliefs about White American men. White Americans in a third condition who were given the Virginia Tech vignette and prompted to subtype the shooter according to his race were less likely to possess negative beliefs about Korean American men the more they believed that mental illness caused the shooting. There was no evidence for the ultimate attribution error. Theoretical accounts based on the stereotype and in-group-out-group bias literature are presented. The current findings have important implications for media depictions of minority group behavior and intergroup relations.

TI  - Sex Trafficking Related Knowledge, Awareness, and Attitudes among Adolescent Female Students in Nepal: A Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Background
   Sex trafficking has been a long-standing concern in Nepal. Very little has been achieved, however, in terms of actual reduction in the number of victims despite numerous anti-sex trafficking programs. This situation may be attributable to a lack of empirical evidence upon which to formulate anti-sexual trafficking interventions. This study aimed to assess sex trafficking-related knowledge, awareness and attitudes, and factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns among adolescent female students in Nepal.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional study was conducted between August-September 2013 among 292 adolescent female students (> 10 years old) using systematic random sampling from three high schools in Sindhupalchowk district, Nepal. As an initial step, descriptive analyses were employed to characterize the data and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with sex trafficking awareness and related attitudes.
   Results
   Seventy-six percent of sampled students reported that they were aware of sex trafficking and 94.6% indicated media (i.e., radio or television) as the primary sources of their knowledge. Fifty-one percent mentioned relatives/friends as mediators of sex trafficking, 60.4% reported promise for better jobs as the primary attraction behind sex trafficking, and 48.6% mentioned adolescent females as the most vulnerable group for sex trafficking. Over half (56.8%) of the respondents had positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns. Age (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 2.51-4.55), parents' occupation (OR = 3.89, 95% CI: 1.58-9.58), and having a radio/TV at home (OR = 6.67, 95% CI: 3.99-9.54) were significantly associated with awareness, whereas being younger (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.55-0.79) and having joint-family (OR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.49-4.80) were significantly associated with having a positive attitudes towards the victims of sex trafficking and/or anti-sex trafficking campaigns.
   Conclusion
   Findings presented have important implications for anti- trafficking programs, in particular those designed to educate the adolescent females who are at most-risk of sex trafficking. Educational programs need to include specific interventions to improve knowledge and attitudes towards sex trafficking among adolescent females in Nepal.

AB  - This article highlights the support, attitude and perception of the general public towards drug abuse so that appropriate policies can be framed for the prevention of drug abuse among youth. The study aims to understand the relationship among variables influencing behaviour change with respect to drug abuse. Questionnaire from 1,159 respondents was administered comprising of 39 items exploring Perception, Attitude, Support pertaining to illicit drugs. Positive or negative attitude towards drug abuse is evolved out of the perception of problems associated with drug abuse and the support provided to dissuade drug-abusing behaviour, and relationship among these variables was tested using SEM-Path analysis. The perception of problems related to drug addiction significantly influences the attitude towards drug addiction. The perceived nature of the support structure augments the influence further (partial mediation). The augmenting effect of the support structure can be seen among gender, age and education. Moderator effects of age, gender and education were studied by estimating multi-group path coefficients. This article is useful to local government as they may take some of the findings of this article for framing policy related to educating youth related to drugs, creating a campaign regarding the harm of drug abuse and involving those volunteers in drug assistance programmes that are more supportive of drug addicts. This article is helpful for society to make them understand that their positive attitude and support towards drug abuse will give a second chance to drug addicts to leave drugs and live a normal life again.

T2  - PARKINSONS DISEASE
LA  - English

KW  - METAANALYSIS
KW  - DEPRESSION
AB  - Background. Blue light glasses have been introduced as a possible new treatment option to treat sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson disease (PD). Assessing patient attitudes represents a key step in the road towards formal testing and introduction into clinical practice. Specifically, we aimed to assess how patients experience the use of blue light glasses, aiming to optimise compliance in upcoming clinical trials where these glasses will be tested for efficacy. Methods. We invited 58 PD patients who had used the blue light glasses for at least one week on a daily basis to complete an online survey about their experiences and self-reported impact. For this purpose, the System Usability Scale was used, supplemented with additional questions about (side) effects. A total of 31 patients (53%) replied. Results. 74% of respondents reported subjective improvements in night-time sleep, daytime sleepiness, depressive symptoms, motor functioning, or a combination thereof. The median score for the System Usability Scale (SUS; 0-100 range, higher scores indicating better performance) was 70.0. A total of 26 patients (84%) had an overall positive attitude towards the technique, with patients rating the glasses with an average score of 6.9 +/- 2.0 (SD) out of 10. Except for one patient, all responders would like to continue using the glasses, mostly because they considered it a useful aid. Conclusion. Blue light therapy appears to have a positive effect on sleep, mood, and motor symptoms in PD. PD patients had an overall positive attitude towards blue light glasses as treatment for sleep disorders.

AB  - Background: Low adherence to therapies in psoriasis decreases treatment outcomes and increases the total health care costs. In spite of the wide use of biologic agents, patients' adherence to these drugs has not been extensively investigated. Objective: The aim of this study is to measure adherence to the biologic drugs in a population of patients treated for psoriasis vulgaris using the medication possession ratio (MPR) index and to survey patients' attitudes to the treatment. Methods: This is a single-center study on 247 patients with psoriasis vulgaris treated with adalimumab (n = 113), etanercept (n = 39), and ustekinumab (n = 95). MPR calculation was calculated monthly based on the hospital records documenting the dispensing of biologics to the patients. Clinical data [ Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), presence of psoriatic arthritis, concomitant treatment, and cause for treatment discontinuation] were obtained from the national database DERMBIO. Patients' attitudes and beliefs were measured using the Medication Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). Results: A total of 93.5% of all patients had an MPR >= 0.8, indicating very good adherence. MPR was independent of patients' age, gender, median PASI or DLQI score, concomitant diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, or treatment with methotrexate. MPR for etanercept was slightly lower than that for ustekinumab and adalimumab. The MARS questionnaire documented satisfactory understanding of the treatment and its adverse effects, and positive attitudes to the treatment. Conclusion: Adherence to biologic therapies is very high in patients with psoriasis, which is consistent with a positive attitude to the treatment. (C) 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Background: Healthcare workers (HCWs) are known to spearhead the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. As such, their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) are considered critical to the success of the current COVID-19 response efforts. This study aims to determine HCWs' KAP toward COVID-19 and assesses their perception of their healthcare facilities preparedness to respond appropriately to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic in Sierra Leone.
   Methods: We conducted an online cross-sectional study among HCWs (n=516) between 1st May 2020 and 30th June 2020. We collected our data using a self-administered structured questionnaire via email and online social media platforms. We analyzed our data using descriptive statistics and regression analysis (p < 0.05).
   Results: Close to three-fourth of HCWs (n=375, 72.7%) were knowledgeable regarding COVID-19. Doctors were more knowledgeable than community health workers and laboratory technicians (AOR= 2.48, 95% CI: 1.16-5.31, p=0.019) regarding COVID-19. Close to two-thirds of HCWs (n=301, 58.3%) HCWs show positive attitudes toward COVID-19. Being male (AOR=2.08, 95% CI: 1.36-3.20, p=0.001) and directly involved in COVID-19 patient care (AOR=3.21, 95% CI: 1.88-5.48, p < 0.001) were identified as predictors of positive attitude towards COVID-19. HCWs are generally adhering to COVID-19 safe practices with majority indicating that they regularly wash or sanitize their hands (n=510, 98.8%) and used facemask at point of care (n=499, 96.7%). Majority of HCWs are of the view that their healthcare facilities are ill-prepared to adequately respond to COVID-19 with majority (n= 400, 77.5%) of them stating that their facilities lack enough personal protective equipment.
   Conclusion: HCWs in Sierra Leone showed good knowledge, positive attitude and practice regarding COVID-19. However, HCWs are of the view that their healthcare facilities are ill-prepared to respond adequately to the COVID-19 outbreak. Health authorities and policymakers need to provide the necessary resources to allow HCWs to work in a safe environment.

AB  - Recent research has focused on the potential negative consequences of belonging to the upper class. The present study attempted to directly replicate previous research examining whether upper-class individuals had more positive attitudes toward greed than lower-class individuals, and whether these attitudes mediated the negative association between social class and unethical behaviour. The current research includes two studies with 317 and 320 participants, from Amazon's Mechanical Turk and Prolific Academic, respectively. We used the same measures and procedures of the original research. The resulting dataset, and analytic code, are hosted on the Open Science Framework (Clerke et al., 2017). Collectively these datasets provide access to data from over 600 participants pertaining to social class, ethical behaviour, and sociodemographic information, such as obtained education and religious and political orientation. As in the original, we found a significant positive correlation between SES and greed in one of two studies, however the size of the effect was smaller. Contrary to the original, we did not find a significant association between SES and the propensity to lie in a hypothetical salary negotiation.

AB  - This article centers on the developmental trajectory of a young woman who took part in a study that tracked the language and intercultural development of international exchange students from a Hong Kong university. 'Serena', a translation ( Chinese-English) major, took steps toward a more intercultural mindset while studying in England. Compared with many of the other participants, she displayed a more positive attitude toward the host language and culture, developed a more diverse social network, and gained more access to local communities of practice. Over time, she became more open-minded and invested in her intercultural relationships which she mediated through English. Weaving together the rich oral and written data related to her case, this paper presents a narrative of her 'international story'. Her lived experiences and the subjective meanings invoked raise awareness of individual characteristics, attributes, and agency that can facilitate second language learning and intercultural development. By drawing comparisons with the stories of her peers, this narrativized account also points to the impact of external elements on sojourn outcomes.

AB  - In three studies we examined how observers making meaning of victimization by finding benefits for the victim leads to the perception that victims are morally obligated to help others and not do harm. In Experiment 1, participants perceived a victim as having greater moral obligations when the meaning of victimization was considered for the victim rather than the perpetrator. This effect on moral obligations was mediated by the extent to which participants believed victims should have found benefits. Experiments 2 and 3 examined the consequences when victims fail or fulfill their moral obligations. Greater social distance from a victim who did harm was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator. Less social distance from a victim who helped was sought when participants focused on the meaning of victimization for the victim as compared to the perpetrator or when they made no meaning. These studies show that how observers make meaning of victimization has implications for subsequent responses to victims. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Objectives: Negative attitudes toward aging are common among formal healthcare providers, but have been infrequently assessed among informal caregivers providing assistance to older adults. The current study sought to identify factors associated with ageism toward older women. Design: Multivariate hierarchical linear regression model Setting: Lower-income neighborhoods in an urban setting in the Midwestern USA Participants: 144 care network members of White and African American women aged >= 65 years Measurements: Age Group Evaluation and Description (AGED) Inventory assessed attitudes toward older women; CES-D scale measured depressive symptoms; Intergenerational Affectional Solidarity Scale assessed relationship closeness. Results: In bivariate analyses, African American caregivers endorsed more positive attitudes toward older women. In the multivariate regression model, attitudes toward older women were associated with care recipient health (beta = 0.18, p < 0.05) and relationship closeness with the care recipient (beta = 0.23, p < 0.05). However, these associations were fully mediated by care recipient-specific attitude ratings by the care network member. The association between person-specific attitudes and general attitudes was uniquely directional. Conclusions: Findings from the present study are consistent with past research suggesting that 'ageism' may, at least in part, derive from bias against perceived poor health. Further, our findings of an association between attitude toward the care recipient and attitudes toward older women in general provide support for cognitive psychology theory which emphasizes the role of personal experience in stereotype formation through the availability heuristic. The current study underlines the necessity for development of interventions to address ageism in informal caregivers.

AB  - Background:
   As issues related to transgender and gender diverse individuals gain more national media attention, professional organizations that promote mental health and LGBTQ + rights continue to advocate for equality and inclusion. Barriers to equality and inclusion for transgender and gender diverse individuals can include a variety of factors including discrimination in educational and workplace settings, and issues related to housing, poverty, and homelessness.
   Aim:
   To examine the impact of a media intervention on changing attitudes toward transgender and gender diverse individuals.
   Methods:
   A total of 223 students from a large, Midwestern university in the USA participated and received a 45-minute media intervention along with pre- and post-testing.
   Results:
   A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in attitudes and beliefs toward transgender and gender diverse individuals using the Transgender Attitude and Beliefs Scale indicated a statistically significant interaction based on a media intervention where F(1, 109) = 7.042, p = .009. A split-plot factorial ANOVA to investigate potential differences in willingness to engage in social action on behalf of this population measured by the Social Justice Scale did not indicate a statistically significant interaction based on the media intervention where F(1, 109) = .881, p = .350.
   Conclusion:
   These findings suggest that a variety of potential media interventions can increase positive attitudes and beliefs toward marginalized groups, but a stronger and/or additional intervention is needed for participants to engage in social action on behalf of the group. Implications and limitations of the study are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the roles of popular music in the lives of immigrant adolescents from the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS-former Soviet Union) in Israel. Based on 70 in-depth interviews with newly arrived adolescents aged 12-18, our research revealed that these adolescents' musical preferences matched different stages of adaptation to their new country, with different music styles fulfilling different integration needs. During their first two years in Israel, interviewees enthusiastically explored local musical fare. This stage was also characterised by positive attitudes towards their new home and their anticipated integration. In dramatic contrast, the next three to five years were characterised by disappointment with the local culture, accompanied by growing social alienation. Many adolescents found consolation in late-1980s Russian rock music, as texts critical of the Soviet regime helped them express anger and frustration felt as they came of age in new, difficult and often hostile surroundings. It seems, therefore, that, for immigrant adolescents, different types of popular music not only serve as a marker of their evolving cultural identity but also as indicators of social and psychological adaptation.

AB  - Background:
   Today, Japan is becoming a super-aged society, with senior citizens already constituting over 21% of the population. In this situation, the question of how elderly people can extend their lives and enjoy independent lifestyles is becoming more important. The present study aims to clarify the relationship between the Quality of Life (QOL) of elderly females and their current oral functions and experiences of music and art education in early life.
   Methods:
   We carried out a survey study focusing on elderly females (Takarazuka Revue Company OG group and general female group) by carrying out a questionnaire survey and comparing cognitive function, oral examinations, cerebral atrophy in magnetic resonance imaging, and other characteristics.
   Results:
   It was shown that the Takarazuka Revue Company OG group had greater hippocampal volumes and significantly higher cognitive functions than the general female group. In addition, in the general female group, there was a significant correlation between a decrease in the number of remaining teeth and a decrease in activities in daily living, but in the Takarazuka Revue Company OG group, no such correlation was observed.
   Conclusions:
   The results showed that those who have received art education as part of their careers over an extensive period since early life have higher levels of cognitive function, QOL, physical activity, social activity and life satisfaction compared with the general female group; showing that they sense a purpose in life and live with a positive attitude. In contrast, in the general female group, those who have continued to enjoy hobbies have higher levels of cognitive function, QOL, physical activity, social activity and life satisfaction than those who have not, thus showing that they live with a positive attitude.

AB  - A key predictor of support for Turkey's EU membership is citizens' attitudes toward immigrants. How anti-immigrant attitudes relate to support is not obvious and has remained unclear thus far. We argue that the presence of immigrants in a country reduces support for Turkey's membership. Second, the stronger this presence, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Third, the more salient immigration issues in a country, the stronger the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support. Using cross sectional survey data (N = 26,344) from 20 EU member states, we find support for these claims. Our findings provide a prime example of how politicians and media can influence citizens' thinking about specific issues, and, in doing so, can influence public opinion.

AB  - Objective. To explore the attitudes of pharmacy, pharmacy technician, medical, and public health students before and after an IPE activity that focused on smoking cessation in the Middle East.
   Methods. A pre-post intervention research design using the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) was used for this study. The tool contained 20 items, categorized under the following subscales: teamwork and collaboration, professional identity, and patient-centeredness.
   Results. A total of 47 out of 50 students from four different health disciplines in Qatar (medicine, pharmacy, pharmacy technician, and public health) who participated in the activity completed a pre- and post-intervention pre-validated questionnaire (94% response rate). Total attitude scores were calculated for all the 20 items along with attitudinal scores of the three domains. Most of the students reported having a positive attitude toward IPE; the number of students having a positive attitude toward IPE increased after the IPE session. The overall median (IQR) score increased from 82 (16) before the session to 84 (15) after the session. Students from different disciplines did not vary in their attitude scores.
   Conclusion. Health care professional students in Qatar perceived IPE positively, believing that it enhanced their communication skills, collaboration and appreciation of professional roles. This study has implication on developing effective methods to implement IPE in various health professional education curricula.

AB  - Online dialogue has tremendous potential to influence intergroup relations in conflict-ridden societies. Although prior research has identified intergroup harmony and justice as two distinct approaches to intergroup contact, little is known about whether online dialogue would foster a harmony- or justice-oriented discourse around conflict. To examine this question, the present study implemented a pre-post within-subjects design around a 4-week online dialogue intervention with Bosniaks and Serbs in the postconflict context of former Yugoslavia. Analyses of pre-post surveys suggest that the dialogue may have fostered a justice-oriented discourse among both Bosniaks and Serbs, who showed greater group identification and demands for justice after the dialogue compared to before the dialogue. There was also lower support for the goal of improving relationships and higher prioritization of discussions of justice after the dialogue. Exploring the linguistic content of the dialogue during the 4-week intervention further revealed that expressions of anger and anxiety decreased, whereas time orientations toward the present increased over time, suggesting that the justice-focused dialogue was not necessarily accompanied by explicit hostility over past atrocities. These findings help inform future interventions in postconflict societies, especially the use of online platforms to shape the discourse of conflict.

AB  - Literatures across the social sciences highlight the tendency for humans to be more attentive to negative information than to positive information. We focus here on negativity biases in news selection (NBNS) and suggest that this bias varies across individuals and contexts. We introduce a survey-based measure of NBNS which is used to explore the correlates of negative news bias in surveys in the U.S., Canada, and Sweden. We find that some respondents are more prone to NBNS than others. There is evidence of contextual effects, but panel data suggests that some of the individual-level differences persist over time. NBNS likely reflects some combination of longterm personality differences and short-term situational factors, and is systematically related to a number of economic and political attitudes.

AB  - Abrupt interruption in the performance of everyday occupations as a consequence of forced social distancing and home confinement, coupled with a lack of regulatory capacities and skills, can trigger harmful effects on people's health and well-being. This study aimed to determine the factors related to the occupational balance in the Spanish population during home confinement as a consequence of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. A total of 3261 subjects completed an online survey, which was disseminated through the mainstream social media platforms in Spain and included the Occupational Balance Questionnaire (OBQ), sociodemographic variables, and factors related to COVID-19 infection. The mean age of the participants (81.69% women) was 40.53 years (SD +/- 14.05). Sociodemographic variables were related to a greater occupational balance, and the multivariate analysis showed that age (beta = 0.071; p = 0.001), the perception of having received enough information (beta = 0.071; p <= 0.001), not telecommuting (beta = -0.047; p = 0.022), and not being infected by COVID-19 (beta = 0.055; p = 0.007) contributed to a better occupational balance. There were profiles of people less likely to suffer disturbances in occupational balance during home confinement, but more studies are needed to help understand and analyze the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on people's occupational and mental health.

AB  - Multicultural ideology proposes that group memberships should be not just acknowledged but also valued in order to accommodate diversity and attain equality. In three studies conducted in Spain and Canada we analyzed, using different measures, the relationship between multicultural ideology on the one hand and prejudice, support for social policies, and motivation for social change on the other hand. In Spain we focused on responses to Gitanos (Spanish Roma) and, in Canada, on First Nations people. Results showed that multicultural ideology was related in both cases to lower prejudice and higher support for social policies to support the minority group and motivation for social change. The internal motivation to control prejudice was an important mediator of this relationship in both countries. In contrast, the way in which social identities are represented played a different role as a function of country: whereas a dual identity representation played a mediating role in Canada, a common identity representation was the mediator in Spain. These results support the importance of valuing cultural diversity to harmonize intergroup relations and to reduce inequalities between majorities and minority groups. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - After the approval of the sales of IQOS in the United States market, discussions about IQOS have become active on social media. Twitter is a popular social media platform to understand public opinions toward IQOS. This study aims to explore public perceptions toward IQOS on Twitter in the United States. IQOS-related tweets from the United States between November 19, 2019, and August 24, 2020, were collected using a Twitter streaming application programming interface (API). Sentiment analysis was performed to determine whether the public perceptions toward IQOS were positive, neutral, or negative. In addition, topics discussed in these tweets were manually coded. From November 2019 to August 2020, the number of tweets discussing IQOS was relatively constant except for a peak starting from July 7, 2020, which lasted for 4 days. Among IQOS tweets with positive sentiments, the most popular topic is "IQOS is safer than cigarettes," followed by "IQOS helps quit smoking." Among tweets with negative sentiments, the most popular topic is "illegal marketing/selling to youth," followed by "health risks/fire hazards." "FDA approval/regulation" is the most popular topic for tweets with neutral sentiments. After the announcement of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) enforcement policy on unauthorized flavored e-cigarette products on January 2, 2020, the proportion of tweets with positive attitudes toward IQOS significantly increased, while the proportion of negative tweets significantly decreased. Our study showed that the public perception of IQOS in the United States became more positive after the FDA enforcement policy on flavored e-cigarettes. While many Twitter users thought IQOS is safer than cigarettes and helps quit smoking, some Twitter users complained about the illegal marketing and health risks of IQOS. These findings provide useful information on future tobacco regulations.

AB  - Purpose Mobile Facebook (m-Facebook) creates many business opportunities for brands and firms while increasingly drawing interest in scientific literature. However, research is scarce on the immersive experiences prompted by m-Facebook, and how these experiences facilitate users' engagement, their positive attitude towards Facebook and their continued use of it. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach This paper theoretically and empirically analyses m-Facebook users' immersive experiences, along with their affective and behavioural effects. Findings The results reveal the important role of imagery, presence and flow in the context of m-Facebook; the interplay between these three immersive phenomena; and the influence the user's optimum stimulation level has on them. Originality/value The investigation offers a foundation for understanding users' immersive experiences on m-Facebook, and informs practitioners who aim to enhance users' engagement with, attitude towards, and continued use of m-Facebook content.

AB  - Objective Metric based virtual reality simulation training may enhance the capability of interventional neuroradiologists (INR) to perform endovascular thrombectomy. As pilot for a national simulation study we examined the feasibility and utility of simulated endovascular thrombectomy procedures on a virtual reality (VR) simulator. Methods Six INR and four residents participated in the thrombectomy skill training on a VR simulator (Mentice VIST 5G). Two different case-scenarios were defined as benchmark-cases, performed before and after VR simulator training. INR performing endovascular thrombectomy clinically were also asked to fill out a questionnaire analyzing their degree of expectation and general attitude towards VR simulator training. Results All participants improved in mean total procedure time for both benchmark-cases. Experts showed significant improvements in handling errors (case 2), a reduction in contrast volume used (case 1 and 2), and fluoroscopy time (case 1 and 2). Novices showed a significant improvement in steps finished (case 2), a reduction in fluoroscopy time (case 1), and radiation used (case 1). Both, before and after having performed simulation training the participating INR had a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Conclusion VR simulation training enhances the capability of INR to perform endovascular thrombectomy on the VR simulator. INR have generally a positive attitude towards VR simulation training. Whether the VR simulation training translates to enhanced clinical performance will be evaluated in the ongoing Norwegian national simulation study.

AB  - Young adults were vulnerable to mental health issues during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the underlying pathway by which COVID-19-related stress influences mental health outcomes among young adults remains unclear. This study aimed to examine the mediating effects of social support and resilience between COVID-19-related stress and mental health outcomes. A sample of 1000 Korean young adults was obtained via online survey. Participants completed self-report questionnaires assessing COVID-19-related stress, social support, resilience, depression, and anxiety. Overall, 48.1% and 23.4% of participants were classified as having depression and anxiety states, respectively. Path analysis using AMOS version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) showed that the direct effects of stress from social distancing difficulties on depression and anxiety were much greater than those of stress from fear of infection and anger toward others. In addition, there were significant indirect effects of social support and resilience in the relationship between stress related to difficulties due to social distancing and mental health outcomes. The mediating roles of social support and resilience suggest that interventions to increase these factors can be effective strategies to reduce the risks of depression and anxiety among young adults suffering from stress related to social distancing difficulties.

AB  - Satirical news shows such asThe Daily Showare popular with students, but are they appropriate for classroom use? In this two-group, pretest-posttest study, I examine differences in engagement, political knowledge, and political attitudes between two American Government classes: one assigned to watchThe Daily Showand the other assigned to readThe New York Times. The findings reveal no differences in engagement between the groups, but greater political knowledge inThe Daily Showgroup, as well as more cynicism and less trust in government. I conclude that given the surprising lack of greater engagement inThe Daily Showclass, along with higher levels of cynicism and mistrust in government,The Daily Showmay not be an appropriate substitute forThe New York Timesas a primary political information resource.

AB  - To what extent do mass media outlets influence viewers' trust in scientific evidence and compliance with behavior recommended by scientific experts? Exploiting the U.S. lockdown period of the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, we analyze a large longitudinal database that combines daily stay-at-home behavior from approximately 8 million mobile phones and local viewership of cable news networks. Early in the pandemic, several of Fox News' hosts downplayed the severity of the pandemic and the risks associated with the transmission of the virus. A combination of regression analysis and a natural experiment finds that a 10% increase in viewership of Fox News in a zip code causes a 0.76 percentage-point reduction in compliance with stay-at-home behavior. The results imply a media persuasion rate that is larger than typical advertising persuasion rates on consumer behavior. Similar analyses using viewership of MSNBC and CNN, which supported lock down measures, were inconclusive but suggested a smaller, positive effect on compliance with social distancing regulations.

AB  - Penal history museums are among the sites where cultural meanings about prisoners and imprisonment are developed, communicated, and consumed. Little research has explored what visitors take from these encounters. Drawing on literature concerning new media communication and Brown's (2009) work on penal spectatorship, we analyze visitor comments about their sojourns into Canadian penal history sites found on TripAdvisor, a global travel website. We delve into the diverse stories that tourists share about their encounters with representations of incarceration, which we have found address the following themes: the performance of on-site actors; perceived authenticity of experiences and emotions; the convenience of visiting museums; attitudes about imprisonment; and views of penal history. Our research suggests that visits to penal history museums in Canada seldom translate into humanizing conceptions of the criminalized and views that challenge punitiveness among visitors, at least online. We also highlight how new media communications shape the actions of penal history museum workers in ways that tend to reinforce memorialization practices that foster social distance between authors and recipients of punishment.

AB  - This study assessed the knowledge and attitude of patients with ovarian cancer (OC) toward OC and next generation sequencing (NGS). The data, including characteristics of patients, their knowledge about OC and their knowledge and attitude of NGS, were collected from June to October 2018. Of the 103 participants, 70.9% (n = 73) had cancer within the second-degree relatives, and 18.4% (n = 19) had BRCA pathogenic mutations. The percentage of right answer for the knowledge about OC and NGS was 64.7% (11/17) and 50% (6/12), respectively. The median number of patients who had positive expectations for the genetic test was 34 (range, 22-44). Based on a first-degree familial history, patients had a different degree of knowledge about OC (11 vs. 8.5, p = 0.026) and NGS (6.5 vs. 5, p = 0.011), but patients with a BRCA pathogenic mutation did not have a different degree of knowledge about OC and NGS panel testing. High-income families had a more positive attitude towards the genetic test than low-income families (p = 0.005). Women with OC do not have enough knowledge about OC (11/17, 64.7%) and NGS (6/12, 50%) but they showed a positive attitude toward the NGS test. These women need OC and NGS educational intervention.

AB  - Despite the growing international interest in the relation between religion and prejudice, there has been a dearth of studies conducted within Australia. We used the Faith Development Scale (FDS) to examine the relation between religious maturity and attitudes toward Muslims and toward gay men and lesbians in an Australian context using a sample of churchgoers from the Perth metropolitan area (N = 139). Respondents who scored lower on the FDS were more prejudiced toward both target groups than were high scorers. Furthermore, participants who scored lower on the FDS were more prejudiced against gay men and lesbians than they were against Muslim Australians. The FDS was a better predictor of attitudes toward the two groups than was the Quest Scale. Contrary to overseas studies, we found that religious fundamentalists held more prejudiced attitudes toward gay men and lesbians than toward those of a different religion (Australian Muslims). Right-wing political orientation was also found to be predictive of prejudice against Australian Muslims and against gay men and lesbians independently of religious development. Results suggest that religious maturity, as well as fundamentalism and right-wing political views, plays an important role in the "making" or "unmaking" of prejudice against Australian Muslims and against gay men and lesbians. Evidence is presented that suggests that the Quest Scale and the FDS are measuring different aspects of religious development.

AB  - Public service announcements (PSAs) are non-commercial advertisements aiming to improve knowledge, attitudes and/or behavior. No evaluations of epilepsy PSAs exist. This study sought to evaluate a televised PSA showing first aid for a seizure. A multilevel regression analysis was used to determine the effect of the PSA on epilepsy knowledge and attitudes taking into account school-level clustering as well as individual-level variables, including socioeconomic status, gender, language and familiarity with epilepsy. Of the 803 randomly selected Grade 5 (9-11 years) students, 406 (51%) had seen the epilepsy PSA. Those who saw the PSA scored significantly higher on knowledge (P < 0.001) and had more positive attitudes (P < 0.001) about epilepsy. Those who saw the PSA had even greater knowledge about epilepsy 1 month later, even though the PSA was no longer being televised. Having viewed, the PSA continued to be associated with higher knowledge and more positive attitudes independent of the effects of a school-based epilepsy education program.

AB  - For public safety and physical security, currently more than a billion closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras are in use around the world. Proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine/deep learning (M/DL) technologies have gained significant applications including crowd surveillance. The state-of-the-art distance and area estimation algorithms either need multiple cameras or a reference object as a ground truth. It is an open question to obtain an estimation using a single camera without a scale reference. In this paper, we propose a novel solution called E-SEC, which estimates interpersonal distance between a pair of dynamic human objects, area occupied by a dynamic crowd, and density using a single edge camera. The E-SEC framework comprises edge CCTV cameras responsible for capturing a crowd on video frames leveraging a customized YOLOv3 model for human detection. E-SEC contributes an interpersonal distance estimation algorithm vital for monitoring the social distancing of a crowd, and an area estimation algorithm for dynamically determining an area occupied by a crowd with changing size and position. A unified output module generates the crowd size, interpersonal distances, social distancing violations, area, and density per every frame. Experimental results validate the accuracy and efficiency of E-SEC with a range of different video datasets.

AB  - In head and neck cancer patients with late radiation injury, hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) is used for therapeutic or prophylactic reasons against soft-tissue and osteoradionecrosis (ORN). Twenty-nine departments of oncology, ENT, oral and maxillofacial (OMF) surgery were surveyed using the Enalyzer tool < www.enalyzer.com >, of whom 21 responded. Data were incomplete in four returns. Within the previous year, 14 departments had referred at least one patient for hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). There appears to be a generally positive attitude in Danish OMF, ENT and oncology departments towards referral of patients with ORN for HBOT. However, there is an increasing desire for better evidence for its role in head and neck cancer in the prevention and treatment of soft-tissue injury and osteonecrosis following radiotherapy.

AB  - Purpose - The major objective of this paper is to examine whether or not information technology (IT) usage to share knowledge is a mediator or moderator of the intention behaviour relationship proposed in the theory of reasoned action (TRA).
   Design/methodology/approach - A letter of invitation to participate in the study was sent to all of the public-listed companies in Malaysia. A total of 483 full-time employees from 23 organizations completed an anonymous, self-administered survey in a cross-sectional design. Partial least squares analysis was used to test the conceptual model.
   Findings - The major finding is that the relationship between the intention to share knowledge and knowledge sharing is partly mediated and not moderated by IT usage to share knowledge.
   Research limitations/implications - Knowledge sharing was considered only at the individual level. The data are self-reported, cross-sectional, from a single source and a single method. The relational and capability-membership perspective leads to a positive attitude towards knowledge sharing whereas the instrumental perspective leads to a negative attitude, The findings augment the TRA by showing there is a mediator of the intention-behaviour relationship in the context of knowledge sharing.
   Practical implications - The findings indicate that organizations need to ascertain employees' preferred methods for sharing knowledge, provide appropriate IT for knowledge sharing, establish online communities for knowledge sharing, publicly acknowledge members for sharing knowledge, and avoid relying on extrinsic tangible rewards to foster knowledge sharing.
   Originality/value - Previous research has shown that using IT to share knowledge does not moderate the intention-behaviour relationship in the TRA. An alternative conceptualisation of the role of using IT to share knowledge in the intention-behaviour relationship is provided.

AB  - Religious fundamentalism is associated with Christian-Islamic conflicts globally, but the psychological reasons remain unexplored. Here, we show that fundamentalism is detrimental to interreligious relations because it makes Christians and Muslims alike reject common theological grounds and Abrahamic origins. Specifically, Study 1 demonstrated that such dual Abrahamic categories mediated the negative effects of fundamentalism on real monetary donations to outgroup children desperately in need (i.e., Save the Children Syria) among Christians but not Atheists. Of importance, this was the case only to the degree that Syrian children were perceived as Muslims and, hence, as part of an Abrahamic outgroup. Using a double-randomized experimental design, Study 2 demonstrated the causal effects of religious fundamentalism on Abrahamic categorization and of Abrahamic categorization on mutual resource distribution bias among Muslims and Christians. Together, these studies suggest that religious fundamentalism fuels interreligious conflicts because it crucially impacts basic categorization processes, with subsequent negative effects on intergroup relations.

AB  - Introduction: In order to curb the abrupt advance of "Coronavirus Disease 2019" (COVID-19) and prevent the collapse of the health system, authorities around the world have opted for social distancing strategies that include closing gyms, among other measures. Objectives: This study analyzed the effect of social distancing on resistance training practitioners' quality of life and perception of body image in silhouette. Methods: The volunteers were contacted through social media; data were collected between April 13 and 19, 2020, through a structured questionnaire, comprised of an Informed Consent Form, four questions about COVID-19 and restrictive measures; and twenty-nine questions designed to characterize the individuals' habits; as well as the Short Form Health Survey 36 questionnaire. All the questionnaires were applied over the Internet, using Google Forms (R). After collection, the data were tabulated and interpreted using the software program AppleNumbers (R), and subsequently presented as mean, standard deviation and percentiles. Results: The results revealed changes in perception of body image and decreased frequency and satisfaction with training. There was also an increase in sedentary behavior, food intake, and amount of sleep; and a reduction in parameters related to health and quality of life. Conclusions: The strategy of social distancing, adopted to curb the progress of COVID-19, has harmful consequences for resistance training practitioners, such as increased calorie intake, stress and anxiety, as well as possible psychological effects. These consequences, in turn, lead to changes in self-perception of body image and in the quality of training.

AB  - In an experiment, participants exposed to depictions of an intergroup interaction between a border patrolling U. S. citizen and an illegal immigrant demonstrated changed attitudes toward illegal immigrants depending on the valence of the portrayal. Negative effects were enhanced among people who identified more strongly with the U. S. citizen character, and positive effects were moderately, although nonsignificantly enhanced among those who viewed the illegal immigrant character as more typical of illegal immigrants in general. Liking of the illegal immigrant character was a significant mediator of the effects. The positive effects on attitudes toward illegal immigrants transferred to more positive attitudes toward other social groups as well. The study is framed in terms of a social cognitive theory approach to vicarious intergroup contact.

AB  - Due to COVID-19, we have witnessed an accelerated digitalisation process in shopping activities as consumers embrace a variety of digital technologies that facilitate their 'in-home' or contactless shopping lifestyle. This study aims to investigate the emerging phenomenon of technology-dependent shopping under social distancing. Exploratory factory analysis and structural equation modeling are employed for data analysis. Anchored on the push-pull-mooring framework, our findings suggest that consumers' health concerns (push factors), technology needs (pull factors), task-technology fit considerations (mediators) and pandemic-induced psychological states (mooring factors) are all critical contributors to the adoption of technology-dependent shopping with varied explanatory powers. The findings also provide guidelines for retailing operators to direct consumers towards the contactless shopping channel as a responsive strategy to the pandemic.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate how the green image of a city can affect potential visitors' attitude toward the city in the context of user-generated content. The study adopts a 2 x 2 experimental design in which the greenness of the city image and the social distance between the users and the authors of social media content are examined. The results demonstrate that green image has a significant effect on attitudes toward cities. Moreover, the effects of social media content vary according to the perceived social distance between the author of the post and potential visitors. This study contributes to the literature by assessing the role that social media content plays in place branding and communication. Furthermore, it provides relevant insights on how institutions should enhance the sustainable resources of cities with their environmental policy and encourage the generation of content from various stakeholders to contribute to the development of a city's image.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The COVID-19 pandemic may be having many psychological impacts on people, at both an individual and a community level.
   OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the relationship between the weekly frequency of physical activity and levels of stress among Brazilian adults during social distancing due to the coronavirus (COVID-19), and the interaction of sex in this association.
   DESIGN AND SETTING: Cross-sectional study with a descriptive approach conducted at a public university in Curitiba (PR), Brazil.
   METHODS: 2,000 Brazilian adults (average age 36.4 years; 59.6% women) were recruited according to convenience through digital media. They filled out a questionnaire in electronic format that asked for sociodemographic information, health data, food consumption data, weekly frequency of physical activity and stress levels on the 10-item Kessler psychological distress scale. Descriptive statistics and regression analyses were used to evaluate the data.
   RESULTS: Associations were observed for the following correlations: male sex * no physical activity (odds ratio (OR): 4.35; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.14-16.67); female sex * physical activity 4 or 5 times a week (OR: 7.86; 95% CI: 2.28-27.05); female sex * physical activity 3 times a week (OR: 7.32; 95% CI: 2.09-25.58); female sex * physical activity 1 or 2 times a week (OR: 14.57; 95% CI: 4.28-49.57); and female sex * no physical activity (OR: 24.17; 95% CI: 7.21-80.97).
   CONCLUSION: The lower the weekly frequency of physical activity during the period of social distancing was, the greater the chances of having stress levels were, especially for women.

AB  - This paper analyses the migration intentions of university graduates using the Theory of Planned Behaviour not just to unravel their intention but also to uncover how subjective perceptions enter the decision-making process. The results suggest that perceived parental and peer pressures have strong direct effects on the formation of the intention, and exert indirect effects by shaping positive attitudes about staying in the city. In terms of behavioural control, the expected difficulty in finding a satisfactory job does not influence the intention. The perceived difficulty in finding affordable housing, however, acts as a barrier to the intention to stay. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study assessed consumers' initial reactions to in-feed native ads appearing as news content. In particular, it focuses on consumers' recognition of advertising when they realize that content they had thought were news stories had in fact been advertising. Recognition of advertising made consumers infer that advertisers had deliberately manipulated them. Consequently, consumers engaged less with the message, had less positive attitudes toward the brand, and were less likely to purchase and share. The results demonstrated the mechanisms through which the two mediators, manipulative intent and message engagement, lowered brand attitude, purchase intention, and sharing intention. In addition, ad disclosure made more people recognize the ad when they were exposed to it than when it was not disclosed as an ad.

AB  - In Croatia, four minority groups practice their right to education in their respective mother tongues. Relations between the majority and minority groups in the four multiethnic communities have developed under different historical circumstances. Thus, in some regions the different language of the minority and the majority group can be perceived as a threat to identity and result in intergroup prejudice and discrimination, whereas in others it might not. In this study, we wanted to examine: (a) the mediating effect of perceived threat on the relationship between in-group identification and intergroup orientation, (b) whether those relationships are moderated by the group status, and (c) contextual specificities, that is, we wanted to test the model in four different contexts. Results showed that ethnonationalism (rather than ethnic identity) is detrimental for intergroup relations, partially due to its connection to the perception of the out-group as a threat. Model tests in different contexts revealed some contextual differences.

KW  - Soldier
KW  - Settler
AB  - Challenging the prevailing postcolonial readings of Joyce, which treat the Irish solely as the colonized, this article focuses on how Joyce represents Ireland's partnership with and contribution to the British Empire. Based on historical records about the Irish involvement with the Empire, the author finds that Joyce realistically portrays the historical contributions to the British Empire of Ireland's soldiers and settlers as two forces essential to the development and spread of the Empire. These Irish soldiers or settlers, whether Protestants or Catholics, both participated in the creation and maintenance of the Empire, but Catholics were treated somewhat differently from Protestants, reiterating the power relationship in their home state. At the turn of the century, however, when political and managerial power began to pass into Catholic hands, clear distinctions between sectarian lines started to dissolve. As illustrated in Joyce's writings, even promising Catholic Irishmen wanted to join the British army or work as civil servants. Irish Catholic settlers in particular were able to overcome prejudice and stereotypes regarding their religion and ethnicity. However, the Irish views of the Empire were as diverse as those of Joyce's characters. By presenting characters who have opposing political viewpoints and by refusing to identify himself with one of the characters, Joyce gives his readers the chance to contemplate the multifaceted views of the Irish toward the British Empire.

AB  - This paper is about the "Internet-based performance support systems with educational elements" model. The theoretical foundations and characteristics are analyzed together with their application being to check the model's effectiveness by means of a mixed research approach with university students. Measuring instruments consisted of questionnaires on attitude about learning through the use of computers as well as reflection on the learning methods, and achievements on practice tests. The results showed that students had positive attitudes and good results on achievement in performance. We recommend the use of educational platforms that are performance learning-centered in universities and for continuing training, as a necessary answer to current workplace demands.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - BEHAVIORS
AB  - While effective preventive measures against COVID-19 are now widely known, many individuals fail to adopt them. This article provides experimental evidence about one potentially important driver of compliance with social distancing: social norms. We asked each of 23,000 survey respondents in Mexico to predict how a fictional person would behave when faced with the choice about whether or not to attend a friend's birthday gathering. Every respondent was randomly assigned to one of four social norms conditions. Expecting that other people would attend the gathering and/or believing that other people approved of attending the gathering both increased the predicted probability that the fictional character would attend the gathering by 25%, in comparison with a scenario where other people were not expected to attend nor to approve of attending. Our results speak to the potential effects of communication campaigns and media coverage of compliance with, and normative views about, COVID-19 preventive measures. They also suggest that policies aimed at modifying social norms or making existing ones salient could impact compliance.

AB  - Recent research has shown the negative effect of meta-dehumanization: the perception that out-group members deny a fully human status to the in-group. So far, no strategies have been investigated that allow the improvement of humanity meta-attributions. In this work, we focused on the two mind perception dimensions: agency (e.g., the capacity of planning actions) and experience (e.g., the capacity of feeling emotions), and investigated whether direct and indirect intergroup friendships are associated with the expectation that the out-group will recognize our mental capacities. A survey was conducted considering the relationship between two regional groups in Italy (Northern and Southern Italians). Participants were Northern university students. A two-level mediation model was tested, in which the exogenous variables were cross-group friendship and extended contact, the first-level mediators were IOS (the inclusion of the out-group in the self mechanism), in-group and out-group norms, and the second-level mediators were anxiety, empathy, and trust toward the out-group. The dependent variables were the evaluations of agency and experience regarding one's group (Northerners) expected by Southerners. Models were estimated by path analysis with observed variables. To replicate prior findings, the attributions of agency and experience to the out-group (Southerners) were also assessed. Results showed that both direct and indirect friendships are related to more positive meta-attributions through the mediation of affective and cognitive factors. Findings have practical implications: contact may favor the expectation of being perceived both as moral agents and as moral patients, thus improving intergroup relations.

AB  - Objectives Edication management is a process in which medications are selected, procured, delivered, prescribed, reviewed, administered and monitored to assure high-quality patient care and safety. This paper explores clinicians' attitudes towards medication management which is both open to influence and strongly linked to successful changes in mediation behaviour. We aimed to investigate effects of engaging in participatory action research to improve emergency medicine clinicians' attitudes to safety in medication management. Setting Emergency department of one university affiliated hospital. Participants A total of 85 clinicians including nurses and physicians partook as participants. Eight managers and clinicians participated as representatives. Design Data are drawn from two-cycle participatory action research. Initially, a situation analysis on the current medication management and clinician views regarding medication management was conducted using three focus groups. Evaluation and reflection data were obtained through qualitative interviews. All qualitative data were analysed using content analysis. Results Clinicians initially expressed negative attitudes towards existing and new plans for medication management, in that they were critical of current medication-related policy and procedures, as well as wary of the potential relevance and utility of potential changes to medication management. Through the action research, improvement actions were implemented including interprofessional courses, pharmacist-led interventions and the development of new guidelines regarding medication management. Participants and their representatives were engaged in all participatory action research stages with different levels of involvement. Extracted results from evaluation and reflection stages revealed that by engaging in the action research and practice new interventions, clinicians' attitude towards medication management was improved. Conclusions The results support the impact of participatory action research on enhancing clinicians' positive attitudes through their involvement in planning and implementing safety enhancing aspects of medication management.

AB  - Background: As COVID-19 poses different levels of threat to people of different ages, health communication regarding prevention measures such as social distancing and isolation may be strengthened by understanding the unique experiences of various age groups.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to examine how people of different ages (1) experienced the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and (2) their respective rates and reasons for compliance or noncompliance with social distancing and isolation health guidance.
   Methods: We fielded a survey on social media early in the pandemic to examine the emotional impact of COVID-19 and individuals' rates and reasons for noncompliance with public health guidance, using computational and content analytic methods of linguistic analysis.
   Results: A total of 17,287 participants were surveyed. The majority (n=13,183, 76.3%) were from the United States. Younger (18-31 years), middle-aged (32-44 years and 45-64 years), and older (>= 65 years) individuals significantly varied in how they described the impact of COVID-19 on their lives, including their emotional experience, self-focused attention, and topical concerns. Younger individuals were more emotionally negative and self-focused, while middle-aged people were other-focused and concerned with family. The oldest and most at-risk group was most concerned with health-related terms but were lower in anxiety (use of fewer anxiety-related terms) and higher in the use of emotionally positive terms than the other less at-risk age groups. While all groups discussed topics such as acquiring essential supplies, they differentially experienced the impact of school closures and limited social interactions. We also found relatively high rates of noncompliance with COVID-19 prevention measures, such as social distancing and self-isolation, with younger people being more likely to be noncompliant than older people (P<.001). Among the 43.1% (n=7456) of respondents who did not fully comply with health orders, people differed substantially in the reasons they gave for noncompliance. The most common reason for noncompliance was not being able to afford to miss work (n=4273, 57.3%). While work obligations proved challenging for participants across ages, younger people struggled more to find adequate space to self-isolate and manage their mental and physical health; middle-aged people had more concerns regarding childcare; and older people perceived themselves as being able to take sufficient precautions.
   Conclusions: Analysis of natural language can provide insight into rapidly developing public health challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic, uncovering individual differences in emotional experiences and health-related behaviors. In this case, our analyses revealed significant differences between different age groups in feelings about and responses to public health orders aimed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To improve public compliance with health orders as the pandemic continues, health communication strategies could be made more effective by being tailored to these age-related differences.

AB  - Governments throughout the world have set social distancing guidelines to manage COVID-19 that reduced opportunities for maintaining social connections through face-to-face interactions. For this study, we conceptualized social collaboration as an intentional social activity in which people are willing to share their knowledge, experience, and expertise. We examined the relative impacts of we-intention (WI), moral trust (MT), and self-motivation (SM) on participation in social collaboration (PSC) and knowledge sharing (KS). We distributed a questionnaire-based survey to a group of Nepalese residents who actively participated in, commented on, and posted questions on social networking sites and received a total of 239 valid questionnaires for analysis. We tested and verified the research model and variables in SPSS 20 to investigate how PSC accelerates KS intention at digital platforms. The standardized path coefficient for PSM to KS was 0.75, suggesting that social collaborator's participation has a strong positive effect on KS purpose. The standardized path coefficients for WI to MT, WI to PSC, WI to SM, MT to PSC, and SM to PSC were 0.55, 0.72, 0.49, 0.42, and 0.67, respectively. All of the values supported the hypothesis and were significant at p <= 0.001.

AB  - BackgroundIn Germany, a mandatory policy on measles vaccination came into effect in March 2020. Physicians, as the main vaccine providers, have a crucial role in implementing it. Mandatory vaccination changes the preconditions under which patient-provider communication on vaccines occurs. Physicians might or might not favor vaccine mandates depending on, among other factors, their attitudes towards vaccines and capabilities as vaccine providers. The aim of this study was to investigate in different subgroups of physicians the association between various factors and their attitudes towards a mandatory policy.MethodsIn total, 2229 physicians participated in a mixed-mode online/paper-pencil survey. Respondents were general practitioners, pediatricians, gynecologists, and internists. Primary determinants were the 5C psychological antecedents of vaccination, communication self-efficacy, patient clientele, projected consequences of the mandate and sociodemographic characteristics. Associations between outcomes and determinants were examined using linear regression analysis.ResultsApproximately 86% of physicians were in favor of the measles vaccine mandate for children. Regarding the 5C model, physicians were more in favor of vaccine mandates when they scored higher on confidence and collective responsibility, and lower on complacency and calculation. They were more in favor of vaccine mandates when they had higher communication self-efficacy and a more vaccine-positive patient clientele. Pediatricians were less in favor of mandates for children (80.0%) than other physician subgroups (87.1%). They were also less convinced that a mandate would result in more children getting vaccinated (59.3%) than other physician subgroups (78.3%). When controlled for these expected consequences, being a pediatrician no longer lowered the attitude towards the mandate.ConclusionsPhysicians in Germany are predominantly in favor of a measles vaccine mandate. Whether or not physicians believe the mandate to be effective in increasing vaccine coverage affects their attitude towards the mandate. In pediatricians, this belief explains their less positive attitude towards the mandate. In addition, physicians need adequate support to communicate well with patients, especially those who are hesitant, to booster their communication self-efficacy. To increase acceptance of vaccine mandates, the 5C model can be used, e.g., collective responsibility can be communicated, to avoid anger stemming from a negative attitude to mandates.

AB  - Introduction: To design, implement and evaluate the effect of an educational intervention on student radiographer attitudes across their educational tenure.
   Methods: In the first phase, an educational intervention that involved didactic lectures, reflective exercises and simulation suits, aimed at improving student radiographer attitudes towards the older person, was designed and implemented. Kogan's attitudes towards older people (KoP) scale was administrated at five test points; pre-intervention; post-intervention; 6 months post intervention; 12 months post intervention and 24 months post intervention. At the final test point these quantitative data was supplemented with qualitative data for triangulation of the findings.
   Results: Students held positive attitudes towards older people pre intervention, these increased significantly post intervention (p = 0.01). However, this increase in positive scores was not noted at 6 months and 12-months post intervention. At 24-months post intervention, although there was a slight increase in positive attitudes when compared to the 6 and 12 month scores, this increase was not found to be significant (p = 0.178)
   Conclusion: The results post-intervention suggested that an educational intervention can have a significant impact on student radiographer's attitudes towards older people. However, the qualitative data suggests that experiences on initial clinical placement can be detrimental to attitudinal scores, particularly if the intervention does not include Dementia care strategies.

AB  - An experiment examined the effects of imagining contact with an illegal immigrant on attitudes towards illegal immigrants and subsequent effects of that attitude change on feelings about other groups (secondary transfer). Compared to a condition in which participants imagined negative contact with an illegal immigrant, participants who imagined positive contact reported more positive attitudes concerning illegal immigrants. Using bootstrapped mediation models, effects of positive imagined contact on attitudes towards illegal immigrants were shown to generalize to other groups that were independently ranked as similar to illegal immigrants, but not to dissimilar groups. This generalization gradient effect was relatively large. Implications for theory and practical applications to prejudice reduction are discussed.

This study was conducted with the aim of exploring knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and barriers toward breast cancer health promotion among community pharmacists in the Palestinian territories. Methods This study was conducted in a cross-sectional design using a questionnaire among community pharmacists. Knowledge of community pharmacists of breast cancer was tested using a 26-item knowledge test. Attitudes and beliefs of the community pharmacists with regard to breast cancer promotion were explored using 14 items. Barrier to breast cancer health promotion were explored using 9 items. Results Data were collected from 200 community pharmacists. The median knowledge score was 69.2 % with and IQR of 15.2 %. Of the community pharmacists, 67.5 % scored 50 % and above in the knowledge test. Multivariate logistic regression showed that community pharmacists who were female in gender were more likely to score 50 % and above in the knowledge test compared to the community pharmacists who were male in gender (OR = 4.73, 95 % CI of 2.26-9.89). The community pharmacists had positive attitudes toward breast cancer health promotion. There was a significant moderate positive correlation between knowledge and attitudes scores (Spearman's rho = 0.37, p-value < 0.001). Lack of reimbursement, lack of enough personnel, lack of time, and fear of offending the patients were the main barriers to breast cancer health promotion (percentage of agreement > 60.0 %). Conclusions This study shed light on the role of community pharmacists in breast cancer health promotion. Pharmacists had good knowledge of breast cancer and positive attitudes toward promoting the health of patients with breast cancer. Further studies are still needed to determine how to integrate community pharmacists in the team of healthcare providers caring for patients with breast cancer.

AB  - Background: SARS-CoV-2 spreads rapidly around the world, and some patients present gastrointestinal symptoms. The existence of the virus in the gastrointestinal tract makes digestive endoscopy a high-risk operation, which associated with an increased risk of infection rate in healthcare workers. This study aimed at exploring current knowledge, practice and attitudes of healthcare workers in endoscopy units in China regarding the status of occupational protection during COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study of a national online survey involving 717 healthcare workers in endoscopy units from 94 medical structures in 24 provinces and municipalities around China was conducted online via a questionnaire platform called Wenjuanxing (wjx.cn). The data were analyzed using correlation approaches, Kruskal-Wallis test for independent samples, and linear regression models.
   Results: Most Chinese healthcare workers in endoscopy units had a good knowledge of COVID-19 (median: 10; range: 7-12), showed a strikingly positive attitude (median: 65; range: 39-65), and carried out good practice (median: 47; range: 14-50) in strengthening the protection, disinfection and management of COVID-19. In terms of attitudes, female staff was more concerned about protection against COVID-19 than male staff (KW = 8.146, P = 0.004). Nurses performed better in both attitude (KW = 2.600, P = 0.009) and practice (KW = 6.358, P < 0.001) than endoscopic physicians when carrying out personal protection, patient care and environmental disinfection against SARS-CoV-2 infection. More positive attitudes in protection were related to better protective behavior in endoscopic daily medical work (r = 0.312; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that Chinese endoscopy healthcare workers have an excellent mastery of knowledge about COVID-19, which is transformed into positive beliefs and attitudes, contributing to good practice during daily endoscopic procedures. Medical staff may benefit from further education. With the gradual normalization amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, protection and management in endoscopy units may be changed accordingly.

AB  - Background: The novel Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 has led to a global pandemic in which case fatality rate (CFR) has varied from country to country. This study aims to identify factors that may explain the variation in CFR across countries. Methods: We identified 24 potential risk factors affecting CFR. For all countries with over 5000 reported COVID-19 cases, we used country-specific datasets from the WHO, the OECD, and the United Nations to quantify each of these factors. We examined univariable relationships of each variable with CFR, as well as correlations among predictors and potential interaction terms. Our final multivariable negative binomial model included univariable predictors of significance and all significant interaction terms. Results: Across the 39 countries under consideration, our model shows COVID-19 case fatality rate was best predicted by time to implementation of social distancing measures, hospital beds per 1000 individuals, percent population over 70 years, CT scanners per 1 million individuals, and (in countries with high population density) smoking prevalence. Conclusion: Our model predicted an increased CFR for countries that waited over 14 days to implement social distancing interventions after the 100th reported case. Smoking prevalence and percentage population over the age of 70 years were also associated with higher CFR. Hospital beds per 1000 and CT scanners per million were identified as possible protective factors associated with decreased CFR.

AB  - Social distancing was found to prevent COVID-19 contagion. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with the public's adherence is important. Acknowledging the importance of emotional wellbeing regarding older people's health, and understanding their emotional state during the pandemic, are crucial. This study assessed factors associated with older people's adherence to social distancing and their emotional status. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1822 respondents above the age of 60. Distancing adherence, negative emotion, trust, social support, threat perception, attitudes, and subjective norms were assessed, and a path analysis was performed. Adherence was positively associated with attitudes (beta = 0.10; p < 0.001), and with subjective norms (beta = 0.19; p < 0.001). Negative emotions were positively associated with threat perception (beta = 0.33; p < 0.001), and negatively associated with social support (beta = -0.13; p < 0.001) and subjective norms (beta = -0.10; p < 0.001). Attitudes mediated the relationship of threat perception (95% CI = 0.009, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.008, 0.029), and social support (95% CI = 0.006, 0.023) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = 0.014, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.026, 0.055), and social support (95% CI = 0.002, 0.048) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = -0.022, -0.006), trust (95% CI = -0.034, -0.010), and social support (95% CI = -0.029, -0.009) with negative emotions. When promoting social distancing adherence, subjective norms and attitudes must be considered, as they play a role in promoting adherence and negative-emotion regulation.

AB  - Purpose
   This purpose of this study was to investigate how consumers' degree of rurality and preference for specific ad types are associated with their attitude toward femvertising (pro-female advertising).
   Design/methodology/approach
   An online survey of US-based respondents over 18 years of age was administered by Qualtrics Panels from February 7 to February 15, 2018. The final sample included 418 respondents.
   Findings
   The more urban the respondents' location was, the more educated they were, leading to more support for gender equality but not a more positive attitude to femvertising. Liking of ads described as "funny," "with a message" and "emotional" was associated with a more positive attitude toward femvertising.
   Research limitations/implications - The findings were limited by the use of a convenience sample and the limited variance in participants' rurality owing to the prevalence of respondents based in or near metropolitan areas. Future research should seek to understand how, if at all, femvertising has affected rather than only reflected social change across a variety of cultural settings.
   Practical implications - Marketers can expect femvertising appeals to be relatively effective across the rural-urban divide. Femvertising campaigns should consider using or continue to use humor, inspiration/ moral reasoning, and emotion in their messages.
   Social implications - The relative lack of controversy surrounding femvertising indicates gender equality may be embraced across social divides, possibly because in the current economic environment, women's empowerment is linked to monetary gains for both companies and households.
   Originality/value
   As the demand for companies to take a stance regarding socially charged issues increases, there is a critical need to understand the factors that impact consumer demand in the context of pro-female messaging. This study expands the literature on the effects of two such factors - rurality and ad type preferences - on attitudes toward advertising promoting egalitarian values. No previous research has investigated the role of these variables in cause-related marketing.

AB  - With our social lives increasingly experienced online, it is critical to understand online relationship development. The current study examined the outcomes of disclosing stigmatized group membership (i.e., being gay or lesbian) earlier (vs. later) in a developing online relationship. Heterosexuals (n = 214) engaged in an experimentally controlled closeness-inducing online interaction with an ostensible partner, learning that he/she was gay/lesbian either before (i.e., earlier) or after (i.e., later) the interaction. Earlier (vs. later) discovery led to a subjectively more positive contact experience, which predicted heightened bond with the partner, itself predicting more positive attitudes toward the partner. Outcomes were uninfluenced by pretest biases and authoritarianism, suggesting the general benefits of disclosing gay/lesbian identity earlier (vs. later) in online relationships.

AB  - Background: Electronic cigarette (e-cigarette) use continues to rise, while there is conflicting evidence about the health effects of its use. As such, research is needed to better determine risks factors for e-cigarette use. Accumulating evidence suggests that attitudes toward e-cigarette use could be a potential risk factor for e-cigarette use. Objectives: This study sought to examine the psychometric properties of the Comparing E-cigarette And Cigarette questionnaire (CEAC), and to replicate a structural model of the relationship between impulsive-related personality traits and e-cigarette use mediated by positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes. Methods: Participants were 525 adults (mean age = 33.42, SD = 11.27) who completed the CEAC and UPPS-P (trait impulsivity) questionnaires online. Results: Confirmatory factor analysis of the CEAC replicated the a priori factor structure of the questionnaire reasonably well (chi(2)(df = 32) =172.85, CFI = 0.94, TLI = 0.91, RMSEA = 0.09 (0.08-0.11, 90% Confidence Interval, SRMR = 0.06). Structural path analysis showed that deficits in conscientiousness was significantly negatively related to e-cigarette attitudes (beta = -0.20, p = .01), while urgency (beta = 0.19, p = .018) showed a significant positive relationship to e-cigarette attitudes. E-cigarette users showed significantly more positive attitudes toward e-cigarettes than nonusers (beta = 0.59, p < .001). No significant direct effects were found between impulsivity-related traits and e-cigarette use. Conclusions: The present study suggests that impulsivity-related traits and attitudes toward e-cigarettes are likely to be important risk factors for e-cigarette use. Future prospective and experimental studies should test if the causal model described in this study predicts risk for e-cigarette use, and whether this model could therefore be used to guide strategies for reducing risk for e-cigarette use.

AB  - Computer-mediated communication is becoming an increasingly popular medium for mental illness self-disclosure. However, little is known about how observers respond to such disclosures (e.g., support or rejections). Using Facebook as a medium of communication, we experimentally examined how different depression disclosure posts can lead to different reactions from observers. In two experimental studies, we examined how (a) the self-presentation used in a depression disclosure on Facebook and (b) peers' supportive responses to the disclosure impacted observers' responses involving social support intention, empathy, social distance, and depression stigma. Participants in both studies (N = 679 and 1,280, respectively) were recruited from Amazon's MTurk. They viewed a mock-up Facebook page in which two factors were manipulated: self-presentation of coping (good vs. poor vs. balanced coping) and peers' supportive responses (present vs. absent). Participants then completed online surveys assessing outcome variables. Results showed that poor coping elicited greater support intention and social distance than good coping across two studies. Further, Study 2 (but not Study 1) showed that participants reported greater empathy and lower social distance when peer responses were present compared to when they were absent. Neither self-presentation nor peers' responses impacted depression stigma in both studies. Our research is the first to experimentally examine observers' reactions to mental illness disclosure posts on social media.

AB  - Aims and objectivesTo evaluate the short-term effects of a suicide care educational intervention on the family's ability to care, family's caring stress levels and family's attitudes towards attempted suicide.
   BackgroundResearch has demonstrated that suicide prevention educational programmes are provided mostly for professional staff and not for the family caregivers of people who are suicidal.
   DesignA experimental design, using two groups and a pre- and postintervention survey method, was used.
   MethodsA randomised controlled study was conducted with 74 family caregivers of people who are suicidal (37 using suicide education and 37 in the control group). The experimental group was provided with a two-hour suicide care education intervention, and the control group received normal suicide care support. Participants were recruited at a Suicide Prevention Centre and two acute psychiatric hospitals between October 2009-December 2010. Three questionnaires were collected: (1) the Suicidal Caring Ability Scale (2) the Caring Stress Scale and (3) the Suicide Attitudes Scale. Descriptive statistics, independent t-tests or Mann-Whitney U-tests were used to analyse the data.
   ResultsThe results demonstrated that there were statistically significant differences in the Suicidal Caring Ability Scale and the Suicide Attitudes Scale but no statistically significant differences in the Caring Stress Scale. That is, the suicide education programme can promote the ability to care for people who are suicidal and can generate a positive attitude towards people who are suicidal from their caregivers.
   ConclusionsFamily caregivers of suicidal individuals who attended the psycho-education programme had an increased caring ability and positive attitudes for their suicidal relatives.
   Relevance to clinical practiceNurses could use the two-hour personal suicidal education programme to increase one's ability to care for their relatives who had attempted suicide and promote one's positive attitudes towards attempted suicide.

AB  - Building upon extant research on the reasoned action approach and message sidedness, this study investigates the persuasive effects of one-sided and two-sided social media messages on the attitude about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination in the context of misinformation. Results of a controlled experiment (N = 251) indicated that compared to the control, one-sided messages addressing misinformation increased positive attitude about the vaccine as prior misperceptions increased. However, a backfire effect may be looming for individuals with lower prior misperceptions. Within the sidedness conditions, refutational two-sided messages were more effective in increasing cognitive attitude for individuals with lower misperceptions; whereas one-sided messages had a persuasive advantage for individuals with higher misperceptions. Theoretical and practical contributions are discussed.

AB  - Although social class was once central to political sociology, it has become increasingly less so; many analysts now believe that one's class position is less important in determining political attitudes and political party preferences. Simultaneously, more attention has been paid to what might be called the culturalization of politics, as epitomized by the US culture wars and stereotypes like the "latte-drinking liberal." Here, political attitudes are regarded as primarily structured by people's lifestyles and broader way of life. But do political preferences have to be explained by either relations of sociomaterial conditions (e.g. class) or cultural orientations (e.g. status and lifestyles)? In this article, we argue in favor of an approach that aims to reconcile these factors, allowing for the empirical mapping of whether and how they intersect in shaping political party preferences. We investigate this by using detailed Norwegian survey data to measure the extent to which intraclass heterogeneity in political party choices can be accounted for by the interaction between class and lifestyle. We employ a novel combination of Multiple Correspondence Analysis (MCA) and Chi-Squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID). In drawing on constructed models of the social space and the space of lifestyles, we show that there are important correspondences between these spaces and that their interaction may help account for party choices. The results highlight the need for a more complex account than that suggested in recent works of cultural stratification research.

AB  - We conducted a longitudinal study to test the bidirectional relationships between intergroup contact, prejudice, and a range of individual difference variables relevant to intergroup relations such as social dominance orientation (SDO) and dispositional empathy (empathic concern, perspective-taking). Participants were Italian high-school students, who completed a questionnaire at two time points separated by an interval of approximately seven months, focusing on immigrants as the outgroup. Results provide support for the importance of contact in reducing prejudice and changing personality. In particular, contact (i.e., cross-group friendships) was longitudinally associated with less SDO (although the effect was marginal) and more positive behavioral intentions. In addition, SDO revealed negative effects over time, on dispositional empathy and behavioral intentions. Mixed findings emerged for dispositional empathy, with positive effects for perspective-taking (negative association with SDO), and negative effects for empathic concern (negative association with contact, and positive associations with SDO and avoidance behavioral tendencies). Results are discussed in terms of importance of an approach that takes into account both situational and personality variables, and of the need to conduct studies that simultaneously consider a wide range of variables relevant to prejudice.

AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

AB  - Greek pre-service teachers' level of ocean literacy was assessed using a revised questionnaire concerning ocean content knowledge and an instrument about ocean stewardship. Rasch analyses showed that the items of both measures were well targeted to the sample. Pre-service teachers possessed a moderate knowledge of ocean sciences issues and positive attitudes toward ocean stewardship; they obtained most information on ocean content from the Internet and mass media and less from formal education, nongovernmental organizations, books, and out-of-school settings. Students who mostly preferred the Internet and mass media scored significantly higher on the knowledge questionnaire. The results could contribute to the enhancement of teachers' ocean literacy.

AB  - This study was conducted to conceptualise advertising value and consumer attitudes towards advertisements. The research was developed to reveal the effect of the source of advertisements on credibility perception through the theoretical framework of Ducoffe's (1995) advertising value model. The research objective is to identify source derogation in terms of credibility to create advertising value and a positive attitude towards advertisements launched through the Facebook social network. In this regard, the study used three distinct sources to generate and introduce product promotional messages: an associative reference group, an aspirational reference group and marketers themselves. This research revealed significant differences in developing advertisement value and forming a favourable attitude towards advertisements when the product-related message was developed by these three distinct groups, who have different source derogations.

AB  - In this study, we examine the role of social trust as an individual and a neighborhood-level determinant for radical right-wing populist party preferences. We argue that high social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences and that this relationship is essentially mediated by negative attitudes toward immigrants. Using data from the Netherlands' Life Course Study, we employ multilevel structural equation modeling to test our argument on support for the Party for Freedom (PVV). The results reveal that individual social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. Beyond the micro-level relationship, we find that neighborhood social trust decreases radical right-wing populist party preferences. In either case, the effects are mediated by anti-immigrant sentiments. Our findings provide evidence for the importance of social trust as a multilevel construct in explanations for radical right-wing populist party preferences.

AB  - This article investigated the effects of attributions that are derived from being aware of interconnectedness in reducing public stigma for people with schizophrenia. The first study tested the mediating role of biogenetic, psychosocial, societal, and personal attributions on the relationship between interconnectedness and social distance from people with schizophrenia. In the second study, an experiment with four conditions was employed to test the incremental effects of societal and personal attributions over biopsychosocial attribution. Study 1 showed interconnectedness is associated with less social distance only through personal attribution. Study 2 found levels of personal advocacy differ between pre- and postexperiment among four conditions across time. Public responsibility at postexperiment mediated the relationship between conditions involving personal attribution and less social distance and greater personal advocacy at 2-week follow-up. These studies highlight the importance of accounting for societal factors and reminding all members of 4 the society their interconnectedness to achieve stigma reduction.

AB  - Contemporary science and environmental news coverage of global warming increasingly portrays scientific consensus. Political news coverage of global warming, however, typically portrays controversy. We hypothesize that attention to science and environmental news is associated with beliefs more consistent with the global warming science and higher risk perceptions, and that the opposite is true of attention to political news. Furthermore, we hypothesize that science-based beliefs and risk perceptions are positively associated with support for policies aiming at reducing global warming. These hypotheses were confirmed by survey data from a nationally representative sample of adults (N = 2,164). These findings support and extend the cognitive mediation model of news learning and have important practical ramifications.

AB  - This study was carried out to assess perceptions and attitudes of key informants towards national food control systems (NFCSs) in developing countries. Two Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries were selected, namely Botswana and Mauritius. The methodology involved qualitative and quantitative techniques. The qualitative method was an in-depth interview of key informants to identify strengths, weaknesses and improvements relating to the NFCSs. The quantitative method involved the use of a 5 point likert scale where key informants were requested to express their level of agreement with attitude statements pertaining to the NFCS. The participants were twenty-two and twenty key informants from Mauritius and Botswana respectively. Specific and common issues emerged from the key informants' evaluation of the NFCS in their respective countries. Strengths, weaknesses and improvements perceived by the majority of key informants in Botswana and Mauritius, were identified. Perceived strengths: regulations are based on international standards; analytical services use internationally recognised methods; participation in international meetings related to food control. Perceived weaknesses: the food laws do not cover primary production; food control laboratories are not accredited; food control administration activities are spread across a number of government ministries with overlapping responsibilities; the lack of code of practice and inspection manuals; implementation of HACCP is not required by the law. Proposed improvements: the law should cover primary production; accreditation of food control laboratories; development of enforcement codes of practice; setting up of a Food Control Agency; the law should make HACCP mandatory. The median of responses to attitude statements revealed common trends in key informants' expressed attitude to most defined NFCS issues. In both countries, most key informants indicated agreement with negative attitude statements and disagreement with positive attitude statements. This research constitutes a starting point for further regional studies to drive harmonisation of NFCSs. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This research is an attempt to examine the developmental relationship between democracy and the socioeconomic conditions in Bulgaria. The assumption is that one of the factors contributing to the negative attitude towards democracy in Bulgaria is the high level of social inequality. After discussing the relevance of studying democracy and socioeconomic conditions from a developmental perspective, the paper traces the socioeconomic development of Bulgaria from 1989 to date and examines public perceptions of social inequality in the country. The research has not revealed any overall negative public attitude towards democracy in Bulgaria. However, the findings have demonstrated a clear tendency for the public support for democracy to decline reflecting the growth of social inequality.

AB  - This research compared the effectiveness of fear and hope appeals in green communications when the issue was framed as either global or local. Results showed that when the environmental issue was framed as global, a fear appeal enhanced viewers' attention, positive attitude toward the green issue, and behavioral intention more than a hope appeal did. The opposite was found when the environmental issue was framed as local. To enhance external validity, Study 2 incorporated actual donation amount and replicated the results found in Study 1. Perspective taking, the act of viewing a situation or understanding of a concept from an alternative point of view, served as an underlying mechanism.

AB  - Conceptual frameworks in the realm of climate-related policy, attitudes and behavior frequently argue that moral emotions play a crucial role in mobilizing pro-environmental action. Yet, little is known about the direct impact of moral emotions on environmental attitudes and behavior. Drawing on emotion research in the context of intergroup relations, the current paper investigates the role of guilty conscience (guilt and shame) as well as other emotions (anger, sadness, pride, and emotional coldness) in motivating pro-environmental behavior intentions and actual behavior as a specific form of reparative action. When confronted with human-caused (vs. seemingly natural) environmental damages, participants (N = 114) reported significantly more guilty conscience. Importantly, participants in the human-caused condition were significantly more likely to spontaneously display actual pro-environmental behavior (sign a petition addressing environmental issues). Highlighting its psychological significance in motivating pro-environmental behavior, a guilty conscience mediated the experimental manipulation's effect on behavioral intentions as well as on actual behavior. We conclude by discussing the potential of moral emotions in developing timely and sustainable climate policies and interventions.

AB  - Personality's direct effects on various aspects of political attitudes and behavior have received substantial attention, yet few investigate its indirect effects-even though several studies posit that these may be even more important. We utilize original survey data from five European countries (Denmark, Germany, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) to provide a comprehensive, cross-national test of the extent to which personal predispositions have a direct versus indirect impact on public support for the European Union (EU). Knowing that ideology is an important determinant of views towards European integration, we look specifically at the extent to which ideological self-placement mediates the effect of the Big Five personality traits on EU attitudes. We indeed find evidence of significant mediation-most robustly for the traits of openness, conscientiousness, and emotional stability-particularly in contexts where party-system complexity is low. These results reiterate that personality matters-both directly and indirectly-for political attitudes and behavior, confirm that ideology is an important mechanism transferring personality effects forward, and suggest that scholars would do well to further evaluate alternative pathways through which personality's effects travel.

AB  - Background COVID-19 caused by a new form of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) first appeared in China end of 2019 and quickly spread to all counties of the world. To slow down the spread of the virus and to limit the pressure on the health care systems, different regulations and recommendations have been implemented by authorities, comprising amongst others the closure of all entertainment venues and social distancing. These measures have received mixed reactions, particularly from young individuals, with many not following available advice. Drawing on the information in social media discussion forums, the present study explores the reasons why people ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities and why the authorities are unable to produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak. Methods Three open-access social media forums (Reddit, Twitter, and YouTube comments) were systematically searched with respect to COVID-19-related beliefs, attitudes, and behaviours of individuals. The data was retrieved in the first 3 weeks of March 2020. Qualitative document analysis and qualitative content analysis were used as the methodical approach. The data was reviewed by all authors and jointly interpreted to minimise inconsistencies. Results The study reveals that reasons such as information pollution on social media, the persistence of uncertainty about the rapidly spreading virus, the impact of the social environment on the individual, and fear of unemployment associated with inequality in the distribution of income lead people to ignore the orders and recommendations of the authorities. The findings suggest that government representatives and politicians could not produce a shared sense of inclusion concerning protective measures against the COVID-19 outbreak, due to not building trust among the public and taking concrete economic steps to satisfy them. Conclusion In uncertain crises, transparency in the presentation of information and government policies emerge as influential determinants in creating social susceptibility and solidarity. The differences between social classes constitute one of the important factors that affect the decision-making mechanisms of individuals in determining the necessary steps to be undertaken in times of crisis.

AB  - Stigma in mental illness is a problem fueled by misrepresentation by the media and the assimilation of parent opinion, noted in those as young as six years old. Intervening in adolescence is critical given juxtaposition of increased judgement/fear of judgement and the onset of serious mental illness. This paper details the efforts of an intervention designed to specifically target the perception of dangerousness, social distancing, and use of stigmatizing language. A total of 124 high school freshman participated in the interactive presentation delivered over the course of a typical 40 min class period. An identical survey with a 5-point Likert scale was administered before and after to measure level of agreement with stigmatizing statements. Most participants reported prior exposure through the media (86.6%) and through conversations with family/friends (67.7%). Post intervention, improvement was seen in the perception of dangerousness (MD = 0.45, t = 4.435, p = <0.001), the need for social distancing (measure 1: MD = 0.148, t = 1.785, p = 0.039; measure 2: MD = 0.142, t = 1.773, p = 0.04), and understanding of the experience of those with serious mental illness (MD = 0.377, t = 3.378, p = <0.001). No significant difference was seen in terms of stigmatizing language use (MD = 0.114, t = 1.192, p = 0.118). This study supports the delivery of anti-stigma education to adolescents that avoids the biogenetic and contact approaches, embraces the continuum model of mental health, normalizes psychotic experiences, addresses dangerousness with data, identifies prominent figures with mental illness, and uses personalized statistics to demonstrate why this topic is of importance.

AB  - Objective: 40 - 50% of cancer patients use complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). While oncologists are skeptical regarding CAM, no data has been published with respect to nurses. The objective of our study was to learn about the attitude of nurses with a specialization in cancer care towards CAM. Subjects and methods: A survey was performed on nurses in Germany, Switzerland and Austria using an online questionnaire, which addressed attitude towards, and experiences with CAM. Results: 877 participants filled in the questionnaire. 61% have a very positive or positive attitude towards complementary (CM) and 20% towards alternative medicine (AM). 71% rate their knowledge as high to moderate regarding CM. 43% use some source of information on CAM and 48% would like more training on CAM. The most important reason to use CM is the patient becoming active (50%). CM is a means for reducing side effects (46%), increasing coping (42%), or quality of life (47%). For AM, less than 20% give positive statements. Risks as a result of interactions and side effects are anticipated by 40 (CM) and 50% (AM). Conclusion: In sum, many but not all participants are aware of the pros and cons of CAM. In general, they have a positive attitude towards CM. In order to make CM safer, a structured training should be offered.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in protracted social isolation across the globe due to the implementation of social distancing to limit the transmission of the virus. People have relied overwhelmingly on digital technology/social media to manage physical distancing while maintaining social connection, resulting in concerns about loneliness and technology's impacts during isolation. Cairns worked with students from her undergraduate methods course to research people's experiences related to COVID-19 and their connection strategies during isolation. The study served multiple purposes, including (1) providing academic insight into the variety of experiences with social isolation as well as technologies/platforms for connecting during COVID-19, including those technologies used in the classroom, (2) encouraging students to explore and discuss what they were facing during the pandemic, and (3) providing creative anthropological research methods training during a time of social isolation for students. This work finds that COVID-19 has fundamentally re-contextualized the relationships between people, technology, and loneliness. While individual experiences during COVID-19 are nuanced, technology served to facilitate connections and provided opportunities for new modes of interaction and meaningful relationship-building during the pandemic. This work also informs future pedagogical approaches to teaching during times of crisis and/or at a distance.

AB  - This study examines the effects of the interaction between regulatory focus frames and self-construal (i.e., regulatory fit effects), and the mediating effects of involvement on responses to advertising messages that promote recycling. The results show that promotion-focused frames generate more positive attitudes and behavioral intentions in individuals with interdependent self-construal, whereas there was no differential framing effect in individuals with independent self-construal. The findings demonstrate a unique pattern of regulatory fit effects, also mediated by involvement with the recycling issues, in the context of environmental appeals. This study contributes to the findings of regulatory goal compatibility by investigating the effects of regulatory focus, self-construal, and involvement interplay in the context of recycling advertising campaign. Theoretical and practical implications of the study are discussed.

AB  - The objective of the research was to obtain data on the attitudes of the future generation of teachers towards using new media in their didactic and educational activities. Additionally, the text presents the level of these teachers' self-evaluation regarding the use of new ICT-based devices. Indicators of both variables are compared. The research was conducted in the biggest Polish pedagogical university, using a sample of 450 students. The technique used was the diagnostic survey. The data were collected in the first half of 2019 as part of the international project SELI. Based on the data obtained, it was noticed that pre-service teachers do not form a homogeneous group, which means there are individuals presenting a very positive attitudes towards the introduction of new media as well as those who are careful when it comes to using ICT in teaching. Most respondents emphasize that using ICT in education is necessary and that this trend is irreversible. There is a minor group of future teachers who do not know about websites and software to support learning and teaching (about 10%). Almost half of the respondents present divided views regarding the role of ICT in stimulating engagement, motivation and interest among students. However, it should also be noted that almost half of the interviewees state that the use of smartphones at school should be banned. A positive attitude to new technologies in one area coincides with a high opinion about ICT in other areas. The self-evaluation of the teachers' own competencies is also internally coherent, meaning that respondents who declared that they had no problems with using, for example, new devices, also have no problems with using new websites or software.

AB  - Prior research on public attitudes towards the police has tended to refer to three concepts-satisfaction with the police, confidence in the police, and trust in the police-entirely interchangeably. Recently, there has been a call to differentiate these three concepts. The current study seeks to address this research gap by analysing a unique Canadian dataset that includes all three concepts. The main research question that the study tries to answer is whether significant co-variates will differ in predicting the three concepts. The findings indicate that different models have slightly different demographic co-variates, but they share three of the same co-variates: dissatisfaction with prior citizen-police contacts, victimization, and neighbourhood conditions. The study suggests that while differentiating these three concepts may be promising, it is important, efficient, and practical to handle the three shared co-variates to improve overall public attitudes towards the police.

AB  - Background Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) endure healthcare biases that are partially due to a lack of disease-specific education among healthcare providers. Furthermore, there is a paucity of age-appropriate health education materials for patients with SCD. To address this gap, we created the GRAPES tool (Game to Raise Awareness for Patient/Provider/Public Education of SCD; ) and hypothesized that utilization of the GRAPES tool will improve patient and provider SCD knowledge and mitigate healthcare bias. Procedure The GRAPES tool is an online, single-player trivia game. A feasibility study was conducted in pediatric patients with SCD at age 10 years or older and registered nurses. All participants were assessed for change in SCD-relevant knowledge and satisfaction post-gameplay. Providers were assessed for change in attitudes toward patients with SCD post-gameplay. Results Twenty-five patients and 25 providers were enrolled. All participants (P < 0.001), and specifically within the patient (P = 0.019) and provider (P < 0.001) cohorts, showed increased SCD knowledge post-gameplay. Both patients and providers reported high satisfaction with GRAPES. Provider negative attitudes were reduced (P = 0.007) post-gameplay without change in positive attitudes (P = 0.959). Providers demonstrated post-gameplay reduced (P = 0.001) belief that patients' changing behavior around providers indicates inappropriate drug-seeking behavior. Conclusions This study demonstrates the feasibility and acceptability of the GRAPES tool as a potential digital, behavioral intervention to provide educational materials for patients and their providers in different clinical settings, improve knowledge about SCD, and decrease stigma against patients with SCD in the healthcare setting.

AB  - Background: Health authorities can minimize the impact of an emergent infectious disease outbreak through effective and timely risk communication, which can build trust and adherence to subsequent behavioral messaging. Monitoring the psychological impacts of an outbreak, as well as public adherence to such messaging, is also important for minimizing long-term effects of an outbreak.
   Objective: We used social media data from Twitter to identify human behaviors relevant to COVID-19 transmission, as well as the perceived impacts of COVID-19 on individuals, as a first step toward real-time monitoring of public perceptions to inform public health communications.
   Methods: We developed a coding schema for 6 categories and 11 subcategories, which included both a wide number of behaviors as well codes focused on the impacts of the pandemic (eg, economic and mental health impacts). We used this to develop training data and develop supervised learning classifiers for classes with sufficient labels. Classifiers that performed adequately were applied to our remaining corpus, and temporal and geospatial trends were assessed. We compared the classified patterns to ground truth mobility data and actual COVID-19 confirmed cases to assess the signal achieved here.
   Results: We applied our labeling schema to approximately 7200 tweets. The worst-performing classifiers had F1 scores of only 0.18 to 0.28 when trying to identify tweets about monitoring symptoms and testing. Classifiers about social distancing, however, were much stronger, with F1 scores of 0.64 to 0.66. We applied the social distancing classifiers to over 228 million tweets. We showed temporal patterns consistent with real-world events, and we showed correlations of up to -0.5 between social distancing signals on Twitter and ground truth mobility throughout the United States.
   Conclusions: Behaviors discussed on Twitter are exceptionally varied. Twitter can provide useful information for parameterizing models that incorporate human behavior, as well as for informing public health communication strategies by describing awareness of and compliance with suggested behaviors.

AB  - Social media has been integral for the organization and success of right-wing populist movements in the United States and Europe. Within online communities, discussions take place in which ideologies are formulated, iterated upon, and disseminated. One particular forum, hosted on the popular website reddit.com, r/The_Donald, has received media attention for its political influence. Despite the influence of online spaces in populist, far-right movements, relatively little attention has been paid to qualitative content of discussions that take place within such spaces, including r/The_Donald. Guided by a social representations approach, we analyzed how discussions on r/The_Donald represent sociopolitical groups. We focused on discussions of political affiliations, race relations, immigration, and culture. From a dataset of 8,198 posts, we selected 1,292 segments from 883 unique Reddit usernames and analyzed them using qualitative content analysis. The results showed that the majority of posts discussed liberals, race relations, and conspiracy theories, and in these posts, liberals and liberal ideas were delegitimized and mocked through their representations. These posts represented conservatives through antinomic contrast and comparison to liberals and liberal policies. The meanings of those representations in intergroup relations are discussed.

TI  - Improving vaccination coverage and offering vaccine to all school-age children allowed uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County, WA: Modeling analysis

AB  - The rapid spread of highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants combined with slowing pace of vaccination in Fall 2021 created uncertainty around the future trajectory of the epidemic in King County, Washington, USA. We analyzed the benefits of offering vaccination to children ages 5- 11 and expanding the overall vaccination coverage using mathematical modeling. We adapted a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission, calibrated to data from King County, Washington, to simulate scenarios of vaccinating children aged 5-11 with different starting dates and different proportions of physical interactions (PPI) in schools being restored. Dynamic social distancing was implemented in response to changes in weekly hospitalizations. Reduction of hospitalizations and estimated time under additional social distancing measures are reported over the 2021-2022 school year. In the scenario with 85% vaccination coverage of 12+ year-olds, offering early vaccination to children aged 5-11 with 75% PPI was predicted to prevent 756 (median, IQR 301-1434) hospitalizations cutting youth hospitalizations in half compared to no vaccination and largely reducing the need for additional social distancing measures over the school year. If, in addition, 90% overall vaccination coverage was reached, 60% of remaining hospitalizations would be averted and the need for increased social distancing would almost certainly be avoided. Our work suggests that uninterrupted in-person schooling in King County was partly possible because reasonable precaution measures were taken at schools to reduce infectious contacts. Rapid vaccination of all school-aged children provides meaningful reduction of the COVID-19 health burden over this school year but only if implemented early. It remains critical to vaccinate as many people as possible to limit the morbidity and mortality associated with future epidemic waves.

TI  - The general fault in our fault lines
T2  - NATURE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR
LA  - English
AB  - Ruggeri et al. tested perceptions of opposing political party members in 10,207 participants from 26 countries. Results show that beliefs about others are overly negative but could be more realistic with transparency about actual group beliefs.
   Pervading global narratives suggest that political polarization is increasing, yet the accuracy of such group meta-perceptions has been drawn into question. A recent US study suggests that these beliefs are inaccurate and drive polarized beliefs about out-groups. However, it also found that informing people of inaccuracies reduces those negative beliefs. In this work, we explore whether these results generalize to other countries. To achieve this, we replicate two of the original experiments with 10,207 participants across 26 countries. We focus on local group divisions, which we refer to as fault lines. We find broad generalizability for both inaccurate meta-perceptions and reduced negative motive attribution through a simple disclosure intervention. We conclude that inaccurate and negative group meta-perceptions are exhibited in myriad contexts and that informing individuals of their misperceptions can yield positive benefits for intergroup relations. Such generalizability highlights a robust phenomenon with implications for political discourse worldwide.

AB  - Three experiments address how people react to a sexual abuse victim compared to a nonvictim when a justification for negative evaluation is available or not available. A harm-doing victim was rated lower on expected job performance and higher on desired social distance than a harm-doing nonvictim. When subsequent harm-doing was absent, judgments of a victim and nonvictim did not differ on expected job performance or social distance. Experiment 2 replicated the results of Experiment 1 and revealed that the order in which victimization history and harm-doing information were presented had no effect. Experiment 3 showed that participants desired greater social distance from a harm-doing victim compared to a non-harm-doing victim to the extent they thought the target should have derived benefits from the childhood victimization. Implications for judgments of harm-doers-depending on whether their victimization history is known or not-are considered.

AB  - Introduction Suicide is the 9th leading cause of death in Canada, and a common reason for patients to present to Canadian emergency departments (ED). Little knowledge exists around Canadian emergency physicians (EPs) attitudes toward and understanding of individuals with suicidal ideation. Methods We developed a web-based survey on suicide knowledge, which was pilot tested by two EPs and one psychiatrist for clarity and content. The survey was distributed via email to attending physician members of the Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians. Data were described using counts, means, medians and interquartile ranges. The Understanding of Suicidal Patients (USP) Scale is an 11-point questionnaire to assess healthcare providers' attitudes toward individuals with suicidal ideation. Other questions pertaining to suicidal ideation, self-perceptions on ability to treat suicidal patients, and personal experiences with suicide were asked in Likert format. Results One hundred eighty-eight Canadian EPs responded to the survey (15% response rate), with a median age of 49 (IQR 39-55), academic practice reported by 55% of respondents, and 65% of respondents identified as male. The mean USP score was 21.8 (95% CI 21.1-22.5), which indicates a generally positive attitude and willingness to provide care for suicidal patients. Only 17% of respondents had participated in specific training for treatment of suicidal patients in the last five years, while the majority of respondents estimate treating 5-15 patients with suicidal ideation a month. Sixty four percent of respondents indicated they had the skills to screen patients for suicidal ideation, but less than one-third felt they could create a personalized safety plan for patients. Conclusions Respondents have a generally positive attitude toward treating individuals with suicidal ideation. Respondents scored highly on the USP scale that measured willingness to provide care for and empathize with suicidal patients. Respondents felt they had the skills to adequately screen patients for suicidal ideation. Key gaps in knowledge were identified suggesting improved residency and ongoing medical education opportunities are needed to better improve care for this vulnerable population.

AB  - The management of natural resources has become a crucial agenda item at the community level of every country, due to the importance of a community's direct involvement in the stewardship of these resources. The sustainable management of natural resources is not easy without the involvement of the community. To know the attitudes of residents in the communities in close proximity to Central Karakoram National Park (CKNP) towards natural resource sustainable management policy, a study of CKNP in northern Pakistan was conducted. This is the first community study for this park. It is difficult to overstate the economic and geographic importance of this national resource to the Pakistani people at local and national levels, as well as at the international level. This is the world's highest public park; as a natural resource it is not only important to the local community, it also has great relevance internationally. The study attempted to gauge the attitudes of the local community towards the sustainable management practices of CKNP. The results of this study showed generally positive attitudes towards the park. The majority of respondents revealed that the park's primary appeal is its geographic location. Households were afraid that pollution in the park will gradually destroy the park's natural resources. For sustainable management of the CKNP, community members expressed willingness to contribute to the betterment of park through volunteerism. Community members praised the government's supportive actions, including budgetary support and public-awareness campaigns. As such, the positive attitude of the community towards the CKNP also revealed new insights for the community-centered sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries. This study also provides a research gap for future work relating to the sustainable management of community-based natural resources to consider more factors beside the factors used in this study.

AB  - By analyzing variability in credibility assessments of news outlets CNN and FOX, this study extends prior research focusing on perceptions of credibility for a single media source. Using national survey data from 2006 and 2008, we find that demographic and political characteristics help to explain different patterns of perceived credibility. Those detecting larger differences between CNN and FOX are more politically knowledgeable and hold more polarized political attitudes. Some findings coincide with research on overall news media trust. Yet other findings demonstrate the importance of considering different patterns. Liberal Democrats were more likely than conservative Republicans to find neither network particularly credible, for example. We also examine the connection between selective exposure and credibility. We find evidence that credibility perceptions for both networks mediate the relationship between political predispositions and cable news use.

AB  - BackgroundDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, many humorous videos on how to practice social distancing appeared on social media. However, the effect of using humor as a crisis communication strategy to persuade people to conform to social distancing rules is not known. ObjectiveDrawing on the literature on humorous message framing and crisis communication, this research explores the effectiveness of a humorous message in communicating social distancing rules in two crisis severity phases (low vs. high severity) and also evaluates how humor affects individuals' online and offline engagement intentions during the COVID-19 pandemic. MethodsA 2 (message framing: humorous vs. non-humorous) x 2 (crisis severity phase: low vs. high) between-subjects design experiment was conducted to test the research questions during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in China from January 30 to February 2, 2020. ResultsThe results showed that the severity of the phase of a health crisis can significantly affect stakeholders' online and offline responses toward the disease. More specifically, in a low severity phase, humor led to increased source likability for the message, and more online and offline engagement intentions. However, no differences between a humorous and non-humorous message in perceived risk were observed. Whereas, in a high severity crisis phase, humor reduced individuals' offline engagement intentions and a decrease in perceived risk, no significant difference was found between a humorous and non-humorous message on source likeability. ConclusionHumor can motivate both more online engagement and offline protective action intention when the crisis severity phase is low, while when crisis severity soars, a non-humorous message should be more desirable. More specifically, using humor in communicating information about an infectious disease can enhance the spokesperson's likeability in a low severity phase, and also helps to spread health information to a larger audience. While, the negative side of using humor in communicating an infectious disease appears in severe crisis phases, as it then decreased the public's perception of risk, and triggers less protective actions. Going beyond previous research, this study recognized that crisis severity changes in different phases of the spread of infectious disease, thereby providing actionable strategy selections for crisis practitioners in a dynamic communication environment.

AB  - The study examines how program-induced mood and a five-second countdown warning affect reception of midroll video commercials. Building on mood regulation theory, findings from three studies suggest that program-induced moods and five-second countdowns systematically influence advertising effectiveness. When the main program is tragic (comedic) and when a countdown precedes (does not precede) the midroll ad, viewers have more positive attitudes toward the ad and purchase intentions. The findings are replicated in realistic (Study 1) and controlled (Studies 2A and 2B) settings.

AB  - The present study aimed to understand how status-oriented individual differences such as narcissistic antagonism, narcissistic extraversion, and moral grandstanding motivations may have longitudinally predicted both behavioral and social media responses during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Via YouGov, a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults was recruited in August of 2019 (N = 2,519; M-age = 47.5, SD = 17.8; 51.4% women) and resampled in May of 2020, (N = 1,533). Results indicated that baseline levels of narcissistic antagonism were associated with lower levels of social distancing and lower compliance with public health recommended behaviors. Similarly, dominance oriented moral grandstanding motivations predicted greater conflict with others over COVID-19, greater engagement in status-oriented social media behaviors about COVID-19, and lower levels of social distancing.

KW  - 4.0 industry

AB  - Background: The article addresses the issue of attitudes towards safety at work in the context of subjective variables such as psychological stress and the subjective self-efficacy of workers in the aviation sector. The research was exploratory in nature. It focused on capturing the individual experiences of ground handling staff at Polish and Slovak airports. Among the 326 people surveyed were engineers, firefighters, mechanics and electricians - a crew that works in difficult and threatening working conditions on a daily basis, often experiencing unexpected accidents and breakdowns. The psychosocial factors in industry 4.0 and this branch of industry itself are - according to the authors - verified empirically quite poorly. Taking care of safety at work and strengthening a positive attitude towards safety seems to be a key aspect of management in such units. Material and Methods: The Polish Questionnaire of Attitude towards Safety by M. Znajmiecka-Sikora, the Generalized Self-Efficacy Scale and the Plopa and Makarowski Stress Feeling Questionnaire were used in the research. Results: The statistical analyses carried out, including regression analyses and a model of analysis of mediation between variables, have indicated that this sense of effectiveness is a key positive predictor of every aspect related to strengthening attitudes towards safety (a cognitive aspect [beta = 0.21, p < 0.001], an affective aspect [beta = 0.15, p = 0.001] and a behavioral aspect [beta = 0.15, p = 0.002]), as well as the overall level of attitude towards safety (beta = 0.19, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The sense of effectiveness is an important mediator between the level of perceived stress and attitudes towards safety, which means that as the subjectively perceived sense of self-efficacy increases, the level of experienced stress decreases and thus the positive attitude towards safe actions and behaviors in the workplace is strengthened.

AB  - International exchange programmes have been previously conceptualised based on the opinion leader model'. It expects participants to form positive attitudes towards the host country, and to become influential back home. However, the micro-processes through which this goal can be achieved remain undertheorised. Drawing from Interaction Ritual Theory, this article argues that international exchanges consist of a chain of rituals. They strategically immerse targeted individuals into personal experiences with a shared focus on the host country, transforming the latter into a symbol charged with emotional energy and (strategically devisable) cognitive content. The symbol (now affectively and cognitively laden) is then recurrently invoked to re-circulate through the networks of the participants. A case study of a programme in which the symbol Poland' became systematically charged with the content of multiculturality' illustrates this proposition. Practical and theoretical implications (e.g. for the literature on socialisation, norm-diffusion, and face-to-face diplomacy) in international relations are discussed.

AB  - Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being used in healthcare. Here, AI-based chatbot systems can act as automated conversational agents, capable of promoting health, providing education, and potentially prompting behaviour change. Exploring the motivation to use health chatbots is required to predict uptake; however, few studies to date have explored their acceptability. This research aimed to explore participants' willingness to engage with AI-led health chatbots. Methods The study incorporated semi-structured interviews (N-29) which informed the development of an online survey (N-216) advertised via social media. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed thematically. A survey of 24 items explored demographic and attitudinal variables, including acceptability and perceived utility. The quantitative data were analysed using binary regressions with a single categorical predictor. Results Three broad themes: 'Understanding of chatbots', 'AI hesitancy' and 'Motivations for health chatbots' were identified, outlining concerns about accuracy, cyber-security, and the inability of AI-led services to empathise. The survey showed moderate acceptability (67%), correlated negatively with perceived poorer IT skills OR = 0.32 [CI95%:0.13-0.78] and dislike for talking to computers OR = 0.77 [CI95%:0.60-0.99] as well as positively correlated with perceived utility OR = 5.10 [CI95%:3.08-8.43], positive attitude OR = 2.71 [CI95%:1.77-4.16] and perceived trustworthiness OR = 1.92 [CI95%:1.13-3.25]. Conclusion Most internet users would be receptive to using health chatbots, although hesitancy regarding this technology is likely to compromise engagement. Intervention designers focusing on AI-led health chatbots need to employ user-centred and theory-based approaches addressing patients' concerns and optimising user experience in order to achieve the best uptake and utilisation. Patients' perspectives, motivation and capabilities need to be taken into account when developing and assessing the effectiveness of health chatbots.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the role of socio-political attitudes and motivational tendencies supposed to mark closed-mindedness, as well as other relevant variables of individual differences (Disintegration, i.e., proneness to psychotic-like experiences/behaviors and Death Anxiety), in the Militant Extremist Mindset (MEM). A community sample of 600 young respondents (Serbs, Bosniaks, and Albanians, aged 18-30) was recruited within a multiethnic region of Serbia that experienced armed conflict during the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. The best-fitted SEM model, incorporating measurement and structural relationships between the variables, showed that the latent factor of Closed-mindedness predicted all three aspects of MEM as well as Neighborhood Grudge, that is, resentment toward neighboring ethnicities. The effects of Disintegration and Death Anxiety on MEM were entirely mediated by Closed-mindedness. Compared to previous findings, Closed-mindedness appears to represent the most important set of cognitive and motivational tendencies that channel protracted intergroup tensions into militant extremism.

AB  - Social media represents a space where the more politically engaged can commune around issues and events of importance and exchange views. Often the spaces created, especially when hosted by a partisan or campaign organization, tend to be ideologically homogenous eschewing debate or critique. The UK's referendum on EU membership represents an opportunity to explore how citizens use social media, in this case Facebook, to express their political views in relation to a controversial and polarizing issue of significant national importance. The data extracted from the public pages of the four most important Leave and Remain campaigns are used to explore the strategies of Leave and Remain campaigns as well as the reactions of subscribers. The data show the Leave campaign the most proactive posters, creating more engaging content and, in turn, gaining an advantage in terms of visibility online. Leave supporters were also more prone to act as cheerleaders for the campaign applauding attacks on Remain leaders and spokespeople and promoting campaign slogans. Remain subscribers similarly endorsed negative messages but were keener to debate the detail behind slogans and critique the official campaign strategy and messaging. Endogenous factors relating to the demographic of the supporter groups and the campaign messages, as well as exogenous factors relating to the social norms of behaviour with the pages, are discussed as explanatory factors for the different dynamics observed. Notwithstanding the limitations of big data discourse analysis, we thus suggest the Facebook communities around each campaign page can be seen as microcosms of wider supporter groups and thus we propose that analysis of discourse within social media platforms such as Facebook allow better understanding of wider societal engagement with political communication and the dynamics of contestation that exist around political issues and events.

Most respondents had heard about vitiligo (96.9%). The median knowledge score was four out of eight and median attitude score was six out of eight. Social media/Internet was the most commonly reported source of information (34.7%), followed by family/friends/acquaintances (30%). Higher proportions of correct responses were recorded regarding the noninfectious nature of vitiligo (85.0%) and whether vitiligo was dangerous or connected to skin cancer (63.4%). However, unsatisfactory responses were found regarding the immunological basis of the condition: only 24.3% knew that vitiligo was an immune disease and 24.5% knew about the role of heredity in vitiligo. The majority of respondents did not mind employing patients with vitiligo (89.0%). Only 40.6% responded that they would many someone with vitiligo. Positive attitude was significantly common in respondents aged 31-50 years (P < 0.01), women (P < 0.01), and those who had a university degree or higher (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Although overall attitude toward vitiligo patients was positive, there were gaps in the knowledge, particularly regarding the nature of the disease. More awareness and education are required to improve attitude toward vitiligo patients, with an aim to improve their overall well-being.

AB  - This paper reviews the advances made in the study of olfactory communication in New World primates (Platyrrhini) made since the last major review in 2006, particularly the findings on scent-marking. Relatively few papers specifically addressed this topic, and some others include pertinent information collected during studies addressing other research questions. The majority of papers stems from research on callitrichids and night monkeys. Results of the latter studies refute my earlier hypothesis on a link between sex-biased scent marking and the relative importance of paternal care, but emphasize the need for using sexual selection as a theoretical framework for analyzing olfactory communication. The only two papers that examined scent marking in the context of territoriality and intergroup relations rejected a territorial function, but this remains a debated issue. I suggest to exploit the quasi-experimental condition created by habitat fragmentation to address this question. Portable Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) devices have been employed for the first time to examine the chemical composition of scent-gland secretions of wild New World primates. Expanding this technology to examine scent marks in situ and how their chemical profile and thus information content changes after deposition will be a promising approach for the future. Finally, I propose to integrate the theoretical framework developed by Carthey and co-workerson the role of microbes for the mediation of olfactory communication into studies of New World primate scent marking.

KW  - Femmephobia
KW  - antifemininity

KW  - transprejudice

AB  - Prejudice towards trans women is an under-examined but a critical social problem in Turkey. Patriarchal femininity sanctions women who do not comply with the idealised female bodies and feminine norms. On the other hand, ideals of hegemonic masculinity necessitate that men avoid femininity. In that sense, prejudice against trans women ostensibly stands at the intersection of hegemonic masculinity ideology and femininities that diverge from patriarchal feminine norms. Therefore, this study examines the mediatory effect of femmephobia in the link between masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women as measured by negative affect and social distancing motivations. Results indicate that femmephobia significantly mediates the relationship between the endorsement of masculinity ideology and prejudice towards trans women. Among three mandates of masculinity ideology, the endorsement of the antifemininity mandate was the most solid indirect predictor of negative affect and social distance through femmephobia, followed by mandates of toughness and status, respectively. Although participant gender does not have an indirect effect on the outcome variables, it has a direct effect on men's social distancing intentions but not on negative emotions. The results are discussed in the light of existing literature which intersects with the devaluation of femininity.

AB  - Companies often seek to persuade consumers to buy products or services through assertive advertising, but such advertising is often resisted by consumers. In order to identify ways to increase consumers' preference for assertive advertising, this study starts by considering consumers' anxiety and finds, through two between-group experiments, that the emotional state of consumers when viewing advertisements affects their attitudes toward assertive advertisements: anxious consumers have a more positive attitudes toward assertive advertisement, and cognitive fluency plays a mediating role in the relationship between consumer anxiety and consumer attitudes toward assertive advertisement. This study incorporates consumer anxiety into the study of assertive advertising, thus both enriching the theoretical research on assertive advertising and consumer anxiety and providing novel ideas for companies to enhance the effectiveness of their assertive advertising strategies.

AB  - Objectives Pediatric transplant recipients may be at increased risk of developing serious infections due to COVID-19. We undertook a web-based survey among parents of post-liver transplant pediatric patients to assess knowledge and concerns regarding COVID-19 pandemic and impact of social media on them. Methods This cross-sectional online survey was conducted between March 21 and March 26, 2020. A 19-item questionnaire was sent to 172 parents of post-liver transplant children. Results 106 (62%) of parents responded. Median time since transplant was 31 (12-52) months. The majority of parents had good understanding regarding symptomatology and routes of transmission. Only 27% were aware of feco-oral transmission, and 34% knew about gastrointestinal symptoms of COVID-19. 100% of parents understood concept of social distancing, and 70% knew that asymptomatic individuals can transmit the virus. Television followed by newspapers was the main source of their information, though over 40% claim to regularly receive information through social media. 87% would consult their doctor if the child had flu-like symptoms rather than modify immunosuppression or try alternative medications. Parental concerns mainly revolved around early recognition of symptoms, queries on unconventional treatments circulating over social media, and supply of medications during the lockdown period. Conclusions The majority of parents had basic understanding of COVID-19 pandemic. Social media appeared to be an important source of information. Results from this survey helped us in modifying patient care protocols to ensure continuity of care while maintaining social distancing.

AB  - Experiments on economic games typically fail to find positive reputational effects of using peer punishment of selfish behavior in social dilemmas. Theorists had expected positive reputational effects because of the potentially beneficial consequences that punishment may have on norm violators' behavior. Going beyond the game-theoretic paradigm, we used vignettes to study how various social factors influence approval ratings of a peer who reprimands a violator of a group-beneficial norm. We found that ratings declined when punishers showed anger, and this effect was mediated by perceived aggressiveness. Thus the same emotions that motivate peer punishers may make them come across as aggressive, to the detriment of their reputation. However, the negative effect of showing anger disappeared when the norm violation was sufficiently severe. Ratings of punishers were also influenced by social distance, such that it is less appropriate for a stranger than a friend to reprimand a violator. In sum, peer punisher ratings were very high for a friend reprimanding a severe norm violation, but particularly poor for a stranger showing anger at a mild norm violation. We found no effect on ratings of whether the reprimand had the beneficial consequence of changing the violator's behavior. Our findings provide insight into how peer punishers can avoid negative reputational effects. They also point to the importance of going beyond economic games when studying peer punishment.

AB  - Extending Blumer's group position theory into the domain of civic engagement, the present study identifies an intergroup social-psychological attitude linked to charitable giving: perceived immigrant job competition. Using the 2006 Portraits of American Life Study (N = 2,539), binary logistic regression models estimating the odds of giving money to a stranger indicate a negative association with perceived immigrant job competition for White and Black respondents. No association is found for Hispanics, Asians, or those identifying with other ethnoracial categories. Furthermore, race-related affect is found to mediate this association for White respondents, but not Black respondents, further emphasizing the relevance of the sense of dominant group position and the group position theory of racial prejudice. Future research on diversity and civic engagement should include and test individual-level measures associated with the social psychology of intergroup relations, in addition to the population-level measures of ethnic heterogeneity already employed.

Participants included 227 adults living in the United States who completed a web-based survey between 23 May 2020 and 25 August 2020. Results indicated that increased EMA was related to less distress and that meaning in life (MIL), but not social distancing stress, mediated this relationship. Our findings highlight the benefits of EMA in the context of a pandemic, and suggest that interventions that promote EMA may reduce distress by enhancing MIL.

AB  - This study aims to investigate how daily activities affect mood in the context of social distancing guidelines enforced during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) administered four times a day during a 2-week period, we asked participants (N = 91) about their mood and the activities they engaged in. Seven individuals were selected for a follow-up, open-ended questionnaire. Results show that a stable routine, including physical exercise, hobbies, regular sleep hours, and minimal time spent in front of the computer, helps maintain a good mood. Coping strategies such as planning and scheduling help keep routines and circadian rhythms stable. Face-to-face contact is associated with a more positive mood, while similar interaction through electronic communication has a less positive effect. We observe an effect related to the infodemic phenomenon: Daily reports on COVID-19 cases and deaths affect mood fluctuations. This is an important consideration in shaping public information policies.

AB  - Background: During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic (April to May 2020), 6,169 Polish and 939 Italian residents were surveyed with an online questionnaire investigating socio-demographic information and personality traits (first section) as well as attitudes, position, and efficacy perceptions on the impact of lockdown (second section) and various health protection measures enforced (third section).Methods: The "health protection attitude score" (HPAS), an endpoint obtained by pooling up the answers to questions of the third section of the survey tool, was investigated by multiple linear regression models, reporting regression coefficients (RC) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI).Results: Concerns for business and health due to COVID-19 were associated with a positive attitude toward risk reduction rules. By contrast, male sex, concerns about the reliability of information available online on COVID-19 and its prevention, along with the feeling of not being enough informed on the transmissibility/prevention of SARS-CoV-2 were associated with a negative attitude toward risk mitigation measures.Discussion: A recent literature review identified two social patterns with different features in relation to their attitude toward health protection rules against the spread of COVID-19. Factors positively associated with adherence to public health guidelines were perceived threat of COVID-19, trust in government, female sex, and increasing age. Factors associated with decreased compliance were instead underestimation of the COVID-19 risk, limited knowledge of the pandemic, belief in conspiracy theories, and political conservativism. Very few studies have tested interventions to change attitudes or behaviors.Conclusion: To improve attitude and compliance toward risk reduction norms, a key intervention is fostering education and knowledge on COVID-19 health risk and prevention among the general population. However, information on COVID-19 epidemiology might be user-generated and contaminated by social media, which contributed to creating an infodemic around the disease. To prevent the negative impact of social media and to increase adherence to health protection, stronger content control by providers of social platforms is recommended.

Results indicate that issue-related CSR programmes work well in reducing scepticism when stakeholders have high issue involvement and positive attitudes. Scepticism is also found to be a mediator between issue-related CSR programmes and perceived corporate credibility.

AB  - Childhood sexual abuse is a growing concern throughout the world, although the legal sequelae of this phenomenon are frequently neglected. We aimed to reveal and compare the attitudes of judiciary and junior clerks toward sexually abused children that might contribute to these sequelae. We divided 302 study participants into two groups of judiciary members and junior clerks. All the participants were asked to anonymously complete a questionnaire about stigmatization, including questions assessing social distance, dangerousness and skillfulness. In their responses, 51.2% of the judiciary and 64.0% of the junior clerks displayed a negative attitude toward "asking a childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivor to supervise their child for few hours" (p = 0.029). When asked "What would you think if your child wanted to marry a CSA survivor?" 76.5% of the judiciary and 84.1% of the junior clerks were opposed to the idea (p = 0.095). Interestingly, significantly more judiciary than junior clerks believed that a "CSA survivor can control his/her rage" (p = 0.001), and significantly more of the junior clerks did not believe that "CSA survivors do not behave impulsively" (p = 0.034). Both groups of legal professionals in this study appear to distance themselves from or have negative thoughts about CSA survivors, particularly when the issue involves their own children and/or social situations. Along with other factors, these negative assumptions might also contribute to lower prosecution rates and retestifying procedures. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Open access podcasting or podcasts on the internet on specific disciplinary topics are gaining prominence but are not well researched. This paper explores the usefulness of a new podcast series for social workers freely available on the internet that aims to: promote the profession of social work and contribute to a social work identity; make connections between theory, research, and practice; introduce students to real-life practice issues much earlier than often occurs in undergraduate degrees; and provide practitioners with opportunities for ongoing professional development. The evaluation was based on social media and website statistics, a survey of 22 students and nine educators, and a content analysis of listener feedback. While the evaluation provided limited evidence that all the aims had been met, the findings revealed very positive attitudes towards the initiative.

TI  - How the New European Union's (Pictorial) Tobacco Health Warnings Influence Quit Attempts and Smoking Cessation: Findings from the 2016-2017 International Tobacco Control (ITC) Netherlands Surveys

AB  - In 2016, the Netherlands was required to introduce new European Union (EU)'s (pictorial) tobacco health warnings. Our objective was to describe the pathways through which the new EU tobacco health warnings may influence quit attempts and smoking cessation among Dutch smokers. Longitudinal data from 2016 and 2017 from the International Tobacco Control (ITC) Netherlands Survey were used. Smokers who participated in both surveys were included (N = 1017). Structural equation modeling was applied to examine the hypothesized pathways. Health warning salience was positively associated with more health worries (beta = 0.301, p < 0.001) and a more positive attitude towards quitting (beta = 0.180, p < 0.001), which, in turn, were associated with a stronger quit intention (health worries: beta = 0.304, p < 0.001; attitude: beta = 0.340, p < 0.001). Quit intention was a strong predictor of quit attempts (beta = 0.336, p = 0.001). Health warning salience was also associated with stronger perceived social norms towards quitting (beta = 0.166, p < 0.001), which directly predicted quit attempts (beta = 0.141, p = 0.048). Quit attempts were positively associated with smoking cessation (beta = 0.453, p = 0.043). Based on these findings, we posit that the effect of the EU's tobacco health warnings on quit attempts and smoking cessation is mediated by increased health worries and a more positive attitude and perceived social norms towards quitting. Making tobacco health warnings more salient (e.g., by using plain packaging) may increase their potential to stimulate quitting among smokers.

AB  - Based on a comparative project on media and religion across Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, this article analyzes relationships between religiosity and political attitudes in Scandinavia and how these connect with attitudes regarding the representation of Islam in various media. Data comes from population-wide surveys conducted in the three countries in April 2015. Most Scandinavians relate 'religion' with conflict, and half of the population perceives Islam as a threat to their national culture. Scandinavians thus perceive religion in terms of political tensions and predominantly feel that news media should serve a critical function towards Islam and religious conflicts. Finally, the results of the empirical analysis are discussed in view of the intertwined processes of politicization of Islam and mediatization of religion.

AB  - Objective: To investigate differences in motivation perceptions toward exercise per self-determination theory and theory of planned behavior between active and insufficiently active persons with multiple sclerosis, given the well-being enhancements associated with exercise engagement for this population.
   Design: Cross-sectional between-groups design where active persons >= 14 points on the Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire, and insufficiently active <14.
   Setting: Community setting in Australia.
   Participants: Australian participants (N=70; mean age, 49.61 +/- 12.79y; FIM 64:6; Patient Disability Disease Steps median, 3).
   Interventions: Not applicable.
   Main Outcome Measures: Godin Leisure Time Exercise Questionnaire and adaptations of the self-determination theory (autonomous and controlling forms of motivation) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (attitudes to exercise, subjective norms to exercise, behavioral control to exercise, intention to exercise) items tailored toward exercise perceptions.
   Results: Active persons perceived higher ratings compared with insufficiently active persons of autonomous motivations toward their exercise d = 0.85 in addition to positive attitudes toward the value of exercise d = 1.28, their behavioral control over exercise d = 1.86, and their enhanced intentions to engage in exercise d = 1.14. All effect sizes were large (d>0.80).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest the value of considering ways of enhancing the perceived autonomy toward engaging in physical activity in addition to the reduction of barriers toward participating and enhancing positive attitudes toward the value of physical activity when practitioners are working with persons living with multiple sclerosis.

T2  - JAVNOST-THE PUBLIC
LA  - English
KW  - ENDORSEMENTS
AB  - Although one of the main aims of celebrities' societal engagement is to grab the attention of a wide audience for a social cause, research about public perceptions of the phenomenon is scarce. This study wants to gain a theoretical and empirical insight into the possible influence of celebrities' engagements on the general population. An internet survey among a sample of one thousand Flemish adults was conducted to ascertain which celebrities are considered to support social causes and how the general population perceives this phenomenon. Results show a select group of celebrity supporters, i.e. those in a deeply engaged role or with a considerable track record of engagement, to be the most popular. While most respondents consider such celebrity engagements to make a significant contribution to social-profit organisations' goals, scepticism about the celebrities' motives is apparent. Young adults and celebrity news followers, traditionally less involved in social causes, demonstrate a more positive attitude towards celebrity engagement than older respondents. As such, celebrities' societal engagement might be advantageous in reaching thus far uninterested parts of society.

AB  - This article reports on two studies investigating the role of intergroup contact on the reduction of prejudice against migrants and on organizational and health outcomes. Study 1 enrolled 624 native healthcare professionals and showed that frequent and positive contact with non-native co-workers was associated with a decrease in the professionals' prejudice and an increase in the professionals' perception of team functioning. These effects were mediated by reduced in-group threat perception. Study 2 enrolled 201 native patients and showed that frequent and positive contact with non-native healthcare providers was associated with a decrease in patients' prejudice and an increase in patients' satisfaction for the care received. These effects were mediated by reduced in-group threat perception. These novel findings showed that frequent and positive contact with non-native individuals can improve health and organizational outcomes along with facilitating positive intergroup relations.

AB  - This study heightens the understanding of response efficacy as a determinant of engagement in preventive behavior during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. To achieve a more nuanced conceptualization of response efficacy, this study proposes and examines a time-based coping appraisal framework, drawing upon a part of the extended parallel process model (EPPM). The current study investigates how the temporality of coping response message features work in generating social distancing behavioral intentions and explicates the role of anticipated emotions in this motivational process. Results of the experimental study (N = 584) indicate that proximal future framed coping response message (vs. distant future message) led to greater response efficacy, which in turn led to greater anticipated guilt and pride, and by extension increased social distancing behavioral intentions. Mediation analyses also demonstrated the indirect effects of the temporality conditions (proximal future-oriented message vs. distant future-oriented message) on social distancing intentions through response efficacy, anticipated guilt, and anticipated pride. The theoretical and practical implications of this study are discussed.

AB  - Based on construal-level theory (CLT) and its view of power as an instance of social distance, we predicted that high, relative to low power would enhance women's mental-rotation performance and impede their emotion-recognition performance. The predicted effects of power emerged both when it was manipulated via a recall priming task (Study 1) and environmental cues (Studies 2 and 3). Studies 3 and 4 found evidence for mediation by construal level of the effect of power on emotion recognition but not on mental rotation. We discuss potential mediating mechanisms for these effects based on both the social distance/construal level and the approach/inhibition views of power. We also discuss implications for optimizing performance on mental rotation and emotion recognition in everyday life.

AB  - Background: The Eat Well Campaign (EWC) was a social marketing campaign developed by Health Canada and disseminated to the public with the help of cross-sector partners. The purpose of this study was to describe factors that influenced cross-sector partners' decision to adopt the EWC.
   Methods: Thematic content analysis, based primarily on an a priori codebook of constructs from Roger's diffusion of innovations decision process model, was conducted on hour-long semi-structured telephone interviews with Health Canada's cross-sector partners (n = 18).
   Results: Dominant themes influencing cross-sector partners' decision to adopt the EWC were: high compatibility with the organization's values; being associated with Health Canada; and low perceived complexity of activities. Several adopters indicated that social norms (e.g., knowing that other organizations in their network were involved in the collaboration) played a strong role in their decision to participate, particularly for food retailers and small organizations. The opportunity itself to work in partnership with Health Canada and other organizations was seen as a prominent relative advantage by many organizations. Adopters were characterized as having high social participation and positive attitudes towards health, new ideas and Health Canada. The lack of exposure to the mass media channels used to diffuse the campaign and reserved attitudes towards Health Canada were prominent obstacles identified by a minority of health organizations, which challenged the decision to adopt the EWC. Most other barriers were considered as minor challenges and did not appear to impede the adoption process.
   Conclusions: Understanding factors that influence cross-sector adoption of nutrition initiatives can help decision makers target the most appropriate partners to advance public health objectives. Government health agencies are likely to find strong partners in organizations that share the same values as the initiative, have positive attitudes towards health, are extremely implicated in social causes and value the notion of partnership.

T2  - SECURITY STUDIES

AB  - Can propaganda produced by foreign adversaries shape public opinion in a target country? We develop a theoretical framework to understand outward-facing propaganda, which many autocrats employ to shape public opinion abroad. We argue that beliefs about foreign affairs are more susceptible to outward-facing propaganda than beliefs about domestic conditions. Empirically, we focus on RT (formerly Russia Today), a media platform the Russian government founded in 2005. After characterizing its content, we ask whether exposure to RT influences the beliefs of American consumers. Exposure to RT, we find, induces respondents to support America withdrawing from its role as a cooperative global leader by 10-20 percentage points. This effect is robust across measures, obtains across party lines, and persists even when we disclose that RT is financed by the Russian government. RT has no effect on Americans' views of domestic politics or the Russian government.

AB  - Considerable research indicates that personal contact from political campaigns can mobilize people to vote, but little attention has been given to whether the tone of the message matters. Studies of message tone have mostly been confined to mass media campaigns and ignored the growing role grassroots techniques play in contemporary political campaigns. Two randomized field experiments were conducted to determine the importance of message tone in grassroots contact. We find evidence that personally delivered messages can be effective at influencing voting preferences, but neither experiment uncovered a systematic difference between the effects of negative and positive messages on voter turnout or political attitudes.

AB  - During the COVID-19 crisis, living in lockdown and observing social distancing rules have become an integral part of everyday life. In this article, I offer some autoethnographic reflections on the increased use of ICTs within families and particularly across generations. Using vignettes relating to communication with my one-year-old granddaughter and my 92-year-old mother, I consider what it means to have the haptic dimensions of kinship relations stripped out and replaced by technologically mediated connection. By way of conclusion, I consider the relationship between the 'magic' of ICTs in interpersonal communication on the one hand and Marshall Sahlins' notion of mutuality on the other.

AB  - Prevailing theories hold that U.S. public support for a war depends primarily on its degree of success, U.S. casualties, or conflict goals. Yet, research into the framing of foreign policy shows that public perceptions concerning each of these factors are often endogenous and malleable by elites. In this article, we argue that both elite rhetoric and the situation on the ground in the conflict affect public opinion, but the qualities that make such information persuasive vary over time and with circumstances. Early in a conflict, elites (especially the president) have an informational advantage that renders public perceptions of "reality" very elastic. As events unfold and as the public gathers more information, this elasticity recedes, allowing alternative frames to challenge the administration's preferred frame. We predict that over time the marginal impact of elite rhetoric and reality will decrease, although a sustained change in events may eventually restore their influence. We test our argument through a content analysis of news coverage of the Iraq war from 2003 through 2007, an original survey of public attitudes regarding Iraq, and partially disaggregated data from more than 200 surveys of public opinion on the war.

AB  - Background: Communication skills (CS) learning is a core skill in medical and dental education. The comparison of attitudes towards CS between dental and medical students based on the taught curriculum (problem-based learning vs. traditional teaching) in Saudi Arabia awaits investigation. Aims: (1) To assess the attitudes of both undergraduate dental and medical students towards communication skills (CS) learning and (2) to compare the attitudes towards CS between Medical and Dental students in relation to sociodemographic and education-related characteristics. Methods and Materials: A cross-sectional study, using an online survey, invited 260 conveniently sampled Taibah university medical and dental undergraduate students. The survey collected data on sociodemographic characteristics, education-related factors, and CS using Communication Skills Attitude Scale (CSAS) that assess positive and negative attitudes (PAS, NAS). Data analysis included descriptive statistics and the Mann-Whitney U test. Results: Of the distributed questionnaire 91% responded (145 dental and 91 medical students). There were, overall, non-significant scores' differences between medical and dental students on PAS (Medicine Median 51 vs. Dentistry Median 50, p = 0.059) and NAS (Medicine Median 32 vs. Dentistry Median 32, p = 0.596). Older medical students, those at clinical levels and those who reported they need to improve their communication skills and student whose parents were not doctors, tended to score statistically significantly (p = 0.032, 0.017, 0.034, and 0.004, respectively) on PAS compared with dental students; on the other hand, medical students with doctor parents scored significantly high in NAS compared to dental students (p = 0.015). Conclusion: Demographic and education-related characteristics underpinned medical student positive attitude towards CS compared to dental students. Although medical and dental students showed no differences in self-rating their attitudes towards (CS). Different factors influence medical and dental students' attitudes towards CS learning.

TI  - Compliance to a Five-Year Biannual Ivermectin Treatment for Onchocerciasis Elimination and Its Determinants among Adults in the Bench Maji Zone, Southwest Ethiopia: A Community-Based Cross-Sectional Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF PARASITOLOGY RESEARCH
LA  - English
AB  - Background. Community-directed treatment with ivermectin twice a year is a major action to control onchocerciasis in endemic countries. Even though the community-directed treatment with ivermectin was proven effective in treating the disease, the level of compliance to the treatment and its contributing factors was not well addressed in our study area. Therefore, the current study was aimed at determining the magnitude of compliance with the five-year (2013-2017 years) biannual ivermectin treatment and its associated factors among adults living in the Bench Maji Zone, Ethiopia. Methods. A community-based cross-sectional study was done on 572 randomly selected people aged greater than or equal to 15 years. Data were collected by a face-to-face interview. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize descriptive data. Binary logistic regression was done to assess statistical associations. Adjusted odds ratio and its 95% CI were, respectively, used to measure the strength of statistical association and its significance. Result. Five hundred fifty-three (553) people had participated in the study making the response rate 96.7%. The overall magnitude of compliance to the five-year biannual ivermectin treatment was 361 (65.3%). The results of the multivariable logistic regression showed that age, positive attitude towards community drug distributers' performance, positive attitude towards height measurement for the treatment dose determination, and involvement in community-directed treatment with ivermectin were independently associated with compliance to ivermectin treatment at P value < 0.05. Conclusions. Even though the Ethiopian government has set a goal to eliminate onchocerciasis through community-directed treatment with the ivermectin, which is proven effective in treating the disease, the magnitude of compliance with the treatment among adults aged >= 15 years in the Semen Bench District is still unacceptably low. The Bench Maji Zonal Health Department and other stakeholders working on onchocerciasis prevention, control, and elimination should give due emphasis to behavioral change communication through community-based education and other social media to promote community's awareness on community-directed treatment with ivermectin giving due focus to adults aged 45 years and above.

AB  - United Nations (UN) peacekeeping missions are complex social organizations, with soldiers coming from several countries. In this environment, effective communication and interactions with local populations are often difficult, and establishing essential local support can be jeopardized when soldiers are culturally distant from local communities. At the same time, however, when local populations perceive peacekeepers as sufficiently distant or unbiased, the promotion of cooperation is enhanced. We explore whether cultural distance-in terms of geography, language, and religion-and social distance-in terms of economy and institutions-between the peacekeepers and the local population improve the operational capabilities of a mission. We use monthly information on UN peacekeeping missions' composition from 1990 to 2015. We find that higher geographic and cultural distances correspond to higher levels of violence against civilians and higher battle deaths, whereas institutional and economic differences have the opposite effects, although these are less robust.

AB  - Given recent and growing societal movements focusing on sexual assault, such as the #MeToo Movement, it is imperative to understand current attitudes about sexual assault and these movements. The aim of this study was to examine negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault in the context of the #MeToo Movement by qualitatively analyzing social media posts (i.e., tweets) containing the hashtag "metoo" on Twitter, a popular social media platform. The initial sample consisted of 4,559 tweets that were publicly posted by Twitter users across a four-day timeframe and represented events and attitudes regarding both about an accuser and an accused. Data were cleaned and coded, and a remaining 508 tweets were included because they contained content that was categorized as negative in their attitudes or beliefs (either through attitudes of condemnation or ambivalence towards accusers and/or the #MeToo Movement). Results from a qualitative content analysis of tweets demonstrated that negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault within the context of the #MeToo Movement were conveyed through six main themes: (1) invalidating the accusations made as part of the #MeToo Movement; (2) insisting, and likely believing, that accusations made were false; (3) claiming that there were alternative motives for those accusations; (4) showing a concern for the harm that accusations may cause those accused; (5) exhibiting concerns about the effects of the Movement on male power, privilege, and status; and (6) questioning the integrity of the #MeToo Movement as a whole. These findings provide a deeper understanding of attitudes and beliefs about the #MeToo Movement, including novel beliefs not often addressed in the literature. Most importantly, these findings show that rape culture continues to persist despite current interventions and social movements. Results underscore the need for future interventions that aim to educate and improve societal attitudes towards sexual assault.

AB  - This article deals comprehensively with factors which influence attitudes to the placement of high-voltage overhead transmission lines (HVOTLs). It employs an analytical schema which links the initial stimulus of the power lines' proposal in an area to Background and Socio-economic independent variables and a set of mediating variables. From a survey of 600 residents in three different domiciliary settings in Queensland, Australia, results indicate an absence of positive attitudes and, at best, neutral ones to HVOTL placement. By multinomial logistic regression, the study probes the grounds behind negativity and extreme negativity, uncovering direct links between these attitudes and certain of the variables included in the analytical schema.

AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston's poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the 'threatening other'. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

AB  - As paradigms of clinical care delivery have been significantly impacted by the novel coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic, so has the structure, delivery, and future of medical education. Both undergraduate and graduate medical education have seen disruptions ranging from fully virtual delivery of educational content and limited clinical care for medical students to increased clinical demands with redeployment for residents and fellows. Adherence to social distancing has led to the adoption and implementation of already available technologies in medical education, including video conferencing softwares and social media platforms. Efficient and effective use of these technologies requires an understanding not only of these platforms and their features but also of their inherent limitations. During a time of uncertainty and increased clinical demands, the approach to medical education must be thoughtful with attention to wellness of both the educator and learner. In this review, we discuss the influence of the pandemic on the existing medical education landscape, outline existing and proposed adaptations to social distancing, and describe challenges that lie ahead.

Values-driven attributions and perceptions of company-cause fit were measured as mediating variables. Results indicate that individuals inferred more values-driven motives from CSR messages than CSA messages, which ultimately led to more positive attitude changes toward the company. Theoretical implications for both CSR and CSA scholarship are discussed. Several implications for companies and strategic communicators are offered.

AB  - Social media has become an important marketing media to attract and retain consumers. This article focuses on the movie industry and aims to investigate how different channels and events in social media marketing achieve box office success through different consumers' responses. In reference to elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose our research model and test hypotheses using the data of 304 movies with the information of box office, attributes, and associated social media posts. The results show that: (1) official microblog activity increases the purchase intent through changing audience's attitude while third-party mention increases purchase intent through catching audience's attention and promoting positive attitude, and there is an interaction effect between official microblog and third-party media; (2) social media marketing events related to contents introduction promote purchase intent through central route while those related to surrounding information promote purchase intent through peripheral route; and (3) movie attributes interact with marketing intensity in affecting purchase intent. Under the same marketing intensity, the marketing effect of domestic sequel movies released on popular holidays is better. Our findings provide both theoretical and practical implications.

AB  - Individuals tend to dehumanize the outgroup. In this paper, we explore whether the activation of attachment security can attenuate dehumanization. Two studies were performed. In Study 1, attachment security was primed by showing pictures that depicted relationships with attachment figures; the outgroup was the homeless and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and non-uniquely human emotions to this group. In Study 2, the sense of interpersonal security was activated by inviting participants to relive a recent interaction that left them with a feeling of safety and warmth. Outgroup members were the Roma, and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and human nature traits to them. In Study 2, the mediation effect of intergroup emotions was investigated. In both studies, outgroup humanization effects were highlighted. In Study 2, these effects were mediated by increased empathy toward the outgroup. Interestingly, the positive impact of security activation was not moderated by chronic attachment orientations. Findings suggest strategies that can be used to improve intergroup relations in specific contexts and in society at large.

AB  - Affective polarization (i.e., differences in evaluations of the in-party and out-party) has important implications for political outcomes including civic engagement and partisan-motivated attitudes and behaviours. In this study, we add to the burgeoning literature on affective polarization by examining moderators of the effect of in-party support on out-party opposition across the three main political parties in New Zealand. Using a large national probability sample of adults (N = 19,078), we assessed the effects of social demographics, Big-Five personality traits, liberal-conservative ideology, political identity centrality, and weekly news exposure on the relationship between in-party and out-party support. Results show political identity centrality is the strongest and most consistent moderator. The effects of some other moderators (e.g., personality, news exposure) are party-specific.

AB  - The investigation of established drivers of online purchase behavior is of great relevance during the COVID-19 pandemic, as companies must anticipate consumer behavior during this global crisis to maintain a competitive edge. This study investigates online shopping motives of generation Y and Z during the COVID-19 shutdown in April 2020. We use survey data from 451 German consumers to examine the relations between normative, utilitarian and hedonic motives, and purchase intentions employing structural equation modeling. The results show that normative determinants such as media reports on the economic situation are related to consumers' purchase intentions, whereas the normative influence of close social networks is not. Furthermore, we find that hedonic motivation is a better predictor of purchase intentions than utilitarian motives and that individuals practicing social distancing, generation Z, and women show higher levels of hedonic motivation. We provide recommendations for e-commerce companies on ways to address consumers' purchase motives and strategically harness normative influences.

AB  - Purpose This study aims to explore the effects of consumer resilience and brand familiarity on the relationship between corporate social responsibility (CSR) and consumer attitudes toward the company conducting CSR in places that have suffered from traumatic events such as natural or anthropogenic disasters and uncertainty of public health issue. Design/methodology/approach This study collected survey-based data from 194 participants who suffered from natural and anthropogenic disasters in the state of Texas. Path analysis was used to test each structural relationship among variables after verifying the reliability and validity of each variable. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the difference in resilience between the two groups. Findings This study verified that there is a positive relationship between CSR and consumer attitude. More importantly, the results show that both resilience and familiarity play an important role as a mediator in the relationship between CSR and attitudes. In particular, it tells us that a group with high resilience shows a higher possibility of having positive attitudes toward the company than another group having low resilience. Originality/value This study empirically tested the impacts of CSR, resilience and brand familiarity on building consumer attitudes. Furthermore, this study explored the effects of resilience and brand familiarity on the relationship between CSR and attitudes. Thus, this study was able to contribute to understanding the effects of CSR, resilience and familiarity on building a positive attitude in the specific settings, in terms of traumatic events, theoretically and practically.

AB  - Politicians within the United States and across many Western societies are concerned about the extent to which Muslims are successfully integrating within their countries. The present research examined how interpersonal (discrimination) and mediated (negative news coverage of Muslims) social identity threats dynamically change young Muslim Americans' strength of identification as American and Muslim, as well as their trust in the U.S. government. Data from a three-wave longitudinal survey show that Time 1, negative news coverage of Muslims (but not discrimination), significantly reduced Time 2, strength of identification as an American, which subsequently reduced Time 3, trust in the U.S. government. Muslim identification did not change as a function of interpersonal or mediated social identity threats. These findings suggest that negative media portrayals can have adverse effects on the national identification of some minority groups, and-crucially-that these effects may be stronger than those of personally experienced discrimination.

AB  - Were policy responses of the US states to the pandemic driven by partisan politics or by budgetary reasons? We show that balanced-budget rules also had an impact, mediated by the possibility of benefiting from the funds previously stored in budget stabilisation funds. State policymakers tried to square the circle by simultaneously respecting budget rules, limiting the economic impact of the social distancing measures, combating the pandemic and pandering to their political bases. Some fiscal rules have induced a trade-off between health and public finance, which may reignite the debate on the pro-cyclicality of fiscal rules.

AB  - This paper reports a test and extension of the model posited by the theory of crisis response narratives, in which the public manifests identification with a spokesperson who tells ethical narratives rather than spinning stories. The effect is hypothesized as being mediated through the public perceiving trustworthiness of, and positive attitudes toward, the spokesperson. An experiment is reported (N = 262) with a televised news interview featuring a spokesperson representing a scandalized company, in which the messaging varies in terms of narratives. The study finds support for the theoretical model as originally specified. In addition, the model is extended to serial and parallel multiple mediation, finding that the effect is processed through the public's anger.

AB  - Democracy may contribute to friendly attitudes and positive attitudes toward outgroups (i.e., outgroup tolerance) because members of democratic societies learn to exercise their rights (i.e., cast a vote) and, in the process, listen to different opinions. Study 1 was a survey study with representative samples from 33 countries (N = 45,070, 53.6% female) and it showed a positive association between the levels of democracy and outgroup tolerance after controlling for gender, age and the rate of immigrants influx from 2010 to 2013. Study 1 demonstrated that members in countries with higher political participation and civil liberty showed greater tolerance toward immigrants. In Study 2, we conducted an experimental study in Taiwan (N = 93, 67.7% female) to further examine two potential mediators (opinion sharing and voting) of the effect of democratic system on tolerance toward outgroups (i.e., attitudes toward mental patients) after controlling for gender and age. We found that when individuals were allowed to share opinions and vote, they had the highest positive other-oriented emotions toward mental patients, which in turn led to greater tolerance toward outgroups compared to those who were not allowed to share opinions or vote. In general, these results demonstrated that the democratic system plays a critical role in increasing outgroup tolerance. Limitations of the two studies and implications regarding opinion sharing, voting, democratic systems, and effects on outgroup tolerance are discussed.

AB  - This article applies the theory of planned behaviour in order to understand intentions to create new ventures or participate in existing ones, by investing human, social and financial capital in a turbulent economic environment, such as the one in Greece. We hypothesize that subjective norms relate to investment intentions (IIs) and that individual attitudes and perceived behavioural control over the investment mediate this relationship. We also propose that norms, attitudes and control interact in explaining IIs in such a way that intentions are stronger when positive norms and attitudes coexist with high levels of control. Hypotheses are tested by means of a cross-sectional quantitative study that was conducted in Greece (N = 203). Bootstrap analyses support our mediation hypotheses by showing that norms relate positively to IIs via their associations with positive attitudes and high control. In addition, regression analyses show that norms, attitudes and control interact in explaining intentions. However, contrary to expectations, results show that positive attitudes towards investment boost IIs, in conditions where norms are positive but control is low.

AB  - We examined a general population sample (n = 1330) from an epidemiological study (SHIP), investigating whether shame, social distance and reluctance to self-identify as having a mental illness interfere with willingness to seek help for mental health problems. Analyses were stratified for life-time diagnosis of any mental illness. Shame was the strongest negative predictor for willingness to seek help (beta = -0.183, p < .001). Structured Estimation Modelling showed shame being a full mediator of a negative association between social distance and willingness. Our results corroborate the important role of shame as an impediment to help-seeking for mental health problems in the general population.

AB  - Visual framing can improve health-message effectiveness. Narrative structure provides a template needed for determining how to frame visuals to maximise message effectiveness. Participants (N = 190) were assigned to a message condition determined by segments (establisher, initial, peak), graphic (static, animated) and cancer (lung, melanoma). ANOVAs revealed that melanoma was more believable than lung cancer with static graphics at the establisher and peak; narratives were more believable with animated graphics at the peak segment; melanoma elicited greater positive attitudes; graphics in the peak influenced greatest intentions. Animated graphics visually framed to emphasise information at the establisher and peak segments suggest maximum effectiveness.

AB  - Japanese often find it pleasant when someone engages in amae, defined as an inappropriate request with the expectation of acceptance. Using a random sampling survey, we examined why Japanese adults feel good when a friend or an acquaintance engages in amae and when they, themselves, engage in amae. In both situations, positive attitude toward amae predicted more positive emotions. Relationship closeness and feeling of control mediated this association, and perceiving enough resources to grant the request did so only in the friend/acquaintance amae situation. Despite its inappropriateness, amae could be an effective way to seek help and express closeness with others.

AB  - The two major challenges facing people with mental health conditions (MHCs) are stigma and discrimination. This study focused on the Amitim program's nationwide integrated arts-based groups that not only aim to impart knowledge and skills in the arts (e.g., theater, writing, music, poetry, visual art, etc.) but also reduce public and self-stigma, and promote personal recovery. This study, composed of a sample of 642 Israeli adults, examined whether people with MHCs and nonclinical community members who attended the integrated groups would report greater adaptive changes in outcomes than those who did not participate, the association of change process factors and in-group factors with these outcomes, and candidate mediators in the association between participation in the groups and the outcomes. The findings showed that change in creative self-efficacy (CSE) significantly predicted adaptive change in outcomes in people with MHCs who participated in these integrated arts-based groups. Participants with MHCs in groups facilitated by arts therapists reported significantly more positive outcomes than participants in groups with facilitators from other professional human services. Nonclinical community members in the integrated groups reported higher postprogram CSE and less desire for social distance from people with MHCs compared with the control group. Finally, change in the desire for social distance significantly mediated the relationship between group participation and change in public stigma. Overall, direct intergroup contact while engaging in arts-based activities appears to be a promising way to promote positive changes in people with MHCs and nonclinical community members. The implications and future directions are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the mediating role of problem-solving coping strategies in the relationship between thinking styles (legislative, executive, and judicial) and teachers' attitudes towards distance education (difficulties related to distance education and efficacy in distance education). The study sample consisted of 556 special education teachers, 122 males (21.9%) and 434 females (78.1%), with an average age of 37.90 years (SD = 7.12). The results confirmed the role of problem-solving coping as a mediator for legislative thinking style on difficulties related to distance education. Furthermore, the findings indicated a positive relationship between judicial style and efficacy in distance education. The results of this study highlight the importance of developing specific special education teacher trainings to promote positive attitudes towards distance education.

AB  - The arrival of digital native students and the omnipresence of Internet access and mobile devices have motivated professors to reflect on their teaching practices. The educational usage of Facebook includes communication, collaboration, and sharing. Different research designs and the lack of baseline data made it difficult to compare research findings and conclude students' perceptions of the educational usage of a Facebook group. The findings from this research showed even more positive attitudes towards the educational usage of a Facebook group after the experience. Specifically, positive significant differences were found in "improves communication between teacher and students", "provides rich multimedia resources and media support to improve the educational experience"; and a negative significant change in "encourages the creation of academic groups (communities) of people with the same interest and needs".

AB  - Objectives: Taking weight-loss supplements may create illusion of protection against weight gain and thereby loosen subsequent dietary self-control. The current study examined whether taking weight-loss supplement would increase food intake and further tested whether positive attitudes toward supplements would increase susceptibility to overeating.
   Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to take either a known placebo or a purported weight loss supplement (actually, the same placebo). After supplement provision, participants' actual food consumption at a reward buffet lunch was recorded.
   Results: Compared with controls, participants receiving a purported weight loss supplement ate more food at the reward buffet. Perceived progress toward the goal of weight reduction mediated the connection between use of weight loss supplements and subsequent food consumption. Participants with more positive attitudes toward weight loss supplements were more susceptible to the liberating effect of taking weight loss supplements on food intake.
   Conclusion: Using weight loss supplements may produce unintended consequences on dietary self-regulation. The public should pay more attention to the notion of psychological liberation when using weight loss supplements. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The European economic crisis, the migratory crisis and the Brexit in the UK are the main causes of the increasing negative moods of the European Union citizens. The research offers a comparative analysis of pupils' and teachers' viewpoints on European citizenship and European identity in selected two Visegrad Group countries. The research held in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the research sample of 1,973 respondents shows that the Slovak pupils and their teachers have in most cases more positive attitudes towards European citizenship and European identity than Czech pupils and their teachers. The responding Slovak pupils are more proud of being citizens of the European Union, less skeptic of the EU's activities and believe in the future of the European Union.
   On the other hand, the Czech pupils and teachers are more proud of the membership of the Czech Republic in the EU, as well as of the Czech activities in the European Union. In this context, the authors point out that a more intensive education relating to the European citizenship and Europeanism could increase positive attitudes towards European identity and membership in the European Union. The European dimension of education is still up to date not only in the old member states of the European Union but also in the new ones or future member states. Citizenship education unifies several social fields and disciplines including education to Europeanism, environmental, global, media, multicultural, personal and social education, and education relating to democracy and constitutionality.

AB  - Are philosophical arguments as effective as narratives in influencing charitable giving and attitudes toward it? In four experiments, we exposed online research participants to either philosophical arguments in favor of charitable giving, a narrative about a child whose life was improved by charitable donations, both the narrative and the argument, or a control text (a passage from a middle school physics text or a description of charitable organizations). Participants then expressed their attitudes toward charitable giving and were either asked how much they would hypothetically donate if given $10 (Experiment 1) or told they had a 10% chance of winning $10 and given the opportunity to donate from their potential winnings (Experiments 2-4). Across the four experiments, participants in all of the narrative conditions and in some of the argument conditions tended to express more positive attitudes toward charitable giving and donated about $1 more on average than did participants in the control conditions. These effects appear to have been mediated by the "narrative transportation" scale, which suggests that appeals to donate can be effective if they engage participants' emotions, imagery, and interest.

AB  - Knowledge of students' construction and technology background is an important input to the process of designing technology-enhanced instruction. Current literature in student background is either not specific for the construction/civil engineering student population or lacks direct implications for pedagogical design. This paper presents a survey study that assesses students' self-reported technology skills and attitude, learning preferences, and baseline construction knowledge. The survey is designed as a questionnaire with three sections: demographic and background information, technology attitude and exposure, and construction-related knowledge. From the 280 data points collected, it was found that today's students are exposed to a wide range of technology applications. They had a positive attitude toward technology, were enthusiastic video-game players, and strongly preferred learning activities that involved interactions, whether these interactions were face-to-face or mediated by technology. These findings suggest that technology-assisted learning would excite and engage students. The paper also provides a discussion on specific pedagogical design implications of the findings and ways in which these could be incorporated in the design of technology-enhanced learning tools.

AB  - Despite the increased visibility and acceptance of the LGBTQ community, sexual minorities continue to face prejudice and discrimination in many domains. Past research has shown that this prejudice is more prevalent among those holding conservative political views. In two studies, we merge strategic essentialism and motivated ideology theoretical perspectives to empirically investigate the link between political orientation and sexual prejudice. More specifically, we examine how conservatives strategically use different forms of essentialism to support their views of gay individuals and their reactions to messages aimed at changing essentializing beliefs. In Study 1 (N = 220), we demonstrate that conservatives endorse social essentialism (i.e., the belief that gay and straight people are fundamentally different from each other) more than liberals do. In turn, they blame gay individuals more for their sexual orientation and show more prejudice toward them. At the same time, conservatives endorse trait essentialism (i.e., the belief that sexual orientation is a fixed attribute that cannot be changed) less than liberals do, which in turn predicts greater levels of blame and prejudice for conservatives relative to liberals. In Study 2 (N = 217), we additionally show that conservatives, but not liberals, are resistant to messages aimed at increasing trait essentialism and reducing prejudice toward sexual minorities. We discuss theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans' HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture. Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers' and daughters' HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework. Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34). Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention.

AB  - Exposure to a single report about terrorism in the mass media can trigger a range of emotional and political reactions. The consequences of exposure to several terrorism reports in row, however, are a matter of controversy. We examine the effects of prolonged terrorism coverage using an experimental design that combines self-report measures of emotions and political attitudes with instantaneous biometric data on emotions. Consistent with research on nonassociational learning, we find that exposure to multiple videos habituates people to depictions of terrorism: the longer people watch terrorism coverage, the less intense their reactions are to the images of terrorism they see. Some images and videos, however, contribute to this result more than others. This suggests that the ultimate effects of terrorism coverage depend on the interplay between the quantity and quality of reporting, not the quantity alone.

AB  - Microblog activity logs are useful to determine user's interest and sentiment towards specific and broader category of events such as natural disaster and national election. In this paper, we present a corpus model to show how personal attitudes can be predicted from social media or microblog activities for a specific domain of events such as natural disasters. More specifically, given a user's tweet and an event, the model is used to predict whether the user will be willing to help or show a positive attitude towards that event or similar events in the future. We present a new dataset related to a specific natural disaster event, i.e. Hurricane Harvey, that distinguishes user's tweets into positive and non-positive attitudes. We build Term Embeddings for Tweet (TEmT) to generate features to model personal attitudes for arbitrary user's tweets. In addition, we present sentiment analysis on the same disaster event dataset using enhanced feature learning on TEmT generated features by applying Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method by employing multiple classification techniques and comparative methods on the newly created dataset.

AB  - Nutrition care should be an integral part of general practitioners' (GPs') daily work with patients. The aim of this study was to assess the attitudes of Croatian GPs toward nutrition and nutrition care, and to evaluate the interconnection between their attitudes and implementation of nutrition care in GPs offices. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 17.0% of randomly selected GPs, from May to July of 2013, via a specially designed anonymous questionnaire. The study showed that 36.0% of the Croatian GPs had satisfactory number of positive attitudes (5 or more) toward nutrition and nutrition care. There was statistically significant difference in the median number of positive attitudes based on the additional education of GPs in nutrition and their ailment from chronic diseases (p < 0.001 and p = 0.022, respectively). The Spearman rank correlation between GPs' attitudes toward nutrition and nutrition care and their practice, i.e., the implementation of nutrition care in GPs' everyday work with patients was r(s) = 0.235 (p < 0.001). In order to provide nutrition care in GPs' offices in Croatia, strategies for changing GPs' attitudes toward nutrition and nutrition care are needed.

AB  - Recent studies have shown that the most important factor explaining opinions on European Union issues is attitudes towards immigrants. Two arguments are given to explain this effect. We contend that these arguments are both built on the idea that people with anti-immigrant attitudes frame other Europeans as an out-group. We then test the validity of these arguments by measuring how respondents in a voter survey frame the issue of Turkish membership. We find that framing the issue in terms of out-groups indeed mediates the effect of anti-immigrant attitudes on support for Turkish membership. This finding offers new insights into why levels of public support vary over different EU issues, because opposition is likely to increase when an issue is more easily framed in terms of out-groups.

AB  - In our media landscape, consumers view a plethora of messages with visual assertions, created through postproduction photo manipulation, which communicate meaning at-a-glance. These visual assertions are processed initially and directly and greatly influence how consumers think, feel, and behave. Yet the impact of visuals, which likely color all processing, is not incorporated in persuasive message processing models. Using dual processing models from multiple disciplines as a theoretical foundation, this study demonstrates through two experiments that the effects of photo manipulation, as visual assertions, in food advertising increased consumers' perceptions of healthfulness, positive attitudes, and purchase intentions. Dual processing models for persuasive messages should be extended to account for the initial, influential visual processing of implied assertions, often manipulated during postproduction.

AB  - This research used a path analysis model to explore the degree to which reliance on off-line and online media, off-line and online discussion of political issues, as well as political attitudes predict whether an individual will engage in selective exposure to political websites. The study also looked at selective avoidance of contradictory information on websites. The results indicate that respondents did indeed practice selective exposure when accessing information on political websites, especially among those who are politically active online and those who rely heavily on websites and blogs for political information. However, the results showed that selective avoidance did not occur, with those exhibiting increased political interest and online participation significantly less likely to avoid information that challenges their views.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the effects of authentic assessment on student satisfaction and promoting behaviour. The sample comprised 120 students enrolled in an undergraduate business programme. A model was proposed and tested using conditional process analysis. It was found that authentic assessments are positively related to student satisfaction and promoting behaviour. It was found that student satisfaction mediated the relationship between authentic assessments and promoting behaviour. Moreover, the effects of authentic assessment are stronger among students who are highly career-oriented than those who are less career-oriented. The implications for higher education institutions are discussed. The key contribution of the research is in providing support for the precept that authentic assessments could drive students' positive attitudes and behavioural intentions.

AB  - This study aimed to develop a web-based learning media on the process and mechanism of labour for the third-year university nursing and midwifery students. This media was developed based on integrating principles of the mechanism of labour with the 5Es inquiry cycle and interactive features of information technology. In this study, the web-based learning unit was used to supplement the conventional lecture as in the traditional teaching. Students' achievements were assessed by using the pre- and post-test on factual knowledge and semi-structured interviews on attitude to the unit. Supplementation with this learning unit made learning significantly more effective than the traditional lecture by itself. The students also showed positive attitude toward the learning unit.

AB  - Past research has examined the beneficial effects of contact focusing mainly on the affective dimension of intergroup relationships. Limited research has examined cognitive dimensions, in particular considering at the same time minority and majority group perspectives. This study tested whether contact in a work context relates differentially to the perception of interethnic conflict in Italian (n = 67) and immigrant (n = 40, all male) blue-collar coworkers with the potential mediation of reciprocal stereotypical content (competence and warmth dimensions), interethnic attitudes, perceived discrimination, and whether organizational identification amplifies the effect of contact. Multigroup path analysis revealed that the two stereotype dimensions, warmth and competence, mediate the relationship between interethnic contact and perceived discrimination for Italians, and between organizational identification and perceived conflict for immigrants. Results highlighted an asymmetrical effect of contact on perceived conflict, detrimental and direct for immigrant workers, beneficial and mediate via the outgroup cognitive image for the Italian workers. Findings suggest that a superordinate identity, in terms of organizational identification, may be effective in reducing conflict at the workplace for majority members, whilst a personalized strategy seems to be more suitable for minority members. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed along with the acculturation perspective.

AB  - Loneliness may be a consequence of social distancing, a measure imposed by several governments to try to reduce the contagion of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Despite being necessary, this measure may have thus caused a rise in mental health issues, leading to higher psychological distress and symptomatology. Thus, it is also important to explore how loneliness relates to the regulation of psychological needs. This study aims to explore the relationships between loneliness, symptomatology, and the regulation of psychological needs. 142 individuals (Mage=32.7, SD=10.9), answered self-report questionnaires in a cross-sectional design. Results show that loneliness is positively correlated with symptomatology and difficulties in the regulation of psychological needs, with these relationships being mediated by psychological distress and psychological well-being. We discuss our results with a focus on loneliness and related psychopathological symptomatology, as they seem to be core factors in the regulation of psychological needs.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to understand how information revealed on organic food labels and perceived organic knowledge drive consumer trust and attitudes towards organic foods, which in turn together with subjective norm eventually influence subsequent purchase intentions.
   Design/methodology/approach - The questionnaire surveys were administered to customers at four urban large-scale supermarkets and three health food stores at three major cities in Taiwan. In total, 693 valid questionnaires were obtained, yielding a response rate of 81.5 per cent.
   Findings - Trust, serving as the antecedent of attitudes, significantly mediates the relationships between revealing information, perceived knowledge, and organic purchase intentions. Additionally, both attitudes towards organic foods and subjective norm significantly influence consumer organic food choices. However, the impact of perceived organic knowledge on consumer attitudes has been found to be insignificant, indicating that the increase in perceived knowledge cannot create positive attitudes towards organic foods. Thus, a focus on how to use knowledge to enhance consumer trust in organic foods is suggested as an effective marketing strategy for the organic food industry.
   Research limitations/implications - The research findings support that trust and attitudes play the mediating roles linking revealed information and perceived knowledge with organic food purchase intentions. This result is consistent with previous studies, indicating that better organic labeling information and related knowledge perceived by consumers have critical effects on consumer trust in organic foods, which in turn will influence their attitudes and intentions to purchase organic foods. However, this study also found that perceived knowledge can generate positive attitudes only when trust can be firmly built. This confirms the essential role of trust in the process of consumer organic buying intentions.
   Practical implications - First, providing credible labeling information by displaying how organic agricultural products are grown, processed, and handled, and the percentage of organic ingredients in a product is crucial to stimulate consumer trust and positive attitudes. Second, enhancing consumer trust by providing correct knowledge and credible information through diversified channels (e.g. TV, newspapers, magazines, web sites) to improve consumer organic knowledge has become the most important task for the government, organic food sectors, certifiers, and research institutions to develop positive attitudes towards organic foods. Finally, organic food sectors and marketers could use a word-of-mouth strategy and focus on promoting the benefits and accessibility of organic foods to the general public to raise the common acceptance of organic foods.
   Social implications - Organic labeling has been considered an effective measure to help consumers obtain valid and trustworthy information in the organic food market, particularly for those with limited knowledge. Therefore, the government agencies not only need to take the responsibility to set regulations for organic food/agricultural products, but also need to set labeling requirements for these products. Based on these labeling requirements, the organic certifying agents can certify organic food/agricultural products by offering organic labels that contain clear information and represent quality to consumers.
   Originality/value - This study incorporates critical factors based on related theories, including the antecedents and the outcome variables of consumer trust, to develop a more comprehensive model for better understanding of consumer organic choice behaviour. The research findings have provided implications and additional contributions to the existing theories as well as developed effective strategies for the development of the organic food market.

AB  - The impact of knowledge on public attitudes toward scientific issues remains unclear, due in part to ill-defined differences in how research designs conceptualize knowledge. Using genetically modified foods as a framework, we explore the impacts of perceived familiarity and factual knowledge, and the moderating roles of media attention and a food-specific attitudinal variable (food consciousness), in shaping these relationships. Based on the differential effects on "negative attitudes" toward genetically modified foods, we provide further evidence that the measures of knowledge are separate concepts and argue against a one-dimensional view of scientific knowledge. We discuss implications for understanding the relationship between knowledge and science attitudes.

AB  - This study tests the effect of fake news awareness as an intervention strategy for motivating news verification behaviour among social media users in Nigeria. A quasi-experiment was utilized with 470 participants divided into two groups, comprising the control group, n = 235, and the treatment group, n = 235. Fake news awareness was found to be an effective intervention strategy used to intensify the urgency and need to verify news before sharing. Individuals exposed to fake news awareness campaigns reported a more positive attitude towards news verification, better self-efficacy towards verification and were more concerned about their reputation on social media.

AB  - This study explored the relationships between General Practitioners' (GPs) beliefs about People With Schizophrenia (PWS) and GPs' recommendations regarding restrictions for such people when in medical (nonpsychiatric) hospital, and whether these relationships were mediated by dangerousness perception. There were 322 randomly selected Italian GPs who completed a questionnaire measuring beliefs about PWS. Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to explore the effects of these beliefs on the GPs' views about the need for restrictive rules in hospital. Thirty-1 percent of GPs firmly believed that, in medical wards, PWS should be supervised and 18% that they should be separated from other patients. SEM revealed that belief in such differential treatment was positively related to a belief that PWS need medication for the rest of their lives, and to perceptions of others' need for social distance, and of dangerousness. Dangerousness was, in turn, positively related to the belief that PWS need medication for their lives, and to a perception of the need for social distance, but negatively related to perceived capacity to report health problems. Analyses of indirect effects showed that the relationships of belief in discriminatory treatment with belief in medication for life and with perceived social distance were mediated by perceived dangerousness. GPs' attitudes about PWS appear closely with their beliefs on discriminatory behaviors in hospital, and the mediating role of dangerousness perceptions. Providing GPs with education about schizophrenia treatments and prognosis, and countering stereotypes about dangerousness, could be helpful to reduce GPs' beliefs in the need for discriminatory treatment of PWS.

AB  - With the real-time brand communications prevalent in Twitter, it has emerged as an increasingly important social technology that facilitates brand-focused electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) activities. The objective of the current research is to examine the factors which discriminate between Twitter brand followers' decisions to engage in eWOM behaviors on the site. Specifically, this study proposes that peer communication, brand-related factors, and Twitter usage motivate brand followers to share eWOM messages on Twitter. Results from an online survey showed that brand followers who serve as role-models to others, those with positive attitudes toward and relationships with brands on Twitter, those who most heavily use Twitter and follow many brands, were most likely to tweet brands. Similar patterns were found in terms of retweeting the links of brands. This study contributes to the literature by demonstrating that Twitter is a socialization agent that facilitates eWOM and provides useful insights for social media marketers. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how exposure to a presidential candidate's high engagement Instagram images influences a citizen's candidate evaluations. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected via Amazon MTurk. A 3 x 2 experimental design was employed to test the persuasive effect of exposure of the "most liked" and "most commented on" images of the top four 2016 US presidential primary candidates on a US citizen's candidate evaluation. Findings Results reveal that highly engaging Instagram images of unfamiliar presidential candidates positively influenced candidate evaluations. However, the same was not true for more well-known presidential candidates. Research limitations/implications This study was not conducted during a live campaign and only examined four of the top 2016 presidential primary candidates. Practical implications The research includes implications for marketers seeking to increase engagement and reach in Instagram marketing campaigns. This study shows that even brief exposure to a highly engaged post involving an unfamiliar person/product on social media can significantly alter evaluations of that person or product. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no experimental designs have addressed how Instagram posts influence users' political attitudes and behaviors within the political marketing and communications literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although higher education and healthier practices are positively associated, the explanatory mechanisms for this association remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to better understand mechanisms underlying this association by examining maternal adherence to 2 health-promoting infant care practices: supine placement and breastfeeding.
   METHODS: We analyzed nationally representative data from the Study of Attitudes and Factors Effecting Infant Care, which surveyed US mothers after infant birth and 2 months thereafter. Using the Theory of Planned Behavior as a framework, we used structural equation models to elucidate mediational pathways from maternal education to supine infant placement or any breastfeeding.
   RESULTS: Data from 3297 mothers demonstrated 77.0% of infants usually were placed supine, and 57.8% received any breastfeeding. The overall direct effect of maternal educational level on supine placement and any breastfeeding was odds ratio (OR) 1.31 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.11 -1.54) and OR 2.82 ( 95% CI 2.35-3.37), respectively. In pathway analyses, the strongest associations with both supine position and breastfeeding were seen with positive attitudes (supine: aOR 18.96, 95% CI 9.00-39.92; breastfeeding: aOR 3.86, 95% CI 2.19-6.82) and positive social norms (supine: aOR 6.69, 95% CI 4.52-9.89; breastfeeding: aOR 5.17, 95% CI 4.28-6.23). Mothers with more education had higher odds of both positive attitudes and positive norms for the 2 practices.
   CONCLUSIONS: The associations linking educational attainment with health practices are intricate, with multiple mediating pathways. Attitudes and social norms are powerful forces that mediate the association between maternal educational attainment and both infant supine positioning and breastfeeding, and may be important mediators for other health behaviors.

AB  - Social media is often used to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and engage the public, which can change the public's attitudes and behaviors and may be used to benefit conservation. Moreover, widespread social media use provides an alternative data sourcing platform to inexpensively access countless potential respondents. However, social media data have rarely been used in conservation regardless of the potential benefit to conservation science and practice. We administered a questionnaire via the #CougarOrNot Twitter game, a mountain lion-focused social media campaign, during 26 December 2016 through 16 February 2018, to access a large respondent sample (n = 1,481) and assess a subset of social media users' attitudes toward mountain lions in North America. We then used cumulative link models in an information theoretic approach to gauge the association between respondent level of engagement with #CougarOrNot and other sociodemographic predictors with user attitudes toward mountain lions. Respondent attitudes toward mountain lions were largely positive (83%), with frequent participants in #CougarOrNot, females, pet owners, nonconsumptive recreators, and households with fewer children exhibiting positive attitudes. #CougarOrNot participation had a stronger correlation with respondent attitudes toward mountain lions than commonly used predictors employed in prior studies (i.e. age, education level, livestock ownership). #CougarOrNot may promote positive attitudes toward mountain lions, though additional research is needed to determine the direct effects of playing the game. Stakeholders interested in mountain lion conservation or other conservation topics could be identified via social media networks attached to specific outreach campaigns and possibly mobilized to support conservation actions that aid mountain lions and conservation in general.

AB  - Some countries have replaced face-to-face education with distance education in response to the coronavirus. This form of distance education differs from conventional distance education: being suddenly, unreadily and forcefully implemented, invading schooling and constituting a globally discussed phenomenon. This article builds a conceptual framework for this education, addressing the question: What are the ramifications of implementing distance education amid coronavirus? It targets Arab culture, although globalisation and the media may have harmonised any substantial cross-cultural variations. Various ramifications have emerged through analysing social-media posts, online classes and interviews. Concerning social and cultural ramifications, some may, for ideological considerations, tolerate, support, reject or subvert this education through campaigning, rumour and humour. Regarding pedagogical and psychological ramifications, unreadiness and incompetence may compromise education. Additionally, staying home may entail problems (pandemic-related stress, anxiety, depression, domestic violence, divorce and pregnancy), preventing students and teachers from learning and teaching. Concerning procedural and logistical ramifications, some Arab contexts may be digitally readier than non-Arab contexts. Additionally, stakeholders may intensify efforts to profit, ethically or unethically, from the over demand for this education. Distance education is one of several social distancing initiatives, which Arabs have welcomed despite their well-rooted social closeness, bonding to debond, forming unorthodox 'distanceship'.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic has affected the lives of people and has forced businesses to develop different ways of doing businesses. Several businesses have implemented social responsibility activities. With social distancing keeping many people at home, online and digital platforms have become one of the most important mechanisms for businesses undertakings and implementing those social responsibility initiatives and activities - digital social responsibility (DSR). The purpose of this study is to examine the relationships of electronic wordof-mouth (eWOM) intentions and customer engagement with DSR in social media with attitude toward DSR as the antecedent during COVID-19 social distancing situation in Thailand. The study employs a quantitative research method where sampling method is followed by convenience sampling technique, and study data is collected through survey questionnaire with social media users who have experiences with firms' online social responsibility initiatives. Based the samples of 123 respondents, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) has been used for analysis. The results show that attitudes toward DSR in social media significantly influence electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) intentions and have a significant effect on customer engagement with DSR in social media. The mediation analysis also revealed that eWOM intention partially mediated the relation between attitudes toward DSR in social media and customer engagement.

AB  - Following the signing of peace agreements, post-accord societies often remain deeply divided across group lines. There is a need to identify antecedents of youth's support for peace and establish more constructive intergroup relations. This article explored the effect of out-group trust, intergroup forgiveness, and social identity on support for the peace process among youth from the historic majority and minority communities in Belfast, Northern Ireland. The sample comprised 667 adolescents (49% male; M = 15.74, SD = 1.99 years old) across two time points. The results from the structural equation model suggested that out-group trust was related to intergroup forgiveness over time, while forgiveness related to later support for the peace process. Strength of in-group social identity differentially moderated how out-group trust and intergroup forgiveness related to later support for peace among youth from the conflict-related groups (i.e., Protestants and Catholics). Implications for consolidating peace in Northern Ireland are discussed, which may be relevant to other settings affected by intergroup conflict.

AB  - Although popular music and politics have been linked in various contexts, surprisingly little is known about whether and how popular songs can influence political attitudes. The present study provides initial empirical evidence that popular music affects public opinion by altering the standards for subsequent political judgments. Using an experiment of a national sample, the current study demonstrates that Lady Gaga's highly popularized song, "Born This Way," primes genetic explanations of homosexuality in citizens' ensuing evaluations of gay rights issues. The findings revealed that vocalized lyrics are the key element of the priming effect among other musical components.

AB  - Political and public health leaders promoting COVID-19 vaccination should identify the most relevant criteria driving the vaccination decision. Social media is increasingly used as a source of vaccination data and as a powerful communication tool to increase vaccination. In December 2020, we performed a cross-sectional social media-based survey addressing personal sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination in the USA. Our primary research objective is to identify socio-demographic characteristics and the reasons for the 1644 survey participants' attitudes regarding vaccination. We present clear evidence that, contrary to the prevailing public perceptions, young audiences using social media have mostly a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination (81.5%). These younger individuals want to protect their families and their relatives (96.7%); they see vaccination as an act of civic responsibility (91.9%) and express strong confidence in their healthcare providers (87.7%). Another critical factor is the younger population's fear of personal COVID-19 infection (88.2%); moreover, the greater the number of children the participants have, the greater is their intent to get the COVID-19 vaccine. These results enable a practical public-messaging pathway to reinforce vaccination campaigns addressing the younger population.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the attitude to and perception of transvaginal sonography (TVS) among Nigerian women of mixed educational status in order to ascertain factors that may prevent them from submitting to TVS when recommended.
   METHODS: A Cross-sectional survey was adopted for the study. Subjects were enrolled from one missionary, one government and eight private hospitals. The instruments for data collection were visual analogue scale (VAS), to ascertain patients' pain/discomfort experience, and a researcher-developed semi-structured questionnaire. The level of pain/discomfort on the VAS was categorized into four on a scale of 100. The categories were: 0-5 (no pain), 6-40 (mild pain), 41-74 (moderate pain), and 75-100 (severe pain).
   RESULTS: The majority (50.6%) of the respondents who attained secondary education had positive attitude to TVS. The majority majority of the respondents (63.1%) preferred female sonographers. A majority of the respondents (54.1%) perceived TVS as not embarrassing, 78% did not consider it stressful, 96.9% reported that the sonographers were professional, 46.7% felt that a chaperon was needed, 98.4% reported there was enough privacy and 84.7% reported they needed prior information. Most of the respondents (82%) were willing to consent to TVS in future, 90.5% reported no pain, 8.6% reported mild pain/discomfort and 0.9% reported moderate pain.
   CONCLUSIONS: Majority of our respondents had a positive attitude to TVS and were willing to consent to TVS in future, hence it was acceptable to them. It was however observed that acceptability increased with increasing education.

AB  - ObjectiveTo assess community practices related to COVID-19 prevention and its associated factors during the early introduction of the disease to the study area.Setting and participantsA community-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Southern Nations, Nationalities and People's Region, Ethiopia. Ten zonal towns with high population density and mobility and 1239 participants were included in the study.Outcome measureA semistructured questionnaire was uploaded to SurveyCTO data collection system with security patterns. Mask usage was assessed by observation, while social distancing and handwashing were assessed by interview. Data were collected by health professionals who have Bachelor of Science degree and above and analysed using SPSS V.25. Descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression were performed.ResultsFrom 1239 individuals, about half, 657 (53%), of respondents were women and about two-thirds, 795 (64.2%), were married. Nearly 9 out of 10 (90.3%) and about 8 out of 10 (82.0%) respondents reported that they frequently wash hands with soap and/or use sanitiser and keep social distancing as means to prevent COVID-19, respectively. Less than three-fifths (57.8%) of respondents wore masks during the interview. In summary, about half (48.9%) of respondents were practising the three recommended methods (social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks). Sex, educational status, family size and overall knowledge about COVID-19 were associated with practising COVID-19 prevention measures.ConclusionCOVID-19 prevention practice was low as only about half of participants were practising social distancing, handwashing and wearing masks. Although awareness creation has been implemented through different forms of media, it should be strengthened in different local languages. Concerned government bodies should strictly follow using masks in public gatherings.

AB  - Research on residential diversification has mainly focused on its negative impacts upon community cohesion and positive effects on intergroup relations. However, these analyses ignore how neighborhood identity can shape the consequences of diversification among residents. Elsewhere, research using the Applied Social Identity Approach (ASIA) has demonstrated the potential for neighborhood identity to provide social and psychological resources to cope with challenges. The current article proposes a novel model whereby these "Social Cure" processes can enable residents to cope with the specific challenges of diversification. We present two studies in support of this model, each from the increasingly religiously desegregated society of postconflict Northern Ireland. Analysis of the 2012 "Northern Ireland Life and Times" survey shows that across Northern Ireland, neighborhood identity impacts positively upon both well-being and intergroup attitudes via a reduction in intergroup anxiety. A second custom-designed survey of residents in a newly mixed area of Belfast shows that neighborhood identification predicts increased well-being, reduced intergroup anxiety, and reduced prejudice independently of group norms and experiences of contact. For political psychologists, our evidence suggests a reformulation of the fundamental question of "what effects do residential mixing have on neighborhoods?" to "how can neighborhood communities support residents to collectively cope with contact?"

AB  - Background: Non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a serious public health concern facing adolescents and young adults worldwide. Despite growing concern that accessing NSSI content on the internet may negatively influence perceptions toward NSSI recovery, no studies have examined actual impacts.
   Objectives: This experimental pilot study assessed the impact of exposure to hopeless versus hopeful peer messages on perceptions toward NSSI recovery. It was hypothesized that exposure to hopeless messages would lead to more negative perceptions about NSSI recovery whereas the opposite would occur for hopeful messages.
   Methods: We developed fictional peer comments embedded in a screenshot of an NSSI-themed YouTube video and randomly assigned participants to either hopeless or hopeful recovery-oriented comments. Participants' attitudes toward NSSI recovery, recovery-oriented subjective norms, and recovery self-efficacy were measured pre- and post-exposure using an online questionnaire.
   Results: Sixty-one participants with a self-reported NSSI history (mean age 20.89 years) completed the online survey. There was a statistically significant effect for attitudes toward recovery. Within the hopeful comment condition, there was an increase in positive attitudes toward recovery and in recovery-oriented subjective norms. Participants exposed to hopeless peer messages did not report an increase in hopeless attitudes toward NSSI recovery.
   Conclusions: Our pilot study indicated that exposure to hopeful online messages improved positive attitudes toward recovery and recovery-oriented subjective norms, while exposure to hopeless messages did not increase hopeless attitudes. Future research on the impacts of online peer comments on one's attitude toward NSSI recovery and support-seeking behavior could further inform practices and policies.

AB  - Commercials influence our attitudes and consumer behavior. We investigated whether mimicking product presenters in commercials adds to positive effects on attitudes and behavioral consumer intentions. Participants watched TV commercials and were instructed to mimic or not to mimic the movements of the model presenting a product. Then we measured their attitude toward the products (Studies 1 and 2) and their behavioral intention to buy the products (Study 2). Results revealed that mimickers had a more positive attitude toward the presented products and had more intention to buy the products than non-mimickers. Furthermore we demonstrated that the mimicry effect on behavioral intention was mediated by attitudes. Thus mimicry makes products presented in a persuasive setting more attractive to us, which increases the intention to buy these products.

TI  - Pandemic infection rates are deterministic but cannot be modeled
T2  - AIP ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - The covid-19 infection rates for a large number of infections collected from a large number of different sites are well defined with a negligible scatter. The simplest invertible iterated map, exponential growth and decay, emerges from country-wide histograms whenever Tchebychev's inequality is satisfied to within several decimal places. This is one point. Another is that failed covid-19 pandemic model predictions have been reported repeatedly by the news media. Model predictions fail because the observed infection rates are beyond modeling: any model that uses fixed rates or uses memory or averages of past rates cannot reproduce the data on active infections. When those possibilities are ruled out, then little is left. Under lockdown and social distancing, the rates unfold daily in small but unforeseeable steps, they are algorithmically complex. We can, however, use two days in the daily data, today and any single day in the past (generally yesterday), to make a useful forecast of future infections. No model provides results better than this simple forecast. We analyze the actual doubling times for covid-19 data and compare them with our predicted doubling times. Flattening and peaking are precisely defined. We identify and study the separate effects of social distancing vs recoveries in the daily infection rates. Social distancing can only cause flattening but recoveries are required in order for the active infections to peak and decay. Three models and their predictions are analyzed. Pandemic data for Austria, Germany, Italy, the USA, the UK, Finland, China, Taiwan, and Sweden are discussed.

AB  - The exceptional levels of political polarization, party system fragmentation, and electoral volatility that Spain is currently experiencing, all recommend analysing the origins of these patterns. We employ a unique combination of individual-level survey and Twitter activity data pertaining to a sample of users of the Voting Advice Application we launched during the transformative 2015 Spanish general elections campaign to investigate the ideological determinants of individuals' online network building. Our results demonstrate that, among those following online parties/candidates' profiles, political promiscuity is the most common behaviour, though this behaviour depends heavily on users' broader online and offline political attitudes.

AB  - The rise of digital media has increased the opportunities for individuals to self-select political content online. This development has stimulated empirical research on how people select political information, especially when political beliefs are at stake. In the present paper, we tested a series of theory-derived assumptions about antecedents and consequences of selective exposure to confirmative political information and opinions in the digital arena. We conducted an online survey with German Internet users (N = 897, April 2016) and assessed political attitudes, media use and general beliefs in the context of the so-called "migration crisis". 28% of the participants in our sample reported exposure to a confirmative information environment. They are more likely to hear or read about political opinions on migration and political asylum that are similar to their own compared to cross-cutting content. We found no evidence for the assumption that the technological affordances of the Internet foster this form of selective political exposure. Instead, our analyses indicate that conservatism is a positive predictor of selecting confirmative information environments when it comes to migration and political asylum. We also gathered evidence that this relation is mediated by perceived threat and that selective political exposure is linked to truly false consensus beliefs. Our findings inform supply- and demand-side explanations of selective political exposure online. We discuss the relevance for psychological theories about the motivational underpinnings of selective exposure.

AB  - In their 2011 piece, Smith et al. argue that there is a set of fundamental or bedrock values that predict ideology and that are strongly influenced by genetics. These values are considered universal, stable, and less susceptible to environmental changes. Smith et al. propose a scale to measure such values: the Society Works Best Index (SWBI). This is an important contribution, but the SWBI requires further evaluation. Using novel panel data, we evaluate the measure, improve on the empirical application with a national panel, and suggest improvements in the scale. We find that the SWBI is no more stable than other measures of ideology and that the observed changes are attributed to measurement error and environmental factors. Furthermore, like many other political attitudes, its predictive power is mediated by levels of political interest.

   Results: Significant predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake intentions were education, having insurance, scoring high on subjective norms, a positive attitude toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, scoring low on barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy. Predictors of willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine under EUA were age, race/ethnicity, positive subjective norms, high perceived behavioral control, positive attitudes toward the vaccine, as well as high perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, high perceived benefits of the vaccine, low barriers to the vaccine, and scoring high on self-efficacy for getting the vaccine. Concerns about rushed vaccine development appear to reduce vaccine uptake intent, as well as willingness to get the vaccine under EUA.
   Conclusions: COVID-19 vaccine-related messages should both address concerns about the vaccine and its development and reinforce benefits of the vaccine (both factors significant in both models).
   Vaccine efforts may need to go beyond just communications campaigns correcting misinformation about a COVID-19 vaccine to also focus on re-establishing public trust in government agencies.

AB  - Several clinical and radiological factors can be prognostic in the development of angular deformity following physeal injuries of the distal tibia. One of the radiological parameters, premature physeal closure (PPC), can be detected during postoperative follow-ups. Aim of our study was to identify the prognostic factors in development of angular deformity and its relationship with PPC.
   One hundred and four patients treated due to physeal injuries of the distal tibia were included in our study. Patients were divided into three groups based on Salter-Harris (SH) classification. The intergroup relationships between sex, age, the amount of energy sustained during injury, premature physeal closure, the amount of residual gap, and deformity were analyzed.
   Angular deformity developed in 25% (3/12) of SH Type 2, in 60% (9/15) of Type 3 and 30% (3/10) of Type 4 patients with PPC. A residual displacement of more than 2 mm, age and premature physeal closure were specified as significant risk factors for development of angular deformity.
   2 mm limit for residual displacement and findings of premature physeal closure in the radiological evaluations during follow-ups are prognostic factors in avoiding malalignment of the distal tibia. Level of evidence: Level 3.

AB  - This mixed-methods study aims to examine the mediating role of attitude toward English varieties in the relationship between Informal Digital Learning of English (IDLE) and perceptions of using English as an International Language (EIL) materials in pre-service English teachers. We collected and analyzed survey data from 434 Indonesian EFL pre-service teachers, using the Jamovi programme. Survey results showed that both receptive and productive IDLE activities had a significant impact on attitudes toward different forms of English, which in turn had a significant impact on views of using EIL resources. Individual interviews (n = 10) and stimulated recalls (n = 7) revealed that participation in IDLE activities (e.g. watching YouTube videos with different English accents and users) aided in maintaining a more positive attitude toward different varieties of English. As a result, pre-service EFL teachers became more open to using EIL materials, such as listening materials that employ different English accents. This study suggests that IDLE is an important factor in developing positive attitudes toward English varieties, an approach that may enable today's pre-service EFL teachers to become more open toward and tolerant of integrating EIL pedagogy into practice.

KW  - VIOLENCE

KW  - WOMEN
AB  - This paper examines whetherand if so howa 2002 European Directive on sexual harassment has changed the practice and content of sexual harassment law in France. It finds that the European Directive shaped how French courts address sexual harassment and informed the content of a new sexual harassment law France passed in 2012. Yet, its influence has been mediated by dominant national attitudes about: (1) the nature of sexual harassment, (2) which legal institutions are best suited to address it, and (3) the character of women who claim to have been harassed. This paper further suggests that news reporting on a 2011 arrest of a French politician for sexual assault led to more positive attitudes about sexual harassment victims.

AB  - Children of binational couples are often raised in the community of one of the parents and, thus, have limited exposure to the language of the other parent. This study focuses on a British/Moroccan family in the UK, where English is the dominant home language and Moroccan Arabic is the 'other' language. Analysis of 'live' family conversations at home in the UK and 'online' conversations with cousins in Morocco indicate that using Moroccan Arabic at home is often seen as a chore, whereas in online conversations it is seen as fun. The use of computer-mediated communication appears to have contributed to a more positive attitude towards using the language and developing a bilingual identity.

AB  - The advent of Information Communications Technology has revolutionized ESL writing instruction. This quasi-experiment investigated the correlations of self-perception in reading, self-perception in writing, reading performance and writing performance of two groups of freshman college students representing two learning conditions - the experimental group (38) exposed to Web-mediated Instruction and the control group (38) taught using the Conventional Method. Researcher-made reading test, self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing inventory validated by language experts, and writing prompt for informative essay were administered to both groups of students before and after the treatment period which ran for 13 weeks. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to examine the correlations among variables and ANCOVA was used to determine the effect of web-mediated and conventional writing instruction on students' writing performance. Results of independent t-test show that there is a significant difference in the pre-test and posttest writing scores of both experimental and control groups. However, there is no significant difference between the reading and writing performance of experimental group and control group at p < 0.05) based on ANCOVA results. Therefore, web-mediated writing instruction via weblogs and conventional writing instruction are equally effective in enhancing students' writing performance. As regards, correlations of variables tested in this study, for experimental group, reading performance positively significantly affects writing performance. Both self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing insignificantly affect writing performance. Reading performance is insignificantly correlated with self-perception in reading. For control group, self-perception in reading and reading performance positively significantly affect the control group's writing performance. Reading performance is insignificantly correlated with self-perception in reading and self-perception in writing. In both groups, self-perception in reading is positively correlated with self-perception in writing. Hence, educators should develop students' positive attitude towards reading to effect positive attitude towards their writing. As what research shows, positive self-concept in writing will more likely result in improvement of writing skills.

AB  - Objective: We sought to test whether participation in an online group including IUD users influenced IUD-related knowledge, attitudes, and behavior among IUD non-users, as a proof-of-concept evaluation of information dissemination for less commonly used or novel contraceptives.
   Study design: We conducted a blinded, randomized controlled trial on the effect of online communication with IUD users within an online program called Birth Control Connect. Participants were women age 1845 living in the United States who had never used an IUD. We invited participants randomized to the intervention to join two-week, nine-member discussion groups including four satisfied IUD users and five IUD non-users; we invited control participants to groups including nine IUD non-users. We performed chi-squared tests on IUD knowledge, information-seeking, informational support and use in immediate post-surveys, and t-tests comparing change in IUD attitudes and frequency of logins to discussion groups.
   Results: We invited 488 IUD non-users and enrolled them into 70 groups between October 2015 and April 2016. We found increased positive attitudes towards the IUD in the intervention arm (0.65-point increase between pre- and post-surveys, versus 0.05 mean change for control arm, p = 0.03 for hormonal IUD, with a trend in the same direction for the non-hormonal IUD). Informational support also increased, with 70.3% of intervention arm participants self-reporting that they gained a better idea of what the IUD would be like, compared to 51.3% in control arm (p < 0.01). Of intervention participants, 63.3% versus 51.3% of control participants reported gaining new information from their group (p = 0.03). There were no differences in correct responses to knowledge items or information-seeking between groups.
   Conclusions: Online exposure to IUD users increased positive attitudes toward the IUD and informational support for decision-making about the IUD among non-users. Implications statement: Online spaces provide a promising environment for the exchange of accurate, useful contraceptive information based on real user experiences. Interventions aiming to harness social communication through structured online conversations (e.g., on existing social media platforms) about user experiences with lesser-known contraceptive methods such as the IUD may be worthwhile.

AB  - Numerous studies have found that perspective-taking reduces stereotyping and prejudice, but they have only involved negative stereotypes. Because target negativity has been empirically confounded with reduced stereotyping, the general effects of perspective-taking on stereotyping and prejudice are unclear. By including both positively and negatively stereotyped targets, this research offers the first empirical test of two competing hypotheses: The positivity hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking produces a positivity bias, with less stereotyping of negative targets but more stereotyping of positive targets. In contrast, the stereotype-reduction hypothesis predicts that perspective-taking reduces stereotyping, regardless of target valence. Three studies support the stereotype-reduction hypothesis. Perspective-taking also produced less positive attitudes toward positive targets, with reduced stereotyping mediating this effect. A final study demonstrated that perspective-taking reduced all stereotyping because it increased self-other overlap. These findings help answer fundamental questions about perspective-taking's effects and processes, and provide evidence that perspective-taking does not improve attitudes invariantly.

AB  - This experimental study assessed whether alcohol television storylines impact youth drinking attitudes and intentions and whether corrective epilogues can potentially moderate this impact. Television episodes were professionally produced to depict heavy drinking leading to either positive or negative consequences. The pro- and anti-alcohol episodes were shown alone or with an epilogue where a main character discussed the deleterious effects of excessive drinking. Attitudes toward drinkers and drinking intentions were measured subsequently, along with reactions to the episode and demographic data, among participants aged 14-17 using an online study. Exposure to the pro-alcohol episode was related to more positive attitudes toward drinkers. Including an epilogue after a pro-alcohol episode was related to more negative viewers' attitudes toward drinkers and lower drinking intentions compared to a pro-alcohol episode with no epilogue. By contrast, including an epilogue after an anti-alcohol episode was unrelated to attitudes toward drinkers or drinking intentions. Viewing a single television episode with a pro-alcohol message may lead to more positive attitudes toward drinkers. The finding that a brief epilogue may reduce the impact of the pro-alcohol storyline suggests easily implemented preventive strategies to counter the adverse impact of substance use portrayals in entertainment programming.

AB  - As nineteenth-century etiquette books remind their readers, the basic principles of social life meant maintaining a clear and insulating space around corporal forms. Amid such normative expectations, Wharton's characters move through material worlds richly populated with objects, many of which are alluringly textured. This essay argues that a number of these objects were charged with additional associative meanings, based on the persons with whom they are most closely aligned, often their owners. Such material items become what I describe as the "proximate objects" that fascinate Wharton's characters, not only because of their sensual appeal, but also because of their combined physical availability and association with other human forms. For characters in fictions such as The Age of Innocence, Ethan Frome, and The Reef, proximate objects have the capacity to mediate human desires by providing a sense of an appropriately distanced but nevertheless material intimacy with another person as they stand in for human forms that must remain socially distanced from one another. Revealing the dynamic and sensual dimensions of the material world, the haptic encounters experienced by Wharton's characters offer insight into the materiality interwoven with human desire.

AB  - Recognizing the globalization of higher education institutions, this study examined the influence of university-student relationships on host country-related outcomes, including student attitudes, purchase intentions, and policy support. A survey was conducted with Chinese students who had studied or who were currently studying at South Korean universities. Its results showed a significant positive association between Chinese student perceptions of their relationships with host universities and their attitudes toward South Korea. In addition, their positive attitudes led to (i) intentions to purchase Korean products and (ii) policy support for the Korean government. The theoretical and practical implications of study findings are discussed from the perspectives of public diplomacy and the university's role in a highly globalized education system.

AB  - Differences in attachment styles and conflict resolution skills may exist for those who choose to initiate or who receive relationship dissolution mediated by technology. 304 college students (F = 178, M = 126) completed an online questionnaire about their demographics, relationship status, attachment styles, and conflict resolution skills. Text messaging was the most common form of technology to initiate or receive a breakup. Greater attachment anxiety predicted being the recipient of a technology-mediated dissolution. Positive attitudes towards conflict resolution predicted having initiated a breakup via technology. There were no significant differences in attachment styles or conflict resolution skills for those using text messaging to receive or initiate conflict resolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - One of the most controversial issues in marketing is marketing towards children. Beginning with the analysis of the process of children's involvement in consumption, child's ability to understand and critically respond to an advertisement, parents' attitudes to children's advertising and possible directions and solutions to the problem of advertising to children the article empirically examines parents' attitudes towards television advertising. Research results include parents of children aged between 10-12 and indicate that parents in general have no positive attitude to advertising to children and show mild interest for the prohibition of television advertisements.

AB  - Previous research has shown that negative attitudes towards immigrants and support for anti-immigrant parties are observed both among those experiencing relative deprivation and those experiencing relative gratification (so called v-curve). Whereas the effect of relative deprivation is intuitive, the effect of relative gratification is more difficult to explain. Why would economic prosperity provoke negative attitudes towards immigrants? We first present correlational (Study 1) and experimental (Study 2) support for the v-curve. In Study 1, in a national Swiss referendum, a higher percentage anti-immigrant voting was found in cantons with relatively lower and relatively higher relative disposable income. In Study 2, in a hypothetical society, more opposition to 'newcomers' joining society was found among poor or above average wealth group members than among those in a moderate wealth group condition. In Study 3, we replicate this finding and also show that opposition to immigration is higher for all wealth groups when societal inequality is growing rather than declining. In a final study, we examine different forms of relative gratification and mediators of the relationship between relative gratification and opposition to immigration (i.e., identification, collective self-definition as competent and cold, and fear about future wealth). Only fear about future wealth mediates this relationship. We conclude that, paradoxically, relative gratification effects are partly due to the fear of future deprivation.

AB  - Background: International literature reports that nursing students feel unprepared when facing patients and families within dying care. They consider their curricula inadequate in teaching end-of-life care and promoting the attitudes required to care for dying patients. Findings of recent studies exploring nursing students' attitudes towards care of the dying patient are often contradictory. Objectives: To explore Italian nursing students' attitudes towards caring for dying patients. Design: A multicenter cross-sectional study was conducted. Settings: The Bachelor's Degree in Nursing courses of four Universities of the Lazio Region. Participants: The sample included 1193 students. Methods: Data were collected between September 2017 and March 2018 using the Italian version of FATCOD-B-I. The differences between the mean scores were compared through t-test or ANOVA. Associations between scores and participant characteristics were evaluated through generalized linear regression. Results: The mean score of FATCOD-B-I was 115.3 (SD = 9.1). Higher scores were significantly associated with training in palliative care (p < 0.0001) and experience with terminally ill patients (p < 0.0001). Students manifested more negative attitudes when they perceived patients losing hope of recovering, and patient's family members interfering with health professionals' work. Uncertainties emerged around knowledge of opioid drugs, decision-making, concepts of death and dying, management of mourning, and relational aspects of patient care. Conclusions: Italian nursing students seem to have more positive attitudes towards care of dying patients than most other countries. They believe that caring for a terminal patient is a formative, useful experience but they do not feel adequately prepared in practice. Deeper palliative care education, integrated with practical training, would prepare students better, enabling them to discover their own human and professional capacity to relieve suffering.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to theorize the heightened exposure to information via the internet can lead citizens to be more critical about political conditions in their countries because using social media increases the likelihood of being exposed to dissident information. Further, the authors argue that the degree to which information is restricted, or internet access is limited, across countries can decrease this effect simply because the likelihood of exposure to a dissident flow is diminished.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used survey data from the 2010 Latino Barometer to estimate a series of multilevel models to test whether citizens' attitudes about the political conditions and about democracy in their respective countries worsen, and whether this effect is stronger in countries with higher internet freedom.
   Findings - The results confirm that social media use has a negative influence on citizens' attitudes about their national political conditions. In addition, respondents from those countries with more internet freedom tended to have more positive attitudes about their democracy and political conditions, generally. However, as a result of more internet freedom, the negative effects of internet and social media use on these attitudes was more pronounced in countries with more internet freedom.
   Originality/value - These results suggest that the flow of information via the internet has substantial effect on how people feel about their government. This could be consequential for political stability, particularly in countries the conditions are not favorable. That said, these results also suggest that governments can actively decrease the odds of this dissidence building by controlling the flow of information.

AB  - The growing use of storytelling as an advertising strategy for brands online poses the question of their relative effectiveness compared to more factual types of ads. In this context, this article focuses on the role of character identification and character type in the effects of narrative transportation that occur from storytelling ads. Using four experimental studies in two different contexts, two brand types, and two character types (human versus animal), the findings present a cautionary tale for the use of storytelling. By generating higher levels of narrative transportation, storytelling video ads can reduce character identification, which results in an overall decrease in positive attitude toward the brand, when using animal characters. These main findings are nuanced in the presence of joyful emotions. Implication for research and practice are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examines the Twitter network discussing the inclusion of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans woman Olympian, during the 2020 Tokyo Games. By analyzing the Twitter reactions, top opinion leaders, and the modularity of the network, this study uncovers that (a) the majority of the top 10 most-liked tweets and the top influential social actors hold a negative attitude toward Laurel Hubbard's participation in the women's category; (b) compared to traditional news agencies, social media influencers and newly launched digital media agencies play a more important role in facilitating the flow of information in this network; and (c) the observed Twitter network is highly clustered, indicating that individuals tend to interact with people more frequently within their segregated subgroup, whereas information diffusion across clusters is more restricted. This research contributes to the understanding of how Twitter users perceive the inclusion of trans athletes at international sporting events by empirically exploring the Twitter network of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans female athlete in Olympic history.

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, countries have sought to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission by restricting population movement through social distancing interventions, thus reducing the number of contacts. Mobility data represent an important proxy measure of social distancing, and here, we characterise the relationship between transmission and mobility for 52 countries around the world. Transmission significantly decreased with the initial reduction in mobility in 73% of the countries analysed, but we found evidence of decoupling of transmission and mobility following the relaxation of strict control measures for 80% of countries. For the majority of countries, mobility explained a substantial proportion of the variation in transmissibility (median adjusted R-squared: 48%, interquartile range - IQR - across countries [27-77%]). Where a change in the relationship occurred, predictive ability decreased after the relaxation; from a median adjusted R-squared of 74% (IQR across countries [49-91%]) pre-relaxation, to a median adjusted R-squared of 30% (IQR across countries [12-48%]) post-relaxation. In countries with a clear relationship between mobility and transmission both before and after strict control measures were relaxed, mobility was associated with lower transmission rates after control measures were relaxed indicating that the beneficial effects of ongoing social distancing behaviours were substantial. Social distancing policies aiming to reduce COVID-19 transmission have been reflected in reductions in human mobility. Here, the authors show that reduced mobility is correlated with decreased transmission, but that this relationship weakened over time as social distancing measures were relaxed.

AB  - The inclusion of children with special educational needs is a major challenge. Amongst the factors linked to a successful inclusive education policy, teachers' attitude toward inclusion is particularly important. The present paper seeks to understand why general teachers exhibit less favourable attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. We argue that general teachers' low sense of efficacy can act as a mediator. To investigate this hypothesis, general and special education teachers were asked to report their attitude and efficacy. Results confirm that general teachers have less positive attitude toward inclusion than special education teachers. In addition, a mediational analysis confirmed that this discrepancy is partly sustained by general teachers' lower sense of efficacy. Limits as well as future perspective are discussed.

AB  - Five experiments examine the interactive power of descriptive and injunctive norms regarding intergroup friendships on the effects of extended contact knowing ingroup members having outgroup friends - on intergroup orientations. We propose that the positive effect of extended contact can occur even when the ingroup members having outgroup friends are unknown to the individual who becomes aware of such contact - de-personalized extended contact. However, to be effective depersonalized extended contact requires ingroup normative support. We tested this prediction by providing participants with information about the number of ingroup members (Spaniards) who have outgroup (immigrants) friends-descriptive norms- and the normative support for cross-group friendship-injunctive norms. Three experiments tested how different levels of depersonalized extended contact (none vs. low vs. high), consensus regarding norms about cross-group friendship (low vs. high), and the source of such norms (ingroup vs. outgroup) impact intergroup orientations. Even low levels of depersonalized extended contact had positive effects on intergroup orientations, when there was normative support for cross-group friendship from the ingroup, but not from the outgroup. Two additional experiments extended these effects to a behavioral outcome, and showed that the positive effect of ingroup injunctive norms was mediated by the enhanced belief that outgroup members had a genuine interest in intergroup contact (integrative motives). However, the lack of effect of outgroup injunctive norms was mediated by the suspicion that outgroup members held utilitarian motives for contact. Implications of these findings for improving intergroup relations through depersonalized extended contact and injunctive normative influence are discussed.

AB  - Opinionated news targets communities of likeminded viewers, relies on dramaturgical storytelling techniques, and shares characteristics with political satire. Accordingly, opinionated news should be understood as a specific form of political entertainment. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of opinionated news on political attitudes using an experimental design that employed manipulated television news items. Findings confirm that opinionated news positively affects policy attitudes via its presumed influence on others and subsequent perceptions of the opinion climate. However, opinionated news also negatively affects attitudes via hostile media perceptions and evoked anger, especially for people with incongruent political preferences. Due to these opposing processes, we found no total effect of opinionated news on policy attitudes. Conditions are discussed under which either the positive or the negative indirect effect is likely to dominate.

KW  - civility
KW  - affective polarization
KW  - conflict orientation
AB  - Partisan media-typically characterized by incivility-has become a defining element of the American political communication environment. While scholars have explored the consequences of partisan media for political attitudes and behaviors, little work has looked at how variations in incivility moderate partisan media's effects. Using a population-based survey experiment, we show that incivility affectively depolarizes partisans when it comes from an in-party source (e.g., MSNBC for Democrats, Fox News for Republicans). Incivility on out-party sources affectively polarizes the audience, however, and we show that the respondent's degree of conflict aversion conditions these effects. Our results raise intriguing normative questions about the trade-offs between polarization and incivility and highlight how scholars must account for both levels of incivility and partisan slant when studying the effects of partisan media.

AB  - This study investigates the negative influence of consumer's perceptions of online retailer's deceptive practices (perceived deception) on consumer's relational variables (satisfaction and loyalty intentions to the online retailer). Also, the moderating role of product type (goods versus services), consumer's attitude toward the Internet, and consumer's demographics in the deception-relational outcomes link is considered. Data from 398 online consumers revealed that satisfaction totally mediated the influence of deception on loyalty. Furthermore, the deception-satisfaction link was moderated by all the hypothesized variables. Interestingly, a direct effect of deception on loyalty was found among more educated consumers, consumers who had a more positive attitude toward the Internet and consumers who had purchased a physical product. Implications for theory and management are discussed.

AB  - Drawing from activation theory and the goal literature, this research explores how competing product-related goals influence attitudes and intentions and how advertised product claims (fortification and health claims) nudge competing consumer goals. Additionally, this research investigates how promotional cue alignment with a product-related goal can positively influence attitudes and intentions. Four studies reveal that when a promotional cue does not align with a focal product cue, there is no impact on attitudes and intentions. When an additional cue, such as a health message, is added to the promotional claim that is aligned with the product related cue, then multiple aligned cues can nudge a non-focal goal to better align with dominant product-related cues, leading to more positive attitudes and intentions, and this effect is mediated by changes in product health goals. This research has implications for goal literature and for advertisers, manufacturers and policy makers.

AB  - In recent years, growing communities of Muslim-Americans have faced tension in a series of debates over the construction of Islamic prayer spaces in American cities. Islamic community members have found themselves fighting for representation within the political process and for their philosophical right to exist within American society. This study presents a framing analysis of the debate in five US newspapers between 2010 and 2013 as a way of examining the position of Muslims within contemporary American society. The study examines five frames: Local Regulation, Legal Authority, Political Debate, Muslim Neighbors, and Islamic Threat. The first three were episodic frames, while the other two were thematic. Some of the discourse showed evidence of Islamophobia, or indiscriminate negative attitudes or emotions directed at Islam or Muslims. Other stories showed evidence of Islamophilia, which is the stereotypical presentation of good Muslims' who are model citizens in contrast to the bad Muslims' who serve as rhetorical enemies.

AB  - This paper aims to develop an instrument to measure Player-Avatar Identification (PAI) in video game playing. Survey studies were conducted with over 1000 students in Singapore primary and secondary schools. The results of the studies demonstrated that PAI can be conceptualized and reliably measured in terms of four-factors - feelings during play, absorption during play, positive attitudes toward the game avatar and importance of the avatar to one's self identity. The four-factor model showed acceptable model data fit and satisfactory reliability and validity. The construct validity was supported by the relationship between PAI and identity style. The result suggested that students with diffused identity style reported significant higher scores on absorption and importance to identity. The usefulness of the concept and the scale was discussed in relation to behavioral and developmental implications. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated the effectiveness of the In One Voice campaign for raising mental health awareness and improving attitudes of youth and young adults towards mental health issues. The campaign featured a prominent male sports figure talking about mental health issues and used online social media.
   A successive independent samples design assessed market penetration and attitudinal changes among the young people. Two samples completed an online questionnaire either immediately before (T1: n = 403) or 2 months after (T2: n = 403) the campaign launch. Website analytics determined changes in activity levels of a youth-focused mental health website (mindcheck.ca).
   One-quarter (24.8 %, n = 100) of the respondents remembered the campaign. The proportion of respondents who were aware of the website increased significantly from 6.0 % at T1 to 15.6 % at T2. Average overall scores on standardized measures of personal stigma and social distance were not significantly different between T1 and T2 respondents. Attitudes towards mental health issues were statistically similar between respondents who were or were not exposed to the campaign. Those who were exposed to the campaign were significantly more likely to talk about and seek information relating to mental health issues.
   The proximal outcomes of the campaign to increase awareness and use of the website were achieved. The distal outcome of the campaign to improve attitudes towards mental health issues was not successfully achieved. The brief social media campaign improved mental health literacy outcomes, but had limited effect on personal stigma and social distance.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify factors affecting consumers' intention to visit food trucks from both utilitarian and hedonic points of view and to identify the service attributes that consumers consider most important when visiting food trucks. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and an importance-performance analysis (IPA) were conducted with a sample of 467 responses. Hedonic values influence consumers' intention, not only directly but also indirectly, by arousing a favorable attitude toward visiting food trucks. Utilitarian values do not directly impact consumers' intention, but the values do trigger consumers' intention indirectly by boosting a positive attitude toward food trucks. The IPA showed that food truck vendors are doing a fairly good job in serving food quickly, promptly correcting mistakes, and providing both consistent and reliable service to consumers. However, operators need to focus on building teamwork so that they can maintain speed and high quality during busy hours.

AB  - Introduction: The radiography profession is challenged by greater responsibilities and shortage of educated radiographers. Implementation of task shifting is one strategy to deal with the current situation in health care. The aim of this studiy was to evaluate radiographers' perception of assistant nurses and nurses carrying out tasks that traditionally were undertaken within the radiography profession in a Swedish context. Methods: An electronic questionnaire was distributed to radiographers at eleven hospitals in Sweden. The questionnaire included background questions and questions about radiographers' perception about task shifting to nurses and assistant nurses. The respondents rated their agreement level regarding task shifting on a five-point Likert scale. Data was statistically evaluated in SPSS using Mann Whitney U test. Results: Sixty-five radiographers participated in the study. Most radiographers responded negatively to task shifting to nurses (72%) or assistant nurses (65%). Most radiographers disagree that nurses should perform mammography screening or work within interventional radiography, while the attitude towards nurses calculating glomerular filtration rate was more positive. A majority disagree regarding assistant nurses performing conventional radiographs, informing the patient about contrast media administration or inserting peripheral intravenous catheters, while there was a positive attitude towards assistant nurses preparing patients for examinations. The attitude towards task shifting was not influenced by age, however radiographers with less working experience were more positive to task shifting in general. Conclusion: A majority of the radiographers had a negative attitude towards task shifting to nurses and assistant nurses. The radiographers were more positive to hand over tasks related to patient care and administrative tasks than technical related tasks within the profession. Implications for practice: Knowledge about radiographers' perception on task shifting within the profession is essential when planning and implementing strategies for task shifting in the clinical settings.

AB  - Background: Given the public health responses to previous respiratory disease pandemics, and in the absence of treatments and vaccines, the mitigation of the COVID-19 pandemic relies on population engagement in nonpharmaceutical interventions. This engagement is largely driven by risk perception, anxiety levels, and knowledge, as well as by historical exposure to disease outbreaks, government responses, and cultural factors.
   Objective: The aim of this study is to compare psychobehavioral responses in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Comparable cross-sectional surveys were administered to adults in Hong Kong and the United Kingdom during the early phase of the epidemic in each setting. Explanatory variables included demographics, risk perception, knowledge of COVID-19, anxiety level, and preventive behaviors. Responses were weighted according to census data. Logistic regression models, including effect modification to quantify setting differences, were used to assess the association between the explanatory variables and the adoption of social distancing measures.
   Results: Data from 3431 complete responses (Hong Kong, 1663; United Kingdom, 1768) were analyzed. Perceived severity of symptoms differed by setting, with weighted percentages of 96.8% for Hong Kong (1621/1663) and 19.9% for the United Kingdom (366/1768). A large proportion of respondents were abnormally or borderline anxious (Hong Kong: 1077/1603, 60.0%; United Kingdom: 812/1768, 46.5%) and regarded direct contact with infected individuals as the transmission route of COVID-19 (Hong Kong: 94.0%-98.5%; United Kingdom: 69.2%-93.5%; all percentages weighted), with Hong Kong identifying additional routes. Hong Kong reported high levels of adoption of various social distancing measures (Hong Kong: 32.6%-93.7%; United Kingdom: 17.6%-59.0%) and mask-wearing (Hong Kong: 98.8% (1647/1663); United Kingdom: 3.1% (53/1768)). The impact of perceived severity of symptoms and perceived ease of transmission of COVID-19 on the adoption of social distancing measures varied by setting. In Hong Kong, these factors had no impact, whereas in the United Kingdom, those who perceived their symptom severity as "high" were more likely to adopt social distancing (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] 1.58-3.01), and those who perceived transmission as "easy" were prone to adopt both general social distancing (aOR 2.00, 95% CI 1.57-2.55) and contact avoidance (aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.41-2.30). The impact of anxiety on adopting social distancing did not vary by setting.
   Conclusions: Our results suggest that health officials should ascertain baseline levels of risk perception and knowledge in populations, as well as prior sensitization to infectious disease outbreaks, during the development of mitigation strategies. Risk should be communicated through suitable media channels-and trust should be maintained-while early intervention remains the cornerstone of effective outbreak response.

AB  - This paper aims for a better understanding of the perspectives of contributors to Spanish academic journals regarding open access, open peer review, and altmetrics. Specifically, it explores how age, gender, years of professional experience, and perception and use of social media influence authors' opinions of these developments in scholarly publishing. A sample of 295 contributors to Spanish academic journals participated in a survey about the aforementioned topics. They were found to hold a favourable opinion of open access but were more cautious about open peer review and altmetrics. The responses of younger and female scholars indicated more reluctance to accept open peer review practices. A positive attitude toward social networks did not necessarily translate into enthusiasm for emerging trends in scholarly publishing. Despite this, ResearchGate users were more aware of altmetrics.

AB  - Recent research demonstrates that a wide range of political attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors can be explained in part by genetic variation. However, these studies have not yet identified the mechanisms that generate such a relationship. Some scholars have speculated that psychological traits mediate the relationship between genes and political participation, but so far there have been no empirical tests. Here we focus on the role of three psychological traits that are believed to influence political participation: cognitive ability, personal control, and extraversion. Utilizing a unique sample of more than 2,000 Swedish twin pairs, we show that a common genetic factor can explain most of the relationship between these psychological traits and acts of political participation, as well as predispositions related to participation. While our analysis is not a definitive test, our results suggest an upper bound for a proposed mediation relationship between genes, psychological traits, and political participation.

AB  - Purpose Online social media has become an important marketing communication tool for entrepreneurs and their customers because of its ability to simplify various constraints in the communication process. Online social media allows entrepreneurs to access customers, suppliers, partners and other necessary resources that were not easily reachable before at significantly lower costs. Therefore, the current study aims to examine entrepreneurs' motivations, expected benefits and intentions to use online social media in an emerging market.
   Design/methodology/approach This study used a quantitative approach to investigate the entrepreneurs' online social media use behaviors. Data are collected from n = 368 entrepreneurial organizations using structured questionnaires and personal interviews. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) along with structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test the hypothesized relationships in the conceptual model.
   Findings Results from the data analyses show that entrepreneurs' perceptions about efforts needed, performance expectations and various social influences helped explain a significant proportion of the variation in entrepreneurs' intentions to use online social media. All hypotheses tested in the study were confirmed.
   Research limitations/implications Efforts need to be spent on developing positive entrepreneurial attitudes toward online social media usage. As social media becomes more integrated with personal and business life, entrepreneurs need to use social networking sites to build relationships with existing customers or to reach new customers. A larger and more representative sample would have improved generalizability of the findings about entrepreneurial use of online social media. Future research studies should consider using additional independent measures to validate the study results.
   Practical implications This study contributes to the entrepreneurial literature by providing empirical evidence for the link between entrepreneurs' perceptions and attitudes about social media and their intentions to use it in an emerging market. Additionally, entrepreneurs need to expend more effort in understanding and effectively using social media and should develop positive attitudes toward online social media. Entrepreneurs' feelings, perceptions and efforts need to be nurtured through support from online social media providers, educational institutions and local chapters of business organizations (i.e. SBA, Chamber of Commerce) alike.
   Originality/value This research is one of the few studies that has attempted to examine the effects of various antecedent factors in the context of entrepreneurs' intentions to use online social media for business purposes in an emerging market. This study contributes to the entrepreneurial literature by providing empirical evidence for the link between entrepreneurs' perceptions and attitudes about social media and their intentions to use it in an emerging market. Additionally, this study contributes to our understanding about the role of social influences, effort and performance expectancies on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions to use social media.

AB  - Objective This article explores how the Millennial Generation identity-the shared values and experiences of young adults (born between 1980 and 1997)-affects political polarization of climate change belief, specifically how it mediates the relationship between party affiliation and educational attainment. Method To test this, an interaction between Millennial*Republican*education is estimated, using data from an original national survey administered in 2015. Results Millennials are more likely to believe in the evidence of climate change and its anthropogenic causes than older adults of their same party affiliation. Unlike older adults, the most educated Millennials are not the most likely to adhere to political party stance; rather, it is among the least educated Millennials that party sorting is most evident. Conclusion The Millennial Generation identity is meaningful for understanding political attitudes. Important distinctions exist between Millennials and older adults in the evaluation of climate change opinion and related policies.

AB  - The flow of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected almost every aspect of human life around the globe. Being the emerging ground and early sufferer of the virus, Wuhan city-data remains a case of multifold significance. Further, it is of notable importance to explore the impact of unique and unprecedented public health response of Chinese authorities-the extreme lockdown of the city. In this research, we investigate the statistical nature of the viral transmission concerning social distancing, extreme quarantine, and robust lockdown interventions. We observed highly convincing and statistically significant evidences in favor of quarantine and social distancing approaches. These findings might help countries, now facing, or likely to face the wave of the virus. We analyzed Wuhan-based data of "number of deaths" and "confirmed cases," extracted from China CDC weekly database, dated from February 13, 2020, to March 24, 2020. To estimate the underlying group structure, the assembled data is further subdivided into three blocks, each consists of two weeks. Thus, the complete data set is studied in three phases, such as, phase 1 (Ph 1) = February 13, 2020, to February 26, 2020; phase 2 (Ph 2) = February 27, 2020 to March 11, 2020; and phase 3 (Ph 3) = March 12, 2020 to March 24, 2020. We observed the overall median proportion of deaths in those six weeks remained 0.0127. This estimate is highly influenced by Ph1, when the early flaws of weak health response were still prevalent. Over the time, we witnessed a median decline of 92.12% in the death proportions. Moreover, a non-parametric version of the variability analysis of death data, estimated that the average rank of reported proportions in Ph 3 remained 7, which was 20.5 in Ph 2, and stayed 34.5 in the first phase. Similar patterns were observed, when studying the confirmed cases data. We estimated the overall median of the proportion of confirmed cases in Wuhan as 0.0041, which again, is highly inclined towards Ph 1 and Ph 2. We also witnessed minimum average rank proportions for Ph 3, such as 7, which was noticeably lower than Ph 2, 21.71, and Ph 1, 32.29. Moreover, the varying degree of clustering indicates that the effectiveness of quarantine based policies is time-dependent. In general, the decline in coronavirus transmission in Wuhan significantly coincides with the lockdown.

AB  - This study evaluates the dynamic impact of various policies adopted by U.S. states, including social distancing, financial assistance, and vaccination policies. We propose a time-varying parameter multilevel dynamic factor model (TVP-MDFM) to improve the model's accuracy for evaluating the dynamic policy effect. The estimation is based on the Bayesian shrinkage method jointly with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that combines model selection and parameter estimation into the same iterative sampling process. The advantages and reliability of the TVP-MDFM are explored using simulation studies and robustness tests. The main empirical results highlight that the direct causal effect of the social distancing policy is more significant than the indirect effect mediated through human behavior. We also find income heterogeneity in financial assistance policies. Moreover, we provide evidence that banning vaccination certification by legislation is a stronger driver of the new case rate than executive orders during the Omicron dominance.

AB  - Introduction: During the COVID-19 pandemic, Computed Tomography (CT) departments have established additional acute capacity whilst maintaining essential services. The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes in service delivery, working practices and decision-making role of diagnostic radiographers during the pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted an electronic cross-sectional survey of diagnostic radiographers working in CT during the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey was open for 6-weeks, with radiographers from all geographical regions encouraged to respond. The questionnaire explored social distancing, patient scheduling and departmental organisation; PPE usage; recognition and escalation of COVID-19 changes, patient management pathways and any training. Additionally, we sought the personal perspectives of radiographers through free text comments.
   Results: Following exclusions, 180 responses were analysed. Service delivery changes included social distancing (59.4%; n= 107), restriction of referrals to those considered time-critical (63.3%; n=114) and dedicated COVID-19 scanners (66.1%; n=119). Working practices were impacted by a need to implement PPE, although variation in PPE worn for different scenarios was seen. Half of the radiographers were routinely reviewing asymptomatic outpatient images for common COVID-19 signs, despite 63.5% of respondents not receiving formal training. Ad hoc patient pathways were in place in 90.5% of cases with 35% indicating that this was radiographer-led. CT staff had experienced anxiety, fatigue, and low morale, but praised teamwork.
   Conclusions: Radiographers were able to reduce the risk of transmission through social distancing, designated scanners, and PPE. This study has demonstrated that despite variance in practice, radiographers play a key role in identifying and triaging high-risk patients.

AB  - Background. The high prevalence of HPV infection among Kazakhstani women and the absence of an HPV vaccination program are directly reflected in increasing rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality. Kazakhstan made its first attempt at introducing the HPV vaccine in 2013, but was unsuccessful due to complications and low public acceptance. The attitudes of Kazakhstani women towards the vaccine were never measured. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the attitudes of women towards the HPV vaccine and determine factors associated with positive, negative, or neutral attitudes. Methods. A 29-item survey consisting of 21 demographic and contextual questions and 8 Likert-scale questions was distributed among women attending gynecological offices in four major cities of Kazakhstan from December 2021 until February 2022. Attitudes of women were measured based on their answers to the eight Likert-scale questions. Ordinal logistic regression was built to find associations between demographic characteristics and attitudes of women. Results. Two hundred thirty-three women were included in the final analysis. A total of 54% of women had positive attitudes towards the vaccine. The majority of women did not trust or had a neutral attitude towards the government, pharmaceutical industry, and traditional and alternative media. However, the trust of women was high in medical workers and scientific researchers. Women's age, education, number of children, effect of the 2013 HPV program, and trust in alternative medicine were included in the ordinal logistic model. Women with a low level of education, a high number of children, who believe in alternative medicine, and who were affected by the failed 2013 vaccination program were less likely to have a positive attitude towards the vaccine. Conclusions. Contrary attitudes towards HPV vaccination exist among Kazakhstani women, with approximately half having positive and almost half having negative or neutral attitudes towards the vaccine. An informational campaign that takes into consideration women's levels of trust in different agencies, as well as targets those who are the most uninformed, might help in a successful relaunch of the HPV vaccination program. However, more studies that cover a higher number of women are required.

AB  - This study analyzes media coverage of Census Bureau projections showing that the U.S. will become a majority-minority state by mid-century. I argue that the mismatch between the racial/ethnic categories used by the media in their coverage of Census projections, and the official government categories used by the Census, help construct social boundaries around "whiteness" that allows for growth of minority populations to be presented as a challenge for "American" society. I contend that media portrayals of Census projections can influence public perceptions of the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S., thus impacting political attitudes and voting behavior among the U.S. populace.

AB  - In Thailand, strict prevention and control strategies have been implemented to mitigate the rapid spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). "New normal" guidelines and a series of mobile health applications have been introduced by the healthcare sector and implemented to aid the disease control monitoring and prevention of widespread outbreaks. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding "new normal" guidelines and quality of life (QOL) among Thai people during the COVID-19 outbreak, and to determine the association between KA, QOL, and practices. An online cross-sectional survey was conducted from 7 June to 12 September 2021 among Thai people in Public Health Region 6 aged >= 18 years old. Of the 506 survey participants, 80.3% were female, and 65.0% were 25-59 years old. The survey revealed that 52.2% of participants were classified as having more accurate knowledge, 58.9% were classified as having more positive attitudes, and 80.8% were classified as having more frequent practices regarding "new normal" guidelines, and 54.7% had high QOL. Of the participants, 93.7% agreed that "people who have been fully vaccinated should wear a mask while outside," and 95.5% wore a face mask outdoors in crowded places. However, 60.9% of participants misunderstood some details regarding online applications for contact tracing and vaccination services, 44.2% felt that these applications were difficult to use, and 33.4% rarely or never downloaded or used these applications. In logistic regression analyses, accurate knowledge of COVID-19 was associated with higher education, being a government employee, monthly family income > 30,000 Thai Baht, and regular use of social media. More positive attitudes regarding "new normal" guidelines and high QOL were associated with positive practices. High QOL was associated with older age, and higher education. Enhancement of attitudes and QOL is also important for improving practices in the general population during the COVID-19 pandemic. Significant factors identified in KAP will be crucial for developing effective prevention and control programs to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. To implement mobile health applications effectively, more work is required to improve the ease of use and promotion strategies.

AB  - Background: Cervical Cancer (CC) is the only preventable cancer among all the female genital tract cancers when is detected in its pre-malignant stage, but it is a fatal disease once it gets its invasive stages. Early detection of it is performed by a medical screening procedure Pap smear (PS), which is an inexpensive and effectual procedure to look for any cervical cytological changes (pre-malignant or malignant). Objectives: The present study aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) about PS, to identify the barriers that are an impediment to having it, to find out the association between KAP of PS, and find out the association between married women socio-demographic characteristics and their KAP of PS. Methods: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted among 400 women at the time of data collection from 7th April 2015 to 30th May 2015. A structured questionnaire was administrated to gather the data related to the knowledge, attitude, and practice regarding PS, in addition to the barriers that impeded women to practice it. Result: Among all women who were interviewed, about 35.9% heard of the Pap smear and 57.1% heard about cervical cancer. Only 7.3% of women had good knowledge about Pap smear, 33% of them had a positive attitude, and 9.5% of them practiced it. The main reason for having the PS was the health provider's advice. Conclusion: The majority of women had low knowledge of PS, and a negative attitude and was not practicing it. Effective media and providing health education are required to improve the level of awareness towards it. A healthcare professional should be contributing to knowledge transfer whenever the opportunity arises.

AB  - Across 12 studies (N= 31,581), we examined how concerns about the rise of automation may be associated with attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 1a to 1g used archival data ranging from 1986 to 2017 across both the United States and Europe to demonstrate a robust association between concerns about automation and more negative attitudes toward immigrants. Studies 2a, 2b, 2c, and 3 employed both correlational and experimental methods to demonstrate that people's concerns about automation are linked to increased support for restrictive immigration policies. These studies show this association to be mediated by perceptions of both realistic and symbolic intergroup threat. Finally, Study 4 experimentally demonstrated that automation may lead to more discriminatory behavior toward immigrants in the context of layoffs. Together, these results suggest that concerns about automation correspond to perceptions of threat and competition with immigrants as well as consequent anti-immigration sentiment.

AB  - Despite drawing on a common pool of data, observers of the 2012 presidential campaign came to different conclusions about whether, how, and to what extent "October surprise" Hurricane Sandy influenced the election. The present study used a mixed correlational and experimental design to assess the relation between, and effect of, the salience of Hurricane Sandy on attitudes and voting intentions regarding President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney in a large sample of voting-aged adults. Results suggest that immediately following positive news coverage of Obama's handling of the storm's aftermath, Sandy's salience positively influenced attitudes toward Obama, but that by election day, reminders of the hurricane became a drag instead of a boon for the President. In addition to theoretical implications, this study provides an example of how to combine methodological approaches to help answer questions about the impact of unpredictable, large-scale events as they unfold.

AB  - Political conservatism and threat salience have been consistently associated with intergroup bias. However, prior research has not examined potential effects of conservatism and/or threat on the attribution of relative in-group/out-group intelligence. In a cross-cultural study conducted in Spain and the United Kingdom, priming violent conflict with ISIS led participants to view an in-group ally as relatively more intelligent than an out-group adversary, in an effect mediated by feelings of anger (but not fear or general arousal). Conservatism similarly predicted biased perception of the ally's relative intellect, a tendency that was driven by militaristic (not social/fiscal) political attitudes but was not explained by associated increases in state anger following conflict cues. This overall pattern indicates that conflict cues and militaristic political orientation heighten assessments of relative intergroup intellect during warfare via distinct affective and attitudinal pathways.

AB  - Although effective interventions to increase international collective action for human rights are highly desirable, the validation of theory-based interventions and their transfer to this practical field is still scarce. We investigated whether collective action intention can be improved by using a diversity intervention technique rooted in social psychology. The intervention builds on the ingroup projection model, postulating that negative intergroup relations are based on the perception of ingroups as more typical of a common superordinate group than outgroups (i.e., relative prototypicality). Thereby, the (quasi-)experimental study tested the ingroup projection model's theoretical assumptions in the context of Model United Nations (MUN) conferences. We hypothesized that the diversity intervention leads to a higher perceived diversity within the superordinate group (the United Nations, UN) as well as identification with the superordinate group (UN). Furthermore, we hypothesized an indirect effect of the intervention on collective action intention mediated by perception of diversity of, and identification with, the superordinate group. In comparison to the control group (n = 45), those participants who received the diversity workshop intervention (n = 55) perceived less relative prototypicality and more diversity of the UN. In addition, we provide evidence of a serial mediation: Compared to the control group, the diversity workshop group perceived the UN as relatively more diverse, facilitating identification with the UN. In turn, this was associated with a stronger intention to act collectively. This study shows the importance of including psychological theories in the field of international relations.

AB  - Social media may promote health and social connectedness, but its misuse and frequency of use may pose risks. Social media use during adolescence requires parental monitoring and mediation to mitigate potentially harmful effects such as depression, anxiety, and risk-taking behaviors. While parents and health care professionals convey concern surrounding exposure to inappropriate content, prolonged screen time, and cyberbullying, appropriate social media monitoring remains challenging. The purpose of this study was to explore parental monitoring and mediation of social media use in adolescents. Online recruitment yielded a nationwide sample (n = 836) of parents of adolescents. The results of the online survey indicated that parents are concerned about adolescent social media use and endorse positive attitudes toward monitoring. Yet parents perceived little control over monitoring. Findings from this study support the school nurse in promoting healthy social media use, media literacy among parents and adolescents, and the use of screening tools.

AB  - The use of corporal punishment (CP) is controversial despite the negative consequences of its use that have been documented. Consequences include the use of CP by those who experienced CP themselves, described in the theory of the cycle of violence. There are little data on the cycle of violence, especially on those who break it and in representative samples. This study examines the cycle of violence in a representative sample by analyzing experiences of and attitudes toward CP. Attitudes toward, and own experiences of, CP by their parents were assessed in a sample of 2,519 individuals (female 54.6%, age range = 14-99 years, M = 48.9 years). Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify subgroups of participants who support and oppose CP. Breaking the cycle, defined as having experienced CP and opposing CP, was examined. Factors associated with positive and negative attitudes toward CP were identified using group comparisons and binary logistic regression. The majority of the sample opposed CP (56%), whereas one third supported less severe forms of CP and 8.2% also supported severe CP. Those supporting CP reported having experienced CP by their parents more often. Of those who had experienced CP, 47% were identified as breaking the cycle. Female gender, younger age, not being divorced, and being married and living together, as well as a higher level of education were associated with breaking the cycle. Even though CP was legally banned in Germany, a relatively high proportion still reports positive attitudes toward and experiences of CP. The ban of CP by the federal government seems to be an effective measure to change attitudes on a societal level as rates were lower in comparison with earlier studies. Future studies should examine interactions between different types of CP, attitudes toward its use, and additional mediating factors.

T2  - JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - Our earlier article (Bennett & Iyengar, 2008) argued that because news audiences are increasingly self-selected, communications scholars will be increasingly hard pressed to document media-induced persuasion effects. Holbert, Garrett, and Gleason's critique does not address the fundamental problem of endogeneity, instead proposing attitude reinforcement as a substitute for persuasion. But the problem of endogeneity applies equally to reinforcement and attitude-change research. Our critics also argue that exposure to alternative news outlets and entertainment programming is exogenous and has the potential to shape political attitudes. We respond that the political content of these programs, while surely promoting other desirable political outcomes, is too sporadic to produce large-scale message effects of the sort described by the classic persuasion paradigm.

AB  - What are the socio-political consequences of infectious diseases? Humans have evolved to avoid disease and infection, resulting in a set of psychological mechanisms that promote disease-avoidance, referred to as the behavioral immune system (BIS). One manifestation of the BIS is the cautious avoidance of unfamiliar, foreign, or potentially contaminating stimuli. Specifically, when disease infection risk is salient or prevalent, authoritarian attitudes can emerge that seek to avoid and reject foreign outgroups while favoring homogenous, familiar ingroups. In the largest study conducted on the topic to date (N > 240,000), elevated regional levels of infectious pathogens were related to more authoritarian attitudes on three geographical levels: across U.S. metropolitan regions, U.S. states, and cross-culturally across 47 countries. The link between pathogen prevalence and authoritarian psychological dispositions predicted conservative voting behavior in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election and more authoritarian governance and state laws, in which one group of people imposes asymmetrical laws on others in a hierarchical structure. Furthermore, cross-cultural analysis illustrated that the relationship between infectious diseases and authoritarianism was pronounced for infectious diseases that can be acquired from other humans (nonzoonotic), and does not generalize to other infectious diseases that can only be acquired from nonhuman species (zoonotic diseases). At a time of heightened awareness of infectious diseases, the current findings are important reminders that public health and ecology can have ramifications for socio-political attitudes by shaping how citizens vote and are governed.

AB  - The present research investigated whether learning that an outgroup humanizes the ingroup (i.e., meta-humanization) enhances how people react to intergroup prosocial behaviours and their willingness to engage in intergroup contact. In three experiments conducted in two cultural contexts (Kosovo and North Macedonia; n = 601), we manipulated meta-humanization by informing participants that their ingroup is perceived to be as human as the outgroup by outgroup members. We compare this meta-humanization condition with a meta-dehumanization condition in which the participant's ingroup is perceived to be less human than the outgroup (Experiments 1 and 3), a meta-liking condition in which the participant's ingroup is liked as much as the outgroup (Experiment 2), and a control condition (Experiments 1 and 2). Overall, results showed that participants in the meta-humanization condition attributed more empathy and prosocial motives to a potential outgroup helper and were more willing to accept outgroup help and engage in future intergroup contact than participants in the other conditions. In addition, positive perceptions of the outgroup helper mediated the effect of meta-humanization on willingness to accept outgroup help and engage in intergroup contact. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these findings for intergroup relations and reconciliation efforts.

AB  - A fascinating hypothesis has been proposed by Woodley (2010, Intelligence, 38: 471-480) to explain why intelligence, in contemporary Western countries, appears to be positively associated with left wing political attitudes. According to the hypothesis, the current Western 'norm' is relatively left-wing values, the intelligent are better at norm-mapping and better at perceiving the benefits of conforming to the dominant set of values and this explains why they are more likely, in this context, to be relatively left wing. This article will critically examine this hypothesis. It will argue that the evidence for it is questionable and open to different interpretations, there is evidence that contradicts it, and it leaves key questions unanswered. The article will propose that a simpler explanation for the association is that intelligence is positively associated with openness-intellect, low time preference and agreeableness.

AB  - Scholars of electoral autocracies accord far more attention to post-election protests than pre-election ones, as the former have the potential to trigger a regime transition. We argue that pre-election protests can have a significant effect on election outcomes. In particular, they are likely to deepen social cleavages along two dimensions: age and immigrant status. The 2019 social unrest in Hong Kong provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the electoral impact of pre-election protests. Comparing public opinion data related to the 2019 and 2015 District Council elections, we find strong empirical support for our argument, as immigrant status and age are strong predictors of voting choices and voter turnout. Our findings imply that exposure to democratic protests may not help in bridging the gap in political attitudes between immigrants and natives.

AB  - We conducted a web-based survey to understand the impact of social distancing measures on Brazilian MSM and transgender/non-binary lives. A total of 3486 respondents were included in this analysis and the great majority were cismen (98%). The median age was 32 years (IQR: 27-40), 44% non-white, 36% low schooling and 38% low income. Most of participants reported HIV negative/unknown status (77%). Participants on-PrEP reported more condomless anal sex than those off-PrEP. Conversely, 24% off-PrEP were at substantial HIV-risk. PrEP/ART continuation were reported by the majority, despite reports of impediments to medication refill. Transgender/non-binary reported more mental health problems and challenges to access health care. Social and racial disparities were associated with unattainability of maintaining social distancing. Tailored social and economic support policies during COVID-19 pandemic should be made available to these populations. Challenges for PrEP/ART access will demand the implementation of innovative solutions to avoid the expansion of the HIV epidemic.

AB  - Artificial intelligence technology has been increasingly applied in the hospitality and tourism industry, and it is a matter of concern how to increase customer adoption of AI applications in service encounters. This study examines how cuteness of AI applications interacts with the type of service task (emotional or knowledge-based) in their influence on customers' willingness to use the application. Hypotheses were tested using four experiments in different interactive contexts. It was found that customers were more willing to adopt AI applications with high perceived cuteness to perform emotional tasks, and social distance played a mediating role; conversely, customers preferred AI applications with low perceived cuteness to perform knowledge-based tasks, and here performance expectancy mediated the relationship between perceived cuteness and customers' willingness to use the application. The findings advance the theories of customer adoption by revealing and differentiating the "cuteness effect" within different service types.

AB  - This cross-sectional survey study aims to investigate preschool teachers' usage of digital technologies (DT) in early childhood education. To investigate teachers' use of DT, a questionnaire was completed by 167 preschool teachers from 52 different preschools. Besides, the Attitude Scale for Technological Tools and Materials Use in Preschool Education was completed by the teachers. The results of the study revealed that the classrooms were equipped with a variety of DT such as television, DVD, computer, and smartphone. Teachers tended to use television and computers in the classroom activities. Although the teachers had a positive attitude towards using DT in early childhood education, they used ICT on a limited scale. They mainly utilized these devices in order for the children to watch cartoon films and listen to music. Gender, teaching experience, and attitudes of teachers towards using ICT did not significantly predict their DT usage in their classroom activities. The results imply that though teachers had enough DT sources and positive attitude towards using those devices in their classroom activities, their DT usage was limited to few types of activities. For improving the quality of DT use in the classrooms by teachers, barriers to teachers' successful technology integration in their classrooms should be determined.

AB  - Does seeing Spanish-language news in the media change the racial and political attitudes of Whites and Spanish-speaking Latinos? We examine the effects of Spanish-language media on White and Spanish-speaking Latino attitudes using online survey experiments in English and Spanish, respectively. We expect White Americans to react to Spanish-language media options by developing more hostile attitudes toward Hispanics, and Spanish-speaking Latino audiences to feel a greater sense of belonging in America when they see Spanish represented in the media. We find that seeing articles about non-immigration politics in Spanish, as an option next to English articles, significantly raises racial resentment toward Hispanics among Whites. Among Spanish-speaking Latinos, seeing a political news article option in Spanish increases feelings of inclusion and belonging, even when it is not about a racialized issue like immigration. Such evidence suggests that language alone may prime identity and shape political attitudes for White and Spanish-speaking Latino voters.

AB  - Based on the communication mediation model, the third-person effect hypothesis was integrated to analyze the influence of the exposure to South China Sea news on its perceived effects on the self and others. In addition, the influences of such exposure on online discussions and political attitudes were examined, specifically in relation to nationalism and government evaluation. The survey (N=868) found that the respondents perceived a stronger media effect on others than on themselves, whereas exposure to traditional and news media exposure exhibited equivalent effects on the self and on others. Moreover, the perceived effects on oneself promoted online discussion and nationalism, whereas the perceived effects on others improved government evaluation. The findings of this study indicate that the effects of media exposure on nationalism and government evaluation are marginally mediated by perceived effects, online discussion, or both.

AB  - Social media influencers promote not only products and brands but also their opinions on serious topics like party politics or climate change. These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers' political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers' communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (N-T2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (N-T2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers' content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers' communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest-yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics.

AB  - BackgroundAdherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be influenced by knowledge, perception and perception regarding ART. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude/perception and practice regarding ART among people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV).MethodsWe conducted a cross-sectional survey to assess knowledge, attitudes, perception and practices ART in PLHIV. The survey was suggested to all PLHIV of at least 18years old and who were on ART for at least 1 month. PLHIV who were unable to answer questions correctly and those who did not complete the survey for any reason were excluded.ResultsDuring the study period, 234 PLHIV were included. Participants were mostly men (75.2%). The median age was 33years (IQR: 27-41). The median time since HIV diagnosis was 25months (IQR: 9-56) and the median duration of ART was 18months (IQR: 8-48). 87.6% had an overall good knowledge of ART. However, only 3.2% knew the name of their ART, 31.2% were aware that ART should be taken at a fixed time and 17.1% knew how to take ART in relation to food intake. 75.6% of participants had an overall positive attitude/perception of ART. However, 10.7% were convinced that other methods were more effective than ART for treating HIV and 42.7% thought that taking ART was shameful. The assessment of practices showed that in case of missed dose, 48.3% of participants routinely skipped this dose instead of trying to take it as soon as possible. In multivariate analysis, good knowledge of ART was independently associated with high level of education (aOR: 4.7, IC95%: 1.6-13.7, p=0.004) and disclosure of HIV status (aOR: 2.7, IC95%: 1.1-6.6, p=0.029).ConclusionsThis study showed an overall good knowledge and a predominantly positive attitude/perception of ART. However, accurate knowledge of ART intake was insufficient and the stigma associated with taking ART remained very present. Furthermore, very heterogeneous practices may reflect lack of instruction given by the physician regarding ART intake.

AB  - Aim. To investigate and analyse the attitudes to tobacco prevention among child healthcare nurses, to study how tobacco preventive work is carried out at child healthcare centres today. To evaluate how the tobacco preventive work had changed in child health care since the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare's national evaluation in 1997.
   Background. Exposure to environmental tobacco smoke has adverse health effects. Interventions aiming at minimising environmental tobacco smoke have been developed and implemented at child healthcare centres in Sweden but the long-term effects of the interventions have not been studied.
   Design. Survey.
   Methods. In 2004, a postal questionnaire was sent to all nurses (n = 196) working at 92 child healthcare centres in two counties in south-eastern Sweden. The questionnaire was based on questions used by the National Board of Health and Welfare in their national evaluation in 1997 and individual semi-structured interviews performed for this study.
   Results. Almost all the nurses considered it very important to ask parents about their smoking habits (median 9.5, range 5.1-10.0). Collaboration with antenatal care had decreased since 1997. Nearly all the nurses mentioned difficulties in reaching fathers (70%), groups such as immigrant families (87%) and socially vulnerable families (94%) with the tobacco preventive programme. No nurses reported having special strategies to reach these groups.
   Conclusions. Improvement of methods for tobacco prevention at child healthcare centres is called for, especially for vulnerable groups in society. However, the positive attitude among nurses found in this study forms a promising basis for successful interventions.
   Relevance to clinical practice. This study shows that launching national programmes for tobacco prevention is not sufficient to achieve sustainable work. Nurses working in child healthcare centres have an overall positive attitude to tobacco prevention but need continuous education and training in communication skills especially to reach social vulnerable groups. Regular feedback from systematic follow-ups might increase motivation for this work.

TI  - Using Facebook Live and Zoom as Tools for Online Radiology Education: A Practical Guide
T2  - CURRENT PROBLEMS IN DIAGNOSTIC RADIOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - In early 2020, the rapid spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) began to shake the world. As the resulting pandemic, quickly dubbed COVID-19, unfolded, we learned to enact public health safety measures to reduce or prevent its spread, particularly "social distancing," an expression once alien but now understood all too well. Consequently, many sought online resources when they would have previously accessed them in person. We have used Facebook Live for several years to discuss radiology topics and, on occasion, interview experts in the medical field and beyond. Much like live television, Facebook Live enables creators like us to share videos with followers in real time. Unlike live television, Facebook Live allows viewers to leave comments and questions in real time, rendering the platform much more interactive. Because Facebook Live has been a helpful tool for us to speak to radiology students and professionals around the world, we looked for another way to continue our interviews on Facebook Live while maintaining social distancing. We have managed to continue our interviews while socially distanced using the video communications software Zoom. With an increasing number of people migrating to online technology, the widespread use of social media for radiology education is imminent. We encourage others to consider mixing Facebook Live and Zoom to create more holistic educational experiences for radiology in the digital world. The COVID-19 pandemic has taught us that life can change unexpectedly and quickly, but online education is here to stay. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - "Education," notes Philip Converse, "is everywhere the universal solvent." Whatever the ill of the body politic, many believe that greater education improves the condition. Much scholarship explores the impact of education on political attitudes and behaviors, but scholars have not examined the relationship of education to support for political compromise. This is especially topical, as compromise between parties seems harder than ever to achieve, yet compromise is necessary for democratic governance. We examine whether higher levels of education lead to support for compromise and find that education does matter, but the relationship is conditional. For liberals and moderates, more education promotes greater support for compromise. For conservatives, those with more education are not more likely to support compromise than those with less education. We argue that for conservatives, education matters for compromise support, but it also leads to better understanding of bedrock ideological principles that inhibit approval of compromise.

AB  - We examined the dynamics through which temporary motor cues of approach or avoidance directed to an outgroup member affect attitudes of majority members toward the minority outgroup. In Study 1 participants activated and maintained either arm flexion or arm extension, while facing a picture of an outgroup person wearing religious trappings. Thereafter, they filled a questionnaire which measured outgroup prejudice. Study 2 replicated this procedure while including a control condition of the arm, and measured intergroup anxiety in addition to prejudice. In the first study outgroup prejudice was significantly higher following arm extension in comparison with arm flexion. The second study revealed that the source of the arm activation effect was due to arm extension increasing prejudice rather than arm flexion reducing it. Moreover, a mediation effect was found: Arm extension (vs. control) increased intergroup anxiety, which in turn was related to higher prejudice toward the outgroup. The results reveal embodiment effects by which temporary motor cues are related to visual religious cues leading to subsequent bias toward the outgroup. Multimodal representation accounts and theories explaining the psychological processes involved in perceiving threat-cues in intergroup relations are discussed. Practical implications of the observed embodied effects are also considered.

AB  - Public Significance Statement Caregivers play a critical role in facilitating child adherence to COVID-19 preventative health guidelines. Public health interventions that help caregivers to see the value of preventative health guidelines and support parents around managing difficulties that arise in implementation may facilitate child adherence behaviors.
   Objective: To describe child adherence to four preventative-health guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic and investigate caregiver-level correlates of adherence. Method: Two hundred thirty-six caregivers (75% female) of children ages 6-12 years (M-age = 8 years; 53% male) living in the United States rated child adherence to four preventative-health guidelines between 10/16/2020 and 11/14/2020. Caregivers also rated perceived importance of each guideline in limiting virus spread and perceived difficulty in obtaining child compliance. Results: Child adherence was highest for mask-wearing (median [Mdn] = 96%) and hand hygiene (Mdn = 95%). Adherence to social distancing guidelines was lower. Mdn adherence for social distancing with family outside the household was 80%, and Mdn adherence for social distancing with friends was 72%. Furthermore, for each of the four guidelines, fewer than half the sample reported 100% adherence (range = 20%-43%). Adherence was positively associated with caregiver perceptions of importance of a given behavior in limiting virus spread (rs = .38-.62) and negatively associated with perceived difficulty in gaining child compliance (rs = -.37--.25). Discussion: Current results indicated parents perceive child adherence to social distancing more challenging than child adherence to mask wearing or hand hygiene. Lower caregiver perceptions of importance of the behavior and greater perceived difficulty in gaining child compliance were associated with lower adherence to all tasks. Brief targeted interventions (e.g., motivational interviewing, parent behavior management training) may be well suited to enhance caregivers' perceptions of value of the behavior, while also addressing behavioral challenges that interfere with child adherence.

AB  - Party identification provides citizens with an anchor from which they derive many of their political attitudes and issue preferences. But what happens when people encounter political debates that place their partisan identities and policy attitudes into conflict with one another? This article draws on an original experiment designed to study the effect of debates that cut across people's partisan identities and policy attitudes. The results show that cross-cutting debates make people less likely to engage in selective exposure, more likely to feel ambivalent toward their political party, and less likely to rely on party cues when rendering a judgment.

AB  - This article discusses two complementary themes that play an important role in contemporary South African political philosophy: (1) the racist tradition in Western philosophy; and (2) the role of ubuntu in regaining an authentic African identity, which was systematically suppressed during the colonial past and apartheid. These are also leading themes in Mogobe Ramose'sAfrican Philosophy Through Ubuntu. The first part concentrates on John Locke. It discusses the thesis that the reprehensible racism of many founders of liberal political philosophy has lethally infected liberal theory. This view neglects the distinction between genesis and justification. Political liberalism has since cleansed itself of the prejudices of its spiritual ancestors. Liberal human rights exclude racism as a matter of principle. The second part discusses the claim that the ubuntu philosophy provides a better basis for a constitution in a modern society than political liberalism. A major problem is that ubuntu is an essentially contested concept. Some philosophers consider ubuntu to be a moribund notion (Matolino); others see it as a vital concept par excellence. In the latter case, it is elaborated from sundry incompatible political views, ranging from African nationalism (Ramose) via humanist communitarianism (Metz) to liberalism (Mboti). Conclusion: as an essentially contested ideological concept, ubuntu should not be a decisive constitutional standard for the application of state force. In contrast, the constitutional model of political liberalism provides a reasonable alternative, as it is designed precisely to solve the problem of social plurality and ideological contest.

AB  - Binge-watching is becoming a new "norm" for viewers in the way they consume their favorite TV shows and movies, nevertheless, most scholarly research on binge-watching remains exploratory. This study investigated (1) the relationship between attitudes toward binge-watching and the extent of binge-watching and (2) the role of viewers' personality traits (i.e., immediate gratification [IG] and needs for cognition [NFC]) on this association. The results from the analysis of the survey data (N = 714) illustrated that there was a positive association between viewers' negative attitudes and the extent of their binge-watching, showing a signature indicator of attitude-discrepant behaviors. Furthermore, a significant interaction effect of a negative attitude toward binge-watching and IG on binge-watching behavior was found. High-IG respondents with a negative attitude toward binge-watching were more likely to binge-watch than their low-IG counterparts, marked by a greater negative attitude toward binge-watching as a guilty pleasure.

AB  - Background: Among the factors known to influence reading development and performance, attitude toward reading is shown to be particularly critical for developing learners. Reading attitude enhances independent reading, levels of engagement in classroom reading activities, and the amount and variety of topics in reading, which in turn influence reading skills and strategies. Reading attitude is an important element in students' active engagement and achievement in reading.
   Purpose: The first purpose of this study was to test whether Korean students' home literacy resources, parental support and parents' reading attitude, and teachers' use of instructional strategies in relation to reading could predict Korean students' reading attitude. The second purpose was to test a model linking family-and school-related factors, reading attitude, and reading behaviors and learning strategy use as outcomes. Specifically, we hypothesized that positive and negative attitudes toward reading would mediate the relationships between home, parent, and teacher variables and reading outcomes.
   Design: Using a nationally representative sample from the PISA 2009 database, we tested two structural equation models. Because there were two categories of outcomes examined in this study, we fitted the model separately for each outcome category. The first model (Reading Behavior Model) included reading activities such as reading for enjoyment, reading diversity, and online reading as outcome variables. The second model (Learning Strategy Model) shared the same model structure with the first one except that the outcome variables were use of learning strategies such as memorization, elaboration, and control. In both models, reading attitudes were hypothesized to mediate the relationship between contextual factors (i.e. gender, home resources, parental and teacher influences) and the reading/learning outcomes.
   Conclusions: Gender, books and other types of literacy resources in the home, and parents' attitudes toward reading functioned as consistent predictors of Korean students' positive and negative attitudes toward reading. Among the contextual factors, parents' reading attitude and parental support for reading directly as well as indirectly predicted students' reading behaviors via students' reading attitude. Parental support for reading and teachers' instruction and assignment strategies in reading directly predicted students' use of learning strategies as well. Positive attitudes toward reading also predicted students' use of memorization, elaboration, and control strategies. Thus, reading attitude was an important mediator between parent-and teacher-related contextual factors and reading/learning engagement of Korean adolescents.

AB  - Does sharing moral values encourage people to connect and form communities? The importance of moral homophily (love of same) has been recognized by social scientists, but the types of moral similarities that drive this phenomenon are still unknown. Using both large-scale, observational social-media analyses and behavioral lab experiments, the authors investigated which types of moral similarities influence tie formations. Analysis of a corpus of over 700,000 tweets revealed that the distance between 2 people in a social-network can be predicted based on differences in the moral purity content-but not other moral content-of their messages. The authors replicated this finding by experimentally manipulating perceived moral difference (Study 2) and similarity (Study 3) in the lab and demonstrating that purity differences play a significant role in social distancing. These results indicate that social network processes reflect moral selection, and both online and offline differences in moral purity concerns are particularly predictive of social distance. This research is an attempt to study morality indirectly using an observational big-data study complemented with 2 confirmatory behavioral experiments carried out using traditional social-psychology methodology.

AB  - The exponential increase in the number of Mainland Chinese tourists (MCTs) and their sudden influx to popular destinations worldwide have resulted in increasingly frequent media reports on their behaviours and encounters with hosts. However, the academic literature has inadequately analysed resident attitudes towards this surging and, in a few destinations, dominant group. The current study addresses this gap by examining the attitudes and mentalities of Hong Kong (HK) residents towards MCTs and revealing their underlying psychological mechanism. A total of 39 semi-structured interviews demonstrate that unfavourable attitudes towards MCTs have exceeded neutral or positive attitudes. Moreover, HK residents share two intertwined mentalities sense of superiority and feeling of deprivation. Findings are discussed under the social identity meta-theoretical framework, and a cyclic psychological mechanism of 'social categorisation social identity social comparison' is identified underlying resident attitude and community mentality formation.

AB  - The question 'What stimulates teachers to integrate Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in their pedagogical practices?' was addressed in the context of teachers' usage of digital learning materials (DLMs). We adopted Fishbein's Integrative Model of Behavior Prediction (IMBP), to investigate the various relationships between distal and proximal variables and intention. Mediation analysis revealed that the proximal variables attitude, subjective norm, and self-efficacy towards DLMs were significant predictors of teachers' intention to use DLMs. The contribution of subjective norm, however, was modest. Attitude, subjective norm and self-efficacy mediated the effects of the following three distal variables on intention: previous use of DLMs, perceived knowledge and skills to use DLMs, and colleagues' usage of DLMs. Persuasive communication and skills based training seem, therefore, appropriate interventions to promote a positive attitude towards DLMs and improve self-efficacy in using DLMs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing measures often result in individual isolation, which can lead to adverse mental outcomes. We collected online questionnaires from 3,952 US adults to examine the impact of "shelter-in-place" guidelines on mental health, and to explore potential disparities and modifiable factors. Selfreported anxiety, depression, and PTSD symptoms were associated with more restrictive quarantine. Younger adults, women, those with lower income, more insecurity, more media exposure, reduced physical activity, or worsened family relationships were particularly affected. Targeted prevention on susceptible subpopulations, including young adults and lower SES groups, might help mitigate disparities in COVID-19-related mental health problems.

AB  - Research on non-hedonic entertainment suggests the experience of elevation as an important construct leading to beneficial outcomes such as prosocial motivation. This study builds on first findings in this realm by distinguishing between different meaningful media contents. In a 3x4 between-subjects online experiment, we varied type of video (beauty of the earth, unity of humankind, portrayals of human kindness, and funny control videos) and context of proliferation (presentation on an unknown video platform or on YouTube with low vs high number of views). Meaningful videos indeed led to greater elevation, more universal orientation, and prosocial motivationwith videos showing human kindness standing out against other forms of meaningful videos. Human kindness videos additionally fostered more positive attitudes toward stereotyped groupsmediated by the feeling of elevation and the subsequent feeling of universal orientation.

AB  - The tendency of world media to villainize of sharks has likely contributed to a disparity in the distribution of research and conservation resources among threatened marine megavertebrates, with elasmobranchs losing out. Increased public knowledge on elasmobranchs can shape public attitude and foster and gain support for elasmobranch conservation. Through an online survey, this study aimed to evaluate the drivers of public knowledge and examine linkages between awareness of elasmobranchs and attitude toward their conservation. To explore the relationships and effects between the different predicting variables and public elasmobranch knowledge and attitude indices, bi-and multi-variate analysis and a partial least squares path model were used. The results indicated that the average public elasmobranch knowledge of the Cypriot population was moderate and the average public attitude towards elasmobranchs was relatively low. Marine-related activities and marine-related education were highly correlated with increased public elasmobranch knowledge and were the strongest predictors of the partial least squares path model which explained a high degree of variation in elasmobranch knowledge. Public elasmobranch knowledge was highly correlated with public attitude towards elasmobranchs. The findings of this study highlighted the importance of ocean literacy and education and provide insights into the mechanisms for developing and designing successful advocacy actions for elasmobranch conservation.

AB  - This study examined the effects of a mass-media video intervention on expectations, attitudes, and intentions to seek help from professional mental health care services. A public service announcement style, mass-media video intervention was developed, with prior empirical research on help-seeking behaviors organized according to the theory of reasoned action/planned behavior. In total, 228 participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 conditions: (a) the media-exposed intervention group, who watched programming in which the media intervention was inserted, and (b) the control group, who watched the same programming without the media intervention. The media intervention was not influential on expectation and belief-based barrier variables. However, the media intervention was effective at increasing positive attitudes toward help seeking. Findings regarding the intervention's ability to increase help-seeking intentions for interpersonal problems were complex. Implications of these findings for future research are discussed.

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the effect of victimization experiences and peer influence on delinquency via one's attitude toward the police. It was hypothesized that negative attitudes toward the police would mediate the prospective relationships between victimization and offending and between peer delinquency and offending. Participants were 2,623 early adolescents from the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) study, a 6-wave longitudinal survey conducted between 1995 and 1999. The research design consisted of 2 independent variables (victimization and peer delinquency) measured at Wave 2, 1 mediator variable (negative attitudes toward the police) measured at Wave 3, and 1 dependent variable (participant delinquency) measured at Wave 4. Multiple regression and negative binomial path analyses revealed significant indirect effects running from violent victimization to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency and from peer delinquency to negative attitudes toward the police to participant delinquency. The results of this study indicate that both violent victimization and peer delinquency contribute to participant delinquency, in part, by encouraging the formation of negative attitudes toward the police. It is speculated that violent victimization may increase negative attitudes toward the police by arousing distress and feelings of vulnerability, whereas peer delinquency may increase negative attitudes through instruction, observation, and other forms of social learning.

AB  - This article presents original user-based research concerning a Mexican European Diaspora?s use of Social Networking Sites (SNSs) for making racial and classed distinctions through the course of sharing and viewing content on their networked profiles. Bourdieu?s theoretical framework is used to address the ways in which SNSs usage fosters social capital, exclusion and displays of prejudice and discrimination. We also found useful the analysis of racial distinctions based on participants? references to physical attributes. To illustrate the use of racial and classed distinctions, we specifically consider the use of Facebook and also of A Small World (ASW), an exclusive SNS, regarded as one of few designed for use by ?the wealthy? [Ruiz, 2008. ?Five Social Networking Sites for the Wealthy.? Forbes. Accessed June 11, 2010. ]. We analyse the term ?naco?, a pejorative Mexican term commonly used to refer to vulgarity or inferiority amongst Mexican European and privileged diaspora with strong racial, classed and gendered connotations. The empirical material for this study is based on ethnographic research. Through the analysis of displayed images and text as well as well questionnaires and interviews we found tacit or explicit exclusion, discrimination and segregation through close-knit SNS networks engaged in by our participants, a Mexican privileged European diaspora.

AB  - Although research has demonstrated that an increased rapport between instructors and learners can positively relate with increased learning gains, perhaps mediated by the positive attitudes toward the course and self-efficacy beliefs in the coursework, little has been done to test what instructional strategies might increase this rapport in online video-based instruction. This study compared online video-based instruction that made use of relationship-building strategies with online video-based instruction that did not use those strategies. The two instructions were identical in every other way. The results show that the attitudes of the college students were positively affected by the relationship building strategies in a statistically significant way (p=.025) and that learning gains were also positively affected at a very near-significant level (p=.052). The implications of the findings are discussed.

Data were collected by a face-to-face survey instrument in Turkey from 594 smartphone owners who actively participated in brand engagement activities. Structural equation modeling and Hayes Process macro analyses were used to examine the research hypothesis. Findings showed perceived enjoyment is the most important stimuli to increase positive attitudes toward consumer engagement behaviors. In particular, self-brand connection plays a vital role in this mechanism and indirectly influences attitudes via enhancing involvement, perceived enjoyment, and benefit.

AB  - Migration influx in Western countries resulting in increasingly diverse societies results in more complex situations for bureaucrats in their client interactions in welfare organizations. The role of discretion for services to clients has received much attention in the public administration research and therefore this study explores the relation among perceived workload, anti-immigration attitudes, perceived discretion, and perceived difficulty in working with migrants. The paper examines the function of perceived discretion as moderator or mediator variable in this constellation. The relations are examined by using structural equation modelling based on a survey among Swedish welfare bureaucrats (N = 1,319). The results show that heavier perceived workload increased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult and that greater perceived discretion decreased the likelihood of experiencing work with migrants as difficult. The results suggest that perceived discretion functions as a mediator for the relation between perceived workload and difficulty in work with migrants: potentially functioning as a 'buffer' for organizational pressure. We also found that bureaucrats who hold negative attitudes towards migrants were more likely to express their work with migrants as more difficult. This paper contributes to the public administration literature by increasing our knowledge on how discretion has significance in relation to when bureaucrat's behaviour is determined by specific organizational and personal factors.

AB  - This study examines the media framings of immigration in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using a content analysis of over 1700 newspaper articles published in 2014 in different cases, my findings show that, regardless of context, the media use a small number of frames to stereotype, generalize and reduce immigration to a singular dimension. My analysis also suggests that the media do not always only have a binary representation of bad or good immigrants. Instead, the media's othering of immigrants is a complex process, suggesting ambivalence despite superficial affirmation. Although my findings also demonstrate that some national differences exist, common patterns can be found across contexts that share similar historical, cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions of immigration. As one of the first cross-regional comparisons of media framings, this research reflects the power dynamics between the elites and immigrants and offers implications for how the media's reinforcement of stereotypes and outsider status of immigrants could potentially shape public opinion and policies regarding immigration.

AB  - With participation in social life, all the interpersonal and intergroup relations an individual establishes takes places in accordance with his/her gender roles and gender identity attributed by society. In this respect, it can be suggested that all forms of relationships individuals establish with others are shaped in parallel with his/her gender identity. Therefore, it would not be wrong to argue that the gender identity an individual possesses in interpersonal relationships has a significant effect on the formation of the relationship established. One of the most important communication barriers confronted in the interpersonal communication process is stereotypes related to gender identity. Gender identity stereotypes emerge according to gender roles taught to each individual who joins society. The presence of these stereotypes turns into interpersonal communication barriers, which, in many cases, show their effects even before communication starts. In this regard, it is considered that addressing the content of stereotypes about the gender identity of the source and recipient as communication barriers in the communication process, is important. For this purpose, emphasis was laid primarily on the guiding effect of stereotypes in interpersonal processes within the scope of the study. Afterwards gender stereotypes were evaluated based on the findings of research conducted in this field, and with reference to characteristics of gender stereotypes.

AB  - Metadehumanization, the perception of being treated as less than a human by others, is a pervasive phenomenon in intergroup relations. It is dissociated from stigmatization or stereotypes. and it has been recently identified as a critical process in severe alcohol use disorders (SAUD). Metadehumanization is associated with a wide array of negative consequences for the victim, including negative emotions, aversive self-awareness, cognitive deconstruction, and psychosomatic strains, which are related to anxiety and depression. This study aims to investigate if metadehumanization occurring among patients with SAUD is associated with clinical factors involved in the maintenance of the disease, namely symptoms of depression or anxiety and drinking refusal self-efficacy. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 120 patients with SAUD. Self-reported questionnaires measured metadehumanization, self-dehumanization (i.e., the feeling of being less than a human), anxiety, depression, drinking refusal self-efficacy, and demographics. Metadehumanization was significantly associated with self-dehumanization, anxiety, depression, and drinking refusal self-efficacy. Additionally, path analyses showed that self-dehumanization mediated the links between metadehumanization and clinical variables. These results indicate that metadehumanization and self-dehumanization could be essential factors to consider during SAUD treatment, as they are associated with increased psychiatric symptoms and reduced drinking refusal self-efficacy.

AB  - This research examines the mediating role of the tendency for Internet addiction, fear of missing out (FOMO), and psychological well-being in the relationship between online exposure to movement-related information and support for radical actions. A questionnaire survey that targets tertiary students was conducted during the Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) Movement (N = 290). The findings reveal the mediating effect of Internet addiction and depression as the main relationship. These findings enrich the literature of political communication by addressing the political impact of Internet use beyond digital architecture. From the perspective of psychology, this research echoes the literature that concerns depression symptoms driven by a protest environment. Radical political attitudes driven by depression during protests should also be concerned based on the findings of this survey.

AB  - Intergroup contact and collective action have been identified as two important but potentially conflicting ways to improve intergroup relations. However, little research has investigated the effects of contact in promoting solidarity-based collective action amongst advantaged group members, and nor has research considered the effects of contact in transnational (global) contexts. The current research provides a longitudinal test of the idea that contact promotes solidarity-based collective action, because it intensifies supportive (opinion-based) social identities amongst advantaged group members. However, rather than contact having uniformly positive effects on social identification, we propose that advantaged group members who value social hierarchy and reject egalitarianism (i.e., those high in social dominance orientation [SDO]), may be less affected by intergroup contact. We tested these claims in the novel domain of global inequality and support for people in developing countries. Participants (N=265) completed measures of transnational contact (with people from developing countries), social identification, SDO, and collective action at two time-points, one year apart. Tests of moderated mediation revealed that, as expected, contact promotes solidarity-based collective action to support international development through (opinion-based) social identification, but only for people low in SDO. Overall, findings contradict the notion that contact and collective action inevitably work against each other but, rather, contact can engage some advantaged group members (i.e., those low in SDO) in the plight of the disadvantaged. The current results highlight opinion-based groups as a key mechanism for connecting the positive effects of intergroup contact and collective action for social change.

AB  - Background: Healthcare professionals (HCPs) are one of the vital and persuading means of information, prevention and control, and incentive of vaccination to content a pandemic. Therefore, knowing the status of HCPs' perception about symptoms, transmission, preventive measures, and attitudes towards a vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial. Methods: This multi-center cross-sectional descriptive study was one of the first and foremost ones in Bangladesh among the HCPs -doctors, nurses, and other subordinates (MLSS) engaged at COVID-dedicated hospitals. The study was conducted from February 5, 2021, to March 7, 2021, using a convenience sampling method among 550 HCPs using structured questionnaire with twenty-five questions on a three-point scale of responses. Results: The age range of the respondents were 18 to 64 years with the mean 36.17 +/- 10.94 years of 524 HCPs, of which the majority of the respondents were female 323 (61.6%) and 201 (38.4%) were male with the 95.27% response rate. Almost all participants had "high" or more than sufficient perception (94.34%) about the symptoms of COVID-19. But all categories of HCPs expressed their poor or fair practice about restraining from shaking hands, and only 6.84% of nurses, 8.33% doctors, and 11.59% of MLSS avoided crowded public gatherings as a practice of prevention. A majority (95.99%) of the HCPs showed positive attitudes about the availability of vaccines free of cost, and 87.40% showed trust in the efficacy and safety of the vaccine against COVID-19. Conclusion: The majority of the HCPs from the COVID-dedicated hospitals have a good perception and positive attitude towards vaccination; nevertheless, have a poor practice of prevention toward COVID-19. This may play a vital role in motivation and wide acceptance of vaccine among the general population and contribute in comprehensive strategic planning to fight back against the pandemic in the country with the restricted resource.

AB  - The current study employs an online survey of viewers of pornography featuring transgender performers (N=250) to investigate the relationship between pornography consumption and attitudes toward transgender people. Results demonstrated a statistically significant but substantively weak association between greater pornography viewing and more positive attitudes toward transgender people. Additionally, results demonstrated that viewers' experience of shame about their sexual attractions to transgender people did not moderate the relationship between porn viewing and attitudes. However, analysis revealed an unhypothesized direct influence of sexual shame on attitudes toward transgender people such that higher levels of shame were associated with greater prejudice. Results are discussed in the context of sexual scripting and the revived porn debates. Further longitudinal research focusing on how the feelings viewers have about the pornography they view impacts erotic media's effects is encouraged.

AB  - Human faces, and more specifically the eyes, play a crucial role in social and nonverbal communication because they signal valuable information about others. It is therefore surprising that few studies have investigated the impact of intergroup contexts and motivations on attention to the eyes of ingroup and outgroup members. Four experiments investigated differences in eye gaze to racial and novel ingroups using eye tracker technology. Whereas Studies 1 and 3 demonstrated that White participants attended more to the eyes of White compared to Black targets, Study 2 showed a similar pattern of attention to the eyes of novel ingroup and outgroup faces. Studies 3 and 4 also provided new evidence that eye gaze is flexible and can be meaningfully influenced by current motivations. Specifically, instructions to individuate specific social categories increased attention to the eyes of target group members. Furthermore, the latter experiments demonstrated that preferential attention to the eyes of ingroup members predicted important intergroup biases such as recognition of ingroup over outgroup faces (i.e., the own-race bias; Study 3) and willingness to interact with outgroup members (Study 4). The implication of these findings for general theorizing on face perception, individuation processes, and intergroup relations are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the interaction of police and citizen representatives during critical moments in reconciliation processes through a relational model.
   Design/methodology/approach - Based on 26 in-depth interviews with key actors in three different cases of media-salient police-citizen group conflict, the interactions in the run-up to, during and after five moments that were critical in the transformation from conflict to cooperation, were analyzed. In focussing on the role of the intergroup relationship in conflict interaction, the applicability of relationship-value, compatibility and security in defining this relationship were explored.
   Findings - Although interactions during critical moments differed along the specific conflict contexts, three chronological stages could be deduced. In the first stage, interactions were tensed and emotional. During the second stage, repressing this insecurity through the exchange of value and compatibility signals was important. In the third stage, the transformation toward friendlier, cooperative dialogue and a less tensed atmosphere was made. Emotional expression, information sharing and emphasizing compatibility seemed particularly important in (re) defining and negotiating police-citizen relationships.
   Research limitations/implications - In analysis, the authors had to rely on limited and retrospective accounts of interactions and attitudes and its indivertible errors.
   Originality/value - This is one of very few studies that analyses police-involved post conflict interactions with a relational model. With regard to the importance of strong police-citizen relationships, the results should be of value to any operational police worker and specifically those who are involved in operational or strategic conflict-management and communication.

AB  - Background Risk evaluation of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases can guide the decision-making on various preventive measures, such as initiating or deferring statin therapy. Pharmacists can play an active part in the risk evaluation and primary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Thus, our study aimed to assess the pharmacists' knowledge, attitude, perceived barriers, and practices regarding risk assessment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among 500 pharmacists using a structured validated questionnaire between November 2020 and February 2021. The Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to analyze the data. Results A total of 456 pharmacists completed the questionnaire out of 500 distributed (91.2% response rate). Over 60% of participants responded with never or rarely for two out of five cardiovascular diseases (CVD) prevention practices. The lowest pharmacist-patient counseling practices were for side effects of statin medication (14.5%) and reviewing the patient's medications to avoid potential statin-drug interactions (31.8%). Participants had a high positive attitude (median = 34 out of 40). The three major barriers for risk assessment were the lack of support (74.8%), the lack of resources (70.6%), and inadequate training (48.7%). Interestingly, having <= 75 customers a day, community pharmacies, PharmD degree, age >= 30 years, and experience >= 6 years were significantly associated (p < .05) with higher CVD prevention activities and counseling practices. Conclusion Pharmacists have a high positive attitude toward CVD risk assessment. However, they had insufficient knowledge and only provided limited activities and counseling services for CVD prevention and statin therapy. Participants perceived several barriers to CVD risk assessment services in pharmacies. Therefore, it is necessary to remove these impediments for pharmacists to be more involved in CVD risk assessment and prevention. Also, continuing medical education and adequate training for pharmacists are required.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the effect of metaphor "Digital India-Power to Empower" on citizens' intention to adopt the e-governance while taking citizens' attitude and emotional attachment with Digital India as mediating variables between citizens' involvement and intention to adopt e-governance. Design/methodology/approach After reviewing the extant literature and using the learning from Technology Acceptance Model-Extension (TAME), a conceptual model has been proposed. The model is empirically tested on 224 respondents from India using structural equation modeling technique. Findings The paper suggested that the metaphoric promotion of E-Governance leads to a higher intention to adopt E-Governance. Metaphoric promotion has a positive influence on citizen involvement with E-Governance, which leads to positive attitude toward E-Governance. This positive attitude leads to citizens' emotional attachment with E-Governance, which in turn leads to citizens' positive behavioral intention to adopt E-Governance. In addition, there is a significant difference in attitude toward E-Governance with respect to education level and metro city dwelling, but there is no difference in intention to adopt E-Governance with respect to education and metro city dwelling.
   Research limitations/implications - As there is a dearth of research on the usage of metaphor by government and its effect on citizens' adoption of E-Governance, a conceptual model has been prepared by using learning from metaphor studies majorly in non-government services.
   Originality/value - As marketing and metaphors are rarely spoken words in E-Governance research, present study starts the much-needed conversation. In the past, adoption of E-Governance is studied in terms of technology attributes using TAM Model. The present study is first to explore the behavioral impact of E-Governance metaphoric promotion on citizens' intention to adopt E-Governance based on TAME model. It raises the issue of marketing foundation of E-Governance in mobilizing the citizens' intention to adopt the E-Governance.

AB  - Objective: Patients beliefs determine their response to an illness and its management especially if it is chronic. Studies assessing patient's knowledge of their epilepsy are scarce. We report the first objective study evaluating knowledge, attitude and practices of epilepsy patients referred to a tertiary care centre in East Coast of Malaysia. Materials and Methods: A cross sectional study using pre-tested, semi-structured questionnaire among consenting epilepsy patients. Results: The demographic details and responses to a questionnaire assessing their insight towards epilepsy were recorded. Among 132 respondents, 51.5% were male and 48.5 % were female. Their age ranged from 14 to 70 years (mean = 31.63 +/- 13.41). Majority (53.8%) of them aged equal or less than 30 years. The median number of years they had epilepsy was 8.0 (4.0, 18.8) years and average duration of seizure prior to seeking medical attention was 1.0 (0.3, 4.5) years. The average number of years they were receiving treatment from a hospital was 5.50 +/- 5.84. Most (90.9%) did not know the cause of epilepsy; however 93.9 % were aware that it can be treated with modern drugs. While only 22.7 % believed that faith healers can treat epilepsy, 74.2% had tried other forms of treatment. Negative attitude was reflected in the belief that epilepsy is due to supernatural powers (1.5%) and that epilepsy is contagious (17.4 %). Positive attitude included that PWE can take a job (66.7%), allowing a child with epilepsy to study (80%), not objecting children to play with a child with epilepsy (54.5%), marry (65.9%) and having children (58.3%). Conclusions: Patients with epilepsy are not knowledgeable about their disorder. This is true regardless of age, educational background, or number of years with epilepsy. The results suggest that there is a critical need to enhance epilepsy education and improve attitudes towards epilepsy beyond seizure control.

AB  - Background: Burn prevention and first aid knowledge amongst medical students is a neglected subject. Objectives: 1. Assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of medical students regarding burn prevention and first aid 2. Identify their sources of knowledge. Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional survey of KKU medical students documented their sociodemographic data, knowledge, attitudes and practices of burn prevention and first aid, and their sources of information. Data was analysed using SPSS 17. Descriptive information was presented as frequency and percentages, while Chi square test was used to find association of knowledge with sociodemographic factors. Results: A total of 273 students, from preclinical and clinical level were enrolled in the study. With an average of 9.3 correct responses, the median score of knowledge regarding burn prevention and first aid was 56.2 %. About half of the respondents (50.9%) achieved a fair knowledge score i.e. between 50-75%. College curriculum emerged as the major source of information for burn prevention (34.06%) and first aid (25.27%). About 42 % students suggested that inclusion in college curriculum would be the best way to increase awareness. You Tube emerged as the most common extra-curricular learning method (67.7%). Students in clinical years of medical education demonstrated significantly higher knowledge than those in pre-clinical years (p=0.01, COR=1.82). Fire prevention practices were not widely in place; however students revealed a positive attitude towards the same. Conclusion: Medical students have a fair knowledge in burn prevention and first aid and carry a positive attitude towards training. Incorporating social media for health awareness shows promise.

AB  - The term political extremism is commonly used to refer to political attitudes considered to be outside the ideological mainstream. This study leverages computational content analysis of big data to longitudinally examine (1970-2019) the prevalence of terms denoting far-right and far-left political extremism in more than 30 million written news and opinion articles from 54 news media outlets popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. We find that the usage of terms denoting right and left political extremism has been increasing across news media outlets in both countries. This trend is particularly stark for far-right-denoting terms, which have been growing in prevalence since at least 2008. Most U.S. and U.K. news media outlets tend to use far-right-denoting terms substantially more often than they use far-left-denoting terms. The rising prevalence in news media of terms denoting political extremism is strongly correlated with similar growing usage of terms denoting prejudice and social justice discourse.

AB  - Background: There have been few studies on the stigma associated with mental disorders among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in China. This study seeks to explore mental health-related stigma and the desire for social distance among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province in China. Methods: The study was carried out with 1123 non-mental health professionals in six general hospitals in Hunan Province by using a questionnaire with a case vignette describing either schizophrenia, depression, or generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Questions were asked about the attitudes of participants and other people towards individuals with mental disorders and the willingness to come into contact with them. Results: The people described in the vignette were considered dangerous by 84.4% of participants for schizophrenia, 72.0% of participants for depression, and 63.1% of participants for GAD. Besides being dangerous, people with schizophrenia were perceived as unpredictable and as the least suitable for voting for as a politician or employing. Around 50% of participants believed the problems described in the vignette were due to personal weakness. Over 70% of the non-mental health professionals were not willing to have the people described in the vignette marry into their family. The participants had gained their mental health-related knowledge mainly through the media, mostly from newspapers. Conclusions: The current study found a significant stigma towards individuals with mental disorders and a desire for social distance from such people among non-mental health professionals in general hospitals in Hunan Province. Anti-stigma interventions should focus on addressing non-mental health professionals' beliefs on dangerousness and unpredictability.

AB  - Despite the emerging trend of adopting co-creative approaches in public and non-profit advertising, research has overlooked participatory approaches in non-commercial settings. This research extends current knowledge on consumer-generated advertising to communications fostering positive social change. The results of an experimental study show that the disclosure of consumer participation in the ad creation process results in positive ad evaluations and reduces positive attitudes towards unhealthy eating. The main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations is mediated by sympathy towards the ad creator. In addition, floodlight analyses show that the main effect of source disclosure on ad evaluations and attitudes is amplified when the audience is highly involved with the advertised issue. Implications for theory, practice and public policy are discussed.

AB  - Cross-group romantic relationships are an extremely intimate and often maligned form of intergroup contact. Yet, according to intergroup contact theory, these relationships have the potential to improve the intergroup attitudes of others via extended contact. This study combines the interpersonal and intergroup literatures to examine the outcomes associated with knowing a partner in a cross-group romantic relationship. Results suggest that cross-group romantic partners encounter greater disapproval toward their relationships than same-group partners and, as a result, their relationships are perceived more negatively. Nevertheless, extended contact with cross-group partners, controlling for participants' cross-group friendships and romantic relationships, predicts more positive attitudes toward cross-group dating and positive intergroup attitudes in general, mediated by perceived ingroup norms toward cross-group relationships.

AB  - Technology-delivered psychological interventions, particularly online and telephonic counselling, have flourished in recent years, with the need for such a flexible delivery method increasing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While empirical research on technology-delivered psychological interventions is limited, findings indicate that therapists have a positive attitude towards online counselling. There is a particular lack of research on therapists' perceptions and experiences of using technology-delivered interventions. The primary aim of this study was to explore therapists' experiences of providing online counselling, thereby gaining insight into the therapeutic experience, processes and efficacy from the therapists' perspective. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews with five therapists, registered with organisations providing professional counselling and psychotherapy, with experience of providing synchronous/real-time online video, audio or chat-mediated counselling sessions. The interviews comprised open-ended questions. Interpretative phenomenological analysis was used to analyse the data, through which two superordinate themes were identified: (a) environmental adaptation and (b) practice enhancement. Our findings suggest that therapists' online counselling experiences incorporate several factors related to environmental adaptation and practice enhancement that impact the therapeutic process, outcomes, progress and relationship. The findings could inform the development of training, awareness-raising and skills-enhanced interventions for psychotherapists already using and hoping to use online therapeutic interventions.

AB  - Youth involved in the juvenile justice system are at elevated risk for HIV as a result of high rates of sexual risk taking, substance use, mental health problems and sexually transmitted infections. Yet few HIV prevention programs exist for young offenders. This pilot study examined change in juvenile offenders' sexual activity, drug/alcohol use, HIV testing and counseling, and theoretical mediators of risk taking following participation in preventing HIV/AIDS among teens (PHAT Life), an HIV-prevention program for teens on probation. Participants (N = 54) were 13-17 year-old arrested males and females remanded to a detention alternative setting. Youth participated in a uniquely tailored HIV prevention intervention and completed a baseline and 3-month follow up assessment of their HIV and substance use knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. At 3-month follow up, teens reported less alcohol use, more positive attitudes toward peers with HIV, greater ability to resist temptation to use substances, and for males, improved HIV prevention self-efficacy and peer norms supporting prevention. Teens were also more likely to seek HIV counseling and males were more likely to get tested for HIV. Effect sizes revealed moderate change in sexual behavior. Findings support PHAT Life as a promising intervention to reduce HIV-risk among youth in juvenile justice.

AB  - Jails and prisons have become hotbeds of COVID-19 outbreaks. Various policies, such as improving access to medical care for inmates, providing soap and hand sanitizer to improve hygiene, and releasing some inmates to facilitate social distancing, have been proposed as ways to mitigate the spread of the virus in these facilities. Across 2 studies, we examined the factors underlying support for policies aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19 in jails (n = 132) and prisons (n = 125) and yielded 3 key findings. Factors found in prior research to be associated with desire for punitive responses-namely, negative attitudes toward offenders and, to a lesser extent, lack of trust in the criminal justice system-were found to underlie lack of support for all types of COVID-19 mitigation policies. Concern related to COVID-19-namely, perceptions of personal risk of contracting the virus-was related to increased support for policies to curb the spread of the virus among inmates. Social media consumption and reliance on social media for news regarding COVID-19 demonstrated inconsistent relationships with support for policies. These findings suggest that factors related to support for harsh treatment of offenders and concerns related to the present situation both contribute to support for criminal justice policy during a crisis situation like a pandemic. The recommended policies offer hope for reducing the negative impact of COVID-19 among justice-involved people. We offer suggestions on tailoring messaging to improve public support for these policies.

KW  - social media

KW  - DEBATE
AB  - From early 20th century headlines to presidential tweets, immigration is described frequently in terms of waves, floods, and tides. Although usage of this inundation metaphor has been widely documented, its potential influence on immigration attitudes has not been assessed empirically. Building from conceptual metaphor theory's claim that abstract ideas can be grounded in simpler, concrete concepts, we hypothesized that using the inundation metaphor to understand immigration contributes to support for a U.S.-Mexico border wall as a figurative means to block immigrants. Accordingly, social media posts supporting a border wall contained more inundation-metaphoric expressions than messages opposing a wall and messages opposing immigration without reference to a wall (Study 1; N = 4,067). Converging experimental tests show, when controlling for political attitudes, exposure to the inundation metaphor increases support for a border wall (Studies 2a and 2b; N = 737). These findings add to the growing body of evidence that political cognition and policy attitudes are partly motivated by metaphoric comparisons to concrete ideas that are irrelevant in a literal sense.

AB  - Tourist satisfaction is a key factor in tourism sustainability. A multiple mediation model is proposed to analyze the relationship between ecotourism knowledge and ecotourist satisfaction, assisting our understanding of the generative mechanism by which ecotourism knowledge influences ecotourist satisfaction. Ecotourists at the Natural Park Saltos de la Damajagua (Dominican Republic) were administered a questionnaire. The results (PLS-SEM) show that ecotourism site perceived value and attitudes towards ecotourism fully mediate the influence of ecotourism knowledge on ecotourist satisfaction. Ecotourism knowledge will therefore only have positive effects on ecotourist satisfaction when the ecotourism site is of high perceived value and there are positive attitudes towards ecotourism.

AB  - In a series of experiments, a retraining paradigm was used to test the effects of attitudes and stereotypes on individuals' motivation and cognitive capacity in stereotype-threatening contexts. Women trained to have a more positive math attitude exhibited increased math motivation (Study 1). This effect was not observed for men but was magnified among women when negative stereotypes were either primed subtly (Study 2) or indirectly reinforced (Study 3). Although attitudes had no effect on working memory capacity, women retrained to associate their gender with being good at math exhibited increased working memory capacity (Studies 3 and 4), which in turn mediated increased math performance (Study 4) in a stereotype-threatening context. Results suggest that although positive attitudes can motivate stigmatized individuals to engage with threatening domains, stereotypes need to be retrained to give them the cognitive capacity critical for success. Implications for interventions to reduce stereotype threat are discussed.

AB  - According to the cognitive perspective, the generation of counterarguments is a key obstacle to persuasion. Following the metacognitive view, however, the experience of difficulty that accompanies increased counterarguing may benefit persuasion. These two contrasting predictions were evaluated in two experiments (N-1 = 392; N-2 = 210) by manipulating the instructions of thought-listing tasks following exposure to a testimonial that advocated for Physician-Assisted Suicide. Results for participants low-in-NfC supported the cognitive prediction, whereby generating many counterarguments (7) led to less favorable attitudes toward PAS, whereas fewer counterarguments (2) engendered more positive attitudes. In contrast, among participants high in NfC, increased counterarguing (7) resulted in more favorable attitudes toward PAS, while fewer counterarguments (2) were translated into greater opposition.

AB  - Background This study aimed to evaluate the associations among oral health-related knowledge, attitudes, practice (KAP), self-rated oral health and oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) among Chinese college students. Methods Of the 2000 participants, 1751 (87.55%) students answered an online questionnaire between October 2019 and January 2020. The questionnaire included demographic characteristics, knowledge, attitudes, and practice related to oral health, self-rated oral health, and OHRQoL. Structural equation modelling was applied to assess the associations among study variables. Results Among the total students, oral health-related knowledge and attitudes were satisfactory, while the oral health practice was not optimistic. The final model showed satisfactory fitness to the data. Oral health knowledge was associated with attitudes directly and positively. Attitudes toward oral health had a direct and positive effect on practice. Oral health knowledge had an indirect effect on practice through attitudes. Oral health practice was directly associated with self-rated oral health. Oral health knowledge, practice, and self-rated oral health all affected OHRQoL directly and positively, while attitudes had a direct negative impact on OHRQoL. Conclusions OHRQoL was influenced by oral health knowledge, attitudes, practice, and self-rated oral health. Our findings support the KAP theory. Limitations of the KAP model were also found.

AB  - While previous research on entertainment-education has assessed its effectiveness, primarily at the conscious level (e.g., free recall and self-reported change in knowledge), few studies have explored its effect on viewers' implicit knowledge. To fill this gap, this study examined the mechanism through which viewers form implicit memory of short health messages inserted in a primetime TV show and its preconscious effects on viewers' health attitudes and intentions. An experiment was conducted using a 3-group (health message: present vs. absent vs. control), posttest-only design with additional planned analyses of differences by subject variables (past experience and involvement). Overall, findings supported the hypothesized effects of implicit memory of a brief antialcohol message embedded in an ER episode on college students' attitudes and intentions against binge drinking. Results showed that participants who were exposed to the health message reported less positive attitudes toward binge drinking and lower intentions to binge drink, compared with those who were not exposed; the causal relations among viewers' implicit memory, attitudes, and intentions were also validated. Results also showed that individuals' past experience and involvement moderated the effects of the health message on attitudes and intentions. Theoretical explanations and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This study attempted to investigate the effects of perceived organizational support (POS) and role clarity on volunteer satisfaction, the mediating role of attitudes toward volunteering in the relationship between volunteer satisfaction and attitudes toward civic participation, and the moderating role of self-efficacy toward service in the relationships between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction among mandatory volunteers. Using data conducted at a major event in Wuhan, China, results showed that POS and role clarity predicted volunteer satisfaction. Volunteer satisfaction positively influenced attitudes toward volunteering, which is linked to attitudes toward civic participation. Self-efficacy toward service moderated the associations between POS, role clarity, and volunteer satisfaction, highlighting its essential role in strengthening the effects of organizational climate factors on volunteer satisfaction. Our findings underline the important role of organizations in increasing mandatory volunteers' satisfaction that affects positive attitudes toward volunteering, leading to enhanced attitudes toward civic participation.

AB  - Purpose The first year of college is a stressful life period connected with the experience of loneliness, isolation and depression since the majority of freshmen can no longer maintain an equally close relationship with school friends and family. Social networks have become a significant part of students' daily lives and might be an effective tool for maintaining relationship and reducing loneliness. There are contradictory results concerning the relationship between social networks sites (SNS) use and feelings of loneliness. Design/methodology/approach A four-week experiment was conducted to study the effect of SNS on feelings of social and emotional loneliness across freshmen. The treatment group (n = 40) took a break from SNS, while the control group (n = 37) used SNS as usual. Findings Comparison of the treatment and control groups showed that quitting SNS does not change either feeling of social/emotional loneliness. This paper also found that feelings of social and emotional loneliness did not depend on freshmen's positive/negative attitudes toward being alone. Originality/value This study is one of the few that uses experimental design to study the effects of using social networks on the psychological state of students in the context of higher education. The results showed that refusing SNS use can have a positive potential for psychological well-being of freshmen since solitude can be used by them as time for self-discovery and self-development. According to the results, social networks neither increase nor decrease the feeling of loneliness, and offline learning and communication environment plays a more significant role in the adaptation of freshmen. These results allow to take a new look at the studies related to the relationship between SNS use and loneliness and the role of social networks in the adaptation of freshmen.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 pandemic is a rapidly growing outbreak, the future course of which is strongly determined by people's adherence to social distancing measures.
   Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the knowledge level, attitudes, and practices of the Iranian population in the context of COVID-19.
   Methods: A nationwide study was conducted from March 24 to April 3, 2020, whereby data were collected via an online self-administered questionnaire.
   Results: Responses from 12,332 participants were analyzed. Participants' mean knowledge score was 23.2 (SD 4.3) out of 30. Most participants recognized the cause of COVID-19, its routes of transmission, its symptoms and signs, predisposing factors, and prevention measures. Social media was the leading source of information. Participants recognized the dangers of the situation and felt responsible for following social distancing protocols, as well as isolating themselves upon symptom presentation. Participants' mean practice score was 20.7 (SD 2.2) out of 24. Nearly none of the respondents went on a trip, and 92% (n=11,342) washed their hands before touching their faces.
   Conclusions: Knowledge of COVID-19 among people in Iran was nearly sufficient, their attitudes were mainly positive, and their practices were satisfactory. There is still room for improvement in correcting misinformation and protecting people from deception. Iranians appear to support government actions like social distancing and care for their and others' safety.

Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is internationally recognized as one of the most effective forms of treatment for opioid dependence and is among the most effective HIV prevention strategies available, yet efforts to adopt it in Ukraine's Criminal Justice System (CJS) have been thwarted.
   Methods: To understand the reluctance of the Ukrainian CJS to adopt OST despite the overwhelming evidence pointing to its health benefits and improved criminal justice outcomes, we conducted the first survey of Ukrainian prison administrative, medical and custodial staff (N=243) attitudes towards addiction in general, OST, and people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in representative regions of Ukraine.
   Results: Results revealed that Ukrainian CJS workers' attitudes toward OST, PLWHA, and drug addiction were universally negative, but differed substantially along geographic and occupational lines. Whereas geographic and cultural proximity to the European Union drove positive attitudes in the west, in the southern region we observed an identifiability effect, as workers who worked directly with prisoners held the most positive attitudes. We also found that knowledge mediated the effect of drug intolerance on OST attitudes.
   Conclusion: In Ukraine, adoption of OST is more influenced by myths, biases and ideological prejudices than by existing scientific evidence. By elucidating existing attitudes among CJS personnel, this study will help to direct subsequent interventions to address the barriers to implementing evidence-based HIV prevention treatments.

AB  - Purpose The shift to remote work brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically limited spontaneous workplace interpersonal interactions. For one interpersonal relationship in particular, the work spouse, the sudden physical distance may impact the energy work spouses draw from one another. Drawing on interactional ritual theory, this study aims to investigate the relationship between interaction frequency and organizational outcomes mediated by relational energy amid the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach During the COVID-19 pandemic, working adults who indicated they had a work spouse were recruited via Qualtrics to participate in a two-part online study. Findings Complete data from 120 participants across both time periods revealed that more frequent interaction between work spouses is associated with increased job satisfaction and affective commitment mediated by relational energy. Originality/value This study represents the first empirical examination of individual and organizational outcomes of a unique interpersonal workplace relationship. Additionally, this study enhances our understanding of the impact of relational energy in socially distanced situations between employees in a close, intimate (non-sexual) pair bond.

AB  - Sharks are among the oldest residents of the planet, they possess a unique value as top predators and constitute irreplaceable elements of marine ecosystems. Unfortunately, contemporary narratives widely presented in popular mainstream media have attached an utterly negative connotation to sharks, propagating an unsubstantiated and fabricated image of them as implacable and voracious predators. Recently a lot of attention is devoted to understanding the public perception towards sharks in order to promote their conservation given that a quarter of all shark species are facing extinction. This work assessed the current attitude of the public towards sharks on a global scale, utilizing modern technology through a single protocol that explored the importance of factors like culture, history, or educational level in shaping attitudes. We collected 13,800 questionnaires from 137 countries, with 25 countries presenting more than 100 answers each, representing in total 92% of the filled questionnaires. A generally positive attitude towards sharks emerged from our study, influenced significantly by several factors including knowledge and participation in marine conservation projects. Interestingly, shark

AB  - Background/Aim. Over the recent years customer satisfaction program as a tool for patient satisfaction has been recognized as an important issue in healthcare services. The aim of this preliminary study was to explore an influence of healthcare institution managers' approach and attitudes to marketing and public relations activities (communication activities), in the context of implementation of customer satisfaction programs, on patient satisfaction. Methods. The study was conducted among managers from different state-owned healthcare institutions (healthcare centres, clinics, hospitals) in Serbia. The structured questionnaire form, comprising both open and closed questions, was used as a main research tool. The total number of sent questionnaires was 120; 56 questionnaires were sent back, while 49 of them were valid. Results. It was shown that 42.9% of healthcare institutions apply proactive media approach, and that 35.7% of the organizations have a person who, besides his/her basic engagements, performs activities connected with marketing and public relations. Using Chi-square likelihood ratio test it is confirmed that these activities have a significant role in supporting customer satisfaction program implementation (p < 0.05). The results showed that in 69.4% cases, positive attitude of healthcare institutions managers toward marketing and public relations activities had positive influence on patient satisfaction (p < 0.05). Conclusion. Managers in healthcare sector in Serbia who used proactive approach toward media and who had already institutionalized communication activities with external stakeholders have a positive attitude to implementation of customer satisfaction program. Furthermore, managers' attitude toward communication activities has influence on patient satisfaction.

AB  - This research aimed to examine (1) the effect of domain overlap between CSR activity and Corporate Social Irresponsibility (CSI) (i.e., CSR strongly or weakly associated with CSI) on attitude toward the sponsor via CSR perception of sponsor and (2) the moderating effects of perceived firm-serving motive for CSR activity. The authors conducted two experiment studies: Study 1 tested the mediation model; Study 2 assessed the moderated mediation model. Participants reported a less positive attitude toward the sponsor when CSR was strongly associated with CSI (i.e., in the high CSR-CSI domain overlap) than when CSR was weakly associated with CSI (i.e., in the low CSR-CSI domain overlap). CSR perception of sponsor mediated the relationship between the CSR-CSI domain overlap and attitude toward the sponsor. The positive effect of the low CSR-CSI domain overlap was weakened when participants attributed firm-serving motives to the sponsor. The findings provided scientific contributions to sponsors with CSI.

AB  - A web-based experiment (n = 960) examined how debunking of publicly shared news on social media affects viewers' attitudes toward the source who shared the fake news, their agreement with the news position, and perceived credibility of social media as a news platform. Exposure to debunking information did not lower participants' agreement with the news position, but led them to derogate (1) the source who shared the misinformation and (2) social media as a news platform. However, participants who initially favored the source were less likely to attribute the sharing of fake news to the source's dispositions, rather than situational factors, thereby maintaining their positive attitudes toward the source.

AB  - The goal of this investigation was to determine whether various cultural stressors (bicultural stress, perceived discrimination, and perceived negative context of reception [PNCR]) predict positive and negative substance use attitudes, directly and indirectly through personal identity, in a sample of immigrant Hispanic adolescents. Data on cultural stressors, substance use attitudes, and covariates were collected from 302 Hispanic immigrant adolescents (152 from Miami [61% Cuban] and 150 from Los Angeles [70% Mexican]) at 3 time points. PNCR was associated with identity confusion (=.175, p=.033). Identity confusion significantly predicted higher positive attitudes toward alcohol and other drug (AOD; =.216, p<.001) and cigarette use (=.191, p=.015) and mediated the relationship between PNCR with unfavorable AOD attitudes (=-.019, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.052,-0.001]) and favorable AOD attitudes (=0.038, 95% CI [0.003, 0.086]). Perceptions of a negative context of reception may hinder successful personal identity formation and impact health outcomes for immigrant youth.

AB  - Gain-framed messages are more effective at promoting physical activity than loss-framed messages. However, the mechanism through which this effect occurs is unclear. The current experiment examined the effects of message framing on variables described in the communication behavior change model (McGuire, 1989), as well as the mediating effects of these variables on the message-frame behavior relationship. Sixty low-to-moderately active women viewed 20 gain- or loss-framed ads and five control ads while their eye movements were recorded via eye tracking. The gain-framed ads attracted greater attention, ps < .05; produced more positive attitudes, p = .06; were better recalled, p < .001; influenced decisions to be active, p = .07; and had an immediate and delayed impact on behavior, ps < .05, compared with the loss-framed messages. Mediation analyses failed to reveal any significant effects. This study demonstrates the effects of framed messages on several outcomes; however, the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear.

AB  - Background: In China, people living with HIV (PLWH) are aging. The study compared prevalence of probable depression between older PLWH and their HIV-negative counterparts, and tested the hypothesis that the between-group difference in depressive symptoms would be mediated by attitudes toward aging.
   Methods: With informed consent, a cross-sectional survey was conducted via anonymous face-to-face interviews to 337 and 363 HIV-positive and HIV-negative people aged >= 50, respectively, in Yongzhou City, Hunan, China from December 2017 to August 2018. Depression was measured by the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression (CES-D) scale. Attitudes toward aging were measured by the Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (subdomains: psychosocial loss, physical change, psychological growth). Bootstrapping analyses were performed to test the mediation hypothesis.
   Results: The prevalence of probable depression (CES-D >= 16) was significantly higher in the HIV-positive group than the HIV-negative group (44.8% versus 20.4%). The HIV-positive participants presented more negative attitudes toward aging (in psychosocial loss and physical change) than their HIV-negative counterparts. Negative attitudes toward aging were associated with more depressive symptoms. Overall attitudes toward aging (effect size=41.3%) and the subdomains of psychosocial loss (effect size=38.5%) and physical change (effect size=16.3%) partially mediated the association between HIV status and depressive symptoms, respectively.
   Limitations: The cross-sectional design limited the ability of causal inference. Selection bias, information bias, and confounding bias might exist.
   Conclusions: Older PLWH might be more depressed than their HIV-negative counterparts in mainland China, partially because they possessed more negative attitudes toward aging. Interventions for depression may include components of improving attitudes toward aging.

An additional aim was exploring whether the different frames affected the strength of identification with the EU, and if the framing effect on attitudes was mediated by participants' identification with the EU and/or by their message evaluation (Experiment 3). Results showed that a common project-based frame was more effective than a common heritage-based frame in promoting positive attitude toward EU integration and enlargement, as well as participants' identification with the EU, which mediated the framing effect on both attitudes; the mediation of participants' message evaluation was not significant. The procedure of the last experiment was replicated on a British sample (Experiment 4), showing a similar pattern of results.

TI  - CoMix: comparing mixing patterns in the Belgian population during and after lockdown
T2  - SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
LA  - English
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has shown how a newly emergent communicable disease can lay considerable burden on public health. To avoid system collapse, governments have resorted to several social distancing measures. In Belgium, this included a lockdown and a following period of phased re-opening. A representative sample of Belgian adults was asked about their contact behaviour from mid-April to the beginning of August, during different stages of the intervention measures in Belgium. Use of personal protection equipment (face masks) and compliance to hygienic measures was also reported. We estimated the expected reproduction number computing the ratio of R0 with respect to pre-pandemic data. During the first two waves (the first month) of the survey, the reduction in the average number of contacts was around 80% and was quite consistent across all age-classes. The average number of contacts increased over time, particularly for the younger age classes, still remaining significantly lower than pre-pandemic values. From the end of May to the end of July , the estimated reproduction number has a median value larger than one, although with a wide dispersion. Estimated R0 fell below one again at the beginning of August. We have shown how a rapidly deployed survey can measure compliance to social distancing and assess its impact on COVID-19 spread. Monitoring the effectiveness of social distancing recommendations is of paramount importance to avoid further waves of COVID-19.

AB  - Objective: Breast cancer (BC) is an important disease for women. BC influences both patient's and relatives lives. Especially, husb:uals/boyfriends/lovers are the ones that are affected mostly. In this study, it was aimed to introduce knowledge and attitudes of men toward BC and their sources of information about BC.
   Materials and Methods: This descriptive study was conducted with men applied to a University Hospital in Istanbul (Turkey-2018). The ethics per- mission was obtained form The Clinical Research Ethics Committee. Data regarding socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge and attitudes towards BC were collected with a questionnaire specific to the research. Statistical significance level was accepted as p<0.05.
   Results: In the study, 240 men (mean age: 36.2 +/- 10.6 years,min: 18.0, max: 63.0) were interviewed. Fifty four percent of men declared that they would nor marry someone with BC and/or someone who had mastectomy. Thirty four percent of participants thought that a woman with BC should conceal the disease. The mean BC knowledge score was 234.1 +/- 128.0 (median: 227.5, min: 0, max: 571.0) among the cocal which was 600.
   Conclusion: A significant proportion of men did not haw sufficient and accurate knowledge about BC. If the BC knowledge scores increase, there was an association with more positive attitudes. Negative attitudes of men related with BC of a woman may be an indicator of stigmatization. If it is aimed to increase support of men for women dealing with BC, it is recommended that BC awareness activities should be prepared to include men in order to increase their knowledge and to change their attitudes into a more positive way.

AB  - This study explores the bleed-over effect of tourism advertising by measuring a sample of international respondents' attitudes toward Bangladesh, its people, and its government before and after watching a television commercial. The commercial, "School of Life," is part of the Bangladesh Tourism Board's "Beautiful Bangladesh" campaign to promote the country as an international destination. Results indicate that this commercial did "bleed over" to create a more positive attitude among respondents in all three areas measured. It shows that a developing country like Bangladesh can successfully implement tourism advertising and destination branding as public diplomacy tools to better brand and promote itself among a variety of international stakeholders. These results support similar research that applied the bleed-over effect of tourism advertising among more developed and well-known countries.

AB  - Informed by the findings in prior research, the current study experimentally tested the effects of empathy responses to different types of media characters on attitudes and support for people with depression. In a between-subjects experiment, participants (N = 80) were assigned to one of three conditions. Participants in the first condition read an article about a high-similarity character with severe depression, those in the second condition read an article about a low-similarity character with severe depression, and those in the control group did not read an article. Participants in all three conditions were then shown a stimulus website for a faux peer-support organization. The results indicated that the level of empathic responses, positive attitudes, and the likelihood of joining the organization and engaging in supportive behaviors increased for those who read about a socially similar person with depression.

AB  - Prison staff are vital for enforcing order in prisons. However, order is not only maintained by what prison staff do, but also relies on prisoners willingly following the directives of prison staff and complying with prison rules and procedures. This article puts forward the idea that how prison staff treat prisoners can affect the social distancing prisoners put between themselves and prison staff, potentially making defiance and non-compliance more difficult to manage. Social distancing is operationalised in this article as motivational posturing. Using survey responses from 177 Australian prisoners, the article shows a strong association between prisoners' perceptions of procedural justice in prison and their self-reported compliance with prison rules. It also shows for the first time that motivational postures exist in a corrections context, and are associated with both procedural justice perceptions and self-reported compliance behaviour. Postures are also found to mediate the procedural justice/compliance relationship.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate whether and how a picture book preventing child sexual abuse can improve children's self-protection skills. The study was conducted in China with Chinese children. In a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, character in the book (human versus animal) and message framing (gain versus loss) were manipulated. Compared to a baseline group who were not exposed to the prevention book, children in the experimental groups significantly enhanced their ability to recognize a potential abuse situation and refuse an inappropriate touch request. Results suggest that the prevention picture books are more effective when using a human character and a gain-framed message. The explanation for this was that human characters simulated children's perceived norm and gain-framed messages increased children's message recall, perceived self-efficacy and positive attitude toward the message, all of which in turn positively affected children's self-protection skills.

AB  - This study investigated how persuasive messages integrated in an online game affects children's cognitive, affective, and conative responses to the brand, as well as their attitude toward the game itself. An experiment conducted among 2453 girls between the ages of 11 and 17 demonstrated that confrontation with interactive brand placement in the game resulted in more positive attitudes toward the game, higher top of mind awareness of the brand, more positive brand images, and more favorable behavioral intentions. In addition, consistent with persuasion literature and theories on child development, this study showed that there was a three-way interaction effect between exposure to the brand placement, age, and prior brand use for behavioral intentions. The youngest girls who had no prior experience with the brand were more strongly influenced by the brand placement than the oldest girls who had no prior brand experience. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Social distancing measures adopted in various countries to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to unwanted effects on their populations' health and behaviors. This study aimed to investigate smoking behavior in the Brazilian adult population during the COVID-19 pandemic and analyze factors associated with the increase in cigarette consumption. An online survey was performed, and the final sample included 45,160 individuals. The study used post-stratification weights and calculated crude prevalence ratios (PR) and adjusted by sex, age, and schooling, and respective 95% confidence intervals (95%CI). Poisson regression models with robust variance were applied to analyze associations between increased cigarette consumption and sociodemographic variables and adherence to social distancing, quality of sleep, state of mind, and changes in work and earnings. Prevalence of smokers was 12% (95%CI: 11.1-12.9), 34% of whom reported an increase in cigarette consumption. The increase was greater among women (PR = 1.27; 95%CI: 1.01-1.59) and individuals with incomplete secondary schooling (PR = 1.35; 95%CI: 1.02-1.79). The increase in cigarette consumption was associated with worse quality of sleep, feeling isolated from family members or sad, depressed, or anxious, loss of earnings, and worse self-rated health. Health promotion strategies, smoking prevention, and encouragement for smoking cessation, as well as mental health interventions, should be continued and reinforced in the context of social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - The subject of homosexuality remains taboo in contemporary China, given that the public maintains a considerably negative attitude toward the subject. Recent Pew Research indicates that, on average, 21% of Chinese respondents believe that homosexuality should be accepted. However, parallel surveys of Internet users paint a different picture, as online surveys found a more liberal atmosphere toward homosexuality and same-sex marriage. The online and offline discrepancy in attitudes toward homosexuality begs the question of whether the Internet carries a stigma-reducing function in terms of views on sexual minority groups. Guided by the contact hypothesis and parasocial contact theory, the current study investigates the de-stigmatizing effect of the social media on homosexuality in China. A web-based survey with 980 social media users with a heterosexual orientation confirmed the positive role of interpersonal-mediated contact with lesbian and gay celebrities via social media venues in stigma reduction; but findings did not lend support to the parasocial-mediated contact hypothesis.

AB  - COVID-19 is a global health emergency that has fundamentally altered human life. Public perception about COVID-19 greatly informs public policymaking and charts the course of present and future mitigation strategies. Existing approaches to gain insights into the evolving nature of public opinion has led to the application of natural language processing on public interaction data acquired from online surveys and social media. In this work, we apply supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches on global Twitter data to learn the opinions about adoption of mitigation strategies such as social distancing, masks, and vaccination, as well as the effect of socioeconomic, demographic, political, and epidemiological features on perceptions. Our study reveals the uniform polarity in public sentiment on the basis of spatial proximity or COVID-19 infection rates. We show the reservation about the adoption of social distancing and vaccination across the world and also quantify the influence of airport traffic, homelessness, followed by old age and race on sentiment of netizens within the US.

AB  - Overspending has been a largely stigmatised consumer behaviour in traditional Chinese culture. However, social and economic development in recent decades has induced the rise of Chinese consumerism and changes in public attitudes towards overspending. Focusing on overspending stigmasGouwukuang(GWK) andDuoshoudang(DSD) and stigma-relevant attitudes, the present study investigates the effect of perceived stigma on consumers' attitude towards overspending through the mediating effect of anticipated consumer guilt. The moderating role of message framing in this relationship is also examined. Results of two analyses indicate that (a) between the two stigmas, DSD is less stigmatising and preferred in comparison to GWK in social interaction and self-identification; (b) participants' perception of the stigma associated with overspending predicts their anticipation of guilt associated with this behaviour, which in turn predicts negative attitude towards overspending; (c) message framing moderates the relationship between perceived stigma and anticipated guilt, and hence facilitates destigmatisation of the traditionally stigmatised behaviour of overspending. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

AB  - The mass media has the ability to shape public opinion on child sexual offenders. To date, research has found that offenses committed by female child sexual offenders have been portrayed in the media with undertones of sympathy and romanticization. With the apparent shift in gender roles toward gender egalitarianism, the aim of the present study was to obtain an up-to-date understanding of how female child sexual offenders are portrayed in the print media across western countries. The study utilized newspaper articles involving female child sexual offenders, published in English across western countries from 2012 to 2016 (N = 35 articles). A qualitative content analysis revealed two major themes: female child sexual offenders are dangerous and they are accountable for their actions. The findings of the current study are positive and shed light on the potential advancement of the reporting of female child sexual offenders in the print media at an international level.

AB  - Entertainment consumption is often shared with others, whether friends or strangers. Whereas most co-viewing scholarship has examined parent-child viewing, few have examined viewing among in-group and out-group members. The present study explores in-group and out-group responses to racial comedy featuring disparaging information about the in-group. Findings suggest that Blacks report a more positive attitude, greater perceived similarity, and identification when viewing racially charged comedy with Black in-group members than when viewing with White out-group members. White viewers display no differences in their responses to television comedy based on whether they were viewing with in-group members or out-group members. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Taiwan withdrew from the United Nations in 1971, which led to missed opportunities for participating in global HIV/AIDS programs and made Taiwan more vulnerable to HIV. Employing a questionnaire of 996 college students in Taiwan, the authors assessed and compared female and male HIV/AIDS-related knowledge, attitudes, and sources of HIV/sexually transmitted infections (STI) information. Students reported moderate knowledge and attitudes. Females had more positive attitudes toward people with HIV/AIDS than males. Most participants reported learning about HIV and STIs from traditional media, school teachers, and the Internet. We suggest evidence-based educational interventions for students should include targeted electronic and cultural awareness strategies.

AB  - Purpose:To evaluate the satisfaction of diabetic patients and its determinants of telescreening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Saudi Arabia. Methods:This cross-sectional survey was conducted in December 2018 in a diabetes center of Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Ten questions were asked by the interviewer. A 5-point Likert scale was used to grade patient responses for each question. Rasch analysis was conducted to evaluate the response of the participants. The main outcome variable was the sum of the Logit values of the responses. The Rasch score was also compared among subgroups. Results:Two hundred (n = 200) diabetic patients were interviewed. The median Rasch score of client-perceived benefit of DR telescreening was +14.6 (25% quartile +3.09, minimum; -23.2, maximum; +35.7). A positive attitude of patients regarding DR telescreening was recorded in 159 (79.5%) participants. The perception of telescreening was better in younger diabetic patients than in older diabetic patients (Friedmanp< 0.001). The perception was similar in both genders (Mann-Whitneyp = 0.3). Diabetic patients from Riyadh and the southern region of Saudi Arabia had significantly more positive perception than those from north and eastern regions (Freedmanp< 0.001). Conclusion:Diabetic patients have positive attitude toward tele-DR screening. Their cooperation is likely to be high if large scale tele-DR screening is implemented in the Kingdom.

AB  - Objectives: This study deals with three relatively understudied issues in intergroup contact: negative contact, mediating mechanisms, and the minority perspective. Both direct and extended positive and negative contact experiences are included in the design. Intergroup anxiety is tested as a mediator between different forms of contact and prejudice, and status as Dutch majority or Muslim minority is used as a moderator. Method: A sample of 317 Dutch majority (47.6% female) and 369 Muslim minority (52.0% female) youth, ranging in age from 12 to 19 years completed self-reports about contact experiences, intergroup threat, and prejudice. Results: Results show that status as a Dutch majority or Muslim minority is a moderator in the relations between contact, intergroup anxiety, and prejudice. In the majority sample, all forms of direct and extended contact were related to prejudice and mediated by intergroup anxiety in the expected directions. In the Muslim minority sample, only positive contact was related to prejudice and mediated by intergroup anxiety in the expected direction. Conclusions: These findings underline that studies on intergroup relations should take both positive and negative contact experiences for intergroup attitudes into account as well as the majority or minority status of the groups involved. Moreover, the study suggests that partly different explanations may be needed for minority and majority groups for the role of intergroup contact in intergroup attitudes.

AB  - ObjectiveWe investigated family caregivers' awareness of disease status and attitude toward disclosure of disease progression compared with those of cancer patients and explored the potential association between family caregivers' attitudes and patients' quality of life (QOL).
   MethodsWe carried out a survey using self-administered questionnaires answered by pairs of family caregivers and patients diagnosed with advanced cancer (n=136 pairs). To assess patients' QOL, we used the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire.
   ResultsMore than half of family caregivers (54%) did not have full knowledge of patients' advanced stage and goal of therapy. Positive attitudes toward disclosure were less common in family caregivers than in patients (59.4% and 85.4%, respectively; p<0.01). The family caregivers' positive attitudes toward disclosure were inversely associated with patients' low functional scores (emotion [p=0.04] and cognition [p=0.02]) and high symptom scores (nausea and vomiting, pain, and insomnia; p<0.05). However, in most QOL scales, patients' attitudes were not significantly associated with functioning and symptom scores.
   ConclusionsA large portion of family caregivers may not know the patients' exact status. This study also suggests that the family caregivers' attitudes may differ from patients' and may be associated with patients' QOL. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Field experimentation is a promising but seldom used method for studying the effects of media messages on political attitudes and behavior. The practical challenges of conducting media experiments in real-world settings often come down to securing cooperation from research partners, such as political campaigns. To do so, researchers must be prepared to adapt their experimental designs to satisfy the constraints imposed by research partners and the media environment in which they operate. This article provides an overview of some alternative field experimental designs that allow researchers to maintain the advantages of random assignment while addressing practical considerations. Examples are drawn from the growing field experimental literature examining the effects of television, radio, and online communication.

AB  - One's generosity to others declines as a function of social distance, which is known as social discounting. We examined cultural similarities and differences in social discounting and the mediating roles of the two aspects of interdependence (self-expression and distinctiveness of the self) as well as the two aspects of independence (harmony-seeking and rejection avoidance). Using the same procedure that previous researchers used to test North Americans, Study 1 showed that compared to North Americans, Japanese discount more steeply a partner's outcomes compared to their own future outcomes, whereas the decrease in the subjective value of the partner's outcomes accelerates less as a function of social distance. To examine the cultural similarities and differences in social discounting in more detail, Study 2 tested Japanese and Germans and found that the hyperbolic with exponent model fitted the participants' discounting behaviors better than the other models, except for the loss condition in Germans where the utility of the q-exponential model was indicated. Moreover, although the social discounting rate was higher in Japanese than in Germans, the cultural difference was limited to the gain frame. However, the decline in a person's generosity accelerated less as a function of social distance in Japanese than in Germans. Furthermore, the cultural difference in the social discounting in gains was mediated by the level of harmony-seeking, which was higher in Germans than in Japanese. Implications for individuals' generosity against the backdrop of cultural characteristics are discussed.

AB  - Background: In August 2007, the President's Cancer Panel urged the leadership of the nation to "summon the political will to address the public health crisis caused by tobacco use" (President's Cancer Panel, N, 2007, Promoting healthy lifestyles: Policy, program, and personal recommendations for reducing cancer risk. http://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/pcp/pcp07rpt/pcp07rpt.pdf). While some research has examined predictors of public support for tobacco control measures, little research has examined modifiable factors that may influence public attitudes toward tobacco control.
   Methods: We used the American Legacy Foundation's 2003 American Smoking and Health Survey 2 to examine the contribution of smoking status, knowledge of the negative effects of tobacco, and tobacco-specific media exposure (antitobacco messages, news coverage of tobacco issues, and protobacco advertising) on U. S. adults' attitudes toward tobacco control. In addition, we assessed whether smoking status moderates the relationship between tobacco-specific media exposure and policy attitudes. Weighted multivariable logistic regression models were employed.
   Results: Results suggest that knowledge of the negative effects of tobacco and smoking status are associated with attitudes toward tobacco control and that exposure to tobacco-specific information in the media plays a role only in some instances. We found no evidence of effect modification by smoking status on the impact of exposure to tobacco-specific media on attitudes toward tobacco control.
   Discussion: Understanding the impact of readily modifiable factors that shape policy attitudes is essential if we are to target outreach and education in a way that is likely to sway public support for tobacco control.

AB  - Although research has shown that different types of prejudice are highly correlated, the existence of prejudice hierarchies indicates that individuals differentiate between target groups. Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N=1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

AB  - Background: Media coverage of the Germanwings plane crash intensely focused on the co-pilot's mental illness and was criticized for potentially increasing depression stigma. We explored whether stigma beliek towards persons with depression changed in April 2015 (about one month after the crash) compared to 2014.
   Method: Telephone surveys among the adult population were conducted in Munich, Germany (N=650 in 2014 and N=601 in 2015). In both surveys, four components of stigma were assessed: (1) characteristics ascribed to persons with a depression, (2) belief in a continuum of symptoms from mental health to mental illness, (3) emotional reactions to people afflicted by depression (fear, anger, and pro social reactions), and (4) desire for social distance.
   Results: Some stigmatizing attitudes have increased after the crash. More specifically, we found more pronounced changes in the attributes ascribed (stereotypes) and in the perceived separation from persons afflicted (continuum beliefs) than in the emotional reactions and the desire for social distance. However, overall increase in depression stigma was smaller than expected as changes were not statistically significant in the majority of the analyzed items.
   Limitations: Due to the study design no causal interpretation of results is possible. Moreover, evidence presented is confined to a regional German sample.
   Conclusions: A single devastating event and related media coverage seem to have a limited impact On public stigmatizing attitudes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All tights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: COVID-19 spread across China and other countries in a matter of weeks. Yet, it is uncertain how people have responded to protective behaviours in this pandemic. This study aims to evaluate how trust in different types of information sources influences the intention to adopt protective behaviours. Methods: In total, 122 Chinese completed a survey on Qualtrics in March 2021. Data on demographic information, protective behaviours, trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived risk, worry and social desirability were collected. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was used to identify associations between these variables. Results: Trust in formal information was significantly associated with perceived risk (beta = -.18) and significantly and positively associated with worry (beta = .28). Trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with perceived risk (beta = .57). Subsequently, perceived risk was significantly associated with social distancing (beta = -.17), and worry was significantly and positively associated with mask wearing (beta = .25) and significantly associated with hand washing (beta = -.27). Trust in formal information was significantly and positively associated with hand washing (beta = .26) while trust in informal information was significantly and positively associated with social distancing and hand washing (beta = .26). Perceived risk was significantly and positively associated with worry (beta = .32). Conclusion: People who trust in informal information from social media and interpersonal communication would be more likely to adopt mask wearing and hand washing protective behaviours. People who trust in formal information from government-agency source would have a lower perceived risk of COVID-19 and are less likely to adopt social distancing, but people who trust in formal information have a greater worry about contracting COVID-19 and are more likely to wear masks.

AB  - Digitalization gives micro-enterprises and rural areas new possibilities and it can support their competitiveness. In this paper, we have presented one way of supporting the diffusion and adoption of digital innovations in rural micro-enterprises. First, we examined the challenges and digital competence of the micro-enterprises in the rural areas of Central Finland to better understand what they needed. The second step was to develop a workshop concept. Theories of innovation diffusion and adoption were used as a base for these workshops. The last step was to evaluate the developed concept, its effects and challenges. We found that the workshop concept worked well for spreading information, for encouraging a positive attitude towards digital innovations, and for planning the use of innovations. Important factors in order for this concept to work were trust, communication, and changing the roles of agents and opinion leaders.

AB  - Objective: To assess the knowledge, attitudes and practices of Imams (Islamic clerics) concerning fluoride toothpaste and fluoridated water to improve oral health in Kelantan. Basic research design: Cross sectional study of Imams in 65 registered mosques in Pasir Puteh district, Kelantan. Method and participants: Face-to-face interview, using structured questionnaire and some open ended questions. Results: Most of the 83 interviewees (82% participation rate) were unsure whether their toothpaste contained fluoride (64%), only 25% were sure. More than one-third (37%) were using fluoridated piped water. Most (87%) had little knowledge of fluorides and more than two-thirds (69%) had lacked positive attitudes towards its use. Television (54%) was the most common source of information about fluorides, followed by newspapers (9%). The main reasons given among the few who opposed fluoride use were i) fear of dangerous side effects (4%) and ii) uncertainty about the halal status of fluoride (2%), Attitudes were not associated with the use of fluoridated water supply (p=0.999), age (p=0.103), income (p=0.540) and location (p=0.999). Conclusion: Over two-thirds of Imams had little knowledge of and lacked positive attitudes towards fluoride use in toothpaste and piped water supplies.

AB  - Strategic perspectives on moral and political attitudes suggest that people often tailor such attitudes to serve the current or future needs of themselves and their families. Given the critical importance of parenting in human life, we were interested in whether parenthood was associated with individual differences in political and moral attitudes, and whether parenthood and parenting motivation might partly explain age differences in these attitudes. Given that a key element of social conservatism is vigilance towards uncertainty and threat and, given that parenting is often associated with risk aversion, we predicted that parents (and those high in parenting motivation) would be more morally vigilant and more socially conservative. Across four studies including over 1500 participants, both objective parenthood and subjective parenting motivation independently predicted both outcomes. Further analyses revealed that both parenthood and parenting motivation mediated the relationships between age and both social conservatism and moral vigilance.

AB  - Aims of the study: The purpose of this study was to assess pharmacists' knowledge and attitude towards early detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) in Jordan and to explore potential predictor variables of such knowledge and attitude.
   Methods used to conduct the study: An electronic, self-reported questionnaire was used to collect data about demographics, knowledge and attitude regarding early detection of CRC. Both content and face validity were tested in a panel of experts. The participants' responses were analysed using descriptive statistics and multiple linear regressions.
   Results of the study: The 352 pharmacists (78% females, 94% Jordanian) had a median age of 28 years and graduated mostly (83%) from public universities. Surprisingly, 90% were not able to identify carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as a non-accurate diagnostic method and almost one-third did not identify the correct screening tests. On a scale of 5, the majority of participants (59%) had moderate knowledge scores (3 or 4) in case scenarios. The median knowledge Percent of Maximum Possible (POMP) score was 67% and higher scores were associated with more years since graduation, pharmacists with MSc degree and higher, working in urban areas, studying oncology course and received oncology training (P < .05). Most participants showed a positive attitude towards early detection of CRC (median attitude POMP score was 78%). However, none of the analysed variables predicted their level of attitude.
   Conclusions drawn from the study and clinical implications: Although the majority of pharmacists demonstrated a positive attitude towards early detection of CRC, their knowledge was inadequate. The study highlighted the importance of optimising the education programmes to improve the pharmacists' knowledge about CRC early detection and preparing the pharmacists for participating in future national screening initiatives.

AB  - Contact with the dominant group can increase opposition, among the disadvantaged, to social policies that would benefit their group. This effect can be explained in terms of contact promoting support for an ideology of meritocracy, which privileges the distribution of societal resources based on individual merit, rather than group-level disadvantage. We tested this ideological mechanism in a large, nationally representative sample of Maori (a disadvantaged group in New Zealand; N = 1,008). Positive intergroup contact with the dominant group (New Zealand Europeans) predicted increased opposition to a topical reparative policy (Maori ownership of the foreshore), and this was fully mediated by increased support for the ideology of meritocracy. Intergroup contact may enable the ideological legitimation of inequality among members of disadvantaged groups, engendering political attitudes that are detrimental to their group's interests. Contact with ingroup members had the opposite effect, increasing support for reparative policy by reducing subscription to meritocratic ideology.

Drawing attention to literatures within carceral geography and cybergeography, and presenting an empirical case study of the simulation computer game Prison Architect, it suggests that rather than being necessarily ephemeral, fleeting and transient, digital cultural production can also be carefully created, curated and manipulated in ways which involve both deep reflection on, and profound shaping of, political attitudes.

AB  - Pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors show substantial individual differences, and exploring their predictors can help reveal the origins of pro-environmental behavior. Basic personality traits may provide a partial explanation, but it is unclear which personality traits are reliably associated with pro-environmental behaviors. This article uses a specific type of environmental behavior, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, to clarify which personality correlates are most robustly associated with behavior, and to test mediation of those effects through attitudes. A large (N = 345) sample of United States adults representative in age, gender, and ethnicity completed the 100-item HEXACO personality inventory, a novel self-report measure of behaviors that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and scales of environmental and political attitudes. Accounting for demographics, emissions-reducing behaviors were most strongly predicted by Openness, Conscientiousness, and Extraversion, and these effects of personality were mediated by attitudes toward the natural environment. These observations broaden the understanding of the etiology of environmental attitudes and behavior.

AB  - Location based social network applications (LB-SNAs) allow business access to real-time customer location information. Despite concerns about individual privacy, the popularity of LB-SNAs is rising. This research considers how marketers can motivate people to disclose their location even when they are aware of the risks involved. The data from these applications encourages customers to try new businesses and allows those businesses to provide services that increase loyalty among current customers. The proposed LB-SNA model was tested using survey research with active online LB-SNA users. Findings show that privacy concerns do not moderate the correlation between attitude and location disclosure and that the decision to disclose location information is correlated with incentives. We also show that opinion leadership is a new antecedent for understanding attitudes about location disclosure. This study fills a research gap by positing and testing how an external factor such as incentives can alter a person's attitude about sharing private information. We also refine correlated factors to attitudes, discovering that if a person perceives that they are an opinion leader, they will also be more inclined to have a positive attitude about LB-SNA. In conjunction to testing these new motives this research is the first to modify Internet privacy concerns to fit LB-SNAs specifically, test a model that is contextualized to LB-SNAs, and include incentives and opinion leadership as dimensions within a privacy model. These findings are relevant to practitioners interested in motivating user participation, as well as academics searching for better understanding of privacy behaviors. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examined the effects of semi-fictional biographical political films on political learning and attitude change in audiences of fictionalized accounts of female politicians. Data from 310 participants indicated that content-related political learning significantly increased and attitude toward female politicians positively changed after exposure. A conceptual model of the political entertainment effects indicated that initial political learning transported the audience into the biographical narrative, which led to greater enjoyment, as well as learning gain and a positive attitude toward female politicians. Our findings provide important clarification to existing research and offer both theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.

AB  - It is commonly said that the lockdowns and social distancing necessary to control coronavirus pandemics will only work if the general population trusts its government, believes the information it provides, and has confidence in its policies. This article traces the British government's record in providing information about its policies and performance, and compares this with the public's use of the mainstream news media. It then considers how these two sources of information affected trust in government and public compliance with social distancing and lockdown rules. Lastly, it compares Covid-19 with Brexit and draws conclusions about how beliefs and behaviour are formed when individuals are personally faced with a serious threat.

AB  - Drawing from the stereotype content model, we examine how people respond to likeminded and counter-attitudinal political comments appearing after a news article. We experimentally test how citizens behave when they are able to click on one of three different buttons posted next to others' commentsLike, Recommend, or Respect. In the experiment, political attitudes predicted button clicking, but the button label affected the strength of the relationship. In some instances, people clicked on fewer buttons associated with likeminded comments and more buttons associated with counter-attitudinal comments when the button was labeled with Respect as opposed to Like or Recommend. The pattern of results for the Recommend button differed across two issues. The results suggest that political comments can trigger stereotypical reactions. Although the Like button is well known, news organizations interested in promoting less partisan behaviors should consider using a Respect button rather than the Like or Recommend button in comment sections.

AB  - Introduction: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global health problem with high morbidity and mortality in patients who are mostly still economically active. The growing incidence and health implications for those affected make T2DM a major public health issue. Objectives: To compile a demographic, anthropometric and knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) profile of adult patients with T2DM in the public health sector of the Free State province, South Africa. Design: A descriptive observational study was conducted. Setting: A total of 255 participants attending public health facilities in the Free State were interviewed. Outcome Measures: Questionnaires were completed in an interview to determine demographics and KAP. Anthropometric measurements were obtained by standard techniques. Results: The majority of the participants (n = 222; 87.1%) were black women from urban areas, who were overweight and obese. The median age at diagnosis was 48 years (range 15?80 years), and 25 participants (9.8%) lacked formal schooling. In 212 participants (83.1%), a waist circumference above cut-off points was observed. Only half of the participants knew the normal range for blood glucose. Approximately 80% felt that they would be a different person if they did not have diabetes. Although 96.1% of participants were knowledgeable about the benefits of physical exercise, only 31.0% reported exercising on a daily basis. A statistically significant association was found between knowledge and attitudes, indicating that better knowledge about diabetes could be associated with a more positive attitude towards diabetes. Conclusion: Poor knowledge, a negative attitude and poor practices related to diabetes were observed in a very high percentage of participants, which may contribute to morbidity and mortality. The fact that knowledge was associated with attitude indicates that interventions aimed at improving knowledge could benefit patients in more than one way. Interventions to equip patients to successfully manage their condition are urgently required.

AB  - Much political communication research examines the effects of media on political attitudes and behavior. But what of the contributions of political behavior toward selective exposure? This study draws on literature from selective exposure and political socialization to explore whether one's likelihood of engaging in selective exposure may originate in part during the "crystallization period" of young adulthood. After controlling for demographic and political variables in adolescence and midadulthood, an analysis of data from a four-wave longitudinal panel of "baby boomers" from 1965 to 1997 indicates that selective exposure can be traced to political protest activity during this time and, very marginally, in subsequent years. The implications for the future of selective exposure among emerging generations are discussed.

AB  - This study focuses on social media use of citizens from two groups that are often associated with the rise of social media: populist and postmaterialist citizens. Considering their ideological underpinnings, we theorize that they will make more political use of social media and that this further reifies their political attitudes into voting for populist and postmaterialist parties, respectively. Using unique survey data including the relatively new populist attitudes and political use of social media, we test this theory on the Dutch case. We find that both groups do not read political news or connect to politicians more, but both are more likely to react to political content. Moreover, social media use does not seem to lead to a retention in one's own ideological funnel signified by populist or postmaterialist voting. Among more postmaterialist citizens, passive social media use even makes it more likely to vote for other parties.

AB  - Research on political psychology has benefitted from using individual-difference measures to predict political attitudes and behavior. And, previous research has further identified a number of specific variables that enhance the predictive utility of individual-difference scales. However, a potentially important factor that has been overlooked is the certainty with which people make their responses. The present research establishes that the certainty with which people respond to scales is associated with stability of the scale responses over time and correspondence between the scale and related outcomes. In addition, the effects of certainty in political ideological identification in predicting politically relevant outcomes hold when controlling for a number of previously established moderators. This research suggests that measuring certainty in answers to individual-difference scales can be a useful and efficient way to increase the predictive utility of those scales within the political domain and beyond. This benefit is demonstrated with need for cognition (Study 1), need to evaluate (Study 2), and ideological identification (Studies 2 and 3).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic generated a number of changes in the functioning of urban areas all over the world and had a visible impact on the use of green infrastructure, including city parks. The study discusses and compares operation and use of two such parks located in Wellington, New Zealand and Warsaw, Poland by adopting "pandemic urban ethnography", an approach that includes autoethnography, interviews with users, non-participant observation, and analysis of social media content. As indicated by the findings of the study, the importance of less rigidly designed, multifunctional spaces that give their users freedom of "tactical" adjustments, significantly grows during times of lockdown and "social distancing". During such a crisis, the management and everyday use of urban parks are highly related to urban policies. The article provides insight into how those policies impact the functional values of green infrastructure confronting it with user-generated adaptations and the landscape design itself. The global health emergency showed how access to green areas becomes a crucial determinant on environmental justice while proving the significance of "tactical pandemic urbanism" as both a design and management method.

AB  - ObjectiveThe study investigates sources of asymmetry between individual attitudes toward nationalist inclusion and exclusionfocusing on why public support in Russia for deporting all migrants remained about the same from 2005 to 2013, while support for admitting all migrants significantly declined.
   MethodsData from surveys based on multistage random sampling of the adult population of the Russian Federation in 2005 (N = 579) and 2013 (N = 805) are subjected to multiple (OLS) regression analysis, in which support for deportation and admission of migrants are dependent variables and survey measures (with different specifications) of intergroup threat, competition, bias, contact, and the immigration security dilemma, as well as education and media exposure are the independent variables.
   ResultsOnly two predictors consistently explained support for both inclusion and exclusion of migrants in Russia in both 2005 and 2013perceived state strength and economic vulnerability. In every test, support for exclusion nonrandomly related to more predictors in the same model than support for inclusion.
   ConclusionIn changing political and socioeconomic contexts exclusionist views are more persistent than inclusive views. Both measures need to be used in research on intergroup relations and nationalism. Otherwise, one is more likely to accept false positives while underestimating some significant enduring predictors.

AB  - Social distancing is a central (un)word of the pandemic year 2020. Now, music culture thrives on performative 'liveness'-even in classical music, where live experience has become the core of the musical artwork in the age of its mechanical reproduction. At the same time, the history of music can be read as a history of the dissolution of boundaries: from the body (voice), to mechanical instruments, to electronic extensions. Accelerated by regulations in response to the COVID-19 crisis, music culture passes another media transformation, entering new virtual stages. In fact, crisis always implies changes and chances too: economists call it 'creative destruction', artists call it innovation. And indeed, 'social distancing' in interaction with accelerated digitalisation also holds media-aesthetic potential. With the support of new media, and this is the hypothesis of this essay, the contemporary music scene in particular can form new dramatic forms that go far beyond the classical one-way stream: by enabling virtual participation instead of physical co-presence.

AB  - Society increasingly demands ethical motives from investors. Like other judgments, however, the moral evaluation of investments can be influenced by stereotypes. We investigate whether subjects' evaluation of investments as immoral violates the commonly accepted principle of moral impartiality- the view that moral evaluations of actions must not depend on the actor's arbitrary personal characteristics. Recently, the media discussed such a violation when criticizing an internal remark of a German financial regulator (BaFin), which stated that most short sellers of Wirecard stocks came from Israel was "striking". Through a between-subjects experiment, we find that young German MTurkers with generally centrist political attitudes display behavior consistent with an anti-Semitic stereotype: They are much more likely to evaluate the very same investment as immoral if it is made by an investor with a name perceived as Jewish. The triggering of this stereotype should prompt us to consider the moral evaluation of investors with caution. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - We propose a difference-in-differences approach for disentangling a total treatment effect within specific subpopulations into a direct effect and an indirect effect operating through a binary mediating variable. Random treatment assignment along with specific common trend and effect homogeneity assumptions identify the direct effects on the always and never takers, whose mediator is not affected by the treatment, as well as the direct and indirect effects on the compliers, whose mediator reacts to the treatment. In our empirical application, we analyze the impact of the Vietnam draft lottery on political preferences. The results suggest that a high draft risk due to the draft lottery outcome leads to an increase in mild preferences for the Republican Party, but has no effect on strong preferences for either party or on specific political attitudes. The increase in Republican support is mostly driven by the direct effect not operating through the mediator that is military service.

AB  - This study proposed a modified activity theory framework, complemented by a dynamic time axis, to analyze each organizational change stage of a two-phase capability maturity model integration (CMMI) maturity level adoption case. The study revealed the following results: At the planning stage, the involvement of senior executives determined the positive attitude toward change. At the getting started stage, employees' clear recognition of change objectives determined the change effectiveness. At the letting go stage, department heads got involved, understood, and provided both support and mediating activities to achieve the actual benefits. At the completion stage, performance was used as a measurement tool to help internalize the change into new capabilities.

AB  - Background: Nowadays, mobile technologies are part of everyday life, but the lack of instruments to assess their acceptability for the management of chronic diseases makes their actual adoption for this purpose slow. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a survey instrument for assessing patients' attitude toward and intention to use mobile technology for diabetes mellitus (DM) self-management, as well as to identify sociodemographic characteristics and quality of life factors that affect them.
   Methods: We first conducted the documentation and instrument design phases, which were subsequently followed by the pilot study and instrument validation. Afterward, the instrument was administered 103 patients (median age: 37 years; range: 18-65 years) diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 DM, who accepted to participate in the study. The reliability and construct validity were assessed by computing Cronbach's alpha and using factor analysis, respectively.
   Results: The instrument included statements about the actual use of electronic devices for DM management, interaction between patient and physician, attitude toward using mobile technology, and quality of life evaluation. Cronbach's alpha was 0.9 for attitude toward using mobile technology and 0.97 for attitude toward using mobile device applications for DM self-management. Younger patients (Spearman's rho=-0.429; P<0.001) with better glycemic control (Spearman's rho=-0.322; P< 0.001) and higher education level (Kendall's tau=0.51; P<0.001) had significantly more favorable attitude toward using mobile assistive applications for DM control. Moreover, patients with a higher quality of life presented a significantly more positive attitude toward using modern technology (Spearman's rho= 0.466; P<0.001).
   Conclusion: The instrument showed good reliability and internal consistency, making it suitable for measuring the acceptability of mobile technology for DM self-management. Additionally, we found that even if most of the patients showed positive attitude toward mobile applications, only a moderate level of intention to indeed use them was observed. Moreover, the study indicated that barriers were truthfulness and easiness to use.

KW  - RECALL FREQUENCY
KW  - INDUCTION
AB  - In recent years, the interest in lucid dreaming (dreaming with the conscious knowledge that one is dreaming) was stimulated by blockbuster films like "Inception" and the media interest in studies indicating that lucid dreaming can be beneficial. However, systematic studies regarding the attitude toward lucid dreams are lacking. An online survey was completed by 1,380 persons (777 women and 603 men), whose mean age was 51.63 +/- 14.13 years. The six-item scale measuring attitude toward lucid dreams showed high internal consistency. The attitude toward lucid dreams was highly correlated with the general attitude toward lucid dreams and decreased with age; women reported a more positive attitude. However, the attitude toward lucid dreams was markedly lower than the attitude toward dreams in general. It would be interesting to study what the bases of the attitude toward lucid dreams are, for example, information in the media, personal experience, and reports of friends.

AB  - Female gender has been consistently associated with positive psychological help-seeking attitudes and behaviors; however, surprisingly few empirical studies have examined how femininity-related variables impact women's help-seeking decision making. Informed by the theory of reasoned action (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980), the purpose of this study was (a) to investigate the associations between two femininity constructssubjective femininity stress and gender solidarityand psychological help-seeking intention, and (b) to explore the mediating roles of help-seeking attitudes and social stigma using structural equation modeling. Participants were 451 college-enrolled women in Southern California. Results revealed that all the mediation relationships involving help-seeking attitudes and stigma were significant. Subjective femininity stress was positively related to help-seeking intention via help-seeking attitudes, but was negatively related to intention via social stigma. Gender solidarity was positively related to help-seeking intention via positive attitudes and reduced social stigma. Implications for future research, prevention programs, and practice are discussed.

AB  - Many ecosystems are facing environmental threats. Some of the main concerns are now focused in developing countries. Strong environmental messages by numerous stakeholders have led to varied responses on environmental issues. Companies, governmental agencies and NGOs are responding to such issues by developing campaigns to promote sustainable practices amongst key stakeholders. Green advertising is one important form of communications employed to elicit environmentally friendly attitudes and consequently promote behavioural change. This study analyses the effect of a sponsored cinematographic green advertising strategy by a NGO and a major supermarket chain in a Latin American country. Based on in-depth interviews with Colombian movie audiences, this investigation demonstrates how (1) a movie focused on nationalistic identification can effectively provoke positive attitude change toward environmental sustainable practices, (2) the movie's media format can heighten audience interest about adopting environmental sustainable practices and (3) these results benefit positively the two movie sponsors through association and affect transfer.

AB  - Objectives: In multiethnic countries, enhancing the sense of community and preventing ethnic segregation represents a major challenge. In this study we aimed to test the effects of different forms of intergroup contact in fostering sense of community among majority and minority ethnic groups in China, by focusing on the sense of the community at the national level.
   Methods: Participants were Han (N = 355, ethnic majority group) and Uyghur (N = 546, ethnic minority group) people at a multiethnic university in the Xinjiang province in China.
   Results: Results from path analysis revealed that positive direct contact for the minority, and positive extended and vicarious contact for both majority and minority group were indirectly associated with higher sense of Chinese national community via greater focus on positive characteristics of the outgroup. In addition, negative contact (extended contact for the majority; direct contact for the minority) were indirectly associated with lower sense of Chinese national community via reduced focus on positive outgroup characteristics. No evidence was found for negative focus (focus on negative outgroup characteristics) and intergroup threat as mediators. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings for improving intergroup relations in multiethnic and conflictual settings by using multiple forms of intergroup contact are discussed.

AB  - Background: Nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) (such as wearing masks and social distancing) have been implemented by governments around the world to slow the spread of COVID-19. To promote public adherence to these regimes, governments need to understand the public perceptions and attitudes toward NPI regimes and the factors that influence them. Twitter data offer a means to capture these insights.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to identify tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries and compare the trends in public perceptions and attitudes toward NPIs across these countries. The aim is to identify factors that influenced public perceptions and attitudes about NPI regimes during the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We analyzed 777,869 English language tweets about COVID-19 NPIs in six countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Ireland, the United Kingdom, and the United States). The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was assessed using a Pearson correlation analysis. Topic modeling was used to isolate tweets about NPIs. A comparative analysis of NPIs between countries was conducted.
   Results: The proportion of NPI-related topics, relative to all topics, varied between countries. The New Zealand data set displayed the greatest attention to NPIs, and the US data set showed the lowest. The relationship between tweet frequencies and case numbers was statistically significant only for Australia (r=0.837, P<.001) and New Zealand (r=0.747, P<.001). Topic modeling produced 131 topics related to one of 22 NPIs, grouped into seven NPI categories: Personal Protection (n=15), Social Distancing (n=9), Testing and Tracing (n=10), Gathering Restrictions (n=18), Lockdown (n=42), Travel Restrictions (n=14), and Workplace Closures (n=23). While less restrictive NPIs gained widespread support, more restrictive NPIs were perceived differently across countries. Four characteristics of these regimes were seen to influence public adherence to NPIs: timeliness of implementation, NPI campaign strategies, inconsistent information, and enforcement strategies.
   Conclusions: Twitter offers a means to obtain timely feedback about the public response to COVID-19 NPI regimes. Insights gained from this analysis can support government decision making, implementation, and communication strategies about NPI regimes, as well as encourage further discussion about the management of NPI programs for global health events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose Indonesia has the largest Muslim population in the world and represents a significant global-market opportunity for halal food producers. Surprisingly, halal-food consumption in Indonesia remains under-researched. Thus, this study aims to investigate the factors influencing consumers' halal-food consumption, using an extended theory of planned behaviour (TPB) model.
   Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire distributed among 418 consumers in Surabaya, Indonesia. Multiple regression analysis was used to describe the TPB relationship and halal-food consumption.
   Findings This study successfully extended the TPB to include additional predictors: perceived awareness, habit, religious self-identity (RSI), moral obligations and trust to determine consumers' intention in halal-food consumption. Attitudes, RSI and moral obligations were significant predictors of intention to consume halal food.
   Practical implications The findings can be used by the government and food producers to target specific factors, especially positive attitudes, RSI and moral obligations. Indonesia Ulama Council (Majelis Ulama Indonesia), the food industry and the media play a critical role in sustaining consumers' positive attitude towards halal-food consumption. It is critical for food manufacturers to tailor their marketing strategies and consider promoting Islamic dietary rules when promoting their food products.
   Originality/value To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is one of the first attempts to investigate the determinants of halal-food consumption, using an extended TPB in Indonesia.

AB  - This study explores the perplexing role of the Internet in authoritarian settings. We disentangle the political impact of the Internet along two distinct dimensions, indirect effects and direct effects. While the direct effects of the exposure to the Internet shape political attitudes in a manifest and immediate way, the indirect effects shape various political outcomes via instilling fundamental democratic orientations among citizens. In authoritarian societies such as China, we argue the indirect effects of the Internet as a value changer tend to be potent, transformative, and persistent. But the direct effects of the Internet as a mere alternative messenger are likely to be markedly contingent. Relying on the newly developed method of causal mediation analysis and applying the method to data from a recent survey conducted in Beijing, we find strong empirical evidence to support our argument about the two-dimensional impacts of the Internet in authoritarian countries.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccine is considered to be the most promising approach to alleviate the pandemic. However, in recent surveys, acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low. To design more effective outreach interventions, there is an urgent need to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 vaccines.
   Objective: Our objective was to analyze the potential of leveraging transfer learning to detect tweets containing opinions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward COVID-19 vaccines, and to explore temporal trends as well as automatically extract topics across a large number of tweets.
   Methods: We developed machine learning and transfer learning models to classify tweets, followed by temporal analysis and topic modeling on a dataset of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets posted from November 1, 2020 to January 31, 2021. We used the F1 values as the primary outcome to compare the performance of machine learning and transfer learning models. The statistical values and P values from the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test were used to assess whether users' perceptions changed over time. The main topics in tweets were extracted by latent Dirichlet allocation analysis.
   Results: We collected 2,678,372 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from 841,978 unique users and annotated 5000 tweets. The F1 values of transfer learning models were 0.792 (95% CI 0.789-0.795), 0.578 (95% CI 0.572-0.584), and 0.614 (95% CI 0.606-0.622) for these three tasks, which significantly outperformed the machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine). The prevalence of tweets containing attitudes and behavioral intentions varied significantly over time. Specifically, tweets containing positive behavioral intentions increased significantly in December 2020. In addition, we selected tweets in the following categories: positive attitudes, negative attitudes, positive behavioral intentions, and negative behavioral intentions. We then identified 10 main topics and relevant terms for each category.
   Conclusions: Overall, we provided a method to automatically analyze the public understanding of COVID-19 vaccines from real-time data in social media, which can be used to tailor educational programs and other interventions to effectively promote the public acceptance of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Uptake of prenatal genetic testing (PGT) is low among those with sickle cell disease (SCD). This study evaluated the association of knowledge and attitudes towards prenatal genetic counseling (PGC), awareness of posttesting intervention options and omission bias with attitudes towards PGT. In addition, we explored changes among knowledge, attitudes, and awareness of options following exposure to an educational, clinical vignette among parents of children with SCD. Parents (n=44) completed a questionnaire and an educational, clinical vignette presenting a detailed account of a pregnant woman with sickle cell trait seeking PGT and PGC was read to each participant. t Tests, Spearman correlations, multivariable regressions, and moderation/mediation analyses were used. More positive attitudes towards PGC (P=0.01), lesser tendency of omission bias (P<0.01) and private insurance (P=0.04) were significant correlates of more positive attitudes towards PGT. Omission bias mediated the relationship of attitudes towards PGC and attitudes towards PGT (95% confidence interval: 0.13, 3.03). Awareness of options (P=0.02), knowledge of PGC (P=0.01) and knowledge of PGT (P=0.01) significantly improved after exposure to the clinical vignette. Patients and families with SCD can benefit from education about the importance of prenatal diagnosis to improve attitudes, address omission bias and promote more informed decisions of PGT.

AB  - Background: Positive attitudes for end-of-life (EOL) care along with adequate education are key factors for the provision of quality EOL care. This national study was conducted to identify the factors that influence attitudes toward EOL care on medical students. Method: An anonymous survey was designed and administered to fourth-year medical students at all 41 medical schools in Korea. Topics related to EOL care were assessed in classroom teaching, bedside teaching, and feedback experiences during clinical clerkships. Seven questions for self-rated attitudes and affecting factors were analyzed toward EOL care. Results: With a response rate of 49.2%, the median number of topics recognized by the students as having been delivered was 5 of 11 topics in classroom lectures and 1 of 8 topics in clinical experience. Although few (21.2%) participants indicated that they felt ready for EOL care practice, nevertheless, most felt that they should have adequate knowledge of and preparation for clinical competency in EOL care. Several parameters including respondent's demographics and exposure to EOL care topics in classroom and in bedside teaching influenced the responses to all 7 attitude questions. However, having more than 1 bedside experience was the only factor positively affecting all attitudinal measures. Conclusions: Clinical experience related to EOL care seems to be the utmost priory in fostering positive attitudes and competency among medical students.

AB  - As virtual reality (VR) games are getting more widespread, the need to understand the interaction between players and the VR games is gaining prominence. The present study examines player endorsement of virtual reality games from an amalgamation of technology acceptance, self-determination, and flow theory perspectives. A survey was carried out with participants (N = 396) who had played a VR game at least once and at most five times. Structural equation modeling analyses showed that perceived ease of use was the primary predictor for satisfaction of self-determination constructs (autonomy and competence) and flow constructs (immersion and concentration), which in turn predicted player enjoyment. Accordingly, the results suggest the importance of including self-determination constructs in addition to the flow perspective within the context of technology acceptance model, for explaining the acceptance of VR gaming. Findings also showed that enjoyment resulted in positive attitudes towards VR gaming, and these attitudes predicted intention to play VR games.

AB  - Despite the increasing popularity and advantage of native advertising on social media, advertisers are concerned about the possibility of native ads misleading consumers, resulting in boomerang effects. This study attempts to address this concern by comparing the predictive role of native ad nonintrusiveness with that of native ad manipulativeness in consumers' attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising. Findings from an online survey of 550 U.S. adult consumers showed that native ad nonintrusiveness was positively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising, whereas native ad manipulativeness was not. Consumers' ad skepticism and persuasion knowledge were negatively related to attitude toward and sharing intention of native advertising; but persuasion knowledge became nonsignificant when native ad nonintrusiveness and manipulativeness were included in regression models. Additionally, those with stronger information-seeking motivation showed more positive attitudinal and behavioral responses. This study advances the knowledge of native advertising by examining the possibility of its being a double-edged sword. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This paper explores the causal influence of media content on voting behavior. We exploit a natural experiment involving access to West German TV within the German Democratic Republic. Focusing on federal and state election outcomes in the post-reunification decade (i.e., a time at which TV content was harmonized), we find that municipalities that had access to Western TV broadcasts before reunification have lower vote shares for left-wing and right-wing extremist parties. With regard to potential channels, we provide evidence based on survey data that GDR citizens with access to West German TV were less loyal to the socialist regime, less hostile toward foreigners, and exhibited higher levels of social capital. Our findings thus support the notion that access to free media influences political attitudes and facilitates the consolidation of democracy.

AB  - In spring 2020, COVID-19 and the ensuing social distancing and stay-at-home orders instigated abrupt changes to employment and educational infrastructure, leading to uncertainty, concern, and stress among United States college students. The media consumption patterns of this and other social groups across the globe were affected, with early evidence suggesting viewers were seeking both pandemic-themed media and reassuring, familiar content. A general increase in media consumption, and increased consumption of specific types of content, may have been due to media use for coping strategies. This paper examines the relationship between the stress and anxiety of university students and their strategic use of media for coping during initial social distancing periods in March-April 2020 using data from a cross-sectional survey. We examine links between specific types of media use with psychological well-being concepts, and examine the moderating roles of traits (hope, optimism, and resilience) as buffers against negative relationships between stress and anxiety and psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that stress was linked to more hedonic and less eudaimonic media use, as well as more avoidant and escapist media-based coping. Anxiety, on the other hand, was linked to more media use in general, specifically more eudaimonic media use and a full range of media-based coping strategies. In turn, escapist media was linked to negative affect, while reframing media and eudaimonic media were linked to positive affect. Avoidant coping was tied to poorer mental health, and humor coping was tied to better mental health. Hedonic and need-satisfying media use were linked to more flourishing. Hope, optimism, and resilience were all predictive of media use, with the latter two traits moderating responses to stress and anxiety. The findings give a nuanced portrait of college students' media use during a pandemic-induced shutdown, showing that media use is closely intertwined with well-being in both adaptive and maladaptive patterns.

AB  - Viewing images of terrorism can have a powerful impact on individuals' emotional and political responses, yet little is known about the psychological processes underlying these effects. We hypothesized that the content of terrorism images will shape viewers' appraisals of the event, which will elicit specific emotions and political attitudes. British citizens viewed photographs of the 2005 London bombings, either focusing on victims or terrorists. Exposure to images of victims increased appraisals of victim suffering, which predicted feelings of sympathy. Exposure to images of terrorists increased appraisals of terrorists as dangerous, which predicted fear; and of the attack as unjust, which predicted anger. Each emotion predicted support for a distinct counterterrorism policy. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explore altruism born of suffering (ABS), a theory that explains how the experience of suffering within one's own life may result in the motivation to help others, even outgroup members.
   Design/methodology/approach Participants were 186 emerging adults (63 per cent female, 37 per cent male; 69 per cent Protestant, 41 per cent Catholic; average age =21.3, SD=2.57 years old) in Northern Ireland, a setting of protracted intergroup conflict. Participants were randomly assigned to an in/outgroup condition, read four types of adversity that occurred to same-sex victim(s), and indicated their empathetic response and how much they would like to help the victims.
   Findings Moderated mediation analyses revealed that empathy for the victim partially mediated the impact of perceived harm on desire to help; moreover, recent negative life events strengthened the link between harm and empathy. The path between empathy and helping was stronger in the outgroup compared to the ingroup condition.
   Practical implications These findings support ABS, highlighting empathy as a key factor underlying more constructive intergroup relations in a divided society.
   Originality/value This paper extends previous research on ABS by focusing on a post-accord context. The value of the current analyses demonstrate the important role of fostering empathy to promote outgroup helping in settings of divisive group identities.

AB  - Mobile internet (M-internet) has developed rapidly in recent years. Under this environment, the spillover effect of corporate negative publicity may have a further impact on brand extension evaluation. This study examined the effects of two types of corporate negative publicities on brand extension evaluation. Further, the possible moderation effects on the above relationship in the M-internet environment were also studied. Compared to ethics negative publicity, the results show that product-harm negative publicity leads to a lower brand extension evaluation. Furthermore, both spatial distance and social distance produce a significant moderation effect on the relationship between corporate negative publicity and brand extension evaluation. In the case of near spatial distance and social distance of familiarity type, a lower brand extension evaluation is shown by product-harm negative publicity. Lastly, negative emotion can significantly mediate the relationship between corporate negative publicity and brand extension evaluation.

AB  - We conducted 3 studies to investigate the effect of money priming on consumers' need for uniqueness. In Study 1, we found that when choosing products, consumers who were primed with money had a stronger need for counterconformity, compared to those who were not. In Study 2, we found that the meaning of money linked to the amount of money moderated the effect of money concept on consumers' choice of innovative products, and that the likelihood that individuals primed with a large amount of money would choose unique products was significantly higher than that of both those primed with a small amount of money and the non-money-primed control group. In Study 3, we found that social distance mediated the influence of money concept on the consumers' need for uniqueness. Overall, the results showed that consumers who are primed with money perceive greater social distance and have a stronger need for uniqueness.

AB  - The current research examines the attitudes towards the use of social media sites to support the learning process among Master's in Educational Technologies students at the University of Bisha in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including perceptions of educational benefits as well as disadvantages and barriers. Forty two students participated in this study and completed a web-based survey. The findings revealed a largely positive attitude toward the usage of social media sites in the classroom, attributing to it many advantages, such as increasing the quality and efficiency of communication between students and teachers, greater access to information, as well as stronger social connections and ease of collaboration among classmates. However, the participants also mentioned cyberbullying, privacy issues and distractions as some difficulties associated with using these tools.

AB  - In this study, the spreading of the pandemic coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is formulated mathematically. The objective of this study is to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19. In fact, to stop the spread of COVID-19, the vaccine of the disease is needed. However, in the absence of the vaccine, people must have to obey curfew and social distancing and follow the media alert coverage rule. In order to maintain these alternative factors, we must obey the modeling rule. Therefore, the impact of curfew, media alert coverage, and social distance between the individuals on the outbreak of disease is considered. Five ordinary differential equations of the first-order are used to represent the model. The solution properties of the system are discussed. The equilibria and the basic reproduction number are computed. The local and global stabilities are studied. The occurrence of local bifurcation near the disease-free equilibrium point is investigated. Numerical simulation is carried out in applying the model to the sample of the Iraqi population through solving the model using the Runge-Kutta fourth-order method with the help of Matlab. It is observed that the complete application of the curfew and social distance makes the basic reproduction number less than one and hence prevents the outbreak of disease. However, increasing the media alert coverage does not prevent the outbreak of disease completely, instead of that it reduces the spread, which means the disease is under control, by reducing the basic reproduction number and making it an approachable one.

AB  - The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has affected 55 million people and caused more than 1,333,742 deaths globally in eight months since its first outbreak. People are increasingly engaging with information using interpersonal communication, traditional and social media to understand the novel virus. The deluge of information can be detrimental in containing this illness that primarily depends on human behavior for transmission. In this environment, health communication theories can provide an insight into the decision-making process of adopting prevention behaviors recommended by public health authorities. We propose that information cues will influence protective behaviors indirectly mediated by perceived susceptibility and perceived severity of COVID-19 threat. In early April 2020, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among a convenience sample among 1,545 people across the United States. Results showed that informational cues influence the behavior of staying at home and maintaining social distancing mediated by perceived susceptibility and perceived severity. Use of social media was shown to have a negative influence on perceived susceptibility and social distancing, suggesting the confounding role of misinformation in influencing people's perception of threat from COVID-19, and their compliance to heath recommendations. Theoretical and practical implications are further discussed.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes toward the religious outgroup among minority Christians and majority Muslims in Indonesia. It answers two research questions: Does interreligious contact reduce negative outgroup attitudes equally for minority Christians and majority Muslims? Are mediation by perceived group threat and moderation by perceived discrimination equally important for religious minorities and majorities? The analysis is based on unique survey data collected from among Christian and Muslim students in Ambon (the Moluccas) and Yogyakarta (central Java). Results show that a higher quantity of interreligious contact reduces negative outgroup attitudes among majority Muslims but not among minority Christians. However, the quality of contact reduces negative attitudes regardless of relative group size. Perceived group threat is an important mediator of the contact-attitude relationship and is equally so for Christians and Muslims. Findings suggest that perceived discrimination does not affect the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes.

AB  - Intergenerational contact can promote positive attitudes towards elders. However, contact with older adults often fosters multiple stereotypes, which may contribute to ambivalence about aging and poorer health in late life. Online survey data from 457 young adults (M age = 19.4 years; 74% female) were used to explore the relationship between intergenerational contact and ambivalence about self as a future elder. Multiple mediator path analysis was used to test the hypothesis that anxiety, knowledge, and empathy would mediate the impact of intergenerational contact on aging self-ambivalence. Ratings of intergenerational contact predicted ambivalence, but anxiety and empathy mediated the relationship (knowledge did not). Higher ratings of intergenerational contact, lower aging anxiety, and higher empathy predicted lower aging self-ambivalence, which reflected positive expectations for late life in our sample. Intergenerational contact can influence expectations for old age; exchange that fosters empathy and reduces anxiety may encourage individuals to exercise strategies that positively impact health in late life.

AB  - Background: In order to support evidence-based policies for reduction of stigma, a better understanding of its components: ignorance (knowledge), prejudice (attitude) and discrimination (behaviour) is necessary. This study explores public perceptions and quantifies stigma for three chronic mental disorders: autism, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in France.
   Methods: Survey of 1000 adults selected from an established market research panel. The 21-item questionnaire explored knowledge, attitudes and behaviours toward each disorder.
   Results: Although 95% respondents recognized the names of each disorder fewer than 70% could report specific characteristics and only 33% considered that publically available information was adequate; most respondents identified the media as their main resource. Labeling of conditions in a negative way was frequent (61%) when referring to mental disorders in general, but fell significantly (18%) when linked to an individual with a disorder. Individuals with schizophrenia are assumed to be dangerous; 65% respondents would engage in social distancing from such an individual, versus 29% for bipolar disorders and 7% for autism (p < 0.001). In contrast to other disorders, discrimination against schizophrenia was only partly attenuated in those with familiarity with mental disorders (through personal or family illness).
   Conclusion: This first population-based survey in France shows that attitudes towards bipolar disorders and autism are less prejudicial than towards schizophrenia. However, most public attitudes and behaviours towards different disorders appear to be based on assumptions rather than knowledge or evidence suggesting a generic information or anti-stigma programme is unlikely to be effective.

AB  - Automation is becoming ever more prevalent, with robot workers replacing many human employees. Many perspectives have examined the economic impact of a robot workforce, but here we consider its social impact: How will the rise of robot workers affect intergroup relations? Whereas some past research has suggested that more robots will lead to more intergroup prejudice, we suggest that robots could also reduce prejudice by highlighting commonalities between all humans. As robot workers become more salient, intergroup differences-including racial and religious differences-may seem less important, fostering a perception of common human identity (i.e., panhumanism). Six studies (Sigma N = 3,312) support this hypothesis. Anxiety about the rising robot workforce predicts less anxiety about human outgroups (Study 1), and priming the salience of a robot workforce reduces prejudice toward outgroups (Study 2), makes people more accepting of outgroup members as leaders and family members (Study 3), and increases wage equality across ingroup and outgroup members in an economic simulation (Study 4). This effect is mediated by panhumanism (Studies 5- 6), suggesting that the perception of a common human ingroup explains why robot salience reduces prejudice. We discuss why automation may sometimes exacerbate intergroup tensions and other times reduce them.
   Public Significance Statement
   This article explores how the rise of robot workers will shape social relations. Across six studies, we found that awareness of robot workers reduces prejudice and discrimination because it leads people to perceive more commonality with other human groups.

AB  - Background: Probiotics have numerous health benefits to the digestive system, one of them being clinically able to prevent and treat diarrhea. The growing scientific evidence of probiotic benefits has led to increased production of probiotic products. Health science students, as future healthcare professionals (HCPs), should have more knowledge about probiotics to be able to give the right recommendation to their future patients and the larger community. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice towards probiotics of health science students in Universitas Padjadjaran, Indonesia.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted on 87 students from Medical Studies, Midwifery, Pharmacy, and Nursing majors in 2020. Proportional cluster random sampling was used to select the study subjects, and an online survey was used to collect the data. Final data were exported to statistics software for analysis. Scores of each variable were categorized. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to analyze the statistical differences among the four groups. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze the relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice variables.
   Results: Of all respondents, 80% had adequate knowledge. More than half (52.9%) had a positive attitude, and most (62.1%) had a positive practice. There were significant correlations between knowledge-attitude and attitude-practice variables. Most respondents gained information on probiotics from the Internet (26%) and their lecturer (24%). P-value from Kruskal-Wallis test for knowledge, attitude, and practice are 0.466, 0.801, and 0.324, respectively.
   Conclusion: Most respondents had an adequate level of knowledge, a positive attitude, and a positive practice towards probiotics. Incorporating scientific evidence regarding probiotics from various studies into all health science majors' academic curricula and media may help equip the students with a better understanding of probiotics, therefore improving probiotics usage to prevent and treat digestive system diseases in the future.

AB  - This longitudinal, quasi-experimental field study investigated affective forecasting as a moderator of positive intergroup contact effects among adolescents. We also examined a novel mediating mechanism that underlies this effect, namely accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for intergroup contact. Three annual waves of survey data were used from 1,169 adolescents (M-age = 13.88 at Wave 1; 50% girls; 66% White British, 44% Asian British) whose schools were merged, in a unique intervention that resulted in one school where ethnic groups were evenly mixed (i.e., balanced school) and two White British majority schools (i.e., majority skewed schools). Results showed that positive intergroup contact and attitudes improved more in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. In all schools, change in adolescents' positive intergroup contact predicted change in positive intergroup attitudes indirectly via (a) increased accuracy of perceived outgroup willingness for contact and (b) reduced intergroup anxiety. Indirect effects via accuracy of perceived contact willingness were stronger for adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts than for other adolescents. These moderated mediation effects were stronger in the balanced school than in the majority skewed schools. Thus, more balanced ethnic mixing in schools seemed to directly enhance positive intergroup relations and attitudes for all adolescents, but to particularly benefit adolescents who made more negative affective forecasts about positive contact before the school merger.

AB  - In recent years psychosocial studies have given a growing attention to online intergroup contact in reducing prejudice. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of evidence on processes that could mediate this relation. The present study aimed to fill this gap. Focused on intergroup relationships between people with different sexual orientations, it examined whether and to what extent identity processes-i.e., sexual identity commitment and exploration-mediated the relationship between online intergroup contact and perception of mediated and vicarious sexual online discrimination on Facebook. Data was collected with a sample of 357 Facebook users (M-age = 26.07, SD = 8.37; females: 64.9%, males: 35.1%) who completed an online questionnaire. A full Structural Equation Modeling was tested. Results showed that: (a) Online contact was positively associated with perceived online sexual discrimination; (b) online contact was positively associated with identity exploration but not commitment; (c) exploration-but not commitment-was positively associated with perceived online sexual discrimination; (d) sexual identity exploration-but not commitment-mediated the relationship between online contact and perception of sexual discrimination, increasing the positive effect of contact on perceived discrimination. Limitations and directions for future research were discussed.

KW  - FIT INDEXES
AB  - Background In our proposed model, family members' perceptions of service quality in organisations improve communication about self-determination. In turn, family perceptions of communication openness have a positive relationship with self-determination attitudes of family members. Finally, these attitudes predict self-determination behaviours of individuals with intellectual disability, as reported by family members.
   Method We tested this model with a sample of 625 family members (196 using 'day care services' and 429 using 'occupational services').
   Results Multi-sample structural equation modelling (SEM) supported the model. Communication and attitudes fully mediated the link from service quality to self-determination behaviours.
   Conclusions Improving family members' perceptions of service quality and opening channels of communication between professionals and family members are useful strategies to facilitate parents' positive attitudes and increase the frequency of self-determination behaviours at home.

AB  - The implementation of environmental standards can be facilitated by motivating workers with pro-social preferences. Therefore, we study if employees working for firms achieving registration for environmentalrelated standards are more likely to display positive attitudes towards their job, to be actively involved in their jobs and to donate effort. Using a French matched employer-employee database, we find that these "green employees" report a significantly higher perception of usefulness and equitable recognition at work. Besides, they are more likely to work uncompensated overtime hours. Finally, if the adoption of environmental standards is shown to have no direct influence on job involvement, we expose how it indirectly impacts job involvement through the mediation of employees' reported perception of usefulness and equitable recognition at work.

AB  - Purpose. Screening rates for colorectal cancer (CRC) lag for low-income, minority populations, contributing to poorer survival rates. A model of storytelling as culture-centric health promotion was tested for promoting CRC screening.
   Design. A two-group parallel randomized controlled trial.
   Setting. Primary care, safety-net clinics.
   Subjects. Low-income patients due for CRC screening, ages 50 to 75 years, speaking English or Spanish.
   Intervention. Patients were exposed to either a video created from personal stories composited into a drama about "Papa'' receiving CRC screening, or an instrument estimating level of personal cancer risk. Patients received a health care provider referral for CRC screening and were followed up for 3 months to document adherence.
   Measures. Behavioral factors related to the narrative model (identification and engagement) and theory of planned behavior.
   Analysis. Main effects of the interventions on screening were tested, controlling for attrition factors, and demographic factor associations were assessed. Path analysis with model variables was used to test the direct effects and multiple mediator models.
   Results. Main effects on CRC screening (roughly half stool-based tests, half colonoscopy) did not indicate significant differences (37% and 42% screened for storytelling and risk-based messages, respectively; n = 539; 33.6% male; 62% Hispanic). Factors positively associated with CRC screening included being female, Hispanic, married or living with a partner, speaking Spanish, having a primary care provider, lower income, and no health insurance. Engagement, working through positive attitudes toward the behavior, predicted CRC screening.
   Conclusion. A storytelling and a personalized risk-tool intervention achieved similar levels of screening among unscreened/underscreened, low-income patients. Factors usually associated with lower rates of screening (e.g., no insurance, being Hispanic) were related to more adherence. Both interventions' engagement factor facilitated positive attitudes about CRC screening associated with behavior change.

AB  - Although the importance of nurses' service behaviors has been increasingly emphasized, few studies accounted for how organizational or individual antecedents affect nurses' psychological processes to implement service behaviors. Additionally, they mainly focused on the one side of role-prescribed service behavior and ignored the effect on extra-role service behavior. This study seeks to explore the relationship between ethical climate and nurses' service behaviors from a comparative view, of the role-prescribed and extra-role service behavior and examine the mediating effect of nurses' professional wellbeing (as characterized by positive attitudes toward work, specifically harmonious work passion and obsessive work passion). Survey data from 378 nurses in China indicate that nurses' harmonious work passion mediated the effects of ethical climate on both their role-prescribed and extra-role service behavior; however, obsessive work passion only mediated the effect of ethical climate on role-prescribed service behavior. Managerial implications and future research directions are discussed in this study.

AB  - Brand websites provide opportunities for levels of interactivity that increase the potential for innovative co creation between consumers and firms. However, little is known about predicting consumer interaction levels on brand websites in markets outside of North American and Europe. Adult consumers in the U.S., China, and South Korea responded to a survey measuring theory-based social and brand-based antecedents of brand website interaction frequency. In all countries, respondents who viewed brands as integral parts of self-concept also interacted more on brand websites. This relationship was mediated by consumers' strength of identification with brand websites as communities. Susceptibility to social normative influence and a positive attitude toward materialism were important predictors of consumer interactions in all countries. Overall, this study found stronger cross-national similarities than differences. Implications emphasize recommendations related to the potential challenge and value of increasing consumer interactions on brand websites in Western and East Asian markets.

AB  - This study explores knowledge about hereditary breast cancer, attitudes about BRCA testing and referral pattern to a family cancer clinic among medical specialists. A total of 92 questionnaires were completed by surgeons (38), medical oncologists (29), radiation oncologists (13) and radiologists (12). The response rate was 51%. A substantial (11-56%) proportion of medical specialists do not refer patients who meet current criteria for BRCA testing. Although questions on inheritance were less well answered, overall knowledge was good. They had a positive attitude, but were concerned about the distress DNA testing might cause to family members. The majority (75%) stated that the best time for referral is after adjuvant therapy or during follow-up, but another important determinant was the patient's wish or need (12%). Further studies are needed to gain insight into the actual referral process, while ongoing training of medical specialists about genetic aspects of breast cancer is also necessary.

AB  - We study the causal effect of school curricula on students' political attitudes, exploiting a major textbook reform in China between 2004 and 2010. The sharp, staggered introduction of the new curriculum across provinces allows us to identify its causal effects. We examine government documents articulating desired consequences of the reform and identify changes in textbooks reflecting these aims. A survey we conducted reveals that the reform was often successful in shaping attitudes, while evidence on behavior is mixed. Studying the new curriculum led to more positive views of China's governance, changed views on democracy, and increased skepticism toward free markets.

KW  - SETTINGS
AB  - Purpose To research whether the ability to earn continuing education (CE) credit for time spent teaching motivates radiologic science professionals to teach students in clinic and to assess whether sonographers, who earn CE credit for time teaching, have more positive attitudes toward teaching than those in modalities who do not earn CE credit for time spent teaching.
   Methods Researchers developed a 2-track digital survey and delivered it electronically and on paper to clinical instructors working at hospitals affiliated with Department of Medical Imaging and Radiation Sciences programs at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Responses were collected for 2 weeks and then compared quantitatively using chi-square tests and logistic regression models. Qualitative results were examined for themes, and proportions among themes were reported.
   Results A total of 239 people responded, with 166 responses coming from individuals working in radiography, radiation therapy, nuclear medicine, and medical dosimetry, and 73 responses from sonography. Receiving CE credit did not result in a difference in teaching attitudes (X-2 = 0.0004, DF = 1, P = .985). However, the non-CE credit-earning population showed a 12% increase in positive attitudes if allowed to earn CE credit in the future (95% CI; 0.08, 0.17).
   Discussion Student learning and performance in clinic directly are related to experiencing a positive learning environment. Factors other than CE credit appear to motivate instructors to teach students. Although the results of this study did not support the hypotheses, this study furthers the need to discuss whether offering CE credit for clinic instruction is something the profession should consider.
   Conclusion Clinical instructors who are willing to teach are the most desirable to students. Further evaluation of CE credit as an extrinsic motivating factor for clinical instructorship is important for providing the best positive learning environment for students.

AB  - The research examines politically entertaining media through a mass communication lens, applying the disposition theory of humor toward the study of political parody appreciation and the effects of exposure to varied humor types on political attitudes. The analyses rely on experimental data (N = 269) collected in 2013. The results of the first analysis suggest that the interaction of disposition and exposure to different types of humor significantly influences variation in political parody appreciation. The findings from the second analysis show that negative affect toward the opposing candidate, or the presumed victor of a humorous situation, can dampen attitudes toward the victim given exposure to critical humor. The strategic implications for campaigns looking to engage with humor are discussed.

AB  - Background: In developed countries, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver condition. The disease raises the risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality, as well as associated comorbidities. The general public's knowledge and attitude are critical in developing countermeasures to prevent the spread of the disease. Purpose: This study was done to determine the knowledge and attitude of the general public of Taif city, Saudi Arabia. Materials and Methods: A validated self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data for the study, which covered knowledge (04 items) and attitude (04 items) (7 items). In addition, demographic questions were included to see how they influenced knowledge and attitude. The data was examined using descriptive statistics in SPSS-IBM 25. Results: Out of 454 participants, more than 72% were female and 55% were in an age group of 18-30 years and only 11% had known NAFLD cases in their family. The number of participants who had family members with NAFLD had a significantly higher level of knowledge (P=0.012). The vast majority of those polled in this study had a favorable or satisfactory attitude toward NAFLD. The age group of 31-40 years showed a significantly (P=0.048) higher proportion of participants with a positive attitude when compared to other age groups. It is also important to note that females with a good knowledge and positive attitude toward NAFLD outnumber male participants. Conclusion: Generally, Taif residents have less knowledge of NAFLD, but their attitude is encouraging. The link between chronic illnesses and NAFLD remains poorly understood. It is critical to find mechanisms and ways to halt the disease's rapid progression in the community.

AB  - After a violent conflict many post-conflict communities remain ethnically divided and normalization of the inter-group relations is hindered not only by in-group norms and interpretation of past events, but also by collective guilt. Although collective guilt has proved to be an important indicator of post-conflict social repair, more research is needed to define its predictors. This study, conducted in an ethnically divided community, confirmed that collective guilt acceptance and collective guilt assignment in our sample are typical for the post-conflict pattern of intergroup relations people readily assign guilt to the outgroup but are unwilling to accept the guilt of their in-group. This suggests that the process of community social reconstruction has not considerably progressed. Our findings also suggest that the two aspects of collective guilt assignment and acceptance are predicted by similar sets of variables. Both collective guilt assignment and collective guilt acceptance are influenced by identification with in-group which influence is fully or partially mediated with the justification of the in-group's wrongdoings. This indicates that in the post-conflict setting relationship towards the in-group may be more important for experiencing collective guilt than the relationship towards the out-group. Relationship towards out-group, although not crucial, also plays a role in experiencing collective guilt. Specifically, both affect towards and cognitions about out-group members predict collective guilt assignment (with cognition being stronger predictor than positive affect), whereas only (absence of) positive affect predicts acceptance of collective guilt and the cognitive aspect is not predictive.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze which components of the social learning theory are associated with adolescents' engagement in sexting among a sample of 357 respondents. Additionally, we distinguish between two types of online sexual self,disclosure: sexting within and outside of a romantic relationship. The results indicate that the extent to which adolescents hold positive attitudes towards the behavior and the extent to which they perceive that their peers approve of sexting, are associated with their engagement in sexting both within and outside of a romantic relationship, when controlling for age, gender, school track and internet use. Sexting outside of a romantic relationship was also influenced by the thrill that young people get out of engaging in this behavior. The discussion addresses the implications of these findings for prevention programs, practice and future research, such as the necessity for future studies to ask with whom participants have engaged in sexting.

AB  - Objectives We aimed to assess social patterns of handwashing, social distancing, and working from home at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada, and determine what proportions of the overall prevalence and social inequalities in handwashing and social distancing are related to inequalities in the opportunity to work from home, to guide pandemic preparedness and response. Methods Using cross-sectional data from the Canadian Perspectives Survey Series, collected between March 29 and April 3, 2020, among Canadian adults (N=4455), we assessed prevalence of not working from home, social distancing in public, or practicing frequent handwashing, according to age, sex, marital status, immigration, education, chronic disease presence, and source of COVID-19 information. Multivariate regression, population attributable fraction estimation, and generalized product mediation analysis were applied. Results Absence of frequent handwashing and distancing was more common among those working outside than within the home (prevalence differences of 7% (95% CI: 4, 10) and 7% (95% CI: 3, 10), respectively). Inequalities in handwashing and distancing were observed across education and immigration status. Over 40% of the prevalence of non-uptake of handwashing and distancing was attributable to populations not being able to work from home. If all worked from home, over 40% (95% CI: 8, 70) of education-based inequalities in handwashing and distancing could be eliminated, but differences by immigration status would likely remain. Conclusion For pandemic response, both workplace safety initiatives and mechanisms to address the inequitable distribution of health risks across socio-economic groups are needed to reduce broader inequalities in transmission risk.

AB  - This paper provides an up-to-date overview of the current role of English among Spanish young students. To that end, an analysis of three important issues has been carried out. First, this research focuses on the different opportunities of the students to be in contact with English outside the classroom. Secondly, the attitudes of the participants have been examined using three different indicators; students' likeability, the importance of English, and the advantages for them of knowing English. Thirdly, the participants have self-assessed their level of proficiency in English in the four different skills. The outcomes reveal that young participants have a limited contact with English, and it is basically through music, radio, books, computers and television. As regards the students' attitudes towards English, the results prove the positive attitude of the respondents. Finally, the participants' self-assessment of their proficiency in English is positive, though some questions that require a reflection are included in the discussion.

AB  - Research problem: Subgroup formation in global virtual teams could negatively impact team performance due to difficulties in coordination, trust, and team cohesion. Research questions: What role do trust and team cohesion play in the relationship between coordination effectiveness and team performance of global virtual teams with two distinct subgroups? Literature review: Prior research suggests that coordination effectiveness on team performance is most strongly impacted by coordination of knowledge. This effectiveness is mediated by trust and team cohesion. However, we have a poor understanding of trust and team cohesion dynamics on intergroup relationships in global virtual teams. Methodology: A survey was conducted with 14 teams with a total of 112 participants in the US and India. The teams were tasked with evaluating customer-relationship-management best practices for a global environment. Results and discussion: We evaluated how the process of effective coordination for teams composed of two colocated subgroups is mediated by individual perceptions of out-group trust and overall team cohesion. Our findings show that individual trust and team cohesion share a reciprocal impact on each other, suggesting that effective coordination in virtual teams can create a positive feedback loop with trust and cohesion, improving overall project performance. Implications for theory and practice include the virtuous cycle that trust and cohesion create in global virtual team coordination and the necessity of establishing appropriate project coordination systems and processes to promote both aspects and, thus, achieve excellent project performance for colocated subgroups.

AB  - Covert forms of authoritarian control remain an understudied strategy of authoritarian survival. This article uses the infiltration of the Catholic Church with secret collaborators in communist Poland to study the drivers and consequences of such covert forms of control. We theorize that subnational variation in communist infiltration is driven by differences in organizational vulnerability following World War II. In turn, we argue that the uneven degree of infiltration with proregime agents shaped the subsequent effectiveness of the Church to foster anticommunist attitudes. We test these predictions against competing explanations (including imperial legacies and modernization) by analyzing seven Polish surveys from the late communist period (1985-89). Our results confirm the importance of organizational vulnerability in driving the success of communist infiltration efforts and suggest that infiltration with secret agents was effective in undermining the Church's ability to shape the political attitudes of frequent churchgoers.

AB  - Star ratings play major roles in informing consumer decisions on major e-commerce sites such as Amazon.com. When people evaluate political books, for example, they might gauge whether star rating favorability scores align with their pre-existing political attitudes. The attitudinal stance of these online cues could invariably trigger responses that worsen the affective divide between partisans. However, few studies have identified and explained the mechanisms underlying affective polarization. Using two online experiments, we examine the mechanisms through which ratings induce affective polarization. Findings support warranting theory by consistently showing that counter-attitudinal ratings indirectly drive up affective polarization by increasing positive inparty affect via perceived manipulation. By contrast, pro-attitudinal star ratings polarize by increasing positive in-party affect through perceived in-party prototypicality. These findings challenge assumptions that affective polarization is solely characterized by negative out-party affect, and driven mainly by exposure to counter-attitudinal information.

AB  - Background: Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) stigma (ie, negative attitudes toward PrEP users) has been widely documented and is considered a significant barrier to implementation. However, few studies have examined PrEP stigma using implicit measures designed to reduce demand characteristics in responding. This study examined implicit PrEP-and HIV-related stigma among gay and bisexual men using geospatial social networking applications (ie, "hookup apps").
   Methods: Participants were presented with 4 simulated online profiles (pretested for comparability) paired with each of the following characteristics: HIV negative, HIV positive, on PrEP, or substance user. Participants rated the profiles on attractiveness, desirability, trustworthiness, likelihood of condom use, and riskiness of sex.
   Results: There was no evidence of PrEP-related stigma, ie, participants did not rate profiles of PrEP users more negatively than profiles of HIV-negative individuals not disclosing PrEP use. However, profiles of HIV-positive individuals were rated significantly less attractive and desirable than HIV-negative or PrEP profiles. When the sample was split by history of PrEP use, negative ratings of HIV-positive profiles remained only among participants who had never taken PrEP. Participants with any history of PrEP use demonstrated no difference in ratings by HIV status.
   Conclusion: These data provide the first empirical evidence for lower HIV stigma among PrEP users. Individuals who have used PrEP may "see" HIV-positive individuals differently than those without a history of PrEP use. The lack of evidence for PrEP-related stigma is encouraging and suggests that negative stereotypes about PrEP users may not extend to negative implicit judgments about them on social networking sites.

AB  - This paper investigates the antecedent factors of consumers' perceived values and attitudes towards digital signage advertising in a structural model. The results of this study revealed that four key antecedents (i.e. informativeness, involvement, entertainment and targeting) affect consumers' attention to digital signage advertising and perception of advertising values. This study shows that attitudes towards digital signage and perceived interactivity with it also affect consumers' attitudes towards digital signage advertising. This, in turn, influences positive attitudes towards a brand and higher purchase intentions.

AB  - The state of boredom presents a conundrum: When bored, we want to engage with an activity, but we don't want to engage with whatever is currently available. This conflict is exacerbated when external factors impose restrictions on the range of behaviors we can engage in, which is precisely the scenario we are currently facing, at a global level, during this period of social isolation in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected data from 924 North American participants (530 Male, Mean age = 37.7 years) using the internet-based Mturk platform to examine the relation between self-reports of boredom proneness (using the Short Boredom-Proneness Scale) and individual responses to questions about compliance with social-distancing requirements during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our sample replicated recent findings in boredom research, including a negative correlation between boredom proneness and self-control. We also provide novel evidence that highly boredom prone people have been more likely to break the rules of social isolation in a variety of ways (e.g., fewer hours spent in social isolation, poor adherence to social distancing as evidenced by increased likelihood of holding a social gathering and coming into proximity with more people than recommended). We further demonstrated that boredom proneness substantially mediates the association between self-control and rule-breaking. These results indicate that boredom proneness is a critical factor to consider when encouraging adherence to social isolation.

AB  - Children with special educational needs often feel lonely in classrooms, are less accepted by their classmates and have fewer friendships. Their classmates' positive attitudes towards them are important for their social participation in inclusive classrooms. According to the theory of social referencing, children's attitudes towards peers with special educational needs are influenced by the role model behaviour of their parents. Therefore, we examined the relevance of children's perceptions of parental behaviour in terms of their attitudes towards peers with learning disabilities. This was done by investigating N = 753 children's attitudes, depending on their perceptions of parental behaviour towards peers with special educational needs, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs concerning their interpersonal skills. The results indicate that their attitudes are predicted by their perceptions of parental behaviour, their contact experiences and their self-efficacy beliefs. The effect of perceived parental behaviour on children's attitudes is mediated by their self-efficacy beliefs.

AB  - Although the news media both reflect and shape public opinion, little is known about how they actually portray public opinion in an integrated manner. A large-scale content analysis of Flemish print and television news, comparing routine and election periods, shows that journalists mostly refer to only one public opinion portrayal in a news item. When more than one public opinion portrayal is present, it is mostly casual inferences used in combination with other portrayals. Regarding the diversity of viewpoints, public opinion is typically represented in a highly one-sided manner and does not reflect nuances in citizen viewpoints.

AB  - The article first examines the contrast between popular remembering and the official presentation of Yugoslav socialist past in Slovenia. We examine the discursive patterns in political dignitaries' declarations and reconstruct popular remembering as it emerges from the existing research. We focus on theories that conceptualize positive popular attitudes towards socialist past with the notion of 'nostalgia'. Following the ways how researchers overcome the difficulties of the 'Yugonostalgia' approach, we note that they do not take into account the embeddedness of the positive achievements of socialism into the overall fabric of socialist system. According to our hypothesis, this omission induces the researchers to overestimate the present social and political impact of positive attitudes to socialist past. Furthermore, social struggles in which researchers are engaged seem to raise barriers to scientific practice. This study attempts to contribute to the project of Yugoslav memory studies.

AB  - In this paper, I trace social mechanisms for the development and continuation of citizens' trust in e-voting. My research focuses on the processes that give rise to trust-related behavior, and identifies mechanisms that explain trust in e-voting. I distinguish between initial formation and recurrent manifestation of trust, and propose models of causal processes to explain them. I frame the research on trust in e-voting as a case of political trust in the socio-technical entity of the electoral authorities and the e-voting system, and draw from general socio-technical theories and literature on trust to construct relevant concepts and relationships. Empirically, this theory-building exercise traces the process of the initial development of trust in e-voting in Brazil in the 1990s and the maintenance of this trust in the conduct of Brazilian elections since then. The social mechanisms of trust that I derive from this study are associated with the process of democratization and continuing care towards adjusting the e-voting system to serve legitimate objectives for the conduct of elections, the interdependence of citizens' perception of the trustworthiness of the technology system and the trustworthiness of the electoral authorities, and the fostering of a positive attitude towards IT by government policy.

AB  - Objective: This study provides insight into how electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) may affect the social normative environment for tobacco use among college students. Participants: Participants were 244 freshman and sophomore students. Methods: Students completed an online self-report survey in April 2011. Results: There is a higher acceptance rate of e-cigarette smoking in public than traditional tobacco. For intention to use an e-cigarette, the strongest predictor is current tobacco use, followed by a positive orientation toward public use of e-cigarettes. Positive orientation toward public use of e-cigarettes is significantly predicted by the use of alternate tobacco, intention to use or try e-cigarettes, positive orientation toward public use of tobacco, positive attitude toward e-cigarettes, positive perception of social norms for use of e-cigarettes, and favorable orientation toward e-cigarettes as an innovation. Conclusions: These models suggest attitudinal, social normative, innovation, and behavioral factors may combine to bring the e-cigarette into wider use among college students.

KW  - community
KW  - service providers
AB  - Background: Slums in urban settings are fast expanding and unprecedented proportions of urbanites are now living in slums, with compromised provision of health services. Slum dwellers in urban settings often face multifaceted barriers to accessing available health services. There is a paucity of evidence on identifying barriers in vulnerable urban centers of Ethiopia. This study aims to explore the barriers to the use of health services in slum urban settings of Ethiopia.
   Methodology: A qualitative study using in-depth and key informant interviews was conducted in 13 selected John Snow, Inc. (JSI) program operational urban areas of Ethiopia. Data were collected flow community members, community opinion leaders, Urban Health Extension Professionals, and urban area health office iepresentatives. The interviews were transcribed by data collectors and analyzed using a thematic content analysis approach. Accordingly, individual-, community- and health facility-level barriers were key themes under which findings were categorized.
   Results: Findings revealed that barriers to health service use at the individual level include limited awareness about health problems, competing priorities and limited capacity to pay for services when referred. Institutional-level barriers include limited medical supplies, and a lack of passion, respect and positive attitudes on the part of health service providers. Barriers at community level include a lack of shared understanding of the problems, services and the community's established values in relation to the problems and services.
   Conclusions: The provision of (maternal) health services in slums in Ethiopia's urban settings is affected by different barriers that work in tandem. The improvement of health service provision in slum settings requires multiple interventions, including strengthening the health system's responsiveness to health care demand.

KW  - ANGLICISMS
AB  - In a 2016 article published in this journal (Roig-Marin, 2016), I argued that the coinage of cyber-blends reflects our blended digital/physical relationships in today's world. The current pandemic has put a halt to our everyday lives and all forms of physical contact, and so technologies and digital experiences now play a more conspicuous role than ever. We have gone online and got used to vocabulary whose usage prior to COVID-19 was very limited (e.g. quarantine and pandemic) or known to very few (coronavirus, super-spreader, or the abbreviations PPE 'personal protective equipment' or WFH 'working from home'), while coming to terms with the implications of others such as self-isolation, lockdown, or social distancing (which should be better called physical distancing as social closeness, albeit non-physically, is very much needed to get through these difficult times). Short pieces on coroneologisms have attested to the rise of many new lexical formations, mostly blends. According to Thorne (2020; also cited in CBC, 2020), more than 1,000 new words - both non-specialised and technical terminology - have been created during the current pandemic. Journalists and Twitter users are particularly prone to coin words displaying a high level of linguistic ingenuity; yet, the circulation of that lexis may be very limited. The present note overviews some of the most widely spread vocabulary related to our new COVID-19 reality, coming from the laity rather than from medical or scientific professionals. Alongside terms like social distancing and lockdown, less technical and more playful vocabulary has transcended linguistic boundaries. Particular attention will be paid to examples from European languages whose word-stocks share a common Latinate substratum, likewise central to scientific communication.

AB  - Firefighters are exposed to carcinogens such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) during fires and from their personal protective equipment (PPE). Recent research has shown that decontamination processes can reduce contamination on both gear and skin. While firefighter cultures that honor dirty gear are changing, little is known about current attitudes and behaviors toward decontamination in the fire service. Four hundred eighty-five firefighters from four departments completed surveys about their attitudes, beliefs, perceived norms, barriers, and behaviors toward post-fire decontamination processes. Overall, firefighters reported positive attitudes, beliefs, and perceived norms about decontamination, but showering after a fire was the only decontamination process that occurred regularly, with field decontamination, use of cleansing wipes, routine gear cleaning, and other behaviors all occurring less frequently. Firefighters reported time and concerns over wet gear as barriers to decontamination.

AB  - Following intergroup conflict, reconciliation efforts most often focus on relationships among people. Though human-centric approaches are valuable, we propose people's engagement in reconciliation is also related to their attitudes toward the broader natural world. With a sample of 233 undergraduate non-Indigenous Canadian students who completed an online survey, we investigated the relationships among connectedness to nature, animal-human continuity, moral expansiveness, and support for reconciliation. All variables correlated positively, though the correlation between animal-human continuity and support for reconciliation was not significant. As well, age positively and significantly correlated with connectedness to nature, whereas gender (coded 0 = male, 1 = female) positively and significantly correlated with animal-human continuity, moral expansiveness, and support for reconciliation. To better understand how connectedness to nature and animal-human continuity related to moral expansiveness and support for reconciliation, we conducted mediation analyses. Participants who felt more connected to nature had more positive attitudes toward reconciliation, because they were more morally expansive. A similar pattern emerged for animal-human continuity, though only for women. These findings imply that strengthening peoples' connection to nature or beliefs about how humans and other animals are similar, and consequently extending peoples' circles of moral concern, may increase support for reconciliation.

AB  - Mental health practitioners in many developing countries are faced with high job demands and a lack of institutional support. Given their high levels of work-related stress, it is important to identify mechanisms that help them to maintain psychological well-being and job satisfaction. Recent research has focused on the role that positive orientation (POS) may play in mediating the negative impact of stress on individual well-being. The present study investigated whether POS predicts mental health practitioners' perceived levels of stress, mental health and job satisfaction. If POS measures a person's tendency to take a positive attitude to life and their ability to cope with difficulties, a high POS could be linked to reduced levels of stress and increased levels of job satisfaction and well-being. This study examined associations between self-reported POS and psychological outcomes in a sample of 100 Malaysian mental health practitioners. The results showed that POS significantly predicted job satisfaction positively and mental health issues and perceived stress negatively, even when socio-demographic variables were controlled. Overall, we found a strong effect of POS on individual functioning across the sample of mental health practitioners. Our results have implications for improving practitioner wellbeing and job satisfaction.

AB  - Restorative justice provides an alternative to retributive justice by seeking to restore criminal offenders to be responsible members of the community. Often offenders will apologize (A) and offer to make restitution (R) for the damage done. Such offers might affect all parties present by promoting forgiveness (though that is not a stated goal of restorative justice), resolution of damages, and positive attitudes toward justice. We investigated Family Group Conferencing (FGC), which involves offender, victim, and supporters of each, in a mediated 30-minute dialogue. Namely, we organized role-play simulation meetings between "victims," "offenders," and the "mother" of each. There were 64 participants (16 groups of 4 participants). Each group role-played a mediated FGC that was video recorded. The offender had either to apologize and offer restitution (AR) or avoid both (No AR). Questionnaires assessed forgiveness (and other outcomes) from each of the four participants' perspectives. Coders coded behavior during the role-play. AR promoted forgiveness by all parties, but to different degrees. Coded "softness" of offender's behavior (i.e., nonverbal signs of remorse, contrition, and regret) affected victim's behaviors and ratings by women role-playing both mothers. The role-play simulation allowed some understanding of the inner working of FGCs relative to retrospective questionnaires.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual's behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.

AB  - Scholarly work has placed political discussion at the center of a healthier democracy. However, this might not always be the case considering the vast amount of different discussion attributes and their effects. This study extends existing research on the influence of different discussion attributes (cognitive elaboration, network size, exposure to disagreement, and online/offline discussion) on political attitude change. To do so, we introduce the concept of obstinate partisanship and explore different discussion attributes as its antecedents. Obstinate partisans remain loyal to their political party irrespective of its performance, just as staunch sports fans do with their team. Results from a survey conducted in three democracies show that discussion network size, discussion disagreement, and offline discussion are all negative predictors of obstinate partisanship. Conversely, online discussion fosters this negative orientation. We finally examine the moderating role of discussion disagreement and network size on some of these relationships.

AB  - (1) Background: The aim of the present study was to develop and validate the psychometric characteristics of a scale measuring nurses' experiences working with COVID-19 patients. (2) Methods: The participants were 180 Croatian nurses who worked in departments with COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 36.8 years (ranging from 20 to 48). Research was conducted from March to June 2020. For the purpose of constructing the scale, 10 statements were developed. Factor analysis was used to determine the factor structure and construct validity of the scale. (3) Results: The scale consisted of nine statements divided into a three-factor structure: factor I-stigmatization and mistrusting (four items), factor II-social distancing (four items), and factor III-fear of infection (two items). Cronbach alpha was calculated to confirm the reliability of the scale: factor I-alpha = 0.80, factor II-alpha = 0.76, and factor III-alpha = 0.70. (4) Conclusion: The nurses' pandemic-related experiences scale showed good psychometric properties and can be applied in future research as a standardized tool for measuring health care workers' experience during COVID-19 or other infectious crises.

AB  - The impact of public relations on emerging fields such as travel journalism has not gained much attention, despite the broadergrowth of lifestyle journalism, and its particular dependence on PR. This study reports the findings of a representative survey of Australian travel journalists, focusing on their views of PR. Results show that travel journalists are wary of PR, although they believe they can be relatively immune from its influence and see some PR activities as quite useful. Cluster analysis identifies three distinct groups based on their views of PR, which range from a positive attitude to strong criticism. Their backgrounds and differences are explored, pointing to gender, job status, and background in mainstream journalism as main determinants for differences. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the attitude of dentists and dental students in Brazil regarding the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) in oral radiology, and to evaluate the effect of an introductory AI lecture on their attitude.
   Methods: A questionnaire was prepared, comprising statements regarding the future role of AI in oral radiology and dentistry. A lecture of approx. 1 h was prepared, comprising the basic principles of AI and a non-exhaustive overview of AI research in medicine and dentistry. Participants filled in the questionnaire prior to the lecture. After the lecture, the questionnaire was repeated.
   Results: Throughout 7 sessions at 6 locations, 293 questionnaires were collected. The majority of participants were undergraduate dental students (57%). Prior to the lecture, there was a strong agreement regarding the various future roles and expected impact of AI in oral radiology. Approximately, one-third of participants was concerned about AI. After the lecture, agreement regarding the different roles of AI in oral radiology increased, overall excitement regarding AI increased, and concerns regarding the potential replacement of oral radiologists decreased.
   Conclusions: A generally positive attitude towards AI was found; an introductory lecture was beneficial towards this attitude and alleviated concerns regarding the effect of AI on the oral radiology profession. Given the unprecedented, ongoing revolution of AI-augmented radiology, it is pivotal to incorporate AI topics in dental training curricula.

AB  - CMC research presents emoticons as visual representations of writers' emotions. We argue that the emoticons in authentic workplace e-mails do not primarily indicate writers' emotions. Rather, they provide information about how an utterance is supposed to be interpreted. We show that emoticons function as contextualization cues, which serve to organize interpersonal relations in written interaction. They serve 3 communicative functions. First, when following signatures, emoticons function as markers of a positive attitude. Second, when following utterances that are intended to be interpreted as humorous, they are joke/irony markers. Third, they are hedges: when following expressive speech acts (such as thanks, greetings, etc.) they function as strengtheners and when following directives (such as requests, corrections, etc.) they function as softeners.

AB  - Introduction: with this fast-increasing pandemic in terms of morbidity and mortality, all mankind is at risk of infection unless they get vaccinated and all African countries shall incorporate COVID-19 vaccination in their health care programs as long as the world work cooperatively. The pandemic, as the World Health Organization (WHO) stated, could be mitigated when 70% of the population which is nearly 5.6 billion should be immunized and to achieve this objective, the willingness of the community to be vaccinated before vaccination is essential. Methods: institutional based cross-sectional study design was conducted from March 1st, 2021, up to 30th May, 2021, in South Gondar Province, North Central Ethiopia. A structured interviewer-administered pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect data. The collected data were entered into EPI data version 4.2 and then exported into SPSS window version 22. Bivariate and multivariate analysis was undertaken and information was presented by using simple frequency tables and pie charts. Results: the majority of the respondents who accepted the COVID-19 vaccine accounted for nearly 260 (65%, 95% CI: 60-69). Positive attitude (AOR 2.5, 95% CI: 1.30-11.20), good knowledge (AOR 13, 95% CI: 6-27), bachelor of sciences (B.Sc) and above educational level (AOR 2.70, 95% CI: 1.30-6), TV or radio as source of information (AOR 0.10, 95% CI: 0.04-0.30), social media as source of information (AOR 0.04, 95% Cl: 0.01-0.2), political leaders (AOR 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01- 0.90) were predictors of COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Conclusion: healthcare professionals (HCPs) with the decision (yes, sure) for COVID-19 vaccine uptake during data collection were found to be low as compared to other studies. Positive attitude, good knowledge, B.Sc, and above educational level were predictors enhancing COVID-19 vaccination uptake and TV or radio as a source of information, social media as a source of information and political leaders were factors decreasing COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Hence, it might be important to prioritize knowledge and attitude creation programs for HCPs and an alternative way of source of information and agents for the COVID-19 vaccine other than social media and religious leaders.

AB  - Background and purpose: The RAVES (Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group 08.03) randomised controlled trial (RCT), compares adjuvant radiotherapy with early salvage radiotherapy in men with high risk histopathological features at prostatectomy. The RAVES Decision Aid study evaluates the utility of a decision aid for men considering participation in the RAVES RCT. We report the RAVES Decision Aid study participants' attitudes and knowledge regarding RCTs, decision-making preferences and decisional-conflict.
   Materials and methods: Baseline questionnaires assessed knowledge and attitudes towards RCTs and RAVES RCT. Sociodemographic and clinical predictors of knowledge were examined. Involvement in decision-making and difficulties with the decision-making process were assessed using validated tools.
   Results: 127 men (median age = 63 years) were recruited through urologists (n = 91) and radiation oncologists (n = 36). Men preferred collaborative (35%) or semi-active (35%) decision-making roles. Most (>75%) felt the RAVES RCT was worthwhile and important with participation being wise. However, nearly half had high decisional-conflict regarding participation. Scores of objective knowledge regarding RCTs and RAVES RCT were low.
   Conclusions: Most men with high-risk histopathological features at prostatectomy desire active involvement in decision-making regarding further management. Despite positive attitudes towards RCTs and the RAVES RCT, there were gaps in knowledge and high decisional-conflict surrounding participation.

AB  - Recognizing an urgent need to understand the dynamics of the pandemic's severity, this longitudinal study is conducted to explore the evolution of complex relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown measures, and social distancing patterns in a diverse set of 86 countries. Collecting data from multiple sources, a structural equation modeling (SEM) technique is applied to understand the interdependencies between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables. Results show that lockdown and confinement measures are very effective to reduce human mobility at retail and recreation facilities, transit stations, and workplaces and encourage people to stay home and thereby control COVID-19 transmission at critical times. The study also found that national contexts rooted in socioeconomic and institutional factors influence social distancing patterns and severity of the pandemic, particularly with regard to the vulnerability of people, treatment costs, level of globalization, employment distribution, and degree of independence in society. Additionally, this study portrayed a mutual relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and human mobility. A higher number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths reduces human mobility and the countries with reduced personal mobility have experienced a deepening of the severity of the pandemic. However, the effect of mobility on pandemic severity is stronger than the effect of pandemic situations on mobility. Overall, the study displays considerable temporal changes in the relationships between independent variables, mediators, and dependent variables considering pandemic situations and lockdown regimes, which provides a critical knowledge base for future handling of pandemics. It has also accommodated some policy guidelines for the authority to control the transmission of COVID-19.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if social undermining as perceived by frontline employees significantly affects their emotional exhaustion and procrastination behavior and to clarify the moderating role of positive psychological capital. A total of 310 deluxe hotel employees in South Korea participated in this study by completing a self-administered questionnaire. The study results showed that social undermining perceived by deluxe hotel employees positively influenced their emotional exhaustion. In addition, when emotional exhaustion became severe, employees' procrastination behavior, which harmed their organizations, increased. Additionally, the findings suggest a mediating effect, thereby indicating that employees' procrastination behaviors may increase when they experience emotional exhaustion resulting from social undermining. When employees perform their jobs with a positive attitude in a work situation, the negative influence of social undermining and emotional exhaustion may be partially offset. Limitations and future research directions are also discussed.

AB  - This research examined the impact of sexual orientation on heterosexuals' judgment of parental competence. Using a vignette approach, Study 1 presented participants with a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual couple who desired to have a child, either as adoptive parents or, in an additional heterosexual target condition, as biological parents. Study 2 presented a lesbian, gay, or heterosexual parent couple; heterosexual targets were either adoptive parents, reflecting the LG target conditions, or biological parents. Contradicting Hypothesis 1, neither target sexual orientation nor way to parenthood (with the latter varied in the heterosexual target condition only) had an impact on parental competence attributions. Confirming Hypothesis 2, participants with personal contact with lesbian and gay (LG) people provided higher ratings of LG target parental competence, mediated by positive attitudes toward homosexuality. Importantly, this mediation did not occur in the heterosexual target condition, corroborating the specificity of the intergroup contact effect.

AB  - This study investigates the effect of phonetic fit between spokesperson name and product attributes on perceived source credibility, namely, spokesperson expertise, attractiveness and trustworthiness. We manipulate phonetic fit through a 2 (spokesperson name: front vs. back) x 2 (product attribute: crisp vs. smooth) factorial design whilst controlling for spokesperson and product attractiveness. Results show that a phonetic fit between the name of the spokesperson and product attributes encourages positive perceptions of spokesperson credibility, irrespective of whether a spokesperson is visually presented in an advertisement. Finally, results demonstrate that phonetic fit (front (back) vowel spokesperson name with crisp (smooth) product attributes) can promote positive attitudes towards an advertisement and product, as well as purchase intention, with these relationships mediated by perceptions of spokesperson credibility. Findings from this research are able to aid advertisers and brand managers in the creation of effective and persuasive spokes/brand-characters.

AB  - Narratives can be used to persuade individuals to change their attitudes and behaviors, and can be especially effective is in changing attitudes toward individuals that are stigmatized or otherwise labeled as outgroup members. One feature that can influence a story's persuasive effectiveness is the story's point of view (POV). This study experimentally investigated the relative impacts of 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-person POVs on attitudes toward, and beliefs about, gay people. Results showed that participants who read the 3rd-person story had significantly more positive attitudes toward gay people than those who read the 1st-person story. In all cases, POV appeared to have no impact upon narrative transportation or identification.

AB  - Duringacrisis context such as the Covid-19 pandemic, the population's dependence on the media system to seek information and guidance increases, which can generate and/or increase political attitudes, such as support for the governmental administration of the crisis. In particular, the article seeks to determine if media dependence influenced the citizen evaluation of the management of the president and the subsecretary of Health during the pandemic in Mexico and if the level of political partisanship moderated this effect. A survey with a representative sample at national level (N = 1211) was carried out. Findings allow observing a moderating effect of partisanship on the relationship between dependency and the evaluation of pandemic administration, especially in the case of the subsecretary of Health. This suggests that the differentiated media coverage of both political actors contributed to modifying the citizen evaluation, especially among nonpartisans.

AB  - Objective:
   This study sought to investigate the impact of a service user-led anti-stigma and discrimination education programme, encompassing numerous interventions focused on facilitating multiple forms of social contact, the promotion of recovery, and respect for human rights, on medical student attitudes.
   Method:
   A comparison cohort study was used to compare the attitudes of two cohorts of medical students who received this programme as part of their fifth (the fifth-year cohort) or sixth (the sixth-year cohort) year psychological medical education attachment (programme cohorts) with two cohorts of equivalent students who received a standard psychological medical attachment (control cohorts). Attitudes to recovery (using the Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire) and stigma (using the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers) were measured at the beginning and end of the attachments for each year and compared both within and between the cohorts using Wilcoxon signed-rank or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests.
   Results:
   With sample sizes ranging from 46 to 70 across all cohorts, after their psychological medicine attachment both the programme and control cohorts showed more positive attitudes towards recovery and less stigmatising attitudes towards people with lived experience of mental distress. Significant differences between the programme cohorts and the control cohorts were found for recovery attitudes (median difference of 2, p < 0.05 in both fifth and sixth year), with particularly large differences being found for the 'recovery is possible and needs faith' subdomain of the Recovery Attitudes Questionnaire. There were no significant between cohort differences in terms of stigmatising attitudes as measured by the Opening Minds Scale for Healthcare Providers.
   Conclusion:
   The introduction of a comprehensive service user-led anti-stigma and education programme resulted in significant improvements in recovery attitudes compared to a control cohort. However, it was not found to be similarly superior in facilitating less stigmatising attitudes. Various possible reasons for this are discussed.

AB  - The efforts of peace-building and reconciliation between historical enemies are faced with many structural and psychological obstacles. Scholars have identified mechanisms that can induce improvements in psychological aspects of intergroup relations, such as intergroup contact. However, establishing direct contact with everyone is impossible. Therefore, the mass media represents an important source through which groups learn about each other. Numerous studies have shown that stereotypical and often negative portrayals of specific social groups through the media produce or reinforce negative intergroup outcomes. In this research, the authors report results from an experimental study conducted in a post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina (N=119). It examined the effects of stereotypical and counter-stereotypical representations of former enemy groups (Bosniaks) through the media on intergroup behavior (reported by Bosnian Serbs). More specifically, in this research the authors explored the effects of representing out-group individuals as immoral (the stereotypical condition) and moral (the counter-stereotypical condition) on specific behavioral tendencies toward the historical enemy group. The results indicate that exposure to primarily moral information about the out-group target facilitated important positive intergroup outcomes. This study extends the literature and research on moral exemplars by demonstrating the effects on relevant intergroup outcomes whilst utilizing current (vs. historical) moral exemplar stories.

AB  - Background: Numerous studies have produced social distance rankings to identify differences in the intensity of stigma associated with various general medical and mental health conditions. All of these studies, however, treat "mental illness" as a single homogeneous condition, when in reality different diagnoses of mental illness may elicit different levels of stigma.
   Aims of the Study: Within our samples, we aim to: (i) determine if there are significant differences in the intensity of stigma associated with different mental/behavior disorders; (ii) compare the intensity of stigma associated with mental/behavior disorders vs. physical/ sensory disorders; and (iii) analyze the effect of familiarity with a person who has a mental/behavior disorder on the stigma associated with that disorder.
   Methods: College students in the U.S. (n=213) and Republic of Korea (n=354) completed a survey of community attitudes toward persons with disabilities. Students were asked to rank 22 health conditions. including 10 mental/behavior disorders, according to the level of acceptance most usually accorded to persons with that condition in their society. Students also indicated, for each condition, whether they had close contact with a person who had that condition.
   Results: Students in both countries indicated a lower mean level of acceptance for the group of mental/behavior disorders than for the group of physical or sensory disorders. Nevertheless, there were significant differences in the acceptability of different types of mental/behavior disorders, with schizophrenia and substance use disorders eliciting the most negative attitudes in both samples. Familiarity is correlated with greater acceptance for most, but not all. mental/behavior disorders.
   Discussion: Mental illness-related stigma imposes costs on society in the form of productivity losses and increased rates of dependency. Reducing these costs requires an understanding of the negative stereotypes that are the source of stigma, and an appreciation of differences in the nature and intensity of stigma associated with different mental disorders. Limitations of the study include: lack of generalizability of the results; terminology which may have generated negative associations for some survey items; possibility of missing variables or data measured with error.
   Implications for Health Policies: The findings with respect to familiarity underscore the importance of inclusive policies to combat mental illness-related stigma. Anti-stigma policies must, however, account for differences in attitudes toward different diagnoses of mental illness. Strategies that may be effective in reducing stigma for some disorders may be counterproductive for others.
   Implications for Further Research: Many social distance studies rely on non-random samples, limiting generalizability of the results. Future research may be able to exploit web-based survey methods to obtain larger, more representative samples. Studies should include multiple diagnoses of mental/behavior disorders, instead of a single category of mental illness, and explore the ways in which familiarity affects intensity of stigma for different mental disorders.

AB  - In July 2021, breakthrough cases were reported in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, sparking concern and discussion about the vaccine's effectiveness and becoming a trending topic on Sina Weibo. In order to explore public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and their emotional orientations, we collected 1542 posts under the trending topic through data mining. We set up four categories of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, and used a big data analysis tool to code and manually checked the coding results to complete the content analysis. The results showed that 45.14% of the Weibo posts (n = 1542) supported the COVID-19 vaccine, 12.97% were neutral, and 7.26% were doubtful, which indicated that the public did not question the vaccine's effectiveness due to the breakthrough cases in Nanjing. There were 66.47% posts that reflected significant negative emotions. Among these, 50.44% of posts with negative emotions were directed towards the media, 25.07% towards the posting users, and 11.51% towards the public, which indicated that the negative emotions were not directed towards the COVID-19 vaccine. External sources outside the vaccine might cause vaccine hesitancy. Public opinions expressed in online media reflect the public's cognition and attitude towards vaccines and their core needs in terms of information. Therefore, online public opinion monitoring could be an essential way to understand the opinions and attitudes towards public health issues.

AB  - Americans are much more likely to be socially connected to copartisans, both in daily life and on social media. However, this observation does not necessarily mean that shared partisanship per se drives social tie formation, because partisanship is confounded with many other factors. Here, we test the causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in a field experiment on Twitter. We created bot accounts that self-identified as people who favored the Democratic or Republican party and that varied in the strength of that identification. We then randomly assigned 842 Twitter users to be followed by one of our accounts. Users were roughly three times more likely to reciprocally follow-back bots whose partisanship matched their own, and this was true regardless of the bot's strength of identification. Interestingly, there was no partisan asymmetry in this preferential follow-back behavior: Democrats and Republicans alike were much more likely to reciprocate follows from copartisans. These results demonstrate a strong causal effect of shared partisanship on the formation of social ties in an ecologically valid field setting and have important implications for political psychology, social media, and the politically polarized state of the American public.

AB  - Two studies are conducted to test how consumers respond differently in feeling nostalgic depending on age and gender. Study 1 uses narrative writing tasks to empirically test the effect of nostalgic versus nonnostalgic feelings on youthfulness by age and gender. To increase the external validity of our findings in Study 1, Study 2 replicates it using print ads. The results across the two studies consistently reveal a significant effect of nostalgia on feelings of youthfulness that differs by age and gender. Specifically, older women tend to feel less youthful than older men when nostalgic feelings are induced in both studies, whereas younger adults experience no gender difference. Results also show that these differences are explained by self-discontinuity between current and ideal body image. Furthermore, we identify that nostalgic feelings in advertising are effective because they generate positive feelings of youthfulness that in turn result in positive attitudes toward the ad.

AB  - e-Research is changing practices and dynamics in social research by the incorporation of advanced e-tools to process data and increase scientific collaboration. Previous research shows a positive attitude of investigators through e-Re search and shows a fast incorporation of e-Tools, in despite of many cultural resistances to the change. This paper examines the current state (attitudes, tools and practices) of e-Research in the field of Media and Communication Studies in Latin America, Spain and Portugal. A total of 316 researchers of the region answered an online survey during the last 2 months of 2011. Findings confirm an optimistic attitude through e-Research and an often use of e-Tools to do research. Even though, most of them informed to use basic e-Tools (e. g. e-mail, commercial videoconference, office software and social networks) instead of advanced technologies to process huge amount of data (e. g. Grid, simulation software and Internet2) or the incorporation to Virtual Research Communities. Some of the researchers said that they had an "intensive" (31%) and "often" (53%) use of e-Tools, but only 22% stated that their computer capacity was not enough to manage and process data. The paper evidences the gap between e-Research in Communications and e-Research in other disciplines; and makes recommendations for its implementation.

AB  - Background: Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) is a viral respiratory illness that was recently recognized in humans. Recently, the Ministry of Health in Saudi Arabia reported a substantial increase in MERS cases, primarily from the Riyadh region. The objective of the present study was to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices towards MERS among physicians, nurses, pharmacist and technicians individually.
   Methods: A cross sectional study conducted at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia among individual healthcare workers. The survey questionnaire was self-administrated and consisted of five sections: Demographic; Source of MERS information; Knowledge; Attitude; and Practice of healthcare workers towards MERS.
   Results: A total of 391 participants of which physicians (162; 41.4%), pharmacists (18; 4.6%), nurses (130; 33.3%) and technicians (81; 20.7%) were included with a response rate of 95.71%. The majority of the participants were female (53.70%) and mostly in the nurse's category (40.5%). The participants reported the highest main source of information was seminars and workshops (n = 191; 48%) followed by social media (n = 179; 45%). The overall score indicates good knowledge among physicians (95.7%), pharmacists (88.9%), nurses (86.2%) and technicians (91.4%) and showed statistically significant (p = 0.039). The study showed a positive attitude among physicians (96.3%), pharmacist (94.4%), nurses (94.6%) and technicians (90.1%) with no statistically significant (p = 0.273). However, the majority of the participants showed average practices towards MERS. However, the least practice among participants was the use of facemask in the crowds (24.2%). The demographic characteristic's age, gender and professions showed significantly associated with mean knowledge score. Similarly, statistical significance observed in gender and experience demographic variables with a mean attitude score.
   Conclusions: The study concludes that different health workers showed good knowledge and positive attitudes, but low to average practices towards MERS with low adherence to facemask practice. When comparing workers, physicians have a high degree of knowledge and attitude when compared to nurses, pharmacist and technicians. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Over the past decade, India has invested significant resources in public diplomacy, using traditional and new approaches to build and leverage its soft power. This article examines the reasons for this investment, the various forms of public diplomacy India and the effectiveness of its efforts to shape public,opinion. It finds that Indian investment in public diplomacy is partly a response to concerns about the perceived growth of Chinese soft power and partly a function of changed beliefs in the foreign policy-making elite about the uses of new social media. It also finds that India's new public diplomacy seems to have met with some-albeit patchy-success in augmenting its soft power.

AB  - This research aims to examine transprejudice in the Turkish cultural context and identify its socio-political and morality-based correlates. To that end, we report two studies. In Study 1, we manipulate the gender identity of a hypothetical victim in a violent criminal scenario. We find that people (N = 116) put greater social distance towards a transwoman compared to a ciswoman victim, yet do not distinguish between the two in terms of responsibility attributions. In Study 2 (N = 175), we explore the socio-political and moral underpinnings of transprejudice by focusing on the role of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) in different forms of transprejudice through the mediating functionof moral foundations. RWA predicts greater social distance and less positive affect towards transwomen through the purity foundation; while SDO predicts lower positive affect through the care foundation. The findings show that transprejudice does exist to some extent and that RWA seems to be a potent socio-political predictor of transprejudice in Turkey. The moral foundations, on the other hand, do not seem to play the mediator role that has been shown for other prejudice domains and different cultural contexts.

AB  - Background: Social network sites (SNSs) are widely exploited in health education and communication by the general public, including patients with various conditions. Nevertheless, there is an absence of evidence evaluating SNSs in connecting health professionals for professional purposes.
   Objective: This pilot randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the feasibility of an intervention aiming to investigate the effects of a continuous professional education program utilizing Facebook to obtain knowledge on dementia and care for patients with dementia.
   Methods: Eighty health professionals from Hong Kong were recruited for participation in the study and randomized at a 1:1 ratio by a block randomization method to the intervention group (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention was an 8-week educational program developed to deliver updated knowledge on dementia care from a multidisciplinary perspective, either by Facebook (intervention group) or by email (control group) from October 2018 to January 2019. The primary outcomes were the effects of the intervention, measured by differences in the means of changes in pre- and postintervention scores of knowledge assessments from the 25-item Dementia Knowledge Assessment Scale (DKAS) and formative evaluation of 20 multiple choice questions. Other outcome measurements included participant compliance, participant engagement in Facebook, satisfaction, and self-perceived uses of Facebook for continuing professional education programs.
   Results: Significantly more intervention group participants (n=35) completed the study than the control group (n=25) (P<.001). The overall retention rate was 75% (60/80). The mean of changes in scores in the intervention group were significant in all assessments (P<.001). A significant difference in the mean of changes in scores between the two groups was identified in the DKAS subscale Communication and Behavior (95% CI 0.4-3.3, P=.02). There was no significant difference in the total DKAS scores, scores of other DKAS subscales, and multiple choice questions. Participant compliance was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group (P<.001). The mean numbers of participants accessing the learning materials were 31.5 (SD 3.9) and 17.6 (SD 5.2) in the intervention and control group, respectively. Polls attracted the highest level of participant engagement, followed by videos. Intervention group participants scored significantly higher in favoring the use of Facebook for the continuing education program (P=.03). Overall, participants were satisfied with the interventions (mean score 4 of a total of 5, SD 0.6).
   Conclusions: The significantly higher retention rate, together with the high levels of participant compliance and engagement, demonstrate that Facebook is a promising tool for professional education. Education delivered through Facebook was significantly more effective at improving participants' knowledge of how people with dementia communicate and behave. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward utilizing Facebook for professional learning. These findings provide evidence for the feasibility of using Facebook as an intervention delivery tool in a manner that can be rolled out into practical settings.

AB  - Background: Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a global pandemic. Healthcare workers' (HCWs) role in patient management is predisposing and can serve as means of hospitals and community transmission. This study evaluated HCWs' knowledge, attitude, and practice towards COVID-19 in Nigeria.
   Methods: we carried out a cross-sectional survey among HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak in Nigeria from March to June 2020. The study assessed 346 HCWs for Knowledge, attitude, and practice by using an online (Google form) self-administered questionnaire, based on a convinience sampling technique Data were retrieved and analyzed using descriptive statistics. Chi-Square and one-way ANOVA were used to measure association and difference among demographic variables. The relationship between knowledge, attitude, and practice was measured using Spearman's rho correlation test.
   Results: the mean knowledge score of the HCWs was 7.1 on a scale of 0-8. The correct overall rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 88.75%. Knowledge was gained mainly from television (35.0%) and social media (35.0%). The mean attitude score on a scale of 0-6 was 5.31 +/- 0.39. Most (92.5%) participants were confident that Nigerian medical scientists would win the war against COVID-19. The majority (92.2%) of the respondents thought that SARS-CoV-2 was not a biological weapon. About 1 out of 5 respondents held that faith healing or prayer is the only cure for COVID-19. A vast majority of the HCWs were taking precautionary measures such as avoiding crowded places (94.2%), washing of hands (96.0%), and the use of personal protective equipment (91.6%) against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Nevertheless, only 3 out of 5 HCWs used a face mask when leaving home. There was a significant (p = 0.046) positive correlation (0.584) between knowledge and attitude.
   Conclusion: our results showed that HCWs in Nigeria had excellent knowledge and possessed a positive attitude and good practice towards COVID-19. However; there were areas where poor knowledge, negative attitudes and unacceptable practices were observed. We recommend continuous public health education of HCWs on SARS-COV-2 infection control and prevention.

AB  - Background: Some 80% of the South African (SA) middle class consumers use washing machines, electric cookers, fridges, freezers and other appliances. Considering the growing water and electricity shortages in SA, the government advocates the use of green appliances. However, the factors helping or hindering the positive attitudes, purchase and use of green appliances need examination.
   Focus of the article: This study focuses on the first and second steps of the community-based social marketing (CBSM) framework, whereby for behavioral change, behaviors, their drivers and barriers are to be examined before strategy formulation. Thus, this study first assessed SA black middle class consumers' green appliances attitude, behavioral intention and actual behavior. It then integrated the Theory of Consumption Values (TCV), Diffusion of Innovations Theory (DOI), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to examine the consumer-related and product-related factors helping or hindering the green appliances attitudes, behavioral intentions and actual behavior.
   Research Hypotheses: From the integration of the TCV, DOI and TPB, a conceptual model was developed that proposed that consumer-related factors (functional, conditional, epistemic, emotional and social values) and product-related factors (relative advantage, complexity, compatibility and observability) will influence green appliances attitude, which with perceived behavioral control will impact behavioral intention, proposed as a driver of actual behavior.
   Methods: Considering that the black middle-class are a fast growing and large (about 4.2 million South Africans) community of consumers, cross-sectional quantitative data was collected from 500 black middle class consumers through self-administered questionnaires. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling was used to test 14 hypotheses.
   Results: The respondents expressed positive attitudes toward green appliances (M = 5.80 on a 7-point Likert scale and positive intention to buy green appliances (M = 5.78). Most of the study participants have purchased one or more green appliances (M = 6.09). The integrated model explained 84.5% of attitude toward green appliances. The significant drivers of attitude were functional, conditional, and epistemic values (consumer-related factors), and relative advantage, compatibility, and observability (product-related factors). The attitude, social value and perceived behavioral control explained 83.1% of behavioral intention, which with PBC explained 24.2% of actual behavior.
   Recommendations for practice: Considering that the third step of the CBSM framework is to develop strategies for behavioral change, the South-African government, environmental agencies and social marketers should seek ways to reward the large segment of black middle class consumers, so that their positive green appliances attitudes and behavioral intentions can further be converted to actual purchase. The consumer-related and product-related drivers of attitudes and purchase behaviors identified in this study should be used to position and promote green appliances using the middle class consumers as opinion leaders or endorsers.
   Limitations: The main limitation is the use of a survey which limits provision of deeper insights into drivers and barriers of green appliances attitudes and behaviors.

AB  - Background: Social distancing is an effective preventative policy for the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that is enforced by governments worldwide. However, significant variations are observed in following the policy across individuals and countries. Arguably, differences in citizens' adherence actions will be influenced by their perceptions about government's plans and the information available to guide their behaviors-more so in the digital age in the realm of mass influence of social media on citizens. Insights into the underlying factors and dynamics involved with citizens' adherence process will inform the policy makers to follow appropriate communication and messaging approaches to influence citizens' willingness to adhere to the recommendations.
   Objective: The aim of this study is a comparative evaluation of citizens' adherence process to COVID-19-relevant recommendations by the government. The focus is on how three different countries' (United States, Kuwait, and South Korea) citizens, randomly sampled, respond to governments'pandemic guidance efforts. We draw insights into two categories of perceived government roles in managing the pandemic: (1) citizens' perceptions of government's role in responding to the pandemic and (2) citizens' perceptions of government's business reopening efforts. Undoubtedly, the internet and social media have burgeoned, with differing effects on shaping individuals' views and assessments of the COVID-19 situation; we argue and test for the effects of information sources, social media use, and knowledge on the adherence actions.
   Methods: We randomly sampled web-based survey data collected by a global firm in May 2020 from citizens of the United States, Kuwait, and South Korea. A nonlinear ordered probit regression, controlling for several counterfactuals, was used for analysis. The focal estimated effects of the study were compared across countries using the weighted distance between the parameter estimates.
   Results: The total sample size was 482 respondents, of which 207 (43%) lived in the United States, 181 (38%) lived in Kuwait, and 94 (20%) lived in South Korea. The ordered probit estimation results suggest that overall, perception of government response efforts positively influenced self-adherence (P<.001) and others'adherence (P<.001) to social distancing and sheltering. Perception of government business reopening efforts positively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). A higher intensity of general health information source for COVID-19 had a positive effect on self-adherence (P=.003). A higher intensity of social media source use for COVID-19 positively influenced others' adherence (P=.002). A higher intensity of knowledge on COVID-19 positively influenced self-adherence (P=.008) and negatively influenced others' adherence (P<.001). There were country-level variations-broadly, the United States and Kuwait had better effects than South Korea.
   Conclusions: As the COVID-19 global pandemic continues to grow and governmental restrictions are ongoing, it is critical to understand people's frustration to reduce panic and promote social distancing to facilitate the control of the pandemic. This study finds that the government plays a central role in terms of adherence to restrictions. Governments need to enhance their efforts on publicizing information on the pandemic, as well as employ strategies for improved communication management to citizens through social media as well as mainstream information sources.

AB  - September 11th was a turning point in the understanding of terrorism and radicalization. The Internet has provided an instrumental change regarding how terrorists communicate and spread their propaganda, proving a cause of concern for counterterrorism units. The increased use of social networking platforms has provided a significant change in the process of self-radicalization, with younger generations at greater risk. The aim of the project was to study the relationship between social media and self-radicalization among college and university students. A sample of 499 participants was recruited throughout Amazon Mechanical Turk and social media platforms. Measures on emotional intelligence, psychological involvement on social media, attitudes toward terrorism, and political violence, and loneliness were gathered. Results showed that individuals holding a university degree-especially young men-were more at risk of endorzing positive attitudes toward political violence and terrorism, and, therefore, more at risk of being radicalized.

AB  - In this article, we use newly available data from the Relationship Dynamics and Social Life (RDSL) study to compare a wide range of attitudes related to pregnancy for 961 black and white young women. We also investigate the extent to which race differences are mediated by, or net of, family background, childhood socioeconomic status (SES), adolescent experiences related to pregnancy, and current SES. Compared with white women, black women generally have less positive attitudes toward young nonmarital sex, contraception, and childbearing, and have less desire for sex in the upcoming year. This is largely because black women are more religious than white women and partly because they are more socioeconomically disadvantaged in young adulthood. However, in spite of these less positive attitudes, black women are more likely to expect sex without contraception in the next year and to expect more positive consequences if they were to become pregnant, relative to white women. This is largely because, relative to white women, black women had higher rates of sex without contraception in adolescence and partly because they are more likely to have grown up with a single parent. It is unclear whether attitudes toward contraception and pregnancy preceded or are a consequence of adolescent sex without contraception. Some race differences remain unexplained; net of all potential mediators in our models, black women have less desire for sex in the upcoming year, but they are less willing to refuse to have sex with a partner if they think it would make him angry and they expect more positive personal consequences of a pregnancy, relative to white women. In spite of these differences, black women's desires to achieve and to prevent pregnancy are very similar to white women's desires.

AB  - How can we explain the persuasiveness of populist messages, and who are most susceptible to their effects? These questions remain largely unanswered in extant research. This study argues that populist messages are characterized by assigning blame to elites in an emotionalized way. As previous research pointed at the guiding influence of blame attributions and emotions on political attitudes, these message characteristics may explain populism's persuasiveness. An experiment using a national sample (N = 721) was conducted to provide insights into the effects of and mechanisms underlying populist blame attribution with regard to the European and national levels of governance. The results show that emotionalized blame attributions influence both blame perceptions and populist attitudes. Identity attachment moderates these effects: Emotionalized blame attributions have the strongest effects for citizens with weaker identity attachments. These insights allow us to understand how populist messages affect which citizens.

AB  - Background: We investigated and compared practices and attitudes about childhood vaccination between young parents and their parents and identified influences and sources of information in the County of Zadar, Croatia. Methods: This research was conducted in six general practice and paediatric medical clinics. It included 300 volunteers, including 150 younger parents and 150 older grandparents. Information was collected with a survey questionnaire. The survey data were statistically processed. Results: The 300 participants were divided into 2 groups. Most of the respondents were married, employed, had a high school education, and had a good economic status, often with two children and living in the city. Generally, the attitude towards vaccination was positive. Healthcare workers made the most important influence on the decision for vaccination. The younger age group was significantly affected by social networks and the internet and wanted more information. They were afraid of the adjuvants in vaccines. The older respondents held that vaccination must be legally regulated and did not believe the anti-vaccine media headlines. Conclusions: Our respondents had positive attitudes towards childhood vaccination, noticed the benefits of vaccinating children, and held that untreated children represent a risk for the community. They were well informed and satisfied with the collaboration with medical professionals, although the media and social networks had some impact on attitudes.

AB  - The overload of news in today's digital information environment can lead to biased media exposure on the individual level-for example, based on the confirmation of preexisting attitudes, attractiveness of negative news, and familiarity with sources. To better understand such news patterns and to whom these selection biases apply, this study identifies different classes of (biased) news audiences and explores several antecedents. A survey in the U.S. and UK presented respondents with multiple vignettes in the form of political news headlines that were altered to reflect (1) confirmation bias, (2) negativity bias, and (3) source bias. Respondents' likelihood of selecting these biased news items was used to classify individuals into audience profiles. The results of a latent profile analysis provide three distinct and theoretically meaningful classes of news audiences that vary in terms of selection biases: avoiders, confirmers, and informers. As an important contribution, we show how these profiles are driven by the political attitudes and news preferences of audiences.

AB  - COVID-19 is a threat to everyone's health but can be especially devastating to older individuals. To prevent spread of the virus, social distancing has become the norm worldwide. However, with social distancing comes significantly less face-to-face interaction, which may be particularly harmful to older adults given their existing levels of loneliness. While social technologies can be used to provide critical social interaction during this time of necessary physical distancing, older adults tend to either lack access to these technologies or the skills and experience necessary to use them effectively. Once online, older adults face the additional challenge of being outsized targets of misinformation and scams, both of which abound in the context of COVID-19. In this essay, we discuss the challenges faced by older adults in their use of digital media for social connection in the present pandemic, as well as highlight some of the population's untapped strengths which can be leveraged to help them live prosperous online lives. Finally, we provide recommendations for actions which key stakeholders can take to support older adults in this pursuit.

AB  - In this article, we examine the ways in which media frames and rhetorical devices in the Chinese media shaped the representation of the genetically modified (GM) golden rice. We draw on a study of Chinese media representations of an experiment designed to test the efficacy of golden rice as a source of Vitamin A using school children in China's Hunan province as subjects. The study analysed Chinese web news stories about the Hunan experiment posted between 30 August 2012 (when Greenpeace first reported on the issue) and 30 October 2012. This experiment resulted in allegations of breaches in scientific protocols and created a hostile public reaction. The incident fuelled the long-standing debate about the risks and benefits of GM crops in China. In this article, we analyse 25 online news reports, examining the attitudinal orientation of the articles, the readers' comments on the articles and GM crops, the writing style and rhetorical devices employed, the emotions provoked and the frames manifest and embedded in these articles and comments. We found that although only one-third of the articles manifested an obviously negative attitude towards golden rice and GM foods, their use of strident metaphors and analogies were designed to arouse readers' fear and concerns about GM crops. In the anti-golden rice articles, we identified conspiracy frames, including the view that the West was using genetic engineering to establish global control over agriculture and that GM products were instruments for genocide. The pro-golden rice articles emphasised the scientific humanitarian progress, but it appears to be less attractive to the readers.

AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that genetic differences explain a sizeable fraction of the variance in political orientations, but little is known about the pathways through which genes might affect political preferences. In this article, we use a uniquely assembled dataset of almost 1,000 Swedish male twin pairs containing detailed information on cognitive ability and political attitudes in order to further examine the genetic and environmental causes of political orientations. Our study makes three distinct contributions to our understanding of the etiology of political orientations: (1) we report heritability estimates across different dimensions of political ideology; (2) we show that cognitive ability and political orientations are related; and (3) we provide evidence consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive ability mediates part of the genetic influence on political orientations. These findings provide important clues about the nature of the complex pathways from molecular genetic variation to political orientations.

AB  - Robots are starting to be developed for aged care populations and some of these have been made into commercial products that have been well received. However, little is known about the psychological factors that promote acceptance or rejection of robots by older people. Finding out more about these psychological determinants of robot uptake and acceptance is the primary focus of the study described in this paper. A healthcare robot feasibility study was conducted in a retirement village. Older people (n = 25) were invited to use a prototype robot with healthcare functions over a two week period. Questionnaires were completed before and after the period. It was found that residents who held significantly more positive attitudes towards robots, and perceived robot minds to have less agency (ability to do things) were more likely to use the robot. It was also found that attitudes towards robots improved over time in robot-users. Our results suggest that the cognitions older people hold about robots may influence their decisions to use robots. The study results also validate participants' subjective self-reports of attitudes towards robots and perceptions of robot mind, against the objective measure of robot use. Interventions to foster adaptive cognitions could be developed and applied in the design, deployment and marketing of robots to promote their use and acceptance.

AB  - Despite increasing awareness of stigma from mental health service providers as a barrier to recovery, little research has directly examined how it might influence the service users' self-perceptions and treatment experience. The present study examined the association of service users' perceived provider stigma with their experience of internalized stigma and disempowerment, two psychosocial constructs known to hinder recovery. Mental health service users (N = 350) completed questionnaires assessing perceived stigma from mental health service providers, including perceptions of negative affective reactions towards individual users and desired social distance towards people with mental illnesses across various life domains, internalized stigma, and disempowerment (i.e., diminished self-efficacy and mastery) in mental health treatment settings. Structural equation modeling showed that both perceived negative affective reactions and perceived social distance were positively associated with disempowerment. Furthermore, these associations were significantly mediated by internalized stigma. These findings illuminate how perceived stigma from providers can "get under the skin" of mental health service users and contribute to their overall sense of disempowerment in mental health settings. They also highlight the need for future stigma reduction interventions to specifically target the attitudes and beliefs held by mental health professionals.

AB  - The phenomenon of scandal(ization) has become omnipresent in contemporary political media discourses - at the latest since the 2016 US presidential election. Our article addresses causes and effects of this recent prevalence of scandal narratives. By connecting concepts from social systems theory and media theory, we consider crucial practices and processes of scandal construction in the 2016 US presidential election, focusing on the much-noticed emailgate and trumptape scandals. Both examples serve to illustrate how the emergence of partial public spheres in social media may lead to a fight for sovereignty over scandal discourse, political attitudes, and the negotiation of social norms, morals, and values.

AB  - This study, based on a representative online survey of 1080 US journalists conducted in 2013, analyses the demographic and organizational predictors of how journalists use social media and how they evaluate the impact of these media on their professional norms and values. The findings indicate that 9 of 10 US journalists regularly use social media in their work-but mainly to check on what other news organizations are doing and to look for breaking news events. The most frequent users of social media are younger journalists with higher incomes who work for television, radio, or online news organizations. The findings also indicate that journalists who hold more positive attitudes toward the use of social media in journalism, and those who think that social media are more important in their jobs, tend to be more supportive of the populist-mobilizer and the disseminator roles of journalism.

AB  - Purpose - Consumers increasingly depend on the internet as the information source to make their hospitality decisions, which highlights the need for more research in online recommendation. Due to the globalization, culture and its effects on marketing become an increasingly important subject to investigate. Therefore, this paper aims to offer a cross-cultural investigation of consumers' different trustworthiness and credibility perceptions when facing online recommendations from different information resources.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research uses the source-credibility theory to examine consumers' responses to online recommendations from two sources. Participants were recruited from two equivalent marketing panels in each culture. A 2 (online recommendation source: in-group vs out-group) by 2 (culture: American vs Chinese) between-subjects quasi-experiment was conducted to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - The results demonstrate that culture moderates consumer responses to the two types of online sources. Chinese consumers, due to their more collectivist nature, exhibit higher levels of purchase intent when the recommendation originates from an in-group rather than from an out-group. Such differences are not observed among the more individualist American consumers. Furthermore, trustworthiness plays an important role in influencing Chinese consumers' perception of recommendation credibility and the consequent purchase intent.
   Practical implications - This research provides guidelines to hospitality practitioners when developing their social networking sites and online marketing strategies across different cultures.
   Originality/value - The current study conducts an in-depth investigation of cultural differences in consumers' perceptions of and reactions to online recommendations from other customers with various social distances.

AB  - This study contributes to the still limited evidence on the effects of online intergroup contact. We conceptualize online contact as occurring through users' comments online, an easy and accessible venue for intergroup encounters. We test two forms of online contact: encountering an outgroup member directly (direct online contact) or through an ingroup member (extended online contact) and their effects on outgroup attitudes, here various forms of threat and social distance. We also examine the emotional mechanisms through which these effects emerge. We rely on an online experiment (N = 396) testing online contact with two distinct outgroups, an undocumented immigrant or a gay person. Compared to the control, direct online contact decreased perceived threat and social distance toward gays and lesbians, but not toward undocumented immigrants. Direct online contact improved attitudes toward both outgroups through positive and negative emotions, whereas extended online contact reduced negative emotions, improving attitudes towards undocumented immigrants. We discuss theoretical, methodological and practical implications of these findings. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using Social Cognitive Career Theory as a basic framework, this study explored hospitality students and recent graduates' attitude toward working in the industry, career seeking experiences, and factors influencing their career decisions during the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 22 participants from eleven universities located in ten states around the U.S. Over half of the participants continue to have positive attitudes to working in the industry, as long as the businesses follow proper health guidelines. Professors and social media become the major platforms to collect career information and connect with potential employers. For career decisions, job security, stable working hours and a source of income become the important factors they consider. The insights revealed by the current analysis will assist hospitality management programs' decision makers and career advisers to better prepare their graduates to succeed in their career during turbulent times.

AB  - Citizen science programs provide an opportunity for the public to reconnect with nature; however, pro-environmental values may not necessarily result in a high level of participation. This study assessed the values and attitudes toward ecology and conservation of 482 people, including 231 citizen scientists participating in two programs requiring either a 'complex' or 'simple' level of participation. Positive attitudes toward urban wildlife were positively associated with increased participation in citizen scientist programs; however, a pro-ecological attitude was not always associated with an increasing level of participation. Young adults were more likely to participate in the simple data submitting a program or via social media, while middle-aged and older adults from vegetated suburbs were more likely to participate in the complex data collecting multi-species focused program. These results have implications for strategic design and targeting of citizen science programs to maximize participation rates.

AB  - American politics scholars disagree on the extent to which voters use policy information to evaluate politicians versus relying on partisan cues to evaluate policies. We demonstrate the coexistence of both of these perspectives, by studying the degree to which objective facts (measured with local COVID-19 cases) and partisan cues (measured with President Trump's tweets about the virus) influence differences in the social distancing behaviors in Democrat and Republican counties in 2020. We find that both factors play an important role in social distancing but that the relative importance between cues and facts favors the latter. Furthermore, the importance of these signals declines over time, suggesting a crucial but underappreciated dynamic of how partisan positions evolve in a Bayesian framework.

AB  - Student academic performance and social competence are influenced positively by parent involvement; effective parent-teacher communication not builds parent reliance on a school, it enhances parent knowledge of raising children. As information technology develops rapidly, it is already a trend that e-communication is replacing traditional paper communication. Mobile phone messages could be a convenience tool to issue notices to parents and reduce conflicts due to negligence such as missing phone calls, forgotten alerts, etc. Therefore, this study investigates teacher behavior of adopting mobile phone messages as a parent-teacher communication medium by applying the TAM, C-TAM-TPB, and UTAUT models. The result posits that attitude should be treated as a mediator between perceived usefulness and behavior intention, even if the user perceives the new device is useful but does not hold a positive attitude toward the device. On the other hand, to most subjects, opinions from family and friends and expectations from superiors are important considerations when making decisions; those thoughts affect directly the intention to use the new system. The results also suggest that infrastructure maturity for mobile phone messaging improves intention to use, but actual use behavior relates to school policies, not teacher intention. To implement a messaging system successfully, authorities should provide inducements that not only attract teachers to use the system, but that foster positive attitudes toward the messaging system to further increase use intention.

AB  - In this article, we seek to observe how and why political TV series affect people's political opinions. The main hypothesis is that the degree of perceived realism people attach to fictional programs is a necessary condition for a series to change political attitudes.
   The study is based on an experiment in which some participants watched a political TV series with a negative tone (House of Cards), others watched a series with a positive tone (The West Wing), while a control group watched The Big Bang Theory, a non - political show. Results show that those who perceive House of Cards to be realistic became more cynical. There is also evidence of a decline in cynicism among participants who perceive The West Wing to be realistic.

AB  - Three studies investigated how politicized collective identification affects individuals' reactions towards others. We hypothesized that a strong politicized identity tends to be accompanied by a moral conviction about the politicized cause, which in turn determines how the politicized respond to those less committed to their cause. Consistent with this, Study 1 showed that politicized (feminist) identification is associated with lower identification with women who place moderate (vs. high) moral value on gender equality. Study 2 showed that politicized identification was associated with negative emotions towards people who disagree with this cause and this was mediated by the extent to which participants saw supporting the activist goal as morally obligatory. Study 3 showed that politicized identification, to the extent to which it implied holding a moral conviction about the activist cause, is associated with a desire for more social distance to an attitudinally dissimilar other, but not from an attitudinally similar other.

AB  - This paper investigates the role of crucial technological and social factors in enhancing or undermining vaccine coverage rates at the country level worldwide. Employing five country-level databases, it explores how different combinations of technology diffusion (that is, social media penetration) and social conditions (functional literacy and attitude toward science) affect the level of vaccine coverage. The analyses are based on two built ad-hoc longitudinal datasets of 36 and 40 countries worldwide, employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) approach. The findings highlight that, at the country level, the absence of high social media penetration, combined with an above-average level of functional literacy and positive attitude toward science, enable vaccine coverage to reach the level recommended by health institutions and authorities.

AB  - As environmental threats intensify rapidly across the globe, understanding how to promote public engagement in pro-environmental actions to address these threats is imperative. Contributing to the effort, we examined two influencers of pro-environmental attitudes and behaviors, psychological proximity and social ties influence, in the context of a recycling campaign through Facebook. We administered an online survey to a random sample of 434 U.S. Millennials. Results showed that psychological proximity (i.e. cognitive and emotional proximities) predicted positive attitudes toward recycling, intentions to like, share, and comment on posts of recycling-related social media campaigns, and to engage in recycling behaviors. The perceived influence of social ties (i.e. strong ties and weak ties) moderated the relationship between psychological proximity and attitudes toward recycling as well as offline recycling intentions. The results revealed that Millennials who perceive a stronger influence of their social ties, both strong and weak ties, rely less on their psychological proximity to determine their attitudes and offline behavioral intentions, indicating the critical influence of social ties. Theoretical and practical implications are suggested.

AB  - The understanding of the role of Cohesion Policy on the processes of European identity building is becoming more and more important in a period or resurgence of nationalisms and Euroscepticism. However, empirical evidence on this is still extremely scarce, due to both conceptual issues and data limitations. The present study tackles these limits and presents an empirical analysis of the way in which satisfaction with Cohesion Policy affected identification with Europe in EU regions between 2014 and 2017. Results show that this relationship is highly dependent on the intensity of funding spent, capturing the intensity of the European policy, and on the recent economic trend occurred at the regional level. This effect is boosted by a positive attitude towards EU institutions.

AB  - Societal organizations aim at challenging online extremist messages by counterposing with different narratives such as alternative narratives (one-sided narrative) and counter-narratives (two-sided narratives). The current study examined which type of narrative is more efficient in changing attitudes accounting for narrative involvement and reactance regarding the narrative. We employed a 2(one-sided vs. two-sided narrative) x 2 (ease of identification vs. no ease of identification) between-subjects design (N = 405) using a controversial topic: the ongoing debate about how to deal with the number of refugees in Germany. We found an indirect effect of the narrative on attitude change. People who read the two-sided narrative showed less reactance. The smaller the reactance, the more they felt involved in the narrative, which, in turn led to more positive attitudes towards refugees. We discuss these findings regarding their theoretical contribution to create customized narratives challenging extremist messages.

AB  - Although there is no consensus among educationalists as to the role schools play as drivers of hostilities in divided societies, there is broad agreement that they can facilitate more positive intergroup relations. In Northern Ireland the promotion of school based intergroup contact has been offered as a means through which this can happen. Until 2007, the approach was twofold, reflected on the one hand in short-term contact opportunities for pupils in predominantly Catholic and Protestant schools, and on the other, in support for integrated schools that educate Catholics and Protestants together. In 2007 the Shared Education Programme was introduced to 'bridge the gap' between short-term opportunities for contact, and 'full immersion' integrated schools. Informed by contact theory, shared education offers curriculum-based interaction between pupils attending all school types, aimed at promoting the type of contact likely to reduce negative social attitudes and ultimately contribute to social harmony. In this paper, we examine the impact of shared education thus far. Our analysis suggests that while shared education is generally effective in promoting positive assessments of other group members, there is a danger that programme impact may be inhibited by the foregrounding of educational over reconciliation priorities. Appreciating that the downplaying reconciliation objectives may have been necessary when the programme was established in order to maximise recruitment to it, we argue that if the full potential of shared education is to be realised, moving forward, it is important for schools to engage with issues of group differences.

AB  - E-cigarette users' beliefs about COVID-19 may shape their responses to the pandemic and their e-cigarette consumption. A U.S. national cross-sectional survey of 562 e-cigarette users was conducted in April 2020. Participants self-reported nicotine consumption, COVID-19 beliefs, beliefs about e-cigarettes, social distancing, COVID-19 disruptions, cessation considerations, and individual characteristics. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression provided unstandardized, and standardized coefficients. Frequency of e-cigarette use is inversely associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (beta = -0.215). Beliefs e-cigarettes are addictive, harmful, or pose a risk to future health were positively associated with beliefs COVID-19 is relevant (beta = 0.171; beta = 0.164; beta = 0.203), beliefs the media are truthful on COVID-19 (beta = 0.133; beta = 0.136; beta = 0.137), and beliefs e-cigarette users are at greater risk (beta = 0.279; beta = 0.411; beta = 0.447). All three COVID-19 beliefs (COVID relevant; media truthful; and greater risk) were positively associated with social distancing (beta = 0.307; beta = 0.259; beta = 0.115), work disruptions (beta = 0.134; beta = 0.135; beta = 0.130), family disruptions (beta = 0.232; beta = 0.131; beta = 0.164), friendship disruptions (beta = 0.214; beta = 0.139; beta = 0.133), and considerations of quitting (beta = 0.250; beta = 0.222; beta = 0.620). Strong associations between e-cigarette beliefs and COVID-19 beliefs exist. COVID-19 beliefs are associated with behavioral responses, such as social distancing and considerations of e-cigarette cessation. Interventions may be able to leverage COVID-19 beliefs to reduce e-cigarette consumption or promote cessation during the pandemic.

AB  - The present study investigates the mediating roles of psychological inflexibility and differential coping strategies on perceived stress and post-traumatic symptoms and growth in the context of COVID-19. Study one recruited 662 participants (54.8% women; M-age =40.64 years, SD =13.04) who completed a cross-sectional questionnaire. It was proposed that orientation to the problem, avoidance strategies, psychological inflexibility, and positive attitude were mediators for the positive association between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The fit indices for the path model were excellent: CFI =0.977, TLI =0.950, RMSEA = 0.057 [90%CI =0.043-0.081], and SRMS =0.042. Gender and stressful events encountered had indirect effects on the endogenous variables. In study two, 128 participants (57.8% women; M-age =42.30, SD =12.08) were assessed for post-traumatic growth one year later. Psychological inflexibility and orientation acted as mediators between perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. Furthermore, a novel path model was constructed in which psychological inflexibility and orientation to the problem as mediators for perceived stress and PTSD symptoms. The indices for the path model were excellent: CFI = 0.99, TLI = 0.97, RMSEA = 0.055 [90%CI = 0.001-0.144], and SRMS = 0.49. Furthermore, PTSD symptoms, psychological inflexibility, and orientation to the problem predicted post-traumatic growth. Specifically, both orientation to the problem (beta = .06 [90%CI: .01;.13]) and psychological inflexibility (beta = .14 [90%CI: .08;.26]) had an indirect effect on post-traumatic growth. Overall, these results significantly contribute to the literature as orientation to the problem positively predicted PTSD symptoms and post-traumatic growth one year later while psychological inflexibility predicted PTSD symptoms and less post-traumatic growth one year later. These results underline the importance of assessing both symptomology and psychological growth to determine adaptive coping strategies in specific contexts.

AB  - Schizophrenia affects more than eight million people in China. Stigmatization of schizophrenia may prevent family members and close others from providing social support to those with schizophrenia. This article aims to investigate the potential use of a biogenetic approach to reduce the stigma of schizophrenia using a cross-sectional (study 1, n = 141) and an experimental design (study 2, n = 100) in China. In the first study, mediation analysis reveals that perceived affiliate stigma, the negative prejudice, and discrimination towards family members of individuals with socially stigmatized identities due to their affiliation with the person mediates the path between biogenetic beliefs and desire for social distance. This pattern is replicated in study 2 in which two 10-min lectures were created and used to influence participants' beliefs in biogenetic causes of schizophrenia. Findings suggest that the biogenetic approach may increase Chinese participants' desired social distance towards their family members with schizophrenia through increasing their concerns about the negative consequences of being affiliated with the family member. Therefore, future research should investigate aspects of biogenetic anti-stigma campaigns that do not increase participants' perception of affiliate stigma in China.

AB  - The aim of this longitudinal study was to determine the effect of an original prevention program (RAPP) on the behavioral and cognitive characteristics of adolescents with high risk for substance consumption. Seventy-six Mexican adolescents 12-15 years old (38 with high risk (HR) and 38 with low risk (LR)) were selected. RAPP was applied for 3 months. Resilience, social skills, attitudes towards substance use, ability to delay a reward, and inhibitory control were assessed in these adolescents, before and after the RAPP intervention. Both groups improved their scores; however, HR achieved greater changes than LR. Findings suggest that HR have behavioral characteristics that can be considered as risk factors for substance consumption (low levels of resilience, low social skills, little family support, positive attitudes towards substance use). RAPP proved to be an effective program for preventing these risk factors for substance use in adolescents.

AB  - This meta-analysis examined over 40 years of research on interracial interactions by exploring 4 types of outcomes: explicit attitudes toward interaction partners, participants' self-reports of their own emotional state, nonverbal or observed behavior, and objective measures of performance. Data were collected from 108 samples (N = 12,463) comparing dyadic interracial and same-race interactions, predominantly featuring Black and White Americans. Effect sizes were small: Participants in same-race dyads tended to express marginally more positive attitudes about their partners (r = .07), reported feeling less negative affect (r = .10), showed more friendly nonverbal behavior (r = .09), and scored higher on performance measures (r = .07) than those in interracial dyads. Effect sizes also showed substantial heterogeneity, and further analyses indicated that intersectional, contextual, and relational factors moderated these outcomes. For example, when members of a dyad were the same sex, differences between interracial and same-race dyads in negative affect were reduced. Structured interactions led to more egalitarian performance outcomes than did free-form interactions, but the effects of interaction structure on nonverbal behavior depended on participant gender. Furthermore, benefits of intergroup contact were apparent: Differences in emotional state across dyadic racial composition disappeared in longer term interactions, and racial minorities, who often have greater experience with intergroup contact, experienced less negative affect in interracial interactions than did majority group members. Finally, there was a significant historical trend toward more egalitarian outcomes across dyadic racial composition for explicit attitudes and for nonverbal behavior; however, participants' emotional responses and performance have remained consistent.

AB  - Science may be failing to convince a significant number of people about COVID-19 scientific facts and needed public health measures. Individual and social factors are behind believing conspiracy theories. Adults (N = 1001) were asked to rate their beliefs in various conspiracy theories circulating in social media, rate their psychological distress relating to COVID-19, rate their trust in science to solve COVID-19 problems, and rate their willingness to adhere to measures regarding social distancing and quarantine. The findings showed conspiracy theories are widely believed and related to lower age, lower education, living in less densely populated areas, and lower income. Stronger conspiracy theory beliefs predicted science mistrust and unwillingness to adhere to public health measures. Psychological state was a strong predictor of conspiracy beliefs. Recommendations, stemming from the findings, for reducing such beliefs and better serving public health are discussed.

AB  - Background High-quality patient care is a complex phenomenon that requires collaboration among healthcare professionals. Research has shown that Interprofessional Education (IPE) carries promise to improve collaborative work and patient care. So far, collaboration among various health professionals remains a challenge. Very few focus group discussions to determine the medical students' readiness and positive attitudes towards IPE have been reported from the Arabian context. Methods A two-staged sequential mixed methods study was conducted among medical, dental, pharmacy, and health sciences students of the University of Sharjah United Arab Emirates. The perspectives of students toward IPE and collaborative practice were first gathered by administering a validated instrument, Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). This was followed by focused group discussions. A quantitative as well as a qualitative data analysis was performed. Results This study cohort included 282 students. All respondents showed readiness to adopt IPE as all statements of the RIPLS inventory scored high median scores. All participants showed positive attitudes and readiness towards IPE. Three main domains of themes were generated from focus group discussions; prior knowledge, need for IPE framework and its implementation. Information workload, lack of clarity and less focused teaching pedagogies of IPE were considered as perceived barriers. Conclusion This study demonstrated a substantial agreement of medical and health sciences students towards readiness and perceived effectiveness of IPE. Educators are urged to embed new IPE programs into existing curricular frameworks, which can potentially enhance collaborative learning and improve quality of patient care.

AB  - Cancer survivors manage their new status using a multitude of coping mechanisms. Coping strategies vary by individual, but are also socioculturally mediated. Scarce evidence on coping strategies adopted by Hispanic male cancer survivors (HMCS) is available to date. The purpose of this study was to explore the reaction to diagnosis and subsequent coping strategies employed by HMCS. Data were gathered through focus groups (n = 18), cognitive interviews (n = 12), and phone interviews (n = 84). Coping strategies included positive attitudes, humor, optimism and social support, use of home remedies, lifestyle changes, and faith. Findings are consistent with research on non-cancer-related coping showing that HMCS use active coping strategies, such as religion and support from family and friends. The analysis of existing strategies and needs points to the need to develop evidence-based psychosocial services that build on strengths and coping behaviors already employed by HMCS.

AB  - Purpose Healthcare providers have limited time to spend with scoliosis patients who are considering surgery and their families. The purpose of this study was to evaluate an e-health strategy to increase knowledge and coping in patients with scoliosis who are surgical candidates and their families.
   Methods We enrolled patients with scoliosis who were candidates for surgery and their families. Patients and their families completed the scoliosis knowledge questionnaire, meaning of illness questionnaire, social support and coping questionnaires before and after access to a comprehensive evidence-based scoliosis website (http://www.aboutkidshealth.ca/scoliosis).
   Results Seventy-four patients and 71 parents completed the evaluation. While both patients and parents improved their knowledge of scoliosis (p = 0.001 and p = 0.003, respectively), the scores of patients were consistently lower than those of the parents both before and after website use (p = 0.0001). Only parents demonstrated a change in the meaning of illness questionnaire, with a small increase in the negative attitude towards illness and a small decrease in the positive attitude towards illness (p = 0002 and p = 0.01, respectively). Of the 12 coping methods examined on the Adolescent Coping Orientation for Problem Experiences (A-COPE) instrument, patients were slightly more likely than parents to use relaxing and solving family problems as tools to cope following website access (p = 0.02 and p = 0.09, respectively). Parents demonstrated no significant changes in the four methods of coping on the Coping Health Inventory for Parents (CHIP) after website exposure. While the majority of patients and parents reported receiving sufficient support, over half of the patients indicated a need for more support in social participation.
   Conclusion An evidence-based website increased the knowledge of patients and parents but simply providing access to the website had minimal impact on their coping and perceptions of social support. The website, however, provides users with the opportunity to absorb vital information about scoliosis across several media.
