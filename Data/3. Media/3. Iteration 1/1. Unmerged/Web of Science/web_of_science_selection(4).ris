AB  - Objectives: We used ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to examine young adults' attitudes towards pro-tobacco messages encountered in real time and their association with intentions to use tobacco. Methods: Young adults (N = 92, ages 18-29) recorded sightings of marketing or social media related to tobacco in real time via mobile app for 28 days. Participants reported message characteristics, their attitudes towards the message, and intentions to use the depicted product for each submission. We used generalized linear mixed models to examine factors related to attitude towards message and intentions to use tobacco. Results: Messages depicting e-cigarettes (p < .001) or hookah (p < .05) were associated with significantly more favorable attitudes compared with traditional cigarettes. Positive attitude towards the message was significantly associated with intention to use the depicted product (p < .001). Messages depicting e-cigarettes and hookah were significantly associated with higher intention to use. Message source was not significantly related to attitudes towards the message or product use intentions. Conclusions: Marketing featuring e-cigarettes and hookah is an important target for future regulation. Given that pro-tobacco and e-cigarette messages are prevalent online, future research should consider the Internet and social media as important venues for counter-marketing and intervention efforts.

AB  - Social media is increasingly gaining traction as a valuable tool for small business. This is particularly the case in micro enterprises in the Indonesian retail industry, where adoption is anecdotally increasing, but with little understanding of the factors enabling such adoption. Consequently, this study proposes a research model derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and the Use of Technology and extended by integrating the task-technology-fit framework, along with price value propositions. Online surveys were sent to micro enterprises operating in the Indonesian retail industry with 153 valid responses received. Data analysis used structural equation modelling with SmartPLS 3. The results show that price value and task-technology-fit are perceived as significant factors for influencing positive attitudes towards the adoption of social media among micro enterprises. In addition, attitude and facilitating conditions were found to have a significant influence on intention to adopt social media. These findings hold import implications to theory and practice in this nascent field of research.

AB  - This paper focuses on the question of how young people today evaluate the Second World War today and how this difficult past' determines their political attitudes. Furthermore, the channels through which the current young generation in Europe is informed about the events dating back to the first half of the twentieth century (e.g. parents and grandparents, schools, the media) are examined. The theoretical basis chosen for addressing these questions is the work of Mannheim (1928) on the formation of successive generations, and the theories of collective memories and identities of Eisenstadt and his followers. Our empirical evidence comes from a transnational comparison of young people's memories of this difficult past in Denmark, Finland and Germany. From a historical perspective a comparison of the three countries is particularly interesting as they played different roles during the Second World War. The evidence highlights the different perceptions of history among youth and points to the absence of a common European understanding of what happened between 1939 and 1945. The empirical evidence comes from a research project (2011-2015) funded by the European Commission and covering 14 European countries. Its main focus has been on present-day young people's perceptions of history and politics (MYPLACE=Memory, Youth, Political Legacy and Civic Engagement).

AB  - In his acculturative family distancing (AFD) theory, Hwang (2006b) argued that acculturation gaps among parents and youth may lead to psychological and emotional distancing. AFD includes 2 dimensions: incongruent cultural values and breakdowns in communication. This study examined whether bicultural competence (BC) served as a mediator and moderator for the relationship between AFD and depression using structural equation modeling. Two hundred and forty-one Latino/a college students attending predominantly White, midwestern universities completed an online survey at 2 time points. For mediation, results indicated that BC at Time 2 (T2) mediated the relationship between AFD at Time 1 (T1) and depression at T2 above and beyond the effects of depression, acculturation, and enculturation at T1. A bootstrap method estimated the significance of the indirect effect. Moreover, 16% of the variance in BC at T2 was explained by acculturation, enculturation, and AFD at T1; 30% of the variance in depression at T2 was explained by BC at T2 and depression at T1. Post hoc analyses of the AFD and BC dimensions suggested that (a) positive attitudes toward both groups, communication ability, and social groundedness were significant mediators for the incongruent cultural values-depression link and (b) communication ability and social groundedness were significant mediators for the communication breakdown-depression link. For moderation, the AFD X BC interaction did not significantly predict depression at T2. Limitations, future research directions, and counseling implications are discussed.

AB  - YouTube has become an educational and entertainment tool among Western European families, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. This study monitored the main channels for children aged 0-5 years by using the social media analysis (SNA) methodology from March 24, 2020 to August 24, 2020. The software used has been FanpageKarma, which allows the collection and interpretation of data. The results indicate not only a growth in the use of such channels during confinement, but also how their expansion is related to the evolution of the COVID-19, reflecting, in turn, the consequences of the government policies adopted. Social distancing generated a greater consumption of recreational content, but not a greater growth in educational content regardless of the country or culture.

AB  - In this study, we experimentally examined parents' perceptions of scientific information about spanking, a controversial topic, and car seat safety, a consensus topic, presented in online news articles. Specifically, we tested whether parents of children ages 2 to 8 years would trust scientific experts (speaking from professional expertise) more than online lay commenters (speaking from personal experience). One hundred and eighty parents across 41 U.S. states were recruited online from Amazon's Mechanical Turk (124 mothers, 56 fathers; 74% White, 9% Black, 8% Latino, 8% Asian, and 1% other or multiple ethnicities). Parents were randomly assigned to read a news article with an expert discussing spanking research that varied by two conditions: The news article contained either anti-spanking lay comments or pro-spanking lay comments. All parents also read a second news article on car seat safety (a consensus topic). Between-condition analyses were used to compare perceptions of the comment conditions, and within-condition analyses were used to compare perceptions of the expert knowledge versus the comments and to compare perceptions of the spanking expert versus the car seat expert. Moderation analyses were used to compare parents' perceptions based on their attitudes toward spanking. Parents with positive attitudes toward spanking recognized pro-spanking comments as opinion, yet still found them more trustworthy than a scientist taking the opposite position. All parents perceived the car seat expert as trustworthy. The results highlight challenges in disseminating information about controversial topics to the public.

AB  - Background: Oral cancer is a preventable disease. Its occurrence is mostly due to lifestyle. In Sudan, the use of smokeless tobacco (Toombak) has long been linked to oral cancer. Knowledge of the signs and symptoms of oral cancer may well aid in early diagnosis and treatment. This is bound to result in increasing survival rates, as well as reducing the oral cancer burden on the society. This study aimed to assess oral cancer awareness regarding knowledge of signs, symptoms, risk factors and sources of the information. Furthermore, it attempts to evaluate attitudes towards oral cancer screening and any previous experience of screening, amongst dental patients attending University of Science and Technology (UST) Dental Teaching Hospital. Omdurman, Sudan.
   Methods: A hospital based cross-sectional study, interviewer-administered questionnaire was conducted amongst 500 adult patients attending the UST Dental Hospital during 2015.
   Results: A total of 57.7% (286) of the individuals demonstrated good knowledge of signs and symptoms, whereas 49% (139) expressed good knowledge of risk factors of oral cancer. For the majority of the individuals 66.1% (290), the most common source of information about oral cancer was from the media, while 33.9% individuals (149), obtained knowledge from direct contact of health workers. The overwhelming majority, 93.2% (466) never screened for oral cancer despite their positive attitude towards it 66.4% (332). Knowledge of risk factors associated significantly with those reported positive attitude towards oral cancer screening and those reported direct contact with health workers as a source of information, (p <= 0.001). Moreover, females and those living in urban districts scores higher than their counterpart in knowledge of risk factor of oral cancer. In addition, those employed 58.6% (280) and 62.8% (164) with correct believes about oral cancer showed significant association with positive knowledge of signs and symptoms (p <= 0.05).
   Conclusions: Awareness levels, knowledge of risk factors and identifying early signs and symptoms of oral cancer necessitate the need for more structured preventive programs using media. Dentists and health workers should do more because they have a pivotal role in early diagnosis by performing oral cancer screening, raising levels of knowledge and in rectifying misconceptions about oral cancer. This would entail a reduction in high rates of morbidity and mortality associated with oral cancer.

AB  - In an effort to reduce learners' pregnancies, the government introduced various interventions in schools such as life skills and HIV/AIDS programmes. In addition there are also clinics, television, radio and internet that provide information about HIV/AIDS and teenage pregnancy. However, despite these interventions and information about HIV/AIDS, pregnancies among female learners have continued to increase. The purpose of this study was to attain an understanding of knowledge, attitudes and use of contraception among learners attending a high school in Mdantsane. A quantitative, descriptive survey was conducted. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, which was self-administered to 150 female learners. When the learners were asked about their understanding of contraception, 86.67% understood it as prevention of pregnancy and 8.67% understood it as prevention of sexually transmitted diseases. About 66.3% of learners had positive attitudes to contraceptives and 77.27% were using injectable contraceptives. The main cited reason for stopping the use of contraception was the side effects. Given the main used type of contraception and reason for discontinuation, learners need to be educated about the mechanism of contraceptives and side effects associated with them. In addition, more contraceptive options should be offered to learners.

AB  - This paper reports on three studies examining people's belief about race as biological. Study 1 (N = 155) found that the relationship between early exposure to diversity as a child and belief in race as biological was moderated by socioeconomic status. Study 2 (N = 210) found that belief in race as biological was related to greater social distance toward out-group members, and this relationship was mediated by out-group discomfort. Study 3 found that participants (N = 31) had significant decreases in belief in race as biological immediately following a daylong race relations workshop and in a 6-week follow-up, and this "unlearning" trajectory was particularly prominent among students who experienced greater social distance from out-groups. Results are interpreted and discussed in relation to reconceptualizing beliefs about race as rationalizing rather than proactive ideologies and for promoting positive race relations through education aimed at deessentializing race.

The Study employs the qualitative method of in-depth interviews for the collection of data. It applies the social interactionist and creative destruction theories to interpret the results to understand the mindsets of the respondents concerning their usage of Instagram. Findings suggest a positive attitude in creative usage of the platform. However, it was seen that the sample did not quite indicate attention-seeking behavior and narcissism. This Study is important in the space of new media and its usage because a large amount of research has been done to understand the negative impacts of social media. However, there hasn't been much exploration when it comes to the positive aspects of it. Hence, it leaves a lot of scope for more extensive research with larger sample sizes to establish a near concrete conclusion.

AB  - A virtual medical imaging department is an innovative and demanding organizational model, to the extent that the underlying goal is to achieve a continuous and advanced organizational integration of human and physical resources, clinical data, and clienteles. To better understand the kind of benefits offered, we conducted a survey of three groups of users-radiologists, radiological technologists, and medical specialists-working in a five-site virtual organization. We received 127 valid questionnaires, for an overall response rate of 66%. The assessments vary according to the use made of the system. The scores for system quality and the quality of the data produced were markedly higher for intra-hospital use (respectively 7.9 and 8.7 out of 10) than for inter-hospital use (5.4 and 7.0). Despite the negative assessments they made of inter-hospital use, users maintained a positive attitude toward some type of virtual organization of medical imaging. Indeed, the score for Overall satisfaction with the system was very high, 8.9 out of 10. Moreover, the scores for Intended future use of the system were very high for both intra-hospital use (8.9) and inter-hospital use (8.7). We also found significant differences in perceptions among user groups.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) helps prevention and aftercare of sporadic breast cancer (BC), cardiopulmonary fitness (CPF) being an age-independent predictor of tumor-specific mortality. Therefore, we wanted to identify predictors of CPF (represented by peak oxygen uptake: VO2peak) in BRCA1/2 mutation carriers whose risk of developing BC is high. We used cross-sectional data from 68 BRCA1/2 germline mutation carrying women participating in the randomized, prospective, controlled clinical study LIBRE-1. Assessments included cardiopulmonary exercise testing, medical and lifestyle history plus socioeconomic status. Additionally, the participants completed a psychological questionnaire regarding their attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control and intention towards PA. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify predictors for participants reaching their age- and sex-adjusted VO2peak reference values. 22 participants (median age: 40 years, interquartile range (IQR) 33-46) were cancer-unaffected and 46 cancer-affected (median age: 44 years, IQR 35-50). The strongest predictor for reaching the reference VO2peak value was attitude towards PA (Odds Ratio 3.0; 95% Confidence Interval 1.3-8.4; p = 0.021). None of the other predictors showed a significant association. A positive attitude towards PA seems to be associated with VO2peak, which should be considered in developing therapeutic and preventive strategies. Trial registrations: NCT02087592; DRKS00005736.

AB  - Objectives: Since 2009 the number of unvaccinated children in Poland has been regularly increasing. The purpose of the study was to learn what parents who decide to vaccinate their children feel and believe about their children's vaccines and in particular to find out how these sentiments and beliefs affect their attitude and decision-making with reference to vaccinations. Methods: The interviews were conducted during an immunization visit of parents whose children are covered by immunization schedule; 53 parents aged 23 to 48 years took part in the study. Most study participants were high school or university graduates living in rural areas. Children were 1 week to 5 years old. Thematic analysis was used to analyse interview data. Results: Identified factors shaping the parents' positive attitude to vaccination included conviction of necessity of vaccines (effective disease prevention, safety, favourable benefit-to-risk ratio, and concerns about the child). The general anti-vaccination belief was that vaccines are unnecessary. External factors, mainly authority figures and media broadcasts, affect parents' beliefs and decisions. Conclusions: Various factors affect parents' decision concerning immunization of their children. Both compulsory and recommended vaccines should be provided free-of-charge. Choice overload should be reduced. Paediatricians should address parental vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Past suicide attempts are a powerful predictor of suicide. This study developed and evaluated the feasibility of a mobile application for creating safety plans, which include coping strategies that can be immediately accessed and used by suicide attempt survivors during a crisis. A safety plan mobile application, called Brake of My Mind, was developed (study 1). Heuristic evaluation (for experts) and user evaluations (for health professionals and adolescent suicide attempt survivors) were performed. A pilot test was then conducted based on the theory of planned behavior to evaluate the feasibility of Brake of My Mind (study 2). Three adolescent suicide attempt survivors used a pilot version of Brake of My Mind. Attitude toward suicide attempts, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and suicide intentions were assessed before, immediately after, and 1 week after using Brake of My Mind. Brake of My Mind showed very few low-priority usability problems, and it was considered a "good" and "acceptable" application. In study 2, median scores for attitudes toward suicide attempts, perceived behavioral control, and suicide intentions decreased over time after using Brake of My Mind. The subjective norm scores did not change. Brake of My Mind is an acceptable application for adolescent suicide attempt survivors that appears effective in decreasing their positive attitude toward suicide attempts.

AB  - We investigated knowledge and attitudes before and after reading refutation texts augmented by different kinds of persuasive information and how emotions mediated the process of knowledge and attitude change. Undergraduates (N = 424) enrolled in 4 universities from 3 countries read a refutation text on genetically modified foods (GMFs) and were then randomly assigned to receive additional information about advantages of GMFs, disadvantages of GMFs, or both. After studying, students reading about advantages of GMFs had significantly more positive attitudes than students who read about disadvantages. There was also a significant reduction in misconceptions; participants in the positive-oriented text condition showed the largest learning gains, particularly those who held more positive initial attitudes. Epistemic emotions of curiosity, frustration, hope, and enjoyment mediated attitude change while confusion mediated relations between prereading attitudes and postreading knowledge. In addition, the direct relationship between prior attitudes and surprise was moderated by type of text. When reading about both advantages and disadvantages of GMFs, participants reported significantly less surprise when compared with those who read about either advantages or disadvantages of GMFs. To foster conceptual change when learning about complex topics, refutation texts may be paired with persuasive information that is aligned with accurate conceptions.

AB  - Carsharing is often promoted as a potentially environmental-friendly alternative to individual car ownership. However, various carsharing programs have displayed limited success in the past. An initial field study of a new carsharing service is such a story of failure: The introduction of this new service at a medium-sized German university generated unexpectedly low adoption rates so that the service was eventually scaled down and then suspended. Quantitative field study results as well as additional qualitative focus groups reveal that missing compatibility is a key barrier to adoption. Drawing on extant conceptual frameworks of user participation in sharing business models, a factorial survey identifies the importance of different dimensions of carsharing business models for their acceptance. The results reveal that a set of convenience and lifestyle dimensions influences usage intentions, including mode of drive, pickup and drop-off mode, service level, price model, availability, and type of market mediation. In contrast, vehicle fleet does not appear to influence carsharing models' acceptance. These findings contribute to research on business model configuration as well as the attitude-behavior gap in the sharing economy by determining relevant dimensions of a carsharing business model that can bridge the gap between basically positive attitudes and usage resistance. Thereby, they also serve for concrete managerial recommendations.

AB  - We explore the quantity (frequency) and quality (priority, atmosphere, structure) of family mealtimes and associations with nutritional and emotional health in Jamaica. Urban adolescents (N = 330, M = 13.8 years, SD = 1.8, 64% girls) and their mothers (M = 41.4 years, SD = 7.8) completed questionnaires. On average, mothers reported having family meals 3-4 times/week and mealtime quality, but not quantity, was associated with health. Correlations revealed that mothers ate more unhealthily if they watched more TV during meals, and actor-partner independence modeling showed that high SES adolescents ate more unhealthily if their mothers had more difficulty finding time for family meals (and vice versa: partner interaction). Additionally, adolescents and mothers were more psychologically distressed if they themselves had more difficulty finding time for family meals, if they had less positive attitudes/behaviors around mealtime atmosphere (actor effects), or if they were high SES individuals placing lower importance on mealtimes (actor interaction). Overall, however many weekly meals Jamaican families are able to share together, what's important is to make those mealtimes count as quality time. Leisurely family meals with enjoyable conversation uninterrupted by television, such as the age-old Jamaican tradition of "Sunday Dinner", may nourish both body and soul.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate health professions student's awareness, attitude, and perception towards the complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and also to determine the influence of socio-demographic variables on the descriptive outcomes of this study.
   Methods: A descriptive, cross-sectional, comparative study was conducted among Undergraduate Health Professions Students (n=398) at King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences at Riyadh campus, through a validated questionnaire.
   Results: The results of the study revealed that among various modalities of CAM, most students were aware and used prayers/spirituality, followed by nutritional supplements, cupping, massage, herbal medicine and yoga. The least effective modality was aromatherapy, whereas the most harmful modality was acupuncture. The data showed that the students obtained more information from friends/relatives and media and less from formal CAM training/courses. Awareness/self-use and beliefs/attitudes were found to have significant associations (p < 0.05) in regard to gender, parent's educational level, and family income.
   Conclusion: The study shows that most of the healthcare students are aware of and demonstrate positive attitudes towards the effectiveness and safety of most CAM modalities. However, the lack of formal training or courses is a major barrier towards its use and practice.

AB  - The goal of this study is to determine the possible factors leading to increased anti-Muslim sentiment or Islamophobia in a comparative examination of public opinion in the United States and Europe. Secondary analyses of data from the 2008 Pew Global Attitude Project and the 2010 Pew News Interest Index, allow us to assess the role of religious practice, news interest and political affiliation in the attitudes toward Muslim minorities in several countries. Predictors of anti-Muslim attitudes include being politically more conservative and being older in all countries, and paying close attention to news coverage of the Park51 Islamic Community Center in the United States (which was proposed to be built near Ground Zero in New York). In France, but not in the other countries of the study, the importance of the respondents' religion was positively related to anti-Muslim attitudes.

AB  - Introduction: The article presents a protocol of a cross-sectional study of mental health of pregnant women in relation to the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic. The primary aim is to compare differences in anxiety and depression scores of pregnant women between countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The secondary aim is to assess demographic, economic, and social aspects affecting maternal anxiety and depression scores among pregnant women worldwide in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we will be able to compare differences in perception of the different aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic (social distancing, restrictions related to delivery) between countries and according to the epidemic status (number of infected patients, number of reported deaths). The comparisons will also be done according to the COVID-19 status of the participants. Methods and analysis: It is a web-based anonymous survey of pregnant women living in countries affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The survey is comprised of 3 sections: 1) Questions related to general demography, pregnancy health history, mental health history, socioeconomic factors, as well as perception of fear, burden and restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; 2) General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire for anxiety assessment and; 3) Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) for depression assessment. Web-based recruitment for health research has proven to be cost-effective and efficient. At current times with the COVID-19 pandemic, limited resources and social distancing restrictions, performing a mental health study involving pregnant women on a large international scale cannot be safely conducted without involving social-media. The fears of pregnant women fall into 3 categories: the medical condition, the economic status and the organization of daily activity.

AB  - In urbanized settlements, ensuring access to the outdoor environment is essential to stimulate well-being responses indoors. Windows provide access to aesthetic and natural features and bring in clues about the time, weather, and seasonal conditions outdoors. Although dynamic environmental attributes are inherent outdoor view qualities, no studies have explored the effects induced by such dynamic conditions on individuals, limiting the extent to which these features might inform design guidelines for sustained indoor well-being. To address this gap, a virtual reality experiment was conducted to analyze subjective responses to lightness changes in outdoor views with respect to three view constructs (i.e., preference, recovery, and imageability). A novel framework for classifying, capturing, and analyzing urban views was extended to generate the view stimuli material consisting of dynamic and static scenes (i.e., panorama images and 360? videos). Attitudes toward dynamic and static views were tested with an adjusted rating instrument. Results showed significant interactions between view type and lightness change factors for the three view constructs presented in dynamic format. Mean scores for views presenting lightness variations were higher than those observed for identical scenes portraying no lightness variations. Low coefficients of variation for individual questions were found, suggesting the adequacy of the subjective instruments to evaluate dynamic views. Moderate to high positive Pearson correlation coefficients were found between three construct pairs, indicating links between the approaches to examine views. The findings in this study demonstrate that positive attitudes toward views are strongly mediated by the presence of luminous changes in these views.

AB  - It is essential that health professionals are trained to provide optimal care for our ageing population. Key to this is a positive attitude to older adults along with the ability to work in teams and provide interprofessional care. There is limited evidence on the impact an interprofessional education (IPE) placement in a residential aged care facility (RACF) has on students. In 2015 in Western Australia, 51 students (30% male, median age 23years), from seven professions, undertook a placement between 2 and 13weeks in length at 1 RACF. Pre- and post-placement measurements of attitudes to the elderly were collected using the Ageing Semantic Differential (ASD) questionnaire and level of readiness for interprofessional learning with the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS). A total of 47 students completed matched ASD and RIPLS surveys. The mean total score on the ASD survey decreased significantly from pre- to post-placement from 116.0 to 108.9 (p=0.033), indicating attitudes became increasingly positive towards older adults. Significant differences post-placement were seen indicating better readiness for interprofessional learning, for two out of four subscales on the RIPLS, namely teamwork & collaboration (42.1-44.0; (p=0.000)) and positive professional identity (18.2-19.3 (p=0.001)). The degree of change is similar to findings from other settings. The results support IPE-focussed student placements within RACF positively influence student's attitudes towards the older adult as well as increase student's readiness for interprofessional learning, confirming RACF are valuable places for training health professionals.

AB  - Our program in is a 4-year combined anatomic pathology (AP) and clinical pathology (CP) program located in New Hampshire. Prior to the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, double-headed sign-outs and multi-headed scope didactic conferences took place daily. On the autopsy service, cases were performed in-house under attending supervision, and forensic cases were performed at the off-site Office of the Medical Examiner. In CP, residents engaged in weekly didactic CP lectures and engaged in in-person resident-attending discussions, laboratory rounds, and direct patient contact on a daily basis. Institutional Universal Guidelines from the Emergency Order from New Hampshire were imposed at the beginning of the pandemic. These included exposure mitigation and employee screening strategies. Changes to resident rotations and didactic sessions, strategies to maintain resident wellness, and the program director perspectives are described. Amid the pandemic, digital pathology, teleconferencing platforms, and social media became important resources for pathology education. Digital platforms allowed groups of people to communicate and watch live presentations while social distancing. In AP, whole slide imaging allowed both attendings and residents to scan slides for personal learning, slide conferences, and didactic learning sessions. Following these measures, we supported the clinical needs of our medical center and learning needs of our residents while enacting social distancing and prevention guidelines early in the pandemic. Although the full impact of COVID-19 on pathology residency programs is still unknown, we incorporated new facets of communication technologies. These were immensely helpful in maintaining social distancing and helping to reduce the spread of disease.

AB  - Many studies demonstrate that mortality salience can increase negativity toward outgroups but few have examined variables that mitigate this effect. The present research examined whether subtly priming people to think of human experiences shared by people from diverse cultures increases perceived similarity of members of different groups, which then reduces MS-induced negativity toward outgroups. In Study 1, exposure to pictures of people from diverse cultures engaged in common human activities non-significantly reversed the effect of MS on implicit anti-Arab prejudice. In Study 2, thinking about similarities between one's own favorite childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated MS-induced explicit negative attitudes toward immigrants. In Study 3, thinking about similarities between one's own painful childhood memories and those of people from other countries eliminated the MS-induced reduction in support for peace-making. Mediation analyses suggest the effects were driven by perceived similarity of people across cultures. These findings suggest that priming widely shared human experiences can attenuate MS-induced intergroup conflict. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper explores how trust in formal information sources (government and media) and informal information sources (interpersonal) about COVID-19 influences compliance with preventive measures. This cross-sectional study uses convenience sampling of 478 adult participants. Data analyses using structural equation modeling with multigroup comparisons examine hypothesized relationships between trust in information sources and preventative behaviors and social distancing. Results suggest that understanding of COVID-19 causes is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to trust in informal information. Self-efficacy for prevention is related to trust in informal information sources, but not to trust in formal information sources. Worry about contracting COVID-19 is related to trust in formal information sources, but not to informal ones. Engaging in preventive measures is linked to both self-efficacy for prevention and worry, while social distancing was related only to worry. These findings have important implications for public health policy guidelines centered on clear and truthful media messages. The findings also facilitate comparative analyses of reactions to information sources across a decade of evolving attitudes toward media and government, between two cultures (Hong Kong vs. the USA), and between two different global pandemics.

AB  - Background: In 2014, the world was startled by a sudden outbreak of Ebola. Although Ebola infections and deaths occurred almost exclusively in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia, few potential Western cases, in particular, caused a great stir among the public in Western countries.
   Objective: This study builds on the construal level theory to examine the relationship between psychological distance to an epidemic and public attention and sentiment expressed on Twitter. Whereas previous research has shown the potential of social media to assess real-time public opinion and sentiment, generalizable insights that further the theory development lack.
   Methods: Epidemiological data (number of Ebola infections and fatalities) and media data (tweet volume and key events reported in the media) were collected for the 2014 Ebola outbreak, and Twitter content from the Netherlands was coded for (1) expressions of fear for self or fear for others and (2) psychological distance of the outbreak to the tweet source. Longitudinal relations were compared using vector error correction model (VECM) methodology.
   Results: Analyses based on 4500 tweets revealed that increases in public attention to Ebola co-occurred with severe world events related to the epidemic, but not all severe events evoked fear. As hypothesized, Web-based public attention and expressions of fear responded mainly to the psychological distance of the epidemic. A chi-square test showed a significant positive relation between proximity and fear:X-2(2)=103.2 (P<. 001). Public attention and fear for self in the Netherlands showed peaks when Ebola became spatially closer by crossing the Mediterranean Sea and Atlantic Ocean. Fear for others was mostly predicted by the social distance to the affected parties.
   Conclusions: Spatial and social distance are important predictors of public attention to worldwide crisis such as epidemics. These factors need to be taken into account when communicating about human tragedies.

AB  - Wine production is directly related to the environmentally responsible production. In recent years, due to demands for an environmentally responsible wine production in the Republic of Serbia, wine producers have become aware of the environmental responsibilities and are taking measures to prevent environmental problems. The objective of this research was to investigate attitudes of winery owners/managers on business performance of the wineries concerning the environmental behavior and its disclosure. The research has been conducted in the period from July to the end of October 2021 on a sample of 330 small wineries in the Republic of Serbia. The data were processed in the Smart PLS software v.3.2.7. The findings show a positive connection between of both service and financial performance with an ethical environmental behavior and environmental disclosure. However, no positive connection between innovative performance and ethical environmental behavior or ethical environmental disclosure has been determined. The positive attitudes of managers on the environment influence the business performance of wineries and indirectly on environmental behavior and disclosure. The current study should contribute to the relevant literature, as it investigates not only firm behavior in the wine sector, but also the impact of firm performance on the environment.

AB  - This study examined factors that affect journalists' Twitter use behaviors based on the framework of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A survey of Korean journalists supported that TPB is a useful theoretical framework for understanding journalists' Twitter use behaviors. This study found that three TPB variables - positive attitudes, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control - are positively associated with journalists' general Twitter use (i.e., time spent using Twitter). More importantly, beyond looking at journalists' general Twitter use, this study expands the literature by distinguishing between expressive Twitter use (e.g., tweeting messages) and consumptive Twitter use (e.g., reading others' tweets). Results showed that journalists' attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral controls were associated differently depending on patterns of expressive and consumptive Twitter usage. Given the role of professional journalists in society, their ways of using Twitter may have a profound impact on the ecology of journalism. Contributing to the literature of the theory of planned behavior by extending its explanatory power to professional journalists' Twitter usage, the results of this study suggest that future research on journalists' Twitter use should pay more attention to how Twitter is employed within the journalistic context.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is rapidly spreading in the world and the mortality rate is getting higher and higher. Due to the outbreak of such epidemic disease, many countries imposed stricter measures among which is social distancing and enforced isolation. The present study tries to establish a realistic model to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19 and explicitly parameterize the intervention effects of control measures. In so doing, it takes into account stochastic perturbation and investigates the effects of media coverage on the transmission dynamics. This paper seeks to study the existence and uniqueness of the global positive solution to the proposed model and establish conditions for extinction and persistence in mean of the disease. Numerical simulations are presented to show the theoretical results obtained from this study.

AB  - Thin-idealized models are mainly promoted in fashion ads, supporting "thinness sells." Based on the self-schema theory, this study investigated how self-evaluative and motivational schema in appearance influenced attitudes toward brand advertising thin models and purchase intention. A web-based survey consisting of three different model stimuli-thin, average-sized, and no models-in fashion ads was conducted. A total of 380 female college students at a large Midwestern university in the United States responded to the web-based survey. Results indicate participants with higher motivational schema in appearance showed more positive attitudes toward brand and greater purchase intention when exposed to thin models rather than average-sized and no models. However, participants with lower motivational schema in appearance responded to thin models less favorably than those with higher motivational schema. These results explored individual differences of motivational self-schema in appearance in responses to thin models. Implications on marketing and advertising strategies for fashion ads were discussed.

AB  - The integration of Faccbook into English as a Second Language (ESL) environment arc prevalent in many higher institution settings, but not many focuses on the receptive skills of reading. This study examines university students' perceptions of Facebook for ESL reading activities. To accomplish this, three methods of data collection were employed; a questionnaire, an informal Facebook group (IFG), and interviews. The findings show that students with good reading ability undertook more reading activities on Facebook, perceived the highest development of language skills after using Facebook and had the most positive attitudes towards English language learning on Facebook compared to students with moderate and poor reading ability. The students saw the effectiveness of the IFG in ESL, but, participated more as silent readers and believed that a higher involvement from the moderator would further enhance ESL progress. They preferred to read non-academic content on Facebook, particularly creative productions like short stories and poems to further cultivate ESL reading habits, develop reading comprehension and boost reading interest.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of organizational justice and conflict management on employee relations (ER) through the mediating role of climate of trust. Design/methodology/approach This study was conducted with a sample of 331 employees working in a power transmission unit of Odisha. Data were collected by administering a structured questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20). Findings The results reveal that climate of trust plays the role of a partial mediator between organizational justice and ER and conflict management and ER. Also, it was found that organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust are the positive and significant predictors of ER. Research limitations/implications - The study was confined to a single state-owned power transmission unit of an Indian state, which restricts its generalizability. The research would benefit from exploration in alternative units. Practical implications - This scholarly work may encourage managers and decision makers to develop trust building climate by focusing on organizational justice and conflict management to flourish an environment of harmonious ER, furthermore to formulate effective strategies for cultivating facilitative work environment to enhance positive attitude among the employees to challenge future goals. Originality/value The research is exclusive in determining the influence of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediator of climate of trust in the new perspective of the power sector that provides empirical evidence to the extant literature.

AB  - Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of politicians' parental status on candidate viability. Building on the concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates' parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates' spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using 2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of such portrayals for establishing candidates' relatability and electoral viability.

AB  - As a result of the global COVID-19 pandemic, Finnish citizens started to display teddy bears in their windows. As this activity gained media interest and popularity, it grew into a transgenerational form of toy play, where children and adults participated as displayers and spectators in this visual-material play pattern, made available to a broader audience through sharing on social media. A previous phase of the study articulated and analyzed the phenomenon as an act that facilitates mental well-being through imagination, participation, and playing for the common good (Heljakka, 2020). By theorizing and framing the phenomenon as pandemic toy play, the researcher suggested the importance of resistance, resourcefulness, and playful resilience in times of forced self-isolation and social distancing. This article builds on the earlier phase of the study by focusing on the previously identified themes and investigates the occurrence of these themes in adult toy play during a pandemic.

AB  - This study attempted to disentangle the issues underlying the marked drop recorded in political engagement of young Greek Cypriots. To reveal the dynamic processes through which people debate, disagree or convince each other towards the formation of political attitudes, eight focus-groups were carried out with a total of forty participants, equally distributed according to age and gender. The analysis showed that young Greek Cypriots appear uncertain for their future, pessimistic, cynical, and highly disillusioned with traditional politics. Contrary to what is observed in other European countries, young Greek Cypriots do not experiment with alternative forms of political action, remain inactive, and although the country's politicised culture of the past is still reflected in their theoretical discussions about social issues, they express embarrassment and confusion when asked to elaborate on how theory could be transformed into practice. They associate politics with corruption and economic interests, they are scornfully disillusioned with the European Union, and they emotionally distance themselves from important changes to come with the possible reunification of Cyprus. Young Greek Cypriots appear insecure, pessimistic, disoriented, uninspired, and in an urgent need to rediscover passion for ideas which they cannot any more find in traditional politics and forms of political action.

AB  - The majority of research on media counter-stereotyping of race/ethnicity has tended to employ positive portrayals or counter-stereotypical exemplars as a primary strategy in eliciting positive attitudes among White participants. In contrast, this article reports the results of an experiment on the unique role of affective responses to media messages as a mechanism in inducing greater feelings of connectedness with a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. Our focus is on the affective response of elevation specifically, which refers to feelings of being moved, touched, and inspired by images of people engaged in morally beautiful acts such as love, generosity, and kindness. Results show that the experience of elevation in response to inspiring videos was associated with heightened feelings of overlap between the self and humanity, with this overlap associated with greater feelings of connectedness with those from a diversity of racial/ethnic groups. This connection was also associated with more favorable attitudes.

AB  - Consumers mainly acquire information through social learning in online shopping environment, and social presence as a media attribute generated by real-time interactions in live streaming commerce is more conducive for consumers' social learning. Therefore, it is worth investigating the roles of social presence and social learning on consumers' purchase intention (PI) in the strong interactive environment. Based on social cognitive theory (SCT) framework and drawing on social presence theory and social learning theory, this study investigates the relationships among social presence, social learning process, and PI. Social presence is operationalized into social presence of others (SPO) and social presence of interactions (SPI), whereas social learning process contains external interaction process [exploitative learning (ETL) and exploratory learning (ERL)] and internal psychological process [cognitive appraisal (CAP) and affective appraisal AAP)]. The results from a survey of 372 consumers of live streaming commerce indicate that SPO and SPI positively affect ETL and ERL and then contribute significantly to the building of CAP and AAP, which can lead to PI. The findings also provide guidance for brand managers and retailers in building more effective interactive atmosphere and promoting consumers' positive attitude toward brands in live streaming marketing.

AB  - Today, turning to the quality of life and the use of spiritual and health attitudes have become one of the communities' concerns. This study aimed to determine a structural model of urban quality of life (UQL) based on socioeconomic status (SES), religious attitude, and mental health status among Iranian Muslims. The sample included 383 individuals (256 females and 179 males) from Yazd selected by multi-stage cluster sampling method. The subjects responded to the demographic form, Urban Quality of Life Scale-47 (UQLS-47), the Religion Assessment Questionnaire-26 (RAQ-26), and the General Health Questionnaire-28 (GHQ-28). The results showed that SES and religious attitude were negatively associated with mental health and positively associated with UQL. Also, mental health negatively associated with UQL and has the role of a mediating variable. This means that three variables (SES, religious attitude and mental health) can predict a 0.45 variance of UQL. The findings are in line with similar studies. So, Iranian Muslims have better mental health and SES in society and a more positive attitude toward religion and spirituality; they will have better UQL.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to compare a Web-based curriculum with a traditional lecture format on medical students' cultural competency attitudes using a standardized instrument and to examine the internal consistency of the standardized instrument. Methods: In 2010, we randomized all 180 1st-year medical students into a Web-based (intervention group) or a lecture-based (control group) cultural competency training. The main outcome was the overall score on the Health Belief Attitudes Survey (1 5 lowest, 6 5 highest). We examined internal consistency with factor analysis. Results: No differences were observed in the overall median scores between the intervention (median 5.2; 25th percentile [Q1] 4.9, 75th percentile [Q3] 5.5) and the control groups (median 5.3, Q1 4.9, Q3 5.6) (P = 0.77). The internal consistency of the 2 main subcomponents was good (Cronbach's alpha = 0.83) to acceptable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.69). Conclusions: A Web-based and a lecture-based cultural competency training strategies were associated with equally high positive attitudes among 1st-year medical students. These findings warrant further evaluation of Web-based cultural competency educational interventions.

AB  - The three stage model set forth by the ACGME, which provides a framework for pandemic residency program management, is insufficient and could best be expanded to 5 stages to include post-pandemic-peak residency program management. Stage 4, "Increased non-COVID clinical demands," present the challenge of an increased clinical workload in the setting of social distancing while reengaging the educational mission of the residency program. In Stage 5, "Business as usual, redefined," the residency program must learn to adapt to new challenges including uncertainty surrounding the American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core examination, uncertainty in the job market, and potential diminished medical student interest in radiology. Despite these challenges, this post-pandemic environment offers tremendous opportunity to build on and enhance the residency program now and into the future.

AB  - While public policy worldwide has focused on providing digital connectivity infrastructure in remote areas, there remain people who are digitally excluded. Hence, it is important to explore why people, despite having access to a digital connection, do not go online. As the third part of a three-year project on digital inclusion in isolated communities in Chile, this study draws on findings from focus groups conducted with non-Internet users who live in three remotes but digitally connected villages, to unravel the elements associated with their decision to remain digitally excluded. The main findings indicate that strong ties within the community shelter their sense of isolation providing a feeling of closeness, whereas the internet is perceived as disruptive. In addition, negative attitudes about the Internet emerge from the discussions: the internet is associated with addiction and isolation. Finally, the absence of digital skills makes smartphones and computers unknown entities, a black box people feel unable to or overwhelmed at the thought of learning how to use. However, many are facing a hard choice due to their need to remain in contact with those outside the community as well as promote and develop their small business ventures. Therefore, there is a cultural construction of the Internet as a required form of progress that nonetheless does more harm than good to a tight-knit community.

AB  - Background: It is important to measure the public response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Twitter is an important data source for infodemiology studies involving public response monitoring.
   Objective: The objective of this study is to examine COVID-19-related discussions, concerns, and sentiments using tweets posted by Twitter users.
   Methods: We analyzed 4 million Twitter messages related to the COVID-19 pandemic using a list of 20 hashtags (eg, "coronavirus," "COVID-19," "quarantine") from March 7 to April 21, 2020. We used a machine learning approach, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to identify popular unigrams and bigrams, salient topics and themes, and sentiments in the collected tweets.
   Results: Popular unigrams included "virus," "lockdown," and "quarantine." Popular bigrams included "COVID-19," "stay home," "corona virus," "social distancing," and "new cases." We identified 13 discussion topics and categorized them into 5 different themes: (1) public health measures to slow the spread of COVID-19, (2) social stigma associated with COVID-19, (3) COVID-19 news, cases, and deaths, (4) COVID-19 in the United States, and (5) COVID-19 in the rest of the world. Across all identified topics, the dominant sentiments for the spread of COVID-19 were anticipation that measures can be taken, followed by mixed feelings of trust, anger, and fear related to different topics. The public tweets revealed a significant feeling of fear when people discussed new COVID-19 cases and deaths compared to other topics.
   Conclusions: This study showed that Twitter data and machine learning approaches can be leveraged for an infodemiology study, enabling research into evolving public discussions and sentiments during the COVID-19 pandemic. As the situation rapidly evolves, several topics are consistently dominant on Twitter, such as confirmed cases and death rates, preventive measures, health authorities and government policies, COVID-19 stigma, and negative psychological reactions (eg, fear). Real-time monitoring and assessment of Twitter discussions and concerns could provide useful data for public health emergency responses and planning Pandemic-related fear, stigma, and mental health concerns are already evident and may continue to influence public trust when a second wave of COVID-19 occurs or there is a new surge of the current pandemic.

AB  - The study compared the level of physical activity (PA) between older people living with HIV (PLWH) and their HIV-negative counterparts in China and tested the mediational roles of self-compassion, attitudes toward aging, and perceived stress in the between-group difference in PA. From December 2017 to August 2018, face-to-face interviews were conducted among 337 and 363 HIV-positive and -negative people aged >= 50 in Yongzhou City, Hunan, China. Path analysis was performed. The proportions of low, moderate, and high levels of PA in the HIV-positive and -negative groups were 18.9% versus 6.7%, 43.1% versus 32.0%, and 38.0% versus 61.3%, respectively, yielding a statistically significant difference. The path analysis showed that older PLWH reported less self-compassion and positive attitudes toward aging, which was in turn associated with more perceived stress and ultimately associated with less PA. Chinese older PLWH were more sedentary than their HIV-negative counterparts. Future PA interventions may modify the mediators.

AB  - Although a limited amount of research exists on pay communication, most shows that pay communication is associated with positive attitudes. Little research exists on pay secrecy and its outcomes. Using equity theory, this article explores the dynamics of how perceived pay communication and perceived pay secrecy policies relate to desirable attitudes. The article proposes that pay equity is the link that mediates these relationships. Data were collected in a U.S. public utility, and findings reveal that perceived communication about how pay levels are determined is positively associated with affective organizational commitment and three dimensions of pay satisfaction, and most of these relationships are fully or partially mediated by pay equity. While perceived written pay secrecy policies show no relationship with attitudes, perceived unwritten secrecy policies negatively predict pay administration satisfaction and this relationship is mediated by pay equity. Finally, neither written nor unwritten pay secrecy policies are related to whether or not respondents report discussing their pay.

AB  - The growing interest in sustainable development in all sectors of the economy has fostered a noteworthy shift toward responsible management education (RME). This emerging view underscores that business schools provide students with more than just managerial knowledge as they also develop students toward responsible management. Based on socialization theory, we show how this development occurs by studying RME as a process that relates to students' values, attitudes and behavioral intentions. With data from a large international survey of business students from 21 countries, our findings show that RME facilitates students' self-transcendence, the development of conservation values and positive attitudes toward corporate social responsibility (CSR). Further, RME is positively related to students' CSR behavioral intentions (willingness to sacrifice salary to work for a responsible employer) through the mediating role of values and attitudes. In sum, this study extends socialization theory to the higher education domain to show that business schools can affect students' prosocial, ethical values and intentions, with implications for responsible management and RME.

AB  - Literature shows the immense importance of technology acceptance among junior school teachers. Hence based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the current study aims to investigate the impact of various external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate, facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation on the adoption of technology among junior school teachers in Indonesia. Using a quantitative field survey, data were collected from 410 respondents and were analyzed using SmartPls3 by testing through the measurement and structural model. Results revealed that junior school teachers have a positive attitude towards the use of educational technology. Also, the external factors, i.e., appreciation learning climate was positively associated with perceived usefulness. Whereas facilitation learning climate, learning through reflection, and learning through experimentation were found to be positively and significantly associated with the perceived ease of use and actual use of the educational technology. Integrating Motivation-Hygiene Theory with the TAM model, this study revealed how multiple external factors motivate teachers to incorporate educational technology in their teaching methodologies. Besides extending the literature related to TAM and motivation theory, several future research directions are suggested.

AB  - Although both storied and extensive, social scientific research on the effects of pornography consumption on males has primarily focused on testing the feminist contention that pornography contributes to sexual aggression against females. Other parties have expressed concern about males use of pornography, however. Moralists (Linz & Malamuth, ) have argued that pornography promotes a permissive approach to sexual relations. Public health researchers have hypothesized that pornography encourages epidemiologically risky sexual behavior. This study used cross-sectional General Social Survey data gathered between 1973 and 2010 to assess these claims for empirical support. In line with moralists contentions, pornography consumption was associated with having more positive attitudes toward teenage sex, adult premarital sex, and extramarital sex. Pornography consumption was also positively related to actually engaging in extramarital sex. In line with public health researchers concerns, pornography consumption was associated with having more sexual partners and engaging in paid sex behavior. Additional longitudinal and experimental research is needed to determine the directionality of these associations and to rule out possible third-variable confounds, such as erotophilia or hypersexuality. Regarding consumption, the percentage of adult U.S. males who consume pornography appears to have increased only slightly over time.

AB  - The development of automated vehicles (AVs) has attracted increasing attention. Understanding public acceptance of AVs and their intention to use them, which are the primary aims of the present study, are especially important considering that increasingly more AVs will be moving on the road in the coming future. A total of 527 participants voluntarily and validly completed a series of questionnaires, including the automated vehicle acceptability scale (AVAS), Big Five Inventory (BFI), and some sociodemographic variables. The results of an internal consistency, reliability, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) confirmed the two-factor (contextual acceptability and impaired driving) structure of the AVAS. The Chinese public generally has a positive attitude towards AVs. In addition, our results indicate the possibility of the misuse of AVs. More importantly, the results reveal that contextual acceptability partially mediated the effect of agreeableness on the willingness to drive and the willingness to own AVs and fully mediated its effect on the willingness to rent AVs, while contextual acceptability and interest in impaired driving fully mediated the effect of the openness on the willingness to drive, own, and rent AVs. Manufacturers and retailers in the automotive vehicle industry should provide their customers with comprehensive information regarding the principles and limitations behind the system and the responsibility and obligations of the drivers to avoid misuse. Moreover, providing more targeted services according to customers' different personality traits might be a useful sales technique.

AB  - The current study tested the impact of different messaging interventions on changing attitude and behaviour in relation to Red and Processed Meat Consumption (RPMC). The study compared the effectiveness of receiving fourteen daily messages on the health, environment, or health + environment benefits of reduced RPMC, against a no message control condition. All three intervention conditions also received daily reminders of the goal regarding RPMC and were asked to record RPMC using a food diary. Participants in the control condition were only asked to use a food diary to record daily food intake. Behaviour and attitude in relation to RPMC of all participants were assessed at Time 1 (pre-message), Time 2 (immediately post-message, two weeks later) and Time 3 (one month later again). Participants were Italian undergraduates (at Time 1 N = 322) randomly allocated to one of the four conditions. Only those completing all measures at all time points were retained for analysis (N = 241). Results showed that health message condition and environment message condition, but not health + environment messages condition, were effective in increasing a positive attitude towards reduced RPMC compared to the control condition. Attitude mediated the effects of health condition and environmental condition on the reduction of behaviour. The effects of health and environment messages on attitude and behaviour persisted for one month after the end of the intervention. Implications for devising effective messaging intervention to change RPMC are discussed.

AB  - In contrast to earlier in the HIV/AIDS pandemic, net of other demographic factors, formal education acts as a preventative factor in sub-Saharan Africa. Despite this trend, there has been almost no research on the causal mechanisms behind the widely reported education effect. Consistent with the education effect, structural equation modeling of the influence of education attainment on condom use with Demographic Health Survey data from nine sub-Saharan Africa nations collected between 2003 and 2005 finds that net of control variables, there is a robust, positive influence of education on condom use among sexually risky adults. Information-transfer and attitude change, the two most commonly assumed educational influences on the use of condoms, are tested, and although education attainment increases acquisition of basic facts and the inculcation of positive attitudes about HIV/AIDS, these factors have only weak influence on condom use. Given this, a new hypothesis about education's enhancement of health reasoning is developed from neuro-developmental and decision-making research. Modeling finds that education robustly influences health reasoning ability and this factor mediates a significant proportion of the education effect on condom use. The results raise concern about the enormous effort by NGOs in the region to use mainly fact-and attitude-based educational programs to reduce future HIV infections. Future research on the causal mechanisms behind the association between education and HIV/AIDS prevention should focus how on schooling enhances the cognitive skills needed for health reasoning.

AB  - The network of relations between Physical Education (PE) teachers' self-efficacy, goal orientations, attitudes, intentions and behaviours concerning the implementation of a new PE curriculum was examined. Participants were 290 Greek junior high school PE teachers. Two years after the introduction of the new curriculum, participants responded to de-identified questionnaires with acceptable psychometric properties. Mastery-oriented and high self-efficacious teachers had positive attitudes towards the new curriculum, implemented the biggest number of teaching plans and they intended to do the same in the future. Performance approach goal orientation had low positive relationship with the implementation of teaching plans and no relationship with intention to do the same in the future, while performance avoidance goal was not related to any determinant of curriculum implementation and intention. The effects of mastery goal orientation on intention and behaviour were mediated by self-efficacy to achieve an educational aim which is an end in itself, that is, the promotion of students' self-regulation in exercise settings. The effects of performance approach goal orientation on behaviour were mediated by self-efficacy to achieve a curricular goal which is a means to promote other educational aims, that is, the adoption of student-centred teaching styles. Teaching experience was negatively related to implementation of the new curriculum and with most of its determinants. Strategies aiming to strengthen teachers' self-efficacy, mastery goals, attitudes and intentions to implement a new curriculum are suggested.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the key factors that influence behavioral intention to adopt MOOCs. The study was conducted in three countries namely, Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan. The study was considered significant considering the advancements in technology that have had an unprecedented impact on education, and the need to conduct learning online due to the COVID-19 to pandemics. The research adopted the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and extended it by including other variables including culture, social distancing, and absorptive capacity. The study was conducted using the quantitative methodology, where the data was collected using a structured questionnaire. The data was collected from a sample from each of the three countries, and sample sizes were 455, 490, and 513 for Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan respectively. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analysis. The results of the study indicated that effort expectancy and culture significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention to use MOOCs in all three countries. As well, absorptive capacity is mediated significantly by performance expectancy and effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions have a significant influence on MOOCs in both Thailand and Pakistan. Social influence has a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Thailand, hedonic motivation and price value have a significant influence on behavioral intention to use MOOCs in Poland, and the habit has a significant factor in Pakistan. The keys aspects influencing behavioral intention to Use MOOCs were different in Poland, Thailand, and Pakistan, in various factors which are performance expectancy, social distancing, price value, facilitating conditions, and social influence. The research recommended that it is important to evaluate the situation and prevailing conditions of the concerned country, before implementing the MOOCs and the associated online learning practices.

AB  - Purpose Identify the elements (defining characteristics, related factors, and risk factors) of the diagnoses of NANDA international impaired religiosity (00169), risk for impaired religiosity (00170), and readiness for enhanced religiosity (00171), in a period of social distancing in the pandemic of COVID-19, and associate them with the behavior of individual and collective religious practice, before and during the pandemic. Methods Survey study, released via social media to members of religious communities in Brazil. Data collection took place in June 2020, by online questionnaire. Findings Participants were 719 people, 563 (78.3%) were women, with a median age of 39 years (min 18-max 73), of Catholic religion (64.7%), with a median of 29 years of religious practice (min 0-max 70). The participants were from Southeast 652 (90.68%), South 49 (6.82%), Northeast 13 (1.82%), Midwest 4 (0.56%), and North 01 (0.14%) of Brazil. The increase of individual religious practice was associated with two diagnostic elements and the reduction of individual practice to nine elements. The reduction of collective religious practice was associated with seven diagnostic elements and the maintenance of the practice associated with five elements. The increase of collective religious practice was associated with five diagnostic elements. Conclusions In individuals who presented during the pandemic reduction of individual religious practice, reduction of collective religious practice, and maintenance of collective religious practice, the elements of the diagnosis impaired religiosity were predominant. In individuals who presented increased practice of collective religious activity during the pandemic, the elements of the diagnosis readiness for enhanced religiosity were predominant. Implications for nursing practice This study highlights defining characteristics, risk factors, and related factors of the religiosity diagnoses presented due to social distancing in the pandemic; these should be screened during nursing consultations in primary health care.

KW  - INFECTION-CONTROL
AB  - Background: Antibiotic resistance is a growing issue in nursing homes (NHs). Antibiotic stewardship (ABS) programmes can reduce antibiotic use in NHs, but few studies have assessed to what extent they are implemented in NHs.
   Objectives: To describe ABS current practices and describe the opinion of NH stakeholders regarding ABS and opportunities for improvement in one French region.
   Methods: We invited by e-mail the medical and nurse coordinators of all NHs of the Grand Est region, France, to participate in our survey in 2019. The online questionnaire included 35 questions covering four topics: NH characteristics, current ABS practices, attitudes towards ABS and opinions on strategies to promote ABS. A score evaluating implementation of core ABS elements was calculated using the current ABS practice responses.
   Results: Out of 417 NHs, 75 (18%) participated in our survey. The three most implemented ABS activities were antibiotic consumption monitoring (65%), antibiotic plan documentation (56%) and antibiotic prescription guide distribution (54%). Audit and feedback, training sessions or identification of a local ABS leader ranged from 13% to 29%. Participants positively perceived ABS and most suggestions to improve ABS programmes in NH, with maximal interest in training, audit and feedback interventions. The median score for implementation of core ABS elements was 3.3 (IQR = 2.3-5.4; theoretical range 0-11), and the score distribution was not associated with any NH characteristic.
   Conclusions: While there is still room for improvement, NHs had a positive attitude towards ABS strategies. Some regional and national initiatives to promote ABS in NHs exist and should be actively promoted.

AB  - Social isolation and its deleterious effects on health increases with age in the general population. People with Parkinson's Disease (PWP) are no exception. Social isolation is a risk factor for worsened health outcomes and increased mortality. Symptoms such as depression and sleep dysfunction are adversely affected by loneliness. There is a paucity of research on social isolation in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is all the more critical now in the setting of social distancing due to COVID-19. The goal of this study was to survey individuals with PD to evaluate whether social isolation is associated with PD symptom severity and quality of life. Only individuals reporting a diagnosis of idiopathic PD were included in this analysis. The primary outcome measures were the Patient-Reported Outcomes in PD (PRO-PD) and questions from PROMIS Global related to social health. PRO-PD scores increased as social performance and social satisfaction scores diminished. Individuals who reported being lonely experienced a 55% greater symptom severity than those who were not lonely (P < 0.01). Individuals who documented having a lot of friends had 21% fewer symptoms than those with few or no friends (P < 0.01). Social isolation was associated with greater patient-reported PD severity and lower quality of life, although it is unclear whether this is the cause and/or a consequence of the disease. In essence, the Parkinson pandemic and the pandemic of social isolation have been further compounded by the recent COVID-19 pandemic. The results emphasize the need to keep PWP socially connected and prevent loneliness in this time of social distancing. Proactive use of virtual modalities for support groups and social prescribing should be explored.

AB  - Sexting (sending and receiving sexual messages) could entail risk for adolescent users. Hence, it is important that parents are able to address their children's sexuality and mediate to them the implications of sexting. The goal of the current study was to identify parental factors that lead to dysfunctional communication about sexting among 427 parents of Israeli adolescents (ages 10-18) and to determine whether parents' perceived severity of sexting and perceived susceptibility of sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of online questionnaires. Findings indicated that of the parenting styles examined, the authoritarian and permissive styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent-child communication. The authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes regarding sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity and susceptibility of their children's sexting activities. It appears that the quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and phenomena and modulate their communication regarding the implied risks accordingly. Moreover, ethnic differences emerged between Arab and Jewish parents with regard to the quality of parent-child communication about sexting. Specifically, Arab parents tended more toward dysfunctional communication about sexting than did Jewish parents. Findings suggest that perceiving the implications of sexting as too risky diminishes parents' ability to conduct a high-quality discussion. In conclusion, parents need to mediate and conduct constructive discussions with their children regarding this topic.

AB  - Advertorials-advertisements camouflaged as editorial material-are a pervasive advertising strategy. Presentational features of advertorials, such as a small or omitted advertisement label and useful information presented in an editorial format prior to promoting a product, are likely to give impressions to readers that the reading material is a useful resource rather than advertising material. We examined the cognitive and persuasive effects of health product-related advertorials based on a schema-laden information processing model framework. Study 1 (n = 337) found that advertorials were less likely to trigger advertising schema, especially consumer awareness of persuasive intent. Study 2 (n = 336) found that the structure presenting useful information before advertising a related product decreased consumer skepticism. Overall, readers exhibited more positive attitudes toward advertorials than they did toward traditional advertisements due to decreased awareness of persuasive intent (Study 1) and advertorials' structure (Study 2), which, in turn, increased willingness to purchase advertised products.

AB  - Since most audit engagements identify multiple proposed audit adjustments, auditors must decide how best to present and negotiate these adjustments with their clients. Prior research indicates that auditors can negotiate adjustments individually (a sequential strategy) or can negotiate multiple adjustments within the same negotiation setting (a simultaneous strategy). This paper examines the relative effectiveness of a simultaneous versus sequential negotiation strategy in eliciting concessions from clients and engendering greater client satisfaction. Participants negotiated audit adjustments with a simulated auditor who employed one of the two negotiation strategies. We find evidence that a simultaneous strategy elicits significantly greater total concessions from client managers and also generates more positive attitudes toward the auditor. We also manipulate the magnitude of the issues negotiated and find that significantly greater concessions are offered when larger issues are presented first. These findings have important implications for auditors, as they suggest that negotiating issues simultaneously and presenting larger issues first can result in significantly improved negotiation outcomes.

AB  - Background: From the theory of compensatory Internet use, escapism through videogames may constitute a coping strategy that is sometimes helpful but, in some cases, maladaptive. To date, however, evidence supporting this view has been gathered only through the use of explicit self-reported questionnaires, which are known to be biased. Accordingly, the aim of the current study was to test whether the escapism motive is related to a preference for the virtual environment.
   Method: A laboratory task that allowed the measurement of implicit attitudes, namely, the Affect Misattribution Procedure, was created with stimuli from real world and videogames. The task was administered online with a series of questionnaire and completed by 273 online gamers from the community.
   Results: Participants had more positive attitudes toward pictures depicting virtual environments than toward those depicting real environments. Furthermore, participants who frequently used videogames to escape real life and were highly engaged in video gaming had a more pronounced positive implicit attitude toward virtual environments.
   Discussion: This study contributes to a better understanding of the psychological processes underlying escapism in videogames and calls for a refinement of the escapism construct, which can be related to both problematic (i.e., potential coping strategy) and nonproblematic patterns of videogame use. Among the limitations, it should be noted that the selection of stimuli related to videogames is restricted to one genre of game, and that the participants' environment could not be controlled due to the online design.

AB  - Conservation science has rapidly adopted citizen science to engage the public in knowledge generation, developing environmental policies, solving localized environmental issues, and generating public support for environmental management. For conservation benefits to be just and equitable, it is important to ensure under served groups have the opportunity to contribute to citizen science, but the barriers and drivers for their participation are poorly understood. This study explores the perspectives of young adults (18-50 years) who feed wild birds. Their cohort is underrepresented in Project FeederWatch, a large-scale North American citizen science project. Interviews with 72 young adults who do not participate in Project FeederWatch, reveal their motivations to feed birds to be primarily for the benefits it provides for themselves (such as experiencing nature, joy and relaxation) and helping the birds survive. An additional motivation, previously undetected, is to share their feeder bird experiences with others in their social networks. The interviewees hold positive attitudes towards involvement in, and outcomes of Project FeederWatch, although some concerns and barriers to participation are particular to their age group. Most notably, limits on their time and financial resources typical for their life-stage present substantial challenges to their involvement. Project design elements including simple instructions and protocol, a mobile app, and reminders will enable their participation. Social norms related to participation in citizen science are found to be weak. This exploratory work is essential for further research on young adults' involvement in knowledge generation to inform conservation science and practice.

AB  - Research links intrinsic religiousness to less prejudice toward Black people and greater prejudice toward gay people. We examined longitudinally in a sample of 865 adolescents three variables that might serve as a mediator of attitudes toward Black people yet produce a suppression effect in attitudes toward gay people: (a) humanitarian values, (b) favorable evaluations of social groups, and (c) socially desirable responding. In light of evidence that Black people on average are more religious than are White people, we also examined whether self-identifying as Black helped explain racial prejudice. Our mediation analyses provided strong evidence that humanitarian values and the tendency to view all social groups favorably accounted for the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and positive attitudes toward Black people. We found no support that socially desirable responding or identifying as Black accounted for our effects. Consistent with a suppression effect, controlling statistically for the agreeable aspects of religiousness strengthened the relationship between intrinsic religiousness and prejudice toward gay people. These findings illustrate mechanisms through which intrinsic religiousness can correspond both positively and negatively with attitudes toward marginalized groups.

AB  - Educational and technical resources are regarded as central in combating disinformation and safeguarding democracy in an era of 'fake news'. In this study, we investigated whether a professional fact-checking tool could be utilised in curricular activity to make pupils more skilled in determining the credibility of digital news and to inspire them to use digital tools to further their transliteracy and technocognition. In addition, we explored how pupils' performance and attitudes regarding digital news and tools varied across four countries (France, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). Our findings showed that a two-hour intervention had a statistically significant impact on teenagers' abilities to determine the credibility of fake images and videos. We also found that the intervention inspired pupils to use digital tools in information credibility assessments. Importantly, the intervention did not make pupils more sceptical of credible news. The impact of the intervention was greater in Romania and Spain than among pupils in Sweden and France. The greater impact in these two countries, we argue, is due to cultural context and the fact that pupils in Romania and Spain learned to focus less on 'gut feelings', increased their use of digital tools, and had a more positive attitude toward the use of the fact-checking tool than pupils in Sweden and France.

AB  - Purpose Shifting to mobile-based banking transactions from physical banking transactions can be considered as a social distancing mechanism, which helps to prevent the spread of Covid-19 virus. As the spread of Covid-19 is expected to continue for long, the continued usage of mobile-based payment services as a strategy to maintain social distancing has to prevail. Hence, this study aims to propose an integrated framework of mobile payments adoption and its continuance intention by integrating health belief model (HBM) and expectation confirmation model (ECM) of information system continuance. Design/methodology/approach The subject of the study constitutes new adopters of mobile payments. A total of 654 respondents participated in the survey. The conceptual model was empirically validated using structural equation modeling and serial mediation analysis. Findings The study found that the HBM constructs, namely, perceived severity, perceived susceptibility and self-efficacy significantly influenced adoption/confirmation of mobile-based payment services. The continuance intention was significantly predicted by perceived usefulness and perceived satisfaction. Furthermore, the perceived health threat (comprising perceived severity and perceived susceptibility) indirectly affects continuance intention through confirmation, perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Practical implications There are short-term and long-term implications for the study. Short-term implications include triggering the HBM at policy levels, to adopt mobile payments/banking as a means of social distancing in the wake of the increasing threat of Covid-19 in India. Long-term implication for service providers is to convert adopters into loyal consumers by enhancing usefulness and satisfaction. Originality/value The study proposes a novel attempt to explain the adoption and continuance of mobile-based payment as a preventive health behavior to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. The study proposes an integrated framework of HBM and ECM to explain pre-adoption and post-adoption behavior of consumers with respect to mobile-based payment services during Covid-19 context.

AB  - Public Significance Statement People view highly prototypical gay men to be more identified and involved with the gay community compared to low prototypical gay men. Additionally, perceivers treated highly prototypical gay men with more prejudice than low prototypical gay men. Perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution were found to mediate the relationship between prototypicality and discrimination.
   The current study assessed how the extent to which a gay man resembled a prototypical gay man influenced the judgements others made about them. We hypothesized that highly prototypical gay men would be perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes of gay men, engage in more activities within the gay community, viewed less positively by others, and receive more discrimination. Additionally, perceived group identification and negative stereotypes attributed to the gay man were expected to serially mediate the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, positive attitudes, and discrimination from others. Participants (N = 364) were randomly assigned to view stimuli depicting either a low or high prototypical gay man. High prototypical gay men were perceived to be more identified with the gay community, possess more negative stereotypes, and engage in more stereotypical immoral activities, than low prototypical gay men. Moreover, perceived group identification and negative stereotype attribution serially mediated the relationship between prototypicality and perceived engagement in gay activities, attitudes toward target, and discrimination. Implications for the Prejudice Distribution Account are discussed.

AB  - Cause-related marketing improves corporate image and consumer attitudes toward brands. An important research gap is how the visual attention paid to cause-related cues in social media affect consumer attitudes and behaviors. In the present study, we analyze the moderating role of the visual attention paid to Instagram-based, cause-related posts on the impact of consumer perceptions (i.e., corporate image), beliefs (trust), and attitudes (i.e., corporate social responsibility [CSR] support) on behavioral intentions (i.e., cause participation, consumer advocacy, and intention to share posts) for fast-food restaurants. Data for the study were collected in a between-subjects experiment with 123 participants. Visual attention was measured using eye-tracking technology, and consumer attitudes and behavioral intentions through an online survey. The results show that the greater the attention paid to images (amount and duration of fixations) and the more revisits made lead to more positive attitudes and behaviors toward the cause and the company. On the other hand, the more time spent looking at the company's responses to negative user-generated content weakens the relationship between trust and consumer advocacy toward the company. These results can help practitioners design appropriate cause-related marketing strategies in social media.

AB  - The core idea of the find-remind-and-bind theory articulated by (Algoe, 2012, Social and Personality Psychology Compass, 6, 455) is that receiving expressed gratitude facilitates positive attitudes toward the expressor such as increased prosocial behaviour. The current study tries to observe the phenomena in Japan where apologies are sometimes used when people express gratitude. In this experimental study, 671 Japanese participants received expressions of gratitude, apologies, both, or neither (control condition) in exchange for their help. The results showed that expressed gratitude had the most positive effect compared to the control, apology and both conditions; that is, expressed gratitude most strongly facilitated the message receiver's prosocial behaviour, self-disclosure, predicted outcome values, and social worth. Expressed apologies showed a limited positive effect. A structural equation model further indicated that predicted outcome values and social worth functioned in unique ways to mediate the link between expressed gratitude and prosocial behaviour as well as self-disclosure.

AB  - Background: During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of conspiracy theories have emerged. A popular theory posits that the pandemic is a hoax and suggests that certain hospitals are "empty." Research has shown that accepting conspiracy theories increases the likelihood that an individual may ignore government advice about social distancing and other public health interventions. Due to the possibility of a second wave and future pandemics, it is important to gain an understanding of the drivers of misinformation and strategies to mitigate it.
   Objective: This study set out to evaluate the #FilmYourHospital conspiracy theory on Twitter, attempting to understand the drivers behind it. More specifically, the objectives were to determine which online sources of information were used as evidence to support the theory, the ratio of automated to organic accounts in the network, and what lessons can be learned to mitigate the spread of such a conspiracy theory in the future.
   Methods: Twitter data related to the #FilmYourHospital hashtag were retrieved and analyzed using social network analysis across a 7-day period from April 13-20, 2020. The data set consisted of 22,785 tweets and 11,333 Twitter users. The Botometer tool was used to identify accounts with a higher probability of being bots.
   Results: The most important drivers of the conspiracy theory are ordinary citizens; one of the most influential accounts is a Brexit supporter. We found that YouTube was the information source most linked to by users. The most retweeted post belonged to a verified Twitter user, indicating that the user may have had more influence on the platform. There was a small number of automated accounts (bots) and deleted accounts within the network.
   Conclusions: Hashtags using and sharing conspiracy theories can be targeted in an effort to delegitimize content containing misinformation. Social media organizations need to bolster their efforts to label or remove content that contains misinformation. Public health authorities could enlist the assistance of influencers in spreading antinarrative content.

AB  - In this study, an experiment was used to examine the effects of employee norm-violations in the service encounter with respect to what was considered appropriate behavior (e.g., social distancing) during the 2020 corona pandemic. The participants were exposed to a grocery store employee whose behavior was manipulated (norm-violating vs. norm-confirming). Norm-violating behavior resulted in lower perceived employee warmth, lower perceived employee competence, higher disgust, and more dehumanization of the employee. These responses mediated the impact of employee behavior on customer satisfaction, so that satisfaction was attenuated when norms were violated. The mediators, however, typically also instill a hostile, avoidance-seeking mindset for those who are subject to norm violations, which is likely to result in problems when transgressors are to be persuaded to change their behaviors.

AB  - Schools are expected to contribute to preparing students for engaged citizenship. Research shows that open classroom discussions on political issues have a positive effect on political attitudes and behaviour. However, a deeper understanding of why students perceive their classrooms as open for discussion is missing. The purpose of this study is to examine how deliberative democratic theory can be used to explain such perceptions. We argue that the openness of the discussion climate is positively affected by, on the one hand, a context of good student-teacher relations characterised by fairness and respect, and, on the other hand, by the level of collective efficacy, which is the perception of responsiveness of the school towards student demands. Using multilevel analyses on the European data of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), we find that these predictors are significant at the student level and the school level. This means that both the individual experience of a student as well as the average school's score on good student-teacher relations and collective efficacy affect how students perceive the discussion climate. Our findings, based on high-quality survey data from 22 countries, are a significant contribution to clarifying the underlying mechanism leading to an open classroom climate. As such discussions have proven to be an effective way to stimulate political engagement, we conclude that a school context characterised by fairness and responsiveness, should not be overlooked by schools and policy.

AB  - As the use of mobile phones for health promotion continues to grow, more work needs to be done to determine which health communication strategies are influential on mobile devices. In two studies conducted with college women in the United States, we assessed the potential for the use of narratives, a strategy found successful in a number of communication channels, in a text-message intervention. The first study consisted of seven focus groups with young women (n = 31) about their perceptions of narrative storylines in a text-message intervention about alcohol and casual sexual encounters. In a second study, we then used an experiment (n = 137) to test the potential of narrative messages to influence transportation, counter-arguing, identification, attitudes toward the intervention type, and attitudes toward the messages. Results showed that women were interested in the possibility of receiving health messages, including narrative health messages, via text message. However, the experiment found limited differences between narrative, non-narrative, and control conditions. Transportation was greater in the narrative condition than in the control, but did not significantly differ from the non-narrative condition. Counter-arguing was also greater in the narrative condition than in the non-narrative condition. Participants who viewed the narrative messages had more positive attitudes toward the messages. Based on both studies, we found that the use of narratives in text messages may be a promising strategy, but it may be a challenge to craft effective content.

AB  - This study tests the effect of pharmaceutical Direct-to-Consumer Advertising (DTCA) for antidepressants on perceived stigma surrounding mental disorders. We randomly assigned participants into one of three experimental conditions: antidepressant DTCA with portrayals of discrimination, cognitive separation, and stereotyping (DCSS), antidepressant DTCA without these representations, or a no-exposure control. Contrary to study hypotheses, participants who viewed ads containing portrayals of DCSS were significantly less likely to want to socially distance themselves from those with mental illnesses than those assigned to the no-exposure control condition, even when controlling for demographics and personal experience with mental illness. We discuss plausible explanations for the unexpected pattern of effects and resulting implications for future research on the topic.

TI  - 'People and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense'? Locating the tenant's voice in Homes in High Flats
T2  - WOMENS HISTORY REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - In recent years, the social research of Pearl Jephcott has been subject to scholarly reappraisal on the grounds that it displays an early commitment to the unmediated reporting of 'the authentic voice of her participants'. This article investigates the extent to which this claim holds for Jephcott's seminal 1971 study Homes in High Flats. It suggests that, although Homes in High Flats sought to investigate 'people and their homes rather than housing in the usual sense', the study's ability to realise this aim was complicated by the social distance obtaining between researcher and researched. Based on re-analysis of the study's archived research materials, the article explores how this distance mediated the researchers' interpretation and re-presentation of the tenant's voice, deepening understanding of the epistemological premises of Jephcott's work.

AB  - Food marketing targeted to Black and Latino adolescents primarily promotes energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and likely contributes to diet-related health disparities. Targeted marketing raises further public health concerns as Black and Latino youth are also exposed to greater amounts of unhealthy food marketing in the media and their communities. However, little is known about Black and Latino adolescents' attitudes toward brands and marketing that target them directly. Focus groups with Black and Latino adolescents (N= 51) explored their attitudes toward targeted and non-targeted brands of food, beverages, and restaurants. Pile sorting activities using cards printed with targeted and non-targeted brand logos were used as an elicitation technique. Overall, participants indicated more positive attitudes about the targeted brands discussed in the focus groups than the non-targeted brands, and participants often described targeted brands as being for someone most like them. Some participants expressed appreciation for marketing that recognized "someone like them" as potential consumers, while others raised ethical issues regarding targeting of unhealthy foods. Participants' strong affinity for targeted brands, and ambivalent attitudes about targeted marketing of unhealthy products, highlight an opportunity to increase awareness of food marketing targeting communities of color and address targeted marketing through countermarketing and grassroots advocacy campaigns.

AB  - Background: Clinical practice guidelines generally recommend clinicians use self-management support (SMS) when managing patients with spine pain. However, even within the educational setting, the implementation of SMS remains suboptimal. The objectives of this study were to 1) estimate the organizational readiness for change toward using SMS at the Canadian Memorial Chiropractic College (CMCC), Toronto, Ontario from the perspective of directors and deans, 2) estimate the attitudes and self-reported behaviours towards using evidence-based practice (EBP), and beliefs about pain management among supervisory clinicians and chiropractic interns, 3) identify potential barriers and enablers to using SMS, and 4) design a theory-based tailored Knowledge Translation (KT) intervention to increase the use of SMS.
   Methods: Mixed method design. We administered three self-administered questionnaires to assess clinicians' and interns' attitudes and behaviours toward EBP, beliefs about pain management, and practice style. In addition, we conducted 3 focus groups with clinicians and interns based on the Theoretical Domain Framework (TDF) to explore their beliefs about using SMS for patients with spine pain. Data were analysed using deductive thematic analysis by 2 independent assessors. A panel of 7 experts mapped behaviour change techniques to key barriers identified informing the design of a KT intervention.
   Results: Participants showed high level of EBP knowledge, positive attitude of EBP, and moderate frequency of EBP use. A number of barrier factors were identified from clinicians (N = 6) and interns (N = 16) corresponding to 7 TDF domains: Knowledge; Skills; Environmental context and resources; Emotion; Beliefs about Capabilities; Memory, attention & decision making; and Social Influence. To address these barriers, the expert panel proposed a multifaceted KT intervention composed of a webinar and online educational module on a SMS guided by the Brief Action Planning, clinical vignettes, training workshop, and opinion leader support.
   Conclusion: SMS strategies can help maximizing the health care services for patients with spine pain. This may in turn optimize patients' health. The proposed theory-based KT intervention may facilitate the implementation of SMS among clinicians and interns.

AB  - Purpose: Public stigma is an important barrier to the recovery of patients with psychosis. This study aimed to explore public stigma associated with a newly adopted Chinese name for psychosis si-jue-shi-tiao' in a representative Chinese population in Hong Kong, focusing on factors contributing to public stigma. Exposure to mass media and its relationship with the stigma were explored in detail.
   Methods: Random telephone survey of general population in Hong Kong was conducted. Information including basic demographics, psychosis literacy, recent news recall about psychosis and stigma, measured with the revised Link's Perceived Discrimination-Devaluation Scale (LPDDS) were obtained. Univariate analysis of LPDDS score and demographic variables, news exposure, previous contacts with people with psychosis and knowledge about psychosis were conducted. Further hierarchical regression analysis was performed.
   Results: A total of 1,016 subjects were interviewed. The sample was comparable with the whole Hong Kong population aged 18 years and above. Those of female gender, with higher educational level and better knowledge about symptoms and treatment of psychosis had higher score of LPDDS. The model significantly explained 8.3% of variance of LPDDS score (F(7, 895)=12.606, p<.0001, p<.0001). The negative news recall had trend significance in the model.
   Conclusion: The finding suggested that discrimination among the general public against people with psychosis was still common. Specific strategies will need to be established in targeting media news reporting about psychosis, knowledge disseminating and needs of specific population. Further researches should be conducted to understand the mechanisms of the stigma development in relation to these factors so that more focused and effective strategies could be developed.

AB  - Collaborations between influencers and brands have become increasingly popular in recent years. Previous research has mainly focused on influencer marketing as a commercial action designed to enhance followers' perceptions and reactions toward promoted brands, ignoring the consequences of these promotional actions on influencers' credibility and their relationships with their followers. This research sheds light on the topic by exploring how influencers' promotional actions affect their credibility, and followers' attitudes and behavioral responses toward the influencer (i.e., to continue following, imitate, and recommend them to other users). A study addressed to the followers of a popular influencer was carried out to test the research model. The results showed that perceived influencer-product congruence positively affects followers' perceptions of the credibility of, and attitude toward, influencers, and negatively affects perceptions of paid communication. Followers' perceptions that influencers have been paid to take part in promotional activities harms their credibility; however, credibility is essential for generating positive attitudes toward the influencer. Finally, both perceived credibility and attitude foster positive behavioral responses toward the influencer; influencers must enhance these factors to retain their influencing capacity. This research provides managerial implications for influencers and brands that can help enhance followers' experiences when exposed to promotions on social media.

AB  - Objectively, the purpose of this study aims to re-confirm and analyze the relationship between variables through direct relationships and mediation (i.e., career optimism (CO), organizational fairness (OF), organizational entrepreneurship commitment (OEC) on employee engagement). This study also addresses whether career optimism provides a strong-impact if it mediates other antecedent variables on employee engagement. Therefore, to test and prove this, we made observations on 200 samples comprising lecturers in Indonesia. The data collection method uses a survey both offline and online. Through the PLS-SEM approach, the statistical testing demonstration states that all hypotheses, either through direct relationship or mediation, are proven to have a positive and significant effect. Career optimism has also proven to be a substantial and positive contribution to testing employee engagement as a mediating variable. The results of seven hypothesis testing in our study confirm that the broaden-built theory and organizational theory are closely related. Therefore, this study positively contributes to human resource management's science to balance the psychological and organizational aspects. In this study, we also add that consistency and a positive attitude in a career trigger a person's career optimization in a better and more positive direction, especially for career-path and employee engagement.

AB  - In a democratic society, school has the goal to foster democratic attitudes in students. Besides explicit attempts to do so, justice experiences in school may be crucial to develop positive attitudes towards democracy. Therefore, we studied the relationship between different dimensions of justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes. We further examined a potential mechanism underlying this relationship, namely general trust, and hypothesized that the relationship between justice experiences in school and democratic attitudes can be understood on the basis of social exchange theory. A total of 210 participants who had visited a public school gave information about their justice experiences in school, general trust, and democratic attitudes. First, it was shown that overall experiences of distributive and interactional justice predict democratic attitudes, more specifically the approval of civic and human rights and the approval of the democratic institutions. Second, we found that the relationships between overall distributive and interactional justice and the approval of civic and human rights, the approval of the democratic institutions, and the approval of democracy-supporting behaviors are each mediated by general trust which can be interpreted as a social exchange process. This study therefore highlights the role of general justice-related school experiences for the development of democratic attitudes.

AB  - This research aims at providing a new model of consumers' personal space to limit the spread of contagious disease while shopping in person. To this end, it adopts an agents-based simulation approach to model consumers' movements in the store during COVID-19 pandemic. Findings show the extent to which consumers' contacts with others increase the risk of contagion, due to the occurrence of social gatherings in certain areas. Specifically, there is a linear correlation between the number of consumers in the store and the number of consumers susceptible to contract the disease. Thus, the personal space from a psychological perception becomes an individual and compulsory boundary to protect consumers from contagious disease. Finally, our results extend the concept of social distance and personal space while shopping, and support retailers to provide safer shopping experiences.

AB  - Research has shown that accounting for moral sentiment in natural language can yield insight into a variety of on- and off-line phenomena such as message diffusion, protest dynamics, and social distancing. However, measuring moral sentiment in natural language is challenging, and the difficulty of this task is exacerbated by the limited availability of annotated data. To address this issue, we introduce the Moral Foundations Twitter Corpus, a collection of 35,108 tweets that have been curated from seven distinct domains of discourse and hand annotated by at least three trained annotators for 10 categories of moral sentiment. To facilitate investigations of annotator response dynamics, we also provide psychological and demographic metadata for each annotator. Finally, we report moral sentiment classification baselines for this corpus using a range of popular methodologies.

AB  - The current worldwide COVID19 pandemic has required the rapid and drastic adoption of social distancing and protective measures as the leading method for reducing the spread of the disease and death. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of such measures in a large sample of the Brazilian population. We relied on recreancy theory, which argues that confidence in the ability of social institutions and perceived vulnerability to the disease are central factors predicting the adoption of these behaviors. Our results, drawn from 7554 respondents, indicate that self-confidence in the ability to carry out these behaviors, confidence in the ability of social institutions such as the government, hospitals, health workers and the media to cope with the pandemic crisis, and risk perceptions are associated with the adoption of preventive behaviors. Our results expand the recreancy theory and show that beyond the main effects, the effect of perceived vulnerability depends on the values of self-confidence and confidence in social institutions. The theoretical implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine antecedents of customer engagement on social media and how these platforms can enhance customers' continuation intention. Customer engagement is manifested by the continued use of social media and is expected to occur when customers have a positive attitude toward social media. Thus, the main objective of this research is to explore the factors that affect customers' attitude toward social media, which in turn is expected to result in customer engagement. Attitude toward social media is proposed to have an impact on levels of use and satisfaction is proposed to have a direct impact on customer engagement. An extended technology acceptance model (TAM) is used as the basic model guiding this research.
   Design/methodology/approach - The theoretical model is tested drawing on the results of empirical work in the form of a large scale survey conducted on a random sample of the US general population. Data collection resulted in 388 usable questionnaires. Structural equation modeling is used to analyze data.
   Findings - Results of this research provide support to the research objectives. Two of the three proposed factors extending TAM, namely, perceived connectedness and enjoyment were found to have a significant effect on attitude toward social media use. Attitude toward social media use was found to have a significant effect on level of use and level of use was found to have a significant effect on continuation intention. Additionally, satisfaction was found to have a significant direct effect on continuation intention.
   Practical implications - Findings of this research provide managers with useful insights about what they need to focus on when designing their social media strategies.
   Originality/value - This study provides a different way of theorizing customer engagement by incorporating new variables to TAM that are particularly relevant to the social media context. It also draws a link between attitude toward social media and levels of use, which has been understudied in literature.

AB  - How do religious affiliation and beliefs shape vaccine attitudes and behaviors? This study examined the associations of attitudes and behaviors relevant to the flu, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR), and human-papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines with religious affiliations, as well as philosophical, spiritual, and moral beliefs. Respondents were 3005 adults from a probability-based, four-wave panel survey in the United States. Longitudinal structural equation modeling examined how religious affiliations and philosophical/moral beliefs shaped attitudes toward vaccines and actual vaccination. Stronger philosophical beliefs predicted more negative attitudes toward each vaccine and stronger moral beliefs more negative attitudes toward the HPV vaccine. Negative vaccine attitudes then predicted weaker intentions to encourage others to vaccinate and lower probability of receiving a vaccine. Theoretical and public health messaging implications are discussed.

AB  - Health brands are based on the relations between individuals and health behaviors and lifestyles. Brands can be measured by the brand equity construct validated in previous studies. The National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign brands alternative, non-drug use behaviors as a behavior change strategy. This study goes beyond previous campaign evaluations, which did not include specific brand equity measurements. Using data from a nationally representative media tracking, this study examined the relation between antidrug campaign brand equity and adoption of targeted attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Data were gathered before the relaunch of the campaign, and follow-up data collected 3 months later. On the basis of factor analysis, the authors developed a higher order antidrug brand equity factor and regressed campaign outcomes on that factor in multivariable models. The authors observed significant effects of higher brand equity on higher levels of targeted antidrug attitudes and normative beliefs at follow-up. The authors also observed some counterintuitive relations (i.e., less positive attitudes at follow-up). They interpreted these results in light of the changing messages and campaign strategy. The authors conclude that antidrug brand equity is an important construct for understanding campaign effectiveness. The present campaign shows signs of changing targeted antidrug attitudes and beliefs among youth with brand equity.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has made videoconferencing tools an essential part of our lives as these tools are what allowed us to keep in touch in a time of social distancing. Having said that, however, many people have found virtual interactions to be surprisingly exhausting. This has given rise to the concept of Zoom fatigue. The purpose of this article is to explore the dynamics that give rise to this peculiar phenomenon. The article first discusses the concept of Zoom fatigue and critiques the brain-centrism of current explanations. It then proposes a more embodied approach to interaction, discusses the mediating role of technology in videoconferencing, and proceeds to presents a list of five videoconferencing dynamics that may induce Zoom fatigue: Awkward turn-taking, inhibited spontaneity, restricted motility, lack of eye contact and increased self-awareness. Finally, it is argued that these dynamics should make us temper our collective expectations about the hybrid future.

AB  - Sharks are crucial to the marine ecosystem, but they are critically declining. Their bad public image explains, to some extent, the lesser concern for their conservation compared to other marine species. Extending previous research which has mainly focused on the study of attitudes towards sharks, we propose a two studies sequence, first by exploring the shark's social representation, followed by an exploration of some stereotypical traits that may affect attitudes toward shark conservation. Study 1 specifically exploreed the social representation of sharks in a sample of zoo goers (N = 979). Main results showed that the representation was ambivalent and participants considered sharks as human predators. Surprisingly, findings showed that sharks were also seen as highly agentic and little communal animals. Consequently, Study 2 (N = 60) was designed to more thoroughly explore this gendered view as well as its implications in the attitudes and behavioral intention towards shark conservation. Results showed that, although sharks were again perceived as highly agentic, it was the perception of the sharks' communality that was associated with more positive attitudes towards their conservation and a higher tendency to choose a shark conservation trust as first choice. Implications of studies 1 and 2 results for sharks' conservation communication strategies and policies are discussed.

AB  - It is well established that emphasizing a biogenetic etiology of mental health problems in anti-stigma interventions inadvertently increases potentially stigmatizing attitudes. The "mixed-blessings" model suggests that biogenetic explanations and greater stigma are linked by essentialism. The present study tests this hypothesis experimentally. In this online experiment, 367 subjects read either a biogenetic or a psychosocial explanation for the etiology of schizophrenia, followed by a vignette describing an individual who has schizophrenia. Subsequently, we measured (a) causal beliefs on the etiology of schizophrenia (as a manipulation check), (b) the degree of essentialist beliefs (mediator), (c) the extent to which subjects subscribed to assumptions of dangerousness, (d) prognostic pessimism, and (e) desire for social distance. Subjects reported a stronger agreement with the etiology they had been presented. Against our expectations, this did not result in higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes in the biogenetic vignette group. Correspondingly, mediation through essentialism could not be tested. In the psychosocial vignette group, biogenetic causal beliefs were associated with a stronger desire for social distance. Essentialist thinking fully mediated this effect. The evidence we found for the assumptions of the mixed-blessings extended to the psychosocial vignette group only. We explain this by the subjects' different readiness to subscribe to biogenetic and psychosocial causal beliefs. We argue that the same levels of essentialism between the experimental groups contributed to the equal levels of stigmatizing attitudes. This underlines the fundamental importance of essentialism in stigma, going beyond a role in the psychological effects of biogenetic causal models.

AB  - Sexting (sending, receiving, and forwarding nude, semi-nude, or sexually explicit content) entails risks for adolescents; therefore, it is important for parents to be able to communicate with their children about its implications. The goal of the present study was to identify parental characteristics that lead to dysfunctional communication (lower quality of communication) about sexting, on a sample of 427 parents (336 mothers and 91 fathers) of Israeli adolescents aged 10-18 years and to determine whether parents' perceived severity of sexting and the degree to which they perceive their adolescent to be susceptible to sexting function as mediating factors. Parents completed a set of questionnaires online. Findings indicated that authoritarian and permissive parenting styles were positively associated with dysfunctional parent-child communication about sexting. Authoritative style was inversely related to dysfunctional communication and was mediated by positive attitudes toward sex education. Additionally, authoritative parents were capable of assessing the severity of their children's sexting activities, and the degree to which their children were susceptible to engage in sexting. The quality of the discussion initiated by authoritative parents appears to have enabled them to be aware of adolescent behaviors and to adjust their communication about the inherent risks. Findings suggest that the perception of sexting as too risky diminishes parents' ability to conduct a high-quality discussion about it. In conclusion, research findings emphasize parents' role in mediation of the online experiences of their children and conducting a constructive discussions with them about sexting.

AB  - Sapmi is a geographical area that runs across the Kola Peninsula in Russia to northern Finland, Norway and Sweden. All Sami languages have been going through a rapid language change process and many of the traditional language domains have disappeared during the last decades due to previous national and local language policies. Nevertheless, recent growth of positive attitudes towards Sami languages and culture both within and outside the Sami group has given new momentum to the language revitalisation process. At the same time, English is becoming more present in the Sami context through tourism, media and popular culture. This study investigates 15-year-old writers' meaning-making in three languages they meet on a daily basis: North Sami, the majority language Finnish/Norwegian/Swedish and English. Data were collected in schools where writers wrote two texts in each language, one argumentative and one descriptive. Using a functional approach, we analyse how three writers make meaning across three languages and two genres. Results show that writers made use of similar ways of expressing meaning on the three levels we investigated: ideational, interpersonal and textual, but also how the production differed between the texts, and how context and content interacted with writers' meaning-making in the three languages.

AB  - Reflection offers an important means to learn effectively from changes induced by the workplace. The authors examined readiness to change and work-related self-determination as preconditions for reflection at work and expected personal initiative-defined as self-starting and proactive behaviour-to have a mediating effect. The study tested these relations using a questionnaire with 84 client advisors working in retail banking departments. These client advisors were about to undergo a range of changes in their workplaces at the time of the data collection. The changes-most importantly, the implementation of a new advisory concept accompanied by new advisory software-afforded these individuals the opportunity to learn. Further, the study conceptualised self-determination as an individual's experience of autonomy, competence and social integration at work. Regression analyses revealed that social integration and perceived competence exert positive effects on reflection. The results indicate that personal initiative mediates the relationship between readiness to change and reflection as well as the relationship between all facets of self-determination and reflection. This paper discusses these findings in terms of their theoretical contribution to the literature on workplace learning and in relation to the practical importance of developing positive attitudes toward changes at work and active work behaviours for change-related learning activities such as reflection to succeed.

AB  - The present study examined the mediating role of pleasure in parenting in the link between fathers' attachment representations and paternal sensitivity among 138 father-infant dyads from a rural part of the southeastern United States. First-time fathers' attachment representations were assessed using the Adult Attachment Interview (AAI) prenatally. Pleasure in parenting-a multidimensional construct assessing positive attitudes and beliefs toward the parenting role-was coded from fathers' interviews at 3 months. Paternal sensitivity was coded from father-infant play interactions at 12 months. Results indicated that fathers with secure-autonomous adult attachment representations showed more pleasure in parenting. In turn, fathers who took more pleasure in parenting also interacted more sensitively during father-infant interactions. Moreover, although the direct association between fathers' attachment representations and sensitivity was nonsignificant, the indirect effect from secure-autonomous representations to sensitivity via pleasure in parenting was significant. Findings suggest that first-time fathers' parenting attitudes may play a role in transmitting representations of early caregiving experiences to sensitive interactions with their own infants.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic brought along with it concerns about anxiety, racial bias, and pushback against public health recommendations, all of which are intensified by the news and social media. This study investigated the effects of constructive journalism in the context of this crisis, by randomly assigning 492 subjects to view simulated social media news updates with different headlines and images. The results showed positive and constructive headlines led to less anger and anxiety than negative headlines. The sanitization of graphic images decreased anger, anxiety, COVID-19 risk perceptions, and anti-Chinese sentiment-a relationship that was mediated by anger and anxiety. These findings suggest constructive journalism can be useful in times of crisis, and that its visual aspect warrants more scholarly attention. Further, these results shed new light on the effects of news exposure via social media in times of crisis, and how this impact depends on specific attributes of the headlines and images of the content being shared. The findings are discussed in relation to the theory of affective intelligence and recent concerns about how news and social media influence the public in times of crisis.

AB  - Aims: Demography of patients and complexity in the management of multimorbid conditions has made collaborative practice a necessity for the future, also in Switzerland. Since 2012, the University of Applied Sciences (UAS) and its Healthcare School as well as the University of Geneva (UG) with its Medical Faculty have joined forces to implement a training program in collaborative practice, using simulation as one of the main learning/teaching process.
   Methods: The actual program consists of three sequential modules and totalizes 300 h of teaching and learning for approximately 1400-1500 students from six tracks (nutritionists, physiotherapists, midwives, nurses, technologists in medical radiology, physicians); in 2019 another hundred pharmacists will also be included. The main issues addressed by the modules are
   Module 1: the Swiss healthcare system and collaborative tools.
   Module 2: roles and responsibilities of the different health professionals, basic tools acquisition in team working (situation monitoring, mutual support, communication).
   Module 3: the axis of quality and safety of care through different contexts and cases.
   Conclusions: A very first evaluation of the teaching and learning and particularly on the aspects of acquisition of collaborative tools shows positive attitudes of students towards the implementation of this new training program. Furthermore, a pre-post questionnaire on teamwork aspects reveals significant modifications.

AB  - Connectivity is intrinsic to all aspects of our life today, be it political, economic, technological, scientific, or personal. Higher education is also transcending the previous paradigm of technology enabled content delivery and e-learning, with a new emphasis on connectivity, enabling participants to exchange knowledge and collaborate to meet educational goals. In this study, a social media technology supported website-digiMe-was developed and evaluated at the School of Medicine of one Australian university. Connectivity to other medical learners and health professionals is intrinsic to digiMe. This paper reports the functionalities of this website, results of a post-intervention evaluative survey, and statistics of website usage generated from Google Analytics. The results revealed more active adoptions and a more positive attitude towards digiMe from Year 4 students compared to Year 5 students. The participants showed a desire for access to a recommended collection of apps, such as those offered through digiMe. However, many participants did not use digiMe beyond initial introduction to it. digiMe demonstrated its potential in raising awareness of web and mobile apps useful for enhancing connectivity, although it needs to be introduced to students in earlier years of their medical education to achieve a higher impact on their learning.

AB  - We introduce intergroup disgust as an individual difference and contextual manipulation. As an individual difference, intergroup disgust sensitivity (ITG-DS) represents affect-laden revulsion toward social outgroups, incorporating beliefs in stigma transfer and social superiority. Study 1 (5 samples, N = 708) validates the ITG-DS scale. Higher ITG-DS scorers demonstrated greater general disgust sensitivity, disease concerns, authoritarian/conservative ideologies, and negative affect Greater ITG-DS correlated with stronger outgroup threat perceptions and discrimination, and uniquely predicted negative outgroup attitudes beyond well-established prejudice-predictors. Intergroup disgust was experimentally manipulated in Study 2, exposing participants (n = 164) to a travel blog concerning contact with a disgust-evoking (vs. neutral) outgroup. Manipulated disgust generated negative outgroup evaluations through greater threat and anxiety. This mediation effect was moderated: Those higher (vs. lower) in ITG-DS did not experience stronger disgust, threat, or anxiety reactions, but demonstrated stronger translation of aversive reactions (especially outgroup threat) into negative attitudes. Theory development and treatment implications are considered. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the perceptions of pregnant women about COVID-19 and the prevalence of common mental disorders during the implemented social distancing period.
   METHODS: This was an observational, cross-sectional study using digital media, of pregnant women exposed to social distancing due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in Fortaleza, Ceara, Northeastern Brazil. Common mental disorders were estimated using the modified Self-Report Questionnaire-20 (SRQ-20) scale, and the feelings towards COVID-19 were assessed using the Fear of COVID-19 scale through telephone calls made in May 2020. COX multivariate regression models were used to verify the associations.
   RESULTS: Of the 1,041 pregnant women, 45.7% (95%CI: 42.7-48.8) had common mental disorders (CMD). All items of the Fear of COVID-19 Scale showed a significant association with the prevalence of CMD (p < 0.001). A CMD risk gradient was observed, going from a prevalence ratio of 1.52 (95%CI: 1.13-2.04) in pregnant women with two positive items to 2.70 (95%CI: 2.08-3.51) for those with four positive items. Early gestational age and the lack of prenatal care were also associated with CMD.
   CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of common mental disorders in pregnant women was high during the period of social distancing and was aggravated by negative feelings towards COVID-19.

AB  - Learner-Generated Digital Media (LGDM) has become prevalent in higher education. Frameworks have been developed for video-making in the classroom that consider technical requirements, pedagogies, and the combination of both. However, missing is a practical model to guide academics and students on the implementation of LGDM assignments. This research aims to test a model to design, implement, and evaluate LGDM as an assessment tool. The model was built based on research gaps and it considers the following elements: (1) pedagogy, (2) student training, (3) hosting of videos, (4) marking schemes, (5) group contribution, (6) feedback, (7) reflection, and (8) evaluation. For this purpose, five science subjects (N = 270) were used to test the model as a guide to implementing LGDM assignments. Data was gathered using a validated 33-step questionnaire instrument. Additionally, group contributions were received using the SPARKPlus peer review application, and marks attained were gathered. Methodological triangulation of the datasets suggested that students have a positive attitude toward LGDM for science learning. Students enjoyed the group work and creativity, and they identified digital media support as a critical component of their learning experience. Preliminary data support using the LGDM framework to design digital media assignments for science education.

AB  - Background: People's adherence to control measures is imperative in the fight against COVID-19. The present study was done to evaluate knowledge, attitudes, and practices towards COVID-19 among residents of Jharkhand and to assist the government in deciding further course of action during the COVID-19 outbreak.
   Methods: This study was an online cross-sectional survey. The link to the questionnaire was displayed on the official website of Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, National Health Mission, Jharkhand, official website of all districts under Jharkhand state administration, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme and Information & Public Relations department. Participation of residents in the survey was extensively propagated using mass media mainly local television networks, radio channels and newspapers.
   Results: A total of 4683 responses were received from all districts of Jharkhand. The majority of the participants were young adults (47.5%) and the number of male participants was more than the females (81.4%). The mean correct knowledge score for participants of this study was 10.73+2.2 (maximum attainable score was 14) while the mean practice score for the participants was 4.5+0.69 (maximum attainable score was 5). The knowledge score of the participants was significantly associated with their age, education status and economic class (p<0.0001). The participants largely held an optimistic attitude and healthy practices towards COVID-19.
   Conclusion: Participants had a positive attitude but were also logically worried and uncertain about the near future. Adequate knowledge of participants was visible in their practices. There was however a gap across age groups, gender, literacy and income levels which should be addressed in future campaigns.

AB  - The concepts of virtualization for facilitating learning have become the focus of attention in several countries. Yet, the limited understanding of how technologies such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) can be used to improve the learning and teaching of science makes it difficult for educational policy makers to apply additional measures in order to ensure the availability of equipment and trained staff. A semi-structured interview was used to gather data from primary school teachers about the challenges and prospects of utilizing VR and AR technologies in teaching science subjects. A set of evidence and recommendations on AR and VR utilization for teaching science were provided based on an interview of 29 science teachers. It was determined that lack of competency, limited instructional design, lack of focused attention, lack of time, and limited environmental resources were common challenges in VR and AR utilization. In addition, we found that both technologies can be used to promote exploratory behavior and perceived usefulness and develop a positive attitude. Other findings related to these aspects were identified and described. The outcomes from this study can provide insights for administrators and policy makers to set priorities for using VR and AR in school practice to carry out various reflective and exploration tasks.

AB  - Uptake of telepractice has drastically increased among speech-language therapists (SLTs) following the COVID-19 pandemic. This study aimed to explore the sudden uptake of telepractice in India among SLTs. An online survey consisting of 20 questions was carried out between 4 and 17 May 2020 using Google form. The participants comprised of SLTs who indicated that they had shifted their services to telepractice during the COVID-19 pandemic. Descriptive analysis was used to summarize the findings. Eighty-four SLTs participated in the study, working across different work settings and from 21 to 53 years of age. Forty-nine percent of SLTs had conducted more than 11 telepractice sessions, 89% conducted only individual sessions. Further, 85% had a mostly paediatric caseload with 75% working with child language disorders. They learnt about telepractice in a range of ways including from colleagues (19%), social media and the internet (18%), formal education (24%), reading (8%) and experience (8%). Overall, SLTs exhibited a positive attitude towards the use of telepractice. The most common platform used was WhatsApp video calling feature (82%), although more than one platform was being used. The greatest challenges faced were dealing with network issues (38%) and lack of cooperation from the child during sessions (27%). The findings highlight an acceptance and uptake towards telepractice. This might pave the path for serious consideration for telepractice in the field of speech-language therapy in India in the future.

AB  - The discussion about the implications of new or digital media focuses mainly on 'social' media. This reduction is a conceptual shortcoming. In order to fully understand how digital media impact on society and the communication landscape, our conceptualisation needs to include new entertainment media, especially computer games. Interactivity here might mean interaction with the AI (artificial-intelligence) or human players. or both, but the crucial difference lies in the fact that the interaction takes place in a 'world' created by the software. Despite the discussion about 'gamification' in marketing and a tradition of game studies in the humanities, there have been few attempts to treat computer games not only as trivial culture, but as a "persuasive device", as a way to shape public opinion. This article explores how the theory of procedural rhetoric, as outlined by Ian Bogost, enhances our understanding of this growing area. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Change and innovation are increasingly critical to organizational survival, as well as sustained success. While it is common to discuss mistakes as critical components of the learning process, how can organizations balance the detrimental costs of workplace mistakes with the beneficial outcomes of increased risk-taking and innovation? This cross-regional comparative research investigates the relationship between employee perceptions of leadership style, mindset (fixed versus growth), and orientation to error learning in a sample of 554 employees recruited in Europe, China, and the US. We examine the relationship between a leader's perceived style - transformational, transactional, laissez-faire, and aversive leadership - follower mindset, and attitudes toward error learning. Our results suggest that transformational leadership fosters significantly more positive attitudes toward employee error learning, while laissez-faire and aversive leadership styles actively inhibit employee error learning. Somewhat surprisingly, in two of the three samples, laissez-faire leadership showed the strongest and most negative effect on error learning orientation, although followers with fixed mindsets reported being less likely to learn from errors regardless of leadership style. Our findings examine the relationship between leadership style and employee error learning and highlight that inattentive leaders may be particularly destructive in work settings that seek to develop creativity and innovation as part of the organizational change process.

AB  - This study extends an evaluation of a brief, social media intervention, called In One Voice, for raising mental health awareness and improving attitudes of youth and young adults towards mental health issues.
   A successive independent samples design assessed market penetration and attitudinal changes among the young people who completed an online questionnaire 1 year after (T3: n = 438) the intervention. This is compared with two samples that completed a survey either immediately before (T1: n = 403) or 2 months after (T2: n = 403) the campaign launch.
   The proportion of respondents who remembered the campaign grew from 24.8 % at T2 to 48.6 % at T3. Elevated website activity on mindcheck.ca was sustained 1 year after In One Voice had ended. Small but significant reductions in personal stigma and social distance were detected from T1 and T3, which were not observed at T2. Respondents' self-rated ability to help others with mental health issues and to engage in positive behaviors relating to mental health issues (e.g., seeking information) did not improve significantly from T1 to T3.
   Improved attitudes towards mental health issues were observed among young people 1 year following a brief social media campaign. The campaign was less effective at providing the tools young people need to feel capable of helping someone who may be experiencing mental health issues, and motivating them to engage in constructive behaviors related to mental health.

AB  - The aims of the present research were to evaluate the preliminary psychometric properties of a new measure for evaluating teachers' attitudes towards the representation of homosexuality in film and television, and to explore the association between moral disengagement and teachers' negative attitudes towards homosexual representations. Participants were 241 Italian primary and secondary school teachers. The new self-report measure comprises 14 items or 8 items (brief version) scored on a 5-point Likert scale. Teachers completed three instruments: the new measure created to capture participants' social and emotional evaluations of homosexuality in film and television, the latent and manifest prejudice scale, and the Italian moral disengagement scale. Exploratory factor analysis of the new measure suggested a single factor. The results demonstrated that the measure had satisfactory construct and convergent validity and reliability. Finally, we identified how teachers' dehumanization of victims and euphemistic labelling were positively associated with their negative attitudes towards representations of homosexuality.

AB  - The social distancing and lockdown measures enacted to address the COVID-19 pandemic entailed an unprecedented shift to digitally-mediated communication. The move to remote learning at schools was one of such important changes. Drawing on privacy and STS literature, we investigate the role of different privacy cultures during the initial moment of turbulence, when schools had to quickly adapt to remote teaching. To this end, we conducted semi-structured interviews with teachers in Israel and Germany. Our interviews carved out three distinct phases: A moment of turbulence, a period of negotiation and a phase of temporary closure, leading to the dominance of Zoom and Google Classroom in Israel, and government-mandated open-source tools for German teachers. These different pathways are shaped by considerations of vertical privacy among German teachers, and the absence of such considerations on the part of Israeli teachers.

AB  - This study differentiates the roles of telepresence and transportation, the two widely cited processes underpinning an immersive media viewing experience, in the context of virtual marketing. In Study 1, college students viewed a real estate property tour in virtual reality (VR; high immersion) or as a 360 degrees video (low immersion) in a research lab. The tour was accompanied by a voiceover presenting descriptive information about the apartment (descriptive evidence) or a narrative-based introduction (narrative evidence). We found the enhanced telepresence under the VR viewing condition negatively impacted users' memory of the property; this effect was particularly pronounced with the narrative voiceover. Study 2 replicated key findings from Study 1 in an online experiment with a larger and more diverse sample. We also found that narrative-induced transportation strengthened attitudinal outcomes, and enhanced telepresence boosted this effect. Our studies disentangle the impacts of VR-induced telepresence on cognitive processing from the effects of narrative-induced transportation on persuasive outcomes. The highly immersive media experience combined with deep transportation into the narrative can strengthen viewers' positive attitude towards the overall experience but hinder their ability to remember the details of the content. The findings point to a medium-message matching strategy to achieve marketing goals.

AB  - Prior studies suggest that the growth in online retail is attributed to the effective implementation of media-rich and interactive services and functionalities that help overcome the para-social distance between customers and online retail stores. However, few studies have offered empirical evidence that demonstrates the specific impacts these interactive services and functionalities have on the financial performance of online retailers. Using data on the operations and financial performance of the top 500 online retailers in the U.S., this study investigates the impact that website features and functionalities have on sales performance and other intermediate performance measures. Our findings suggest that website features and functionalities have a significant direct impact on sales as well as an indirect impact through intermediate performance measures. Furthermore, our model identifies the specific performance measures that each website feature targets to improve.

AB  - Of the social media tools available to brand managers, consumer-generated advertising (CGA) has attractive features combining consumer-generated content, social media advertising, and online interactive marketing campaigns. However, only a small number of customers actively participate in co-creation of CGA. Based on social presence theory and service-dominant logic conceptualization, we examined CGA observers, knowledgeable and attentive viewers of value co-creation processes who do not directly participate in value co-creation. In two studies, we examined consumer responses to company-driven CGA and found no significant differences between CGA creators, or direct participants, and CGA observers, or indirect participants in the process of involvement with CGA, its antecedents, and its outcomes. Study 1 demonstrated that CGA observers developed positive attitudes toward co-created CGA that influenced their brand loyalty and willingness to participate in the process. Study 2 revealed that both creators' and observers' involvement with CGA led to stronger perceptions of competitive advantage, which positively affected brand loyalty and trust. Perceptions of competitive advantage also had a mediation effect.

AB  - Both right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and the dominance facet of social dominance orientation (SDO-D) are related to positive attitudes towards torture in a war context We investigated whether dehumanization of Muslims and identification with Swedes as an in-group served as mediators of these relationships. Employing a student and a military sample we found that the relationship between RWA, SDO-D and torture was completely mediated by dehumanization. In-group identification added to the model by partially mediating RWA and the equalization facet of social dominance orientation (SDO-E). The relationship between SDO-D and torture was weaker in the military sample, which also scored higher than the student sample on all variables. It is argued that the mediating effect of dehumanization on RWA and SDO-D might be understood as authoritarians and social dominators feeling lower empathy towards dehumanized out-groups and that research on the relationship between RWA, SDO and abuse in a war context should preferably be conducted on relevant groups (such as soldiers).

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a massive global health crisis. The rapid transmission rate of the virus, as well as the lack of effective medications and vaccines, has posed serious challenges to controlling the spread of the disease. Dealing with this public health crisis has required major changes in people's behavior, including the adoption of social distancing measures such as avoiding meeting with family members and friends, crowded places, and public transportation. The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors associated with the adoption of these behaviors in China and Israel. We relied on the 3Cs model that has been used to predict the adoption of a specific preventive behavior (vaccinations) with the goal of testing its applicability to other preventive behaviors such as in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The model indicates that confidence in social institutions, complacency (fear of and assessments about the risk of becoming ill) and constraints (levels of self-efficacy and confidence in being able to engage in the behaviors) are predictors of adopting preventive behaviors. Data were collected in China and Israel through an online survey of the population (n = 1406). We used latent variables and structural equation modeling to test the hypotheses derived from the 3Cs model. The findings indicate that there are some differences in the types of preventive behaviors adopted in the two countries. In Israel, higher levels of confidence predicted the adoption of avoidant behaviors and more constraints predicted engaging in fewer avoidant behaviors. In China, more constraints also contributed to the adoption of fewer avoidant behaviors, but people's level of confidence fully mediated this result. The multi-group analysis indicated that the conceptualized model fits the Chinese and Israeli data reasonably well. The findings suggest that the 3Cs model can be generalized from getting vaccinated to adopting avoidant behaviors and that the model can be used across cultures and countries.

AB  - Introduction: The Coronavirus Disease-2019 (COVID-19) that originated in China in December 2019 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on 11th March, 2020. It has resulted in extensive lockdown measures in India and in the state of West Bengal. Both Central and State Governments have made considerable efforts to increase awareness about the pandemic among the general public.
   Aim: This study was conducted to assess the Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) among the general public of West Bengal about the pandemic as no such data is available till date.
   Materials and Methods: The retrospective survey was undertaken among the general public of the state of West Bengal, India, by means of social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp) through a validated e-questionnaire containing 10 questions during 18th April, 2020 to 3rd May, 2020. Data was captured on Google Forms, which were analysed using appropriate tools.
   Results: A total of 355 responses were obtained. A 97% of responders were completely aware of the pandemic with 92% practising preventive measures, such as social distancing, washing hands, and wearing a mask. Majority of the participants were young (18-30 years of age) with 51% being males. A 99% of the responders were literate and 86% were from urban dwelling. Total 61% of the participants stated that they have learnt something new after participating in this survey.
   Conclusion: KAP about COVID- 19 pandemic was found to be high in the general population of West Bengal. Involvement of various social media platforms is required for generating mass awareness about COVID-19 in rural West Bengal. Continuous communication and survey by the Government is necessary to spread public awareness as information about COVID-19 is constantly evolving.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the respiratory disease caused by the virus now called as SARS-CoV-2 and first identified in Wuhan, China, has spread to all regions of the world. At the time of this write-up, over 5.1 million people had been infected by the virus globally. The World Health Organization estimates that in Africa over 5 million people would need hospital admission during the course of the pandemic. Interventions to prevent the disease include social distancing and nationwide lockdowns, which, whilst necessary, have had negative effects not only on the economic status of many but also on primary care and especially the management of chronic illnesses. There are opportunities for primary care physicians to continue learning, lend humanitarian aid and provide the needed care in this context. Social media has promising applications in this rapidly changing context.

AB  - The media plays an important role in how the American public understands controversial social and political issues, such as immigration. The purpose of this article is to examine how key features of the media, such as location (Arizona vs. National) and political ideology (Liberal vs. Conservative), affect the framing of arguments supporting and opposing the anti-immigration bill (Arizona SB 1070). A content analysis was conducted using 3 weeks of newspaper articles from two Arizona newspapers (one Conservative, one Liberal) and five national newspapers (three Conservative, two Liberal). Analyses revealed that both location and political ideology influenced the framing. Specifically, the national newspapers were more likely than Arizona newspapers to frame arguments supporting the bill in terms of threats (e.g., threats to economic and public safety) and to frame arguments against the bill in terms of civil rights issues (e.g., racial profiling). In terms of political ideology, Conservative newspapers were more likely than Liberal newspapers to frame the bill in terms of economic and public safety threats, but did not differ in mentions of civil rights issues. The implications for attitudes toward immigrants and legal ethnic minorities and for defining the boundaries of the American national identity are discussed.

AB  - Background and aims Childhood vaccinations are an important component of primary prevention. Maternal and Child Health (MCH) clinics in Israel provide routine vaccinations without charge. Several vaccine-preventable-diseases outbreaks (measles, mumps) emerged in Jerusalem in the past decade. We aimed to study attitudes and knowledge on vaccinations among mothers, in communities with low immunization coverage. Methods A qualitative study including focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Results Low immunization coverage was defined below the district's mean (age 2 years, 2013) for measles-mumps-rubella-varicella 1st dose (MMR1\MMRV1) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis 4th dose (DTaP4), 96 and 89%, respectively. Five communities were included, all were Jewish ultra-orthodox. The mothers' (n = 87) median age was 30 years and median number of children 4. Most mothers (94%) rated vaccinations as the main activity in the MCH clinics with overall positive attitudes. Knowledge about vaccines and vaccination schedule was inadequate. Of vaccines scheduled at ages 0-2 years (n = 13), the mean number mentioned was 3.9 +/- 2.8 (median 4, range 0-9). Vaccines mentioned more often were outbreak-related (measles, mumps, polio) and HBV (given to newborns). Concerns about vaccines were obvious, trust issues and religious beliefs were not. Vaccination delay was very common and timeliness was considered insignificant. Practical difficulties in adhering to the recommended schedule prevailed. The vaccinations visits were associated with pain and stress. Overall, there was a sense of self-responsibility accompanied by inability to influence others. Conclusion Investigating maternal knowledge and attitudes on childhood vaccinations provides insights that may assist in planning tailored intervention programs aimed to increase both vaccination coverage and timeliness.

AB  - Objectives: Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is a life-saving treatment, but donor numbers are lacking in Turkey and elsewhere. Increased awareness of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation among university students might help expand donation. We evaluated the effect of a brief targeted educational intervention on knowledge and attitudes about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and donation among first-year university students in Turkey.
   Materials and Methods: There were 301 first-year university students (median age, 18 y) who volunteered: 163 medical students (54%) and 138 law students (46%). Before and after a brief lecture about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, students answered a 5-item yes-or-no questionnaire regarding (1) knowledge about health benefits of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; (2) knowledge about stem cell banking and donation in Turkey; (3) knowledge about the transplantation procedure; (4) prior experience and/or willingness to donate blood; and (5) willingness to donate stem cells. Reasons for motivation to donate blood and/or stem cells were categorized. Results before and after the lecture were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses.
   Results: The response rate was 100%. Significantly greater proportions of students had knowledge about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and willingness to donate blood and stem cells after the lecture. There were no differences between medical and law students before the lecture. After the lecture, a significantly greater proportion of medical students indicated knowledge about health benefits of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, stem cell banking and donation in Turkey, and the transplantation procedure.
   Conclusions: Brief education about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for university students can increase knowledge and awareness about hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and cause more positive attitudes about stem cell donation.

AB  - In this work, we describe an educational approach based on augmented reality (AR) and mobile technology that has been developed with the aim to engage students in a learning procedure regarding the electric forces as well as Coulomb's Law. Initially, we present the AR learning environment and we explain its design principles with respect to the educational goals we aim to accomplish. The idea behind the present approach has been to present students with a novel learning environment that aligns well with their familiarization with mobile technology and the pleasure they take in making use of this technology, in order to stimulate their intrinsic motivation and learning performance. In addition, we demonstrate the early results of a classroom study performed in order to estimate students' reaction to the AR approach and get an indication of their motivation levels and ease of use, with respect to the AR tool. Based on the study results, we conclude that students have demonstrated positive attitudes toward the AR learning approach and we claim that mobile AR may be incorporated for educational purposes in physics curricula.

AB  - Background: Although annual seasonal influenza vaccination is recommended for healthcare personnel (HCPs), their vaccination uptake has been suboptimal. This study aimed to examine the psychosocial determinants of influenza vaccination among HCPs in Hong Kong using a longitudinal study design based on behavioral change theories.
   Methods: Participants were invited to complete a baseline survey before the 2017/18 influenza vaccination campaign to measure their baseline perceptions and vaccination intention, and followed up for 9 months to measure actual vaccination uptake. The survey used a theoretical framework combining the Health Belief Model and Theory of Planned Behaviour with extended psychosocial factors for predicting HCPs' vaccination uptake. Structural equation modelling was used to test the theoretical model and estimate path coefficients (p) to infer associations of psychosocial factors with HCPs' influenza vaccination uptake.
   Results: Of the 845 participants who completed follow-up, 43.0% indicated intending to take vaccination and 30.8% reported actual receipt of the vaccination. The structural equation modeling analysis showed that positive attitude towards influenza vaccination (beta= 0.69), greater perceived susceptibility to influenza virus infection (beta = 0.34), greater anticipated regret for not vaccinating (beta = 0.31), and more cues to action (beta= 0.29) were significantly associated with higher vaccination intention which directly predicted greater vaccination uptake (beta = 0.82). Norms were found to have an indirect association with vaccination intention through the mediation of attitude towards influenza vaccination (beta = 0.63). Self-efficacy was significantly associated with actual receipt of influenza vaccination (beta = 0.13) but not vaccination intention. The structural equation model explained 84.7% and 69.6% of the variance, respectively, in HCPs' intention to receive and actual receipt of influenza vaccination.
   Conclusions: Attitude towards influenza vaccination was the strongest predictor of HCPs' intention and actual receipt of influenza vaccination. Social norm approach may be an intervention strategy to shape HCPs' attitude towards influenza vaccination and their subsequent decision-making for influenza vaccination. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study examines whether and how the right to a fair and impartial jury may be compromised by prejudicial news media coverage of death penalty cases. Using a unique data set of historic newspaper coverage of 20 capital cases in California in which defendants filed change of venue motions, we conducted a detailed content analysis of 1,831 newspaper articles to examine the nature and extent of the pretrial publicity in each case. We used a detailed coding scheme with 27 content categories to describe the types of information conveyed; analyze the relative amounts of negative, positive, and neutral content in the publicity; and determine whether the publicity included the kind of information that has been shown to bias prospective jurors. The publicity was overwhelmingly negative and we identified a number of highly prejudicial aspects, including heav y reliance on law enforcement and prosecution sources, numerous instances of sensationalized descriptions of the crime and criminal defendant, and the inclusion of legally excludable material. Despite the potentially biasing effects of the publicity analyzed, venue was rarely changed. Moreover, the trial courts' decisions appeared largely unrelated to the substantial amount and prejudicial content of the pretrial publicity. Implications for a capital defendant's light to an impartial jury, due process protections, and the adequacy and availability of effective legal remedies are discussed.

AB  - Objective: The National Human Genome Research Institute has emphasised community engagement and public dialogue in the U.S. on issues related to genetics. This study examines how online discussions among the U.S. public directly or indirectly influence psychosocial constructs of the Theory of Planned Behavior, including intention to take part in genetic research.Design: After completing the baseline questionnaire, participants (n=3754) were randomly assigned to one of the following three groups: the discussion group, the pre-/post-only group and the End-of-Project group. The discussion group (n=1824) was invited and participated in up to three online discussions, which were held from November 2008 to May 2009.Main outcome measures: Behavioural intention, beliefs, attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control variables were assessed.Results: The most interesting finding was that those participating in online discussions had fewer negative beliefs about volunteering for genetic research, which in turn contributed to more positive attitudes, increased injunctive and descriptive norms and enhanced behavioural control. These relationships, then, were associated with higher intention to participate in genetic research.Conclusion: These findings suggest that continuous public discussions seem to positively affect volunteer intention for genetic research through ameliorating fears of negative consequences.

AB  - The global spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has affected the world in many ways. Due to the communicable nature of the disease, it is difficult to investigate the causal reason for the epidemic's spread sufficiently. This study comprehensively investigates the causal relationship between the spread of COVID-19 and mobility level on a multi time-scale and its influencing factors, by using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) and the causal decomposition approach. Linear regression analysis investigates the significance and importance of the influential factors on the intrastate and interstate causal strength. The results of an EEMD analysis indicate that the mid-term and long-term domain portrays the macroscopic component of the states' mobility level and COVID-19 cases, which represents overall intrinsic characteristics. In particular, the mobility level is highly associated with the long-term variations of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term variations. Intrastate causality analysis identifies the significant effects of median age and political orientation on the causal strength at a specific time-scale, and some of them cannot be identified from the existing method. Interstate causality results show a negative association with the interstate distance and the positive one with the airline traffic in the long-term domain. Clustering analysis confirms that the states with the higher the gross domestic product and the more politically democratic tend to more adhere to social distancing. The findings of this study can provide practical implications to the policymakers that whether the social distancing policies are effectively working or not should be monitored by long-term trends of COVID-19 cases rather than short-term.

AB  - Since early 2020, COVID-19 has spread throughout the United States (US), killing more than 700,000. Mask-wearing, social-distancing, and hand hygiene can curb the spread of COVID-19 and other infectious diseases. However, the adherence to COVID-19 safety measures varies considerably among the US public, likely due to disparate perceptions of COVID-19's risk. The current study examines risk perceptions for COVID-19 (RP-C) in a nationally representative sample of US residents (N = 512), as well as their political preferences, news media consumption, COVID-19 safety attitudes (SA-C) and reported COVID-19 safety behaviors (SB-C; e.g., mask-wearing and social-distancing). Using structural equation modeling, we tested a comprehensive measure for RP-C with a single latent factor, finding good model fit. We found that higher RP-C was associated with being more liberal, consuming more traditional news media, having attitudes that supported compliance with COVID-19 safety measures, and having greater reported compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. In addition, factor loadings for RP-C items indicate that people's RP-C was more strongly determined by personal and family, rather than collective or societal risk, which suggests risk communication may be improved by focusing on personal and family risk. Public health efforts to combat COVID-19 are only as good as compliance allows, and RP-C's strong relationship with SB-C indicates a potential means for risk communicators to increase compliance with COVID-19 safety measures. This finding will remain important as new COVID-19 variants, such as the Delta variant, emerge.

AB  - This is a cross-sectional study that was conducted to explore readiness with regard to the sudden shift towards emergency remote teaching and its correlation with perceived effectiveness, satisfaction, anxiety and attitudes among instructors in Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown. Data were gathered using an online questionnaire on readiness and perceptions of effectiveness, attitudes and satisfaction relating to the emergency remote teaching, as well as the anxiety resulting from it. Pearson's test was performed to assess the correlations between different parameters. The results of the study showed that readiness in terms of emergency remote teaching was high, at 44.9% among instructors, while 64.8% of them scored moderately regarding their perception of the emergency remote teaching's effectiveness. A positive attitude towards emergency remote teaching was reported by 18.5% of the instructors, although a high level of satisfaction was observed in 79.6% of the cases, and 38.7% showed no anxiety. A positive and significant correlation was obtained between a readiness to shift to emergency remote teaching and perceived effectiveness, attitudes and satisfaction (r = 0.2 and p < 0.01); however, anxiety showed a significant moderate negative correlation with perceived effectiveness (r = -0.35) p < 0.01, attitudes (r = -0.33) p < 0.01 and satisfaction (r = -0.44), p < 0.01. In conclusion, instructors at PNU were ready to provide emergency remote teaching, which led to high perceived effectiveness and levels of satisfaction, while the high level of anxiety could be attributed to stressful circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Purpose. The study is aimed at exploring the popularity, impact, and usefulness of using YouTube in learning anatomy as perceived by Jordanian medical students studying at Jordan University of Science and Technology. Methods. The present work is a cross-sectional questionnaire-based study. First-, second-, and third-year medical students were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Students' responses were numerically coded, and the results were analyzed to reveal any statistically significant differences related to gender or level of study. Results. The results showed that 96.4% of the students used YouTube in general, 91.2% used it as a source of information, and 83.9% used YouTube as a learning tool in medical school. Further, YouTube was used by 79.1% of the students as an anatomy-learning tool. Most of these students used this platform in learning gross anatomy. The study also revealed that dissection videos were the most viewed anatomy-related content. Regarding the perceived value of YouTube as an anatomy-learning tool, the majority of the students reported that YouTube offered them useful anatomical information and enhanced their understanding, memorization, and recall of anatomical information. In addition, most of them recommended using YouTube as an anatomy-learning tool. Statistical analysis of the results revealed the presence of gender-related significant differences in students' perspectives. Such differences were also found among students of different levels of study. Conclusion. Medical students have positive attitudes toward using YouTube in augmenting their anatomy learning. For this, educators are encouraged to adopt YouTube as an educational tool in their anatomy instruction and to create new anatomy-related YouTube videos to enhance their students' learning.

AB  - Context. There is limited research on how community-based long-term care (CBLTC) providers' personal characteristics and attitudes affect their decisions to initiate advance care planning (ACP) conversations with consumers.
   Objectives. To examine judgments by CBLTC providers as to whether a consumer was in need of ACP and to compare the relative influence of situational features of the consumer with the influence of personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider.
   Methods. Factorial surveys with vignettes with randomly assigned situational features of a hypothetical consumer were obtained from 182 CBLTC providers at three Area Agencies on Aging located in the Midwestern U. S. Measures included the consumer's situational features, such as demographics, diagnosis, pain level, level of functioning, and caregiver involvement. Personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider included demographics, discipline, past experience with ACP, and attitudes toward ACP.
   Results. Hierarchical linear models indicated that most variability in ACP decisions was the result of differences among CBLTC providers (64%) rather than consumers' situational features. Positive decisions to discuss ACP were associated with consumers who needed assistance with legal issues and had a cancer diagnosis; these variables explained 8% of the vignette level variance. Significant personal characteristics of the CBLTC provider included a nursing background, less direct contact with consumers, past experience with ACP, and positive attitudes toward ACP; these variables explained 41% of the person-level variance.
   Conclusion. This study shows the lack of normative consensus about ACP and highlights the need for consistent educational programs regarding the role of the CBLTC provider in the ACP process.

AB  - Objective: Integrating constructs from three prominent health behavior theories including the extended parallel process model, the health belief model, and the theory of planned behavior, this study seeks to identify sociopsychological factors that influenced American's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
   Method: An online survey was delivered to a U.S. sample (N = 934), assessing the influences of risk perception and fear associated with COVID-19, beliefs about and attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, self-efficacy, social and psychological contexts, and demographic characteristics on people's intention to get COVID-19 vaccines.
   Results: Most respondents intended to get vaccinated. However, they tended to underestimate their risks of contracting COVID-19. Disease exposure led to higher uptake intent via the mediation of fear. Safety concerns negatively influenced vaccination intention, while perceived community benefits were positively associated with vaccination intention. Positive attitudes toward vaccines and recent vaccine history were positively linked to vaccination intent.
   Conclusion: This study attests the effectiveness of HBT constructs in predicting people's intention to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
   Practice Implications: The results point to the importance of fostering confidence in vaccine safety and countering overoptimism of individual susceptibility to the disease in interventions promoting COVID-19 vaccines uptake. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social distancing rules in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated a move to online research for many social science researchers. In moving data collection online, academic literature on Internet-mediated research has resurfaced and been enriched, providing researchers with a useful resource when planning data collection online. In sharp contrast, there is limited published work for online workshops, indicating new opportunities for developing an evidence base for this increasingly important approach to data generation.

AB  - Waste prevention is currently a critical issue, and our research aims to provide a more nuanced view by examining the determinants of individual behaviour when deciding to either purchase a certain item or to extend the life of an owned item through repair or reuse activities. Our research has two main aims: (1) to examine the importance that being aware of consequences and personal norms have in shaping positive attitudes towards waste prevention behaviour; and (2) to explore the relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control on waste prevention by testing the mediation effects of perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour. The research is based on 375 questionnaires collected in Pietra Ligure, a municipality located in Northwest Italy. Data were modelled using a structural equation model to test the hypotheses. The findings show that awareness of the consequences is a fundamental driver of waste prevention attitudes while personal norms are not. The findings also confirm a positive relationship between attitudes and perceived behavioural control. Finally, a positive significant relationship was found between perceived behavioural control and waste prevention behaviour, and between social norms and waste prevention behaviour. The results of our investigation are contextualised in theoretical, political and managerial frameworks and suggest several avenues for further research. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article we synthesize theory and research from several areas of psychology and political science to propose and test a causal model of the effects of threat on political attitudes. Based in part on prior research showing that fear, threat, and anxiety decrease cognitive capacity and motivation, we hypothesize that under high (vs. low) threat, people will seek to curtail open-ended information searches and exhibit motivated closed-mindedness (one aspect of the need for cognitive closure). The subjective desire for certainty, control, and closure, in turn, is expected to increase the individual's affinity for political conservatism, insofar as resistance to change and adherence to authority figures and conventional forms of morality are assumed to satisfy these epistemic motives more successfully than their ideological opposites. Consistent with this account, we find in Studies 1a and 1b that putting people into a highly threatened mindset leads them to exhibit an increase in motivated closed-mindedness and to perceive the world as more dangerous. Furthermore, in Study 2 we demonstrate that a subtle threat manipulation increases self-reported conservatism (or decreases self-reported liberalism), and this effect is mediated by closed-mindedness. In Study 3, we manipulated closed-mindedness directly and found that high (vs. low) cognitive load results in a greater affinity for the Republican (vs. Democratic) party. Finally, in Study 4 we conducted an experiment involving political elites in Iceland and found that three different types of threat (to the self, group, and system) all led center-right politicians to score higher on closed-mindedness and issue-based political conservatism. Implications for society and for the theory of ideology as motivated social cognition are discussed.

AB  - Background Many important strategies to reduce the spread of pandemic influenza need public participation. To assess public receptivity to such strategies, we compared adoption of preventive behaviours in response to the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic among the public in five countries and examined whether certain non-pharmaceutical behaviours (such as handwashing) were deterrents to vaccination. We also assessed public support for related public health recommendations.
   Methods We used data from simultaneous telephone polls (mobile telephone and landline) in Argentina, Japan, Mexico, the UK, and the USA. In each country, interviews were done in a nationally representative sample of adults, who were selected by the use of random digit dial techniques. The questionnaire asked people whether or not they had adopted each of various preventive behaviours (non-pharmaceutical such as personal protective and social distancing behaviour or vaccinations) to protect themselves or their family from H1N1 at any point during the pandemic. Two-tailed t tests were used for statistical analysis.
   Findings 900 people were surveyed in each country except the USA where 911 people were contacted. There were wide differences in the adoption of preventive behaviours between countries, although certain personal protective behaviours (eg, handwashing) were more commonly adopted than social distancing behaviours (eg, avoiding places where many people gather) across countries (53-89% vs 11-69%). These non-pharmaceutical behaviours did not reduce the likelihood of getting vaccinated in any country. There was also support across all countries for government recommendations related to school closure, avoiding places where many people gather, and wearing masks in public.
   Interpretation There is a need for country-specific approaches in pandemic policy planning that use both non-pharmaceutical approaches and vaccination.

AB  - The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19) pandemic represents a worldwide emergency, which may have harmful consequences on people's mental health. Parallel to research focused on risk factors, it could be useful to investigate the factors that help to cope with such crises at an emotional level. Therefore, this study aimed to strengthen the role of variables that protect from subjective distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, explore the pathways between satisfaction with life and perceived stress, and consider the role of coping strategies and defense mechanisms in this relationship. A sample of 1102 Italian participants who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures (Mage = 34.91, SD = 11.91) completed an online survey in which the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, Satisfaction with Life Scale, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced Inventory and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire were included. The data were analyzed using Pearson's r correlations and moderation analysis. A chained-mediation model showed that the relationship between life satisfaction and perceived stress is partially mediated by approach coping, positive attitude and mature defenses. This study contributes toward gaining a better understanding of a protective pathway for mental health outcomes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings could be useful from both a preventive and an intervention perspective.

AB  - The naive social Darwinism, also called the Competitive Jungle Belief (CJB), according to the theory of the Dual-Process Motivational (DPM) model, is recognized as an expanded perceptual scheme acting as a cognitive mediator between deep individual characteristics and the area of socio-political attitudes and ideologies. This article aims to show the individual differences that can be dispositional characteristics to believe in the Competitive Jungle scheme's principles. The presented studies' main theoretical question is to find out whether the CJB bases on positive "individual resources" or rather some psychological deficits. In an extensive survey study, including four random-representative samples of adults Poles (with N ranging from 624 to 853 respondents), we tested the predictive power of the five categories of variables: 1) attachment styles; 2) Big Five personality traits; 3) Dark Triad of personality; 4) basic human values and 5) moral judgments. The results showed the psychological profile of social Darwinists as clearly dysfunctional in terms of personal life quality. They express characteristics like admiration for power and desire to dominate, pursue one's goals at all costs, exploitative attitude towards people, and hostility. On the other hand, they reveal a fearful style in close relations with others and have low self-esteem and low self-sufficiency. From the societal perspective, such beliefs make up a vision of social life that is unfavorable for building a cooperative, helpful, and relatively egalitarian society. The supreme idea that only those who do not sympathize with others and are ready to use them can be successful and survive is far from the principles of liberal democracy.

AB  - Conflicts over environmental spaces that are sites of trauma or have been designated as sacred involve questions about who has a legitimate stake in determining the use of the site, and where the hallowedness attached to that space ends. We examine these questions in a study of the 2009-2010 controversy about the Park51 [sic] Islamic Community Center, sometimes called the "Ground Zero Mosque," to examine how issues of distributive, procedural, and inclusionary justice play out in a conflict over valuable land close to Ground Zero. This conflict, though in a specifically fraught locale, speaks to resistance to mosque construction in the USA and Europe. Using newspaper articles on the public debate as data (N = 65), and performing a thematic analysis, we identified four key themes: (1) views of Islam, (2) conflict, (3) American identity and ideals, and (4) proximity and place. Utilizing Chi square analyses to examine the effect of propinquity on support for Park51, we found that people living within New York City were more likely to support Park51 than those outside of the city. Our conclusion discusses constructs that link values, space, and social relations-hallowed ground, place attachment, social distance-and discuss their relationship to justice. We argue that while several kinds of justice are relevant, at its heart, this conflict concerns inclusionary questions about who can speak, who belongs, and who should be excluded.

AB  - Objectives. This study assessed the physical and psychological burden of lead apron use on Jordanian interventionists and investigated the attitudes and knowledge of interventional personnel toward ergonomic guidelines and practices. Methods. A cross-sectional investigation of a randomly sampled Jordanian cohort of interventional personnel was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. Results. A nationwide sample of 130 practitioners with a mean 9.3 +/- 8.1 years of experience in interventional procedures participated. Practitioners were aware of their apron's weight but not of its lead equivalence (71.5%). More than 60% of respondents complained of back pain. While 66.9% did not develop musculoskeletal pathologies, 64.3% of those with already established musculoskeletal pathologies experienced worse pain due to apron usage. Despite believing in the effect of lead aprons on muscular strain and work performance, 78.5% adhere to its usage. In terms of ergonomics, only 39.2% were aware of ergonomic guidelines; however, 90.0% believe that ergonomic practices are essential as 49.2% have experienced discomfort due to bad ergonomics. In terms of psychological burden, anxiety and depression were suggested in 16.4 and 21.6% of the sample. Conclusion. Jordanian interventionists portray positive attitudes toward lead aprons; nevertheless, their awareness of ergonomic practices warrants the implementation of evidenced-based interventions.

KW  - leisure
KW  - nostalgia
KW  - popular culture

AB  - This paper considers the role of nostalgia-based leisure in the present COVID-19 pandemic. Enforced lockdowns and social distancing initiatives have been met with various media channels replaying famous sport matches, classic films and memorable concerts from the past. Furthermore, social media is full of families interacting more; playing traditional board games and numerous other leisure-related activities such as baking bread and making fresh pasta. Nostalgia may well end up being one of the primary coping mechanisms (for all generations) of enduring isolation, fear - and a general loss of freedom. It is also worth considering whether we are now creating our own future nostalgia where, when the crisis is through, we will long for the social bonds and sense of community the pandemic created.

AB  - Purpose In light of the recent shift in the US culture, this paper investigates the effectiveness of female sexual empowerment as ad appeal in the apparel industry. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 aimed to understand consumers' reactions to female sexual empowerment in ads in terms of their attitudes toward the ad, attitudes toward the brand and purchase intention. Study 2 investigated the role of gender in perceptions of female sexual empowerment in ads. Findings This research establishes that consumers display positive attitudes toward female sexual empowerment in the apparel advertisement. These attitudes positively influence attitudes toward the brand, which in turn improve purchase intention. These effects are stronger for women than men. Research limitations/implications This research borrows from social power theory to reveal the impact of female sexual empowerment in ads in the apparel industry. Based on the theory of planned behavior, the findings also show that female sexual empowerment can have a positive impact on purchase intention through a serial mediation of attitude toward the ad and brand. Practical implications Marketers need to be aware of the impact of female sexual empowerment as ad appeal. Specifically, firms in the apparel industry could benefit from the positive effects of incorporating female sexual empowerment in their campaigns. Originality/value This research is the first to investigate the role of female sexual empowerment as ad appeal in improving consumers' responses to ads.

AB  - Background. Currently, online social media have become increasingly popular and can provide the opportunity to provide and acquire information regarding knowledge and attitudes toward organ donation and transplantation. To evaluate participants' knowledge about organ donation, information sources and donation principles, an on-line survey was distributed through social network in Italy.
   Methods. 10584 persons were invited to respond to the questionnaire, the response rate was 22.8% and a total of 2258 complete responses were analyzed.
   Results. The majority of participants were in favour of organ donation (94.9%), but this proportion decreased when asking for consent to donation of a family member's organs (75.2%; P<0.001). Internet represented a considerable proportion of information sources (37.2%), that were much less frequently represented by family doctors (5.6%) and school education (18.6%). Conversely, 68.5% of participants think that family doctors should provide information regarding donation and 81.9% think schools should also provide such education (P<0.001). A good knowledge about donation principles was the main factor associated with a positive attitude toward donation (P<0.001).
   Conclusion. Efforts must be aimed at involving schools and family doctors in education about donation; the use of social networks can represent a way of improving such knowledge. (Minerva Anestesiol 2012;78:1109-16)

AB  - Responding to a call for research on pornography and women's sexuality made by Weinberg, Williams, Kleiner, and Irizarry (2010), this study assessed pornography consumption, predictors, and correlates using nationally representative data gathered from U.S. women between 1973 and 2010 (N = 18,225). Women who were younger, less religious, and non-White were more likely to consume pornography. Women who consumed pornography had more positive attitudes toward extramarital sex, adult premarital sex, and teenage sex. Women who consumed pornography also had more sexual partners in the prior year, prior 5 years, and were more likely to have engaged in extramarital sex and paid sex. Consistent with Wright's (2011a) acquisition, activation, application model of mass media sexual socialization and the theorizing of Linz and Malamuth (1993), liberal-conservative ideology moderated the association between pornography exposure and sexual behavior. Specifically, the positive association between pornography exposure and women's recent sexual behavior was strongest for the most liberal women and weakest for the most conservative women. Cultural commentators and some academics argue that technological advances have resulted in a steady increase in the percentage of individuals who consume pornography. Little support was found for this assertion among U.S. women.

AB  - Objective: To determine the qualities of a good medical teacher from a trainee's perspective, to evaluate the best teaching method, and to explore the association of specialty and level of training with teaching methods and qualities of a medical teacher.
   Methods: The questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey was conducted in two tertiary care teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, from July 2019 to December 2020, and comprised all house officers and postgraduate residents. Data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire that had three sections: demographics, best method of teaching, and the characteristics of a good medical teacher. Data was analysed using SPSS 20.
   Results: Of the 135 subjects, 56(41.5%) were males; 79(58.5%) were females; 76(56%) were junior trainees; and 77(57%) belonged to surgical specialties. The overall mean age was 27.6 +/- 2.4 years. Best teaching method identified by the trainees was 'asking of problem-based questions' 46(33.6%). Good communication skills 61(44.5%), and calm and non-humiliating demeanour 61(44.5%) were the most frequently identified qualities. More surgical trainees considered the generation of competition among learners as the best teaching method than the trainees from other specialties (p=0.001). House officers reported 'unbiased' (p=0.001) and 'moral and ethical' (p=0.001) significantly more frequently as a good trait in their teachers compared to the residents.
   Conclusion: The most important qualities in a medial teacher, as identified by the learners, were good communication skills and calm and polite attitude.

KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - The association between women's levels of relationship intimacy and how frequently their partner viewed pornography was examined in a community sample of 136 NZ heterosexual women. Controlling for age, ethnicity and education, partner use of pornography was significantly negatively correlated with emotional, sexual, intellectual and recreational intimacy, but not social intimacy. Women's attitudes toward pornography did not mediate any of these associations. However, significant moderation effects were found: women with more negative attitudes toward pornography reported lower rates of emotional and social intimacy when their partner was believed to be viewing pornography weekly or more, but not when this frequency was less. No association was found for women with less negative attitudes toward pornography. These findings indicate that pornography may be detrimental to relationship intimacy for women with strongly negative attitudes toward it.

T2  - JOURNAL OF APPLIED SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - While recent research has started to pay more attention to the role of contact strategies on promoting intergroup harmony between Turkish and Kurdish communities, the effectiveness of a novel form of indirect contact strategy, E-contact-where participants engage in a cooperative and structured online interaction with an individual from the outgroup-has not yet been tested. Across two studies (N-Study 1 = 110, N-Study 2 = 176), we investigated the effects of E-contact among Turks on promoting positive attitudes and behavioral tendencies toward Kurds, testing outgroup trust and intergroup anxiety as mediators and incorporating a distinction between lower and higher self-disclosure conditions. As expected, E-contact led to more positive outgroup attitudes, as well as greater approach tendencies and decreased avoidance tendencies through increased outgroup trust (Studies 1 and 2) and reduced intergroup anxiety (Study 2). Study 2 also found that E-contact produced lower perceived interethnic conflict through increased outgroup trust. While both lower and higher personal disclosure conditions provided similar effects in the two studies, E-contact with heightened self-disclosure was especially effective at promoting more positive outgroup attitudes and reducing avoidance tendencies. Findings highlight potential benefits of using E-contact as a prejudice-reduction strategy in conflict settings.

AB  - The commercial application of transgenic technology in the food industry has become a crucial topic worldwide. This study aims to achieve the following objectives: (i) to examine consumers' purchase intention toward genetically modified (GM) food by using benefit-risk analysis (BRA); (ii) to examine consumers' purchase intention toward GM food based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB); and (iii) to determine which framework or theory significantly influences the interpretation of purchase intention toward GM food under an integrated framework incorporating the BRA and the TPB. An online survey was conducted among 408 qualified samples who were analysed through structural equation modeling. The result analysis leads to the following conclusions: (i) under the BRA framework, Chinese consumers rely on their positive attitude toward GM food to increase purchase intention and their perceived risks to decrease purchase intention. Moreover, consumers' trust increases their perceived benefits offered by GM food and decrease their perceived risks; (ii) under the TPB framework, attitude toward GM technology is the most significant predictor of purchase intention toward GM food, followed by perceived behavioral control and subjective norms; and (iii) under the integrated framework, although most of the results in the single framework of the BRA or the TPB are supported, the BRA provides better interpretation than the TPB. In addition, several mediating effects are found in the context of purchase intention toward GM food.

AB  - It is commonly believed that the general public is heavily dependent on the media for its political news and views and that, as a consequence, the media exercise a strong influence over public opinion and behaviour. However, many millions in the Western world strongly believe things that are barely ever mentioned in the mainstream media, just as many millions also firmly reject or ignore some of the messages that are repeated incessantly by them. This confirms sixty years of experimental psychology research showing that most individuals are capable of preserving their beliefs, even in the face of overwhelming evidence, argument and logic to the contrary. Consistent with this, political science research finds little evidence of strong media influence on the party voting, political attitudes and election agendas of citizens. They have their own ways of gathering political information about the world around them, and they do not necessarily believe what they read in the papers, unless they are so inclined to start with. Consequently, media influences on mass opinion and behaviour are weaker than commonly assumed and, such as they are, their effects are more beneficial than harmful for democracy.

KW  - PROPAGATION PATH
AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, the Internet has gradually become an interactive platform for people to exchange ideas, collide emotions, spread information, and release emotions. The openness, anonymity, and inclusiveness of the Internet have reduced the obstacles of information dissemination and triggered the conflict of public opinion on the Internet. In addition, students actively express their opinions, attitudes, and feelings on important topics in life and study on the Internet, forming a certain scale of online opinions reflecting students' unique political attitudes, moral concepts, and values. Because college students are immature physically and mentally and the network environment is full of phenomena, it is easy to arouse their emotional resonance. Therefore, the free and diverse network environment presents new challenges and higher requirements of the times for the stable operation of college network public opinion guidance. Therefore, how to form systematic education in universities combined with ideological and political network public opinions under big data has become an important problem to be solved. Based on this paper presents the communication pattern of network public opinion and model it, namely, the random network public opinion transmission model. By comparing the scope and influence of the two transmission paths of network public opinion, the paper draws the conclusion and strengthens the teaching practice of ideological and political courses. Finally, it is pointed out that the research of the ideological and political network public opinion communication path is a complex digital communication system project, which requires the government, the media, and the schools together to give suggestions in the guidance of the network public opinion.

AB  - Purpose
   The playable ad is a new type of digital advertising that combines interactivity with gamification. Guided by psychological reactance theory, this study aims to explore the psychological processes and effects of playable ads on consumers' perceived control and product attitudes.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This paper conducted two experiments to examine the relationship between playable ads, perceived control and product attitude. This paper also applied psychological reactance theory and investigated whether perceived control triggered by the interactive features of playable ads influenced psychological reactance toward them.
   Findings
   Findings from two experiments show that playable ads, compared to video ads, increased consumers' perceived control, which, in turn, led to more positive attitudes toward the advertised products (Studies 1 and 2). This study also supports psychological reactance theory by revealing that increased perceived control diminished perceived freedom threat and subsequently alleviated consumers' psychological reactance toward advertising messages (Study 2).
   Originality/value
   This study sheds light on the effectiveness of a new type of ad-game integration - playable ads. Different from prior research in gamification of advertising, this paper examined the effectiveness of playable ads in an information processing context in which the ads were not the primary task to focus on. This study also extends psychological reactance theory in the context of interactive marketing by exploring the effect of perceived control afforded by digital message features in mitigating reactance.

AB  - Reducing stigma is key to improving the wellbeing of people with albinism in Tanzania. This study aimed to obtain more insight into the effects of two radio interventions with regard to albinism-related stigma: a radio drama and a radio interview. Assessment of the radio interventions was based on two attitude measurement instruments (The Albinism Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue Community Stigma Scale and the Albinism Social Distance Scale), an entertainment scale, and two informal (group) interviews. In total, 111 community members participated in the assessment prior to the radio drama, and 65 after. In the case of the radio interview, 123 community members participated in the assessment prior to the radio show, and 77 after. Following the radio drama, a significant reduction was found in terms of community stigma, and a reduction in social distance was found after both interventions. The entertainment score for both interventions was high, but significantly higher for the radio drama. The respondents indicated that they had gained more understanding of albinism as a result of the interventions, and were positive about this type of education. The current study shows that a radio show in which the listener interacts with someone with albinism can contribute to a reduction in stigma, and demonstrates that different types of radio intervention can have different outcomes.
   Points of interest
   Reducing discrimination is key to improving the wellbeing of people with albinism in Tanzania.
   This research investigated the use of radio shows to change attitudes towards people with albinism within the community; two types of radio show were tested: a radio drama and a radio interview.
   Through the shows the respondents got into contact with someone with albinism.
   The shows were valued by the community members as an attractive means of education.
   The shows proved to be effective in terms of improving peoples' knowledge about, and attitude towards people with albinism.
   People enjoyed the radio drama more than the radio interview. The radio drama was also more effective than the radio interview in improving peoples' attitudes towards people with albinism.
   This research offers recommendations for organisations that are working to raise awareness with regard to albinism.

AB  - Introduction: Exposure to violence is a risk factor for firearm carriage. Youth exposed to violence also have difficulty envisioning positive future outcomes (e.g., educational outcomes), which can increase the likelihood of firearm carriage over time. Researchers, however, have not yet examined whether changes in exposure to violence over time can influence the developmental trajectories of firearm carriage. To address this gap, we (1) examined the longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage (grades 9 to 12) and then (2) examined whether changes in future expectations mediated this longitudinal association.
   Method: The longitudinal association between exposure to violence and firearm carriage through future expectations was examined among 850 adolescents from the Flint Adolescent Study. Participants were recruited from four high schools in a midwestern city in the United States. Parallel latent growth models and latent growth mediation models were estimated.
   Results: A positive association was observed between the rate of change in exposure to violence and firearm carriage. Exposure to violence also indirectly increased the risk for firearm carriage over time by decreasing future expectation in the 9th grade.
   Conclusions: Our results support the idea that helping youth develop positive attitude about educational success may help reduce firearm carriage. Increasing positive expectations about future may help prevent firearm carriage within the context of violence exposure.

AB  - Background: This study explored the extent of COVID-19 vaccination coverage and investigated drivers and barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake among people in prison. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from July to October 2021 among 517 detained people in the Campania region of South Italy. Results: In total, 47.1% of participants expressed a high concern about contracting COVID-19 after vaccination, whereas 60.6% and 53.8% of respondents reported a positive attitude towards usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines, respectively. Adherence to the active offer of COVID-19 vaccination involved 89.7% of detained subjects. COVID-19 vaccination uptake was significantly higher in females, and in those who reported influenza vaccination uptake, had received information about COVID-19 vaccination from media and newspapers, did not express need of additional information about COVID-19 vaccine, believed that COVID-19 vaccine is safe, were involved in working activities in the prison, and had a high school or university degree. Conclusions: These findings showed a high self-reported COVID-19 vaccination coverage in detained subjects, supporting the effectiveness of the strategy aimed at giving priority to COVID-19 vaccinations in prisons. Further efforts are needed to contrast the hesitancy of those who refused vaccination to increase their confidence about usefulness and safety of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - Handwashing (HW) with water and soap is one of the cheapest and most effective ways of protecting oneself and others against the coronavirus. Here, the HW knowledge, attitudes, and practices of Saudi adults were assessed during the COVID-19 pandemic using a cross-sectional study conducted between May 8 and June 8, 2020, during a partial lockdown period. A web-based validated questionnaire was distributed through different social media platforms, and the sociodemographic characteristics of the participants, seven items related to knowledge, four items related to attitudes, and thirteen items related to the practice of HW were assessed. A total of 1323 (51% male and 49% female) adults from all regions of Saudi Arabia responded to the questionnaire. The overall mean (+/- SD) was 5.13 (+/- 1.18) for knowledge of HW and COVID-19, 2.79 (+/- 0.77) for attitude toward HW, and 7.8 (+/- 2.56) for HW practice. A multiple linear regression analysis revealed factors associated with knowledge to be age and family income. Sex, educational level, family income, and HW knowledge were associated with negative and neutral attitude, whereas age, sex, family income, and HW knowledge were associated with practice. These results suggest that HW knowledge was strongly associated with positive attitudes toward HW and correct HW practice in Saudi adults during the COVID-19 lockdown.

AB  - Context-Knowledge is linked consistently with organ donation attitudes, willingness, and consent. Negative information about donation and the recipients of donation can affect public opinion and donation willingness. However, it is unclear which information sources are most important in forming knowledge, particularly in Australia where little prior research exists.
   Objectives-To identify information sources that may inform Australians' organ donation knowledge and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Participants-1487 Australian residents aged 18 years or older who completed an online survey.
   Main Outcome Measures-Self-reported knowledge, information sources, and attitudes toward transplant recipients.
   Results-Participants felt fairly well informed about organ donation, particularly if they registered donation wishes, were female, and were older. More than half reported their driver's license, television news, and discussion with family/friends as donation information sources. However, information sources contributing to knowledge were personal experience, online, hospital, government campaign, discussion with family/friends, Medicare, doctor's surgery, and the newspaper. Differences based on registration status, sex, and age, were found. Discussion with family/friends and movies or television shows, as well as not having seen information in a newspaper or doctor's surgery, contributed to positive attitudes toward recipients, although the variance explained was small.
   Conclusions-People felt more informed by personal, medical, and government information sources than by mass media. Family discussion was not only a common information source but also contributed significantly and positively to both donation knowledge and attitudes toward recipients. Further exploration of information sources contributing to donation knowledge and community attitudes toward, transplant recipients among young men is needed.

AB  - This article investigates the impact of perceived age norms on the formation of entrepreneurial intentions in the third age. Age norms refer to those social norms that determine whether establishing and running a business are considered appropriate behavior for a mature individual. An empirical analysis of Finnish individuals finds that norms perceived as permissive of enterprising activity in the third age exert a significant positive influence on entrepreneurial intentions in this segment, even when controlling for the general level of entrepreneurship in the municipalities. This influence is partially mediated by whether the individual has a positive attitude toward entrepreneurship, by how the individual perceives their own ability to start and run a business, by the extent of support from their family and friends they perceive and by the importance of that support to them. Thus, if policy aims to increase enterprising activity in the third-age segment, the portfolio of instruments should include measures that address people's general awareness of third-age entrepreneurship as a viable, positive and attractive late-career option.

AB  - Before consequences of climate change continue to intensify and increasingly affect the entire planet, immediate action must be taken. For instance, adopt the pro-environmental behaviors such as purchase of organic food to minimize the harmful human-caused impacts to the environment. This paper aims to determine the factors that influence the purchase intention of organic food in Malaysia by applying the theory of planned behavior and the protection motivation theory. A total of 300 questionnaires were collected and PLS-SEM was employed to test the structural relationships. Consequences of climate change and health threats were not the primary concerns among Malaysians when deciding whether to purchase organic food. Results show that perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and attitude affect purchase intention towards organic food. Consumers were more likely to have positive attitude towards organic food when they have adequate information on vulnerability of a threat and its consequences. The findings provide insights on the antecedents and outcomes of purchase intention towards organic food particularly in Malaysia. Although predictive power of perceived factors such as perceived rewards and perceived efficacy have been extensively researched in the past, there are limited studies that integrate both theories that simultaneously investigate antecedents of consumers' purchase intention towards organic food.

AB  - Background: Gender-based data indicates that within-race STI rate disparities exist for young African Americans males, (YAAMs) ages 18 to 24. Social media may prove to be a valuable tool for delivering theory-driven messages about sexual health knowledge and behaviors, including condom usage, directly to YAAMs in promoting safer sex behaviors for this population. Purpose: To examine the current attitudes, norms and perceived controls related to the influence of social media on condom use among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Methods: Nine group-depth interviews were held with 41 participants, mean age 19, SD +1.2, were conducted in metro Detroit to understand use of social media for condom use education, and health messages among YAAMs ages 18 to 21. Results: Participants demonstrated positive attitudes about using social media for condom use education. Social media sites that were educational (n = 12) and engaging (n = 5) made it easy to seek out sexual health information related to condom use. Similarly, participants liked social media for condom use education if the sites provided educational (n = 9) content and had creative advertisements. (n = 7). Top reasons to dislike social media as a mode for condom use education included negative comments (n = 6) displayed on the sites or if the site provided misinformation (n = 5) about the use of condoms. Conclusion: The findings here can help healthcare providers, the community and researchers understand media preference, navigation, and better understand the role of social media in adolescent health care.

AB  - Framed by a social exchange perspective, this study address the issue of whether positive employees' perceptions about human resource management practices influence positive attitudes and behaviour. We hypothesize that human resource management practices (HRMP) have a significant negative effect on intention to voluntary leave the organization and a positive effect on organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB), and that OCB could mediate the relationship between HRMP and turnover intention. A sample of 165 employees from the Portuguese public administration participated in the study. Data was analysed through descriptive statistics, confirmatory factor analysis and hypotheses were tested using single and multiple linear regressions. Results indicate that HRMP is positively associated with OCB, but only internal communication practice is highly valued by Portuguese public employees and successfully predicts OCB. HRMP also show a positive association with turnover intention but only celebration and recognition practices are predictors of turnover intention. Contrary to our hypothesis OCB did not acted as mediator between HRMP and turnover intention. Some suggestions on managerial human resource practices were proposed as well as some main questions raised in the Portuguese public administration context.

AB  - This study investigates attitudes towards legalizing land sales and Willingness to Accept (WTA) sales prices and compensation prices for land among smallholder households in the southern highlands of Ethiopia. Household panel data from 2007 and 2012 are used. The large majority of the sample prefers land sales to remain illegal, and the resistance to legalizing land sales increased from 2007 to 2012. While resistance against land sales was strongest among the most land poor in 2007, the relatively more land rich had become more negative towards legalizing land sales in 2012. Younger age and more education were not associated with a more positive attitude towards legalizing land sales. In the same period, perceived median real land values increased sharply but also exhibit substantial local variation with higher land values in areas with better market access. Stated minimum land sales prices increased with farm size in 2012. The substantial increase in perceived land values, high economic growth and outmigration of youth have yet to persuade the rural population in southern Ethiopia to open the land sales market.

AB  - We explore the potential of teleoperated androids, which are embodied telecommunication media with humanlike appearances. By conducting a pilot study, we investigated how Telenoid, a teleoperated android designed as a minimalistic human, affects people in the real world when it is employed to express telepresence and a sense of 'being there'. Our exploratory study focused on the social aspects of the android robot, which might facilitate communication between the elderly and Telenoid's operator. This new way of creating social relationships can be used to solve a problem in society, the social isolation of senior citizens. It has become a major issue even in Denmark that is known as one of countries with advanced welfare systems. In this pilot study at Danish homes, we found that the elderly with or without dementia showed positive attitudes toward Telenoid and developed various dialogue strategies. Contrary to the issue of revulsion that can be caused by humanlike robots and the negative reactions by non-users in media reports, we discuss potentials and challenges of the android's embodiment for social inclusion of senior citizens in telecommunications.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to present the problems of a typical rural school in a mountainous region in terms of the organization of the educational process, in particular distance learning of students in a coronary virus pandemic. The following research methods were used: analytic synthetic, empirical and mathematical statistics. The specifics of the organization of schoolchildren's education in the alpine conditions of a small rural school are substantiated. The results of an empirical study conducted among teachers of rural schools in the mountains of Ukraine are presented. The subject of the survey were questions about the attitude of teachers to distance learning in rural schools, the realities and difficulties of using information and communication technologies (ICT) in the educational process. It was found that among teachers of various levels of rural education (preschool, primary and secondary school) 49.12% have a positive attitude to distance learning, 18.42% - partially support. Given the difficulties and problems of using ICT, lack of teaching materials for online learning, low level of digital and media literacy, 23.68% of teachers - strongly against this form of organization of the educational process in remote rural (mountainous) regions. Prospects for the development of rural schools in mountainous areas in the context of digitalization of education are identified.

AB  - The success of digital longforms in terms of readership and viral spread promotes an optimistic perspective on innovative web journalism with regard to the attention, engagement, and subsequent knowledge acquisition of citizens when consuming news. Since empirical evidence for such effects is scant, this experimental study focuses on visual aesthetics as a signature element of novel news formats that are designed to attract attention in a highly competitive media landscape. Specifically, it draws on the theoretical framework of user engagement and shows that the presence of visual aesthetics contributes to meaningful learning from the news by initiating positive attitudes towards the interface, which in turn leads to deeper involvement with the content. However, when the presence of visual aesthetics fails to affect interface evaluation, the opposite effect occurs. Surprisingly, these effects are not found to be contingent upon individual differences such as issue involvement or issue-specific prior knowledge. Overall, our results suggest that for news organizations, it is worth investing financial and personal resources in innovative news formats in order to support knowledge gain, although they need to be carefully designed as the first encounter with the interface decides about the subsequent engagement with and processing of the news.

AB  - Background. A novel coronavirus first reported in Wuhan City in China in 2019 (COVID-19) developed into a global pandemic throughout 2020. Many countries around the world implemented strict social distancing policies to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we aimed to examine potential change in mental/physical health and social relationships during a highly restrictive COVID-19 lockdown period in Australia during April 2020.
   Methods. Our survey (n = 1,599) included questions about concerns, social behaviour, perceived change in relationship quality, social media use, frequency of exercise, physical health, and mental health during COVID-19 lockdown (April, 2020).
   Results. When estimating their mental health for the previous year 13% of participants reported more negative than positive emotion, whereas this increased to 41% when participants reflected on their time during COVID-19 lockdown. A substantial proportion (39-54%) of participants reported deterioration in mental health, physical health, financial situation, and work productivity. However, most of these participants reported 'somewhat' rather than 'a lot' of deterioration, and many others reported 'no change' (40-50%) or even 'improvement' (6-17%). Even less impact was apparent for social relationships (68% reported 'no change') as participants compensated for decreased face-to-face interaction via increased technology-mediated interaction.
   Conclusions. The psychological toll of COVID-19 on Australians may not have been as large as other parts of the world with greater infection rates. Our findings highlight how technology-mediated communication can allow people to adequately maintain social relationships during an extreme lockdown event.

AB  - Aim/Purpose This paper investigates the influence of university student multitasking on their learning success, defined as students' learning satisfaction and performance.
   Background Most research on student multitasking finds student multitasking problematic. However, this research is generally from 2010. Yet, today's students are known to be digital natives and they have a different, more positive, relationship with mobile technologies. Based on the old findings, most instructors ban mobile technology use during instruction, and design their online courses without regard for the mobile technology use that happens regardless of their ban. This study investigates whether today's instructors and learning management system interface designers should take into account multitasking with mobile technologies.
   Methodology A quasi-experimental design was used in this study. Data were collected from 117 students across two sections of an introductory Management Information Systems class taught by the first author. We took multiple approaches and steps to control for confounding factors and to increase the internal validity of the study. We used a control group as a comparison group, we used a pre-test, we controlled for selection bias, and we tested for demographic differences between groups.
   Contribution With this paper, we explicated the relationship between multitasking and learning success. We defined learning success as learning performance and learning satisfaction. Contrary to the literature, we found that multitasking involving IT texting does not decrease students' learning performance. An explanation of this change is the change in the student population, and the digital nativeness between 2010s and 2020 and beyond.
   Findings Our study showed that multitasking involving IT texting does not decrease students' performance in class compared to not multitasking. Secondly, our study showed that, overall, multitasking reduced the students' learning satisfaction despite the literature suggesting otherwise. We found that attitude towards multitasking moderated the relationship between multitasking and learning satisfaction as follows. Individuals who had a positive attitude towards multitasking had high learning satisfaction with multitasking. However, individuals who had positive attitude toward multitasking did not necessarily have higher learning performance.
   Recommendations for Practitioners We would recommend both instructors and the designers of learning management systems to take mobile multitasking into consideration while designing courses and course interfaces, rather than banning multitasking, and assuming that the students do not do it. Furthermore, we recommend including multi-tasking into relevant courses such as Management Information Systems courses to make students aware of their own multitasking behavior and their results.
   Recommendations for Researchers We recommend that future studies investigate multitasking with different instruction methods, especially studies that make students aware of their multitasking behavior and its outcomes will be useful for next generations.
   Impact on Society This paper investigates the role of mobile multitasking on learning performance. Since mobile technologies are ubiquitous and their use in multitasking is common, their use in multitasking affects societal performance.
   Future Research Studies that replicate our research with larger and more diverse samples are needed. Future research could explore research-based experiential teaching methods, similar to this study.

AB  - When receiving unfair monetary offers from another person, the most common response is punishment. Existing literature on the Ultimatum Game indicates that individuals frequently refuse unfair offers even when this results in a loss for themselves. Here, we present behavioral and neurophysiological evidence demonstrating that friendship substantially modifies this response. When the proposer was a friend rather than an unknown person, unfair offers were less frequently rejected and the medial frontal negativity (MFN) typically associated with unfair offers was reversed to positive polarity. The underlying generators were located in inferior-mesial and right inferior-and medial-lateral frontal regions (BA10 and BA11). These findings highlight the fundamental role of the anterior prefrontal cortex in interpersonal economic interaction and, particularly, present new evidence on the effects of social distance on the MFN.

AB  - Background and Purpose Virus mitigation strategies such as adhering to stay-at-home orders, practicing social distancing, and engaging in personal protective behaviors are central to slowing the spread of COVID-19. This population-based cohort study sought to identify sociodemographic characteristics and Health Belief Model factors that are associated with nonadherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies with the goal of informing public health messaging campaigns.
   Methods An online population-based survey was distributed via social media over an 8-week period from April 13, 2020, to June 8, 2020.
   Results Data were derived from 2,222 adults (57% female; 40% racial/ethnic minorities). Univariate analyses revealed that men, younger aged (18-30 years) and unmarried adults, and noncollege educated individuals had lower levels of perceived threat, control, and knowledge about COVID-19 (p <= .001). Multivariable linear regression models further revealed that male gender was significantly associated with reporting lower levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .001), and that higher levels of perceived threat, perceived control, and knowledge about how to keep oneself and others safe from COVID-19 were significantly associated with reporting higher levels of adherence to COVID-19 mitigation strategies (p < .01).
   Conclusions Findings suggest that public health appeals that target men, emphasize individual risk, and provide clear, consistent guidance on what individuals can do to decrease their risk for COVID-19 may be effective in motivating increased mitigation adherence.

KW  - QUANTIFIED AUDIENCES
AB  - As newsrooms are increasingly using web analytics to monitor news behavior, journalism is likely to become increasingly "metrics-driven." Research suggests that analytics are commonly used by web editors to decide on the distribution and promotion of news stories, but how does this affect the news practices of journalists? To what extent are audience metrics taken into account by individual journalists and reporters who work in a specific news beat? This paper explores this question through a survey of political journalists in Belgium. The study examines the level of access that political news journalists have to audience metrics, and to what extent their level of exposure to and use of metrics affects their attitudes toward analytics in news work. Results show that while three quarters of the political news journalists are nowadays exposed to audience metrics on a regular basis, more than half of them report to never make direct use of web metrics in their daily work. Younger journalists are more likely to be exposed and to use web metrics than their senior colleagues, but journalists working for commercial media do not use metrics more intensely than journalists from public service media. Journalists who actively use metrics themselves tend to hold more positive attitudes toward web metrics, whereas the passive exposure to metrics seems to make journalists more skeptical or negative about them.

AB  - Electric mobility has been around for a long time. In recent years, with advancements in technology, electric vehicles (EVs) have shown a new potential to meet many of the challenges being faced by humanity. These challenges include increasing dependence on fossil fuels, environmental concerns, challenges posed by rapid urbanization, urban mobility, and employment. However, the adoption of electric vehicles has remained challenging despite consumers having a positive attitude toward EVs and big policy pushes by governments in many countries. Marketers from the electric vehicle (EV) industry are finding it difficult to identify genuine buyers for their products. In this context, the present study attempts to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a person would "Buy" or "Won't Buy" an electric vehicle in India. To develop the model, an exploration of EV context was done first by conducting a text analysis of online content relating to electric vehicles. The objective was to find frequently occurring words to gain a meaningful understanding of the consumer's interests and concerns relating to electric vehicles. The machine learning model indicates that age, gender, income, level of environmental concerns, vehicle cost, running cost, vehicle performance, driving range, and mass behavior are significant predictors of electrical vehicle purchase in India. The level of education, employment, and government subsidy are not significant predictors of EV uptake.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN ITALIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - Political polarization
KW  - dramatization
KW  - media system
KW  - segmentation
AB  - This contribution is organized along two main interpretive lines. First: the Italian public sphere is very polarized because of well-established historical attitudes, a crowded media market and new technologies that push towards segmentation of the audience. The arrival of Berlusconi has only reinforced the already existing polarization that goes well beyond the borders of partisanship involving the content of news, the structure and professionalism of news outlets and also the recipients that divide themselves along the lines of political attitudes. The second characteristic feature of the Italian public sphere involves the tendency towards dramatization, which is also produced by the sudden commercialization of the entire mass media system that started in 1980. This article's thesis is supported by examples of dramatization and extreme political discourse. The consequences that derive from this situation are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - Each year thousands of women are trafficked for sexual exploitation. To understand how the mass media represent trafficking, a qualitative framing analysis of magazines, published from 2000 through to 2010, was conducted. Results showed magazines presented complementary frames of victimization and benevolence. Magazine articles shed light on trafficking, which operates in society's shadows and is far removed from many people's lives, but articles reinforce hierarchies and divisions: between women and men; among women; and among "good" prostitutes who deserve help and "bad" prostitutes who do not. Articles imply that the problem of trafficking is one of individual vulnerability, which can be remedied by charitable efforts, and ignore the larger cultural, political, economic, and educational systems of sex discrimination. Traffickers and men who buy sex were largely absent from magazine stories, and focus on the sale of sexual services, rather than the purchase, emphasized women's role in the trafficking process while making men's roles invisible. Because the mass media can shape public opinion and public policy, such incomplete reports may lead to ineffective policies.

AB  - Sharks have historically suffered from a negative image, which has been indirectly fuelling public fear and government decisions to kill sharks, as part of bather protection programmes in various countries. Scientists are arguing, however, that the public opinion of sharks is increasingly positive, and that opposition to lethal shark control and to negative shark framing is growing. Positive attitudes and behaviour towards sharks tend to be influenced by an array of factors, which ought to be considered in studies aimed at effectively steering shark conservation actions. This study used a questionnaire survey of 1138 beach visitors in South Africa, together with structural equation modelling, to investigate human perceptions of sharks, and their influence on outcome variables including attitudes and behaviour towards shark hazard mitigation and shark framing. The results show that basic knowledge and attitudes towards sharks have a significant effect on the outcome variables. Additionally, attitudes towards sharks moderate the effect of perceived risk from sharks on the outcome variables. The results support arguments of public concern for sharks, and provide guidance for strategies aimed at garnering more support for shark conservation.

AB  - The main objective of the research was to analyse the study attitudes and study behaviour of online students at DOBA Business School. Furthermore, the aim was to evaluate the interrelationship between study attitudes and study behaviour and to assess the predictive value of the two sets of variables for students' general satisfaction with the study programmes. A total of 331 students participated in the web survey. Participants expressed the most positive attitudes towards the use of technology and flexibility of online learning, while the absence of personal contacts was also perceived as highly favourable. Average scores for both deep and strategic approaches were quite high, while the surface approach was much less prominent. Participants were highly engaged with their teamwork assignments, whereas proactive communication was somewhat less developed. Study attitudes seem to be far more powerful predictors of general satisfaction than study behaviour, which is not surprising. Satisfaction is thought to be the result of the complex subjective evaluation of all relevant aspects of the study programme implementation, as they were measured by attitudinal subscales.

KW  - REGION
AB  - Objectives: Malaria affects millions of people in urban and rural India every year. This study addresses two main gaps in current research: 1) attitudes towards personal protective strategies against Malaria among urban populations; and 2) understanding of the extent to which urban health information seeking preferences shape preventive behaviours.
   Study design: Cross-sectional face-to-face surveys using stratified sampling design.
   Methods: A 60-min survey was carried out to 1000 middle-of-pyramid (MOP) population in five main cities in India by trained interviewers. Variables assessed included perceived effectiveness and actual practice of 14 scientific and indigenous personal protection methods, Malaria-related attitudes (susceptibility, severity and response efficacy) and health information seeking preferences.
   Results: Actual practice of Malaria preventive behaviours was found to be significantly lower than the perceived effectiveness of each of the fourteen scientific and indigenous methods. Television, newspapers, and mobile phones were reported as the top three preferred media for seeking public health information. Lastly, perceived susceptibility, response efficacy, and health-related media use were found to play significant roles in predicting actual practice behaviours.
   Conclusions: Our study highlights a need for health authorities to focus on translating positive attitudes to actual practice of preventive behaviours. Communication efforts may focus on the use of TV, newspapers and mobile phones for greater reach and efficacy. Other implications for Malaria prevention programs are discussed.

AB  - After several significant nuclear accidents, public attitudes toward nuclear energy technologies and facilities are considered to be one of the essential factors in the national energy and electricity policy-making process of several nations that employ nuclear energy as their key energy resource. However, it is difficult to explore and capture such an attitude, because the majority of prior studies analyzed public attitudes with a limited number of respondents and fragmentary opinion polls. In order to supplement this point, this study suggests a big data analyzing method with K-LIWC (Korean-Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count), sentiment and query analysis methods, and investigates public attitudes, positive and negative emotional statements about nuclear energy with the collected data sets of well-known social media and network services in Korea over time. Results show that several events and accidents related to nuclear energy have consistent or temporary effects on the attitude and ratios of the statements, depending on the kind of events and accidents. The presented methodology and the use of big data in relation to the energy industry is suggested as it can be helpful in addressing and exploring public attitudes. Based on the results, implications, limitations, and future research areas are presented. (C) 2018 Korean Nuclear Society, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.

AB  - This research assessed fatalism toward COVID-19 and its role in behavioral intentions to support mitigation efforts (e. g., social distancing) and mental well-being. A COVID-19 fatalism measure was developed, and a messaging manipulation (fatalistic vs. optimistic vs. no message) was created to examine causal links between fatalism scores. Support for mitigation efforts and negative affect (anxiety, fear, depression, and insecurity) were measured to examine the consequences of fatalism toward COVID-19. Results showed that the fatalistic messaging condition increased fatalism whereas the optimistic message reduced it. The effects of the messaging manipulation were also apparent in the downstream measures of support for mitigation and negative affect through the mediator of fatalism toward COVID-19. Specifically, fatalism negatively predicted intentions to support mitigation. Regarding mental health, fatalism was positively associated with depression but negatively associated with fear and insecurity. Implications for COVID-19 mitigation efforts and mental health in the face of the coronavirus pandemic are discussed.

AB  - Background. While sport is often considered a vehicle for peace, the evidence for this notion is weak. There is also a vast difference in the way in which sports have been studied.
   Problem and aim. In light of the conflict between Ukraine and Russia, the current study investigated reconciliatory attitudes among Ukrainian athletes when facing Russian and non-Russian opponents. The aim was to explore whether sport and competition can unite combat sports athletes despite them coming from countries in conflict.
   Method. One hundred and fifty-six Ukrainian athletes in several different types of combat sports were recruited and divided into two groups according to whether or not they faced a Russian opponent. The groups then answered questions in regard to reconciliatory attitudes, sociopolitical hostility and aggression. Their answers were analyzed in an ANOVA and with subsequent moderation analysis with the PROCESS macro v3.1.
   Results and conclusions. We found that, in general, competition influenced reconciliatory attitudes in a positive way. Moreover, the effect was predicted by physical aggression, verbal aggression and anger. Additionally, hostility moderated the relationship between pre-and post-reconciliatory attitudes. However, neither nationality nor sociopolitical perception of Russia influenced reconciliatory attitudes. These findings might have implications for future research on combat sports, such as identifying individuals suitable to reconcile and the fostering of positive attitudes (peace) despite political conflict.

AB  - Makerspaces and hacklabs are believed to encourage a positive attitude towards gaining computer skills. Within these communities for peer production, citizens can apply cutting-edge technologies in DIY projects. In recent decades, mushrooming makerspaces and hacklabs were embraced by the tech industry and governments alike. Feminist makerspaces and hacklabs, however, as they are centred around a queer feminist agenda, have raised eyebrows. In order to foster diversity in tech development, they create safer spaces for self-expression. Here, feminist lay(wo)men* (To emphasise that the category 'Woman' is constructed and that more people than only those who identify as women are being included, one uses the sign * after the term 'women' ), makers, designers, artists and tinkerers experiment with open-source hardware and software. Art and design projects emerging from feminist hacklabs focus on issues of representation and democratic participation in digital media, as well as on ways of reclaiming one's own body. This article tries to unpack how, after an exhibition on sexual health norms, a feminist hacklab was attacked by local right-wing and conservative politicians. The attack resulted in the defunding of the feminist hacklab. But it also started a transformation process within the collective, as members became aware of critical interferences of diffracting marginalisations. The crisis triggered a discussion on how each member was threatened to very different degrees; for example, there was more at stake for members depending on their legal status in the country. The right-wing and conservative campaign against the feminist hacklab damaged the initiative, but at the same time it pushed the collective to generate increased vehemence and resilience.

AB  - Objectives: To identify elderly inpatients' attitudes toward deprescribing at King Khalid University Hospital and determine the most commonly used polypharmacy drugs. Methods: A cross-sectional study on deprescribing in elderly patients was conducted at Riyadh's King Saud university medical city during January-February/2019. We used the validated Arabic version of the Patient Attitude toward Deprescribing (rPATD) questionnaire. Results: One hundred fourteen patients completed the questionnaire with a response rate of 83%. The participants' mean age was 68.9 +/- 7.4. Most were females (54.4%), married (86.8%), and illiterate (42.1%). Despite 63% of the patients feeling that they were taking many medicines, 58.8% of the participants did not perceive a financial burden of medications. The median (range) of comorbidities was 3(6). The cardiovascular and metabolic diseases account for (86.0%) and (79.8%). Patients took a median (range) of 8(12) medications. The most were statins (48.2%), proton pump inhibitor (46.4%), beta-blocker (41.8%), insulin (38.2%), biguanides (35.5%) and Anticoagulants (22.7). Overall, 87.7% would like to some of their drugs if their physicians allow it, although 80.7% reported satisfication with their drugs. The positive attitude towards deprescribing) accounted for 48.2%. It was higher among those younger 80, p<0.05. Also, the illiterate scored higher median than other educational groups on the burden factor subscale, p<0.01. Conclusion: The majority of elderly patients are willing to deprescribe when it is appropriate. We recommend the utilization of clinical pharmacists' expertise to simplify the polypharmacy for patients. Further studies should be held to obtain more evidence to initiate the deprescribing process.

AB  - Background: Globally, depression is the fourth leading cause of mental illness and disability among adolescents (15-19 years). This study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude toward depression among adolescents attending secondary schools. Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study among 257 adolescents attending secondary schools in an urban area of Lagos State. Multistage sampling technique was used to identify appropriate schools, and a semi-structured self-administered questionnaire that contained a vignette depicting depression was used to collect data. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 20. Results: Overall, 257 students participated in the study. The mean age was 15.8 +/- 1.3 years. Majority (91.5%) had prior knowledge about depression. The most common sources of information were from school (38.9%), family and friends (23.3%), and social media (20.6%). Majority (87.9%) correctly recognized depression in the vignette. Attempted suicide and social withdrawal from friends (71% and 67.3%, respectively) were less recognized as symptoms of depression. Similarly, only 36.2% recognized depression as a real medical condition. Students in science (76.9%) had better knowledge about depression than students in arts (43.5%) and commerce (43.8%) (P = 0.006). The teacher was considered as the primary access to care compared to the need for specialized care. Majority of the respondents had positive attitudes toward depression and 75.4% believed that people with depression should not be stigmatized. Conclusion: This study showed important gaps in knowledge of causes, symptoms, and the need for professional or psychiatric care of depression. It highlights the need to promote mental health literacy in schools.

AB  - Objective. Our aim was to (1) survey public' perception and attitudes toward organ donation and (2) analyze the relationship between knowledge, attitudes, and willingness to donate.
   Methods. We developed a questionnaire, and conducted the survey with stratified random sampling. Overall, 600 residents, aged >= 18 who resided in Hunan, and 600 undergraduates from 3 universities in Hunan were surveyed randomly. For this study, 1085 valid questionnaires were completed, with a response rate of 90.4%.
   Results. Of the 1085 participants, 581 (53.5%) were students, 504 (46.5%) were residents, and 519 (47.8%) were male and 566 (52.2%) female. The mean accuracy rate was 71.96%, and the students' mean accuracy rate was slightly higher than that of the resident population (73.06% vs 70.68%, respectively). The results showed that 82.2% of public support organ donation, and 53.5% were willing to donate their organs after death. Students scored higher than the residents (88% vs 75.6% and 55.6% vs 51.2%). Nearly 1.8% felt that organ donation was against their religion, 14.9% thought it was important to ensure the integrity of the body, 71.7% agreed that organ donation allowed a positive outcome after a person's death, and 61.5% agreed that organ donation represented a continuation of life, to help families cope with grief. Age and gender were related to attitudes. Public knowledge of organ donation and their attitudes were correlated positively (r = 0.666).
   Conclusions. Public knowledge of organ donation is poor, biased, and incomplete, and based on television, movies, and communication networks. Positive attitudes toward donation displayed in the surveys were not matched by actual organ donation.

AB  - Purpose To investigate the influence of poor health on job-search behavior and re-employment, and the mediating role of job-search cognitions and coping resources. Methods A prospective study was conducted among unemployed persons receiving social security benefits in the Netherlands (n = 510). Self-rated health, self-esteem, mastery, job-search cognitions, and the intention to search for a job were measured at baseline. Logistic regression analysis was used to investigate determinants of job-search behavior during a follow-up period of 6 months. Cox proportional hazards analysis was used to investigate the influence of health, job-search cognitions and coping resources on re-employment during a mean follow-up period of 23 months. Results Persons with poor health were less likely to search for paid employment (OR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.39-0.85) and were also less likely to find paid employment (HR 0.58, 95 % CI 0.39-0.89). Persons with a positive attitude toward job-search, high perceived social pressure to look for a job, high job-search self-efficacy and high job-search intention were more likely to search actively and also to actually find paid employment. Adjustment for job-search cognitions and coping reduced the influence of health on active search behavior by 50 % and on re-employment by 33 %. Conclusions Health-related differences in job-search behavior and re-employment can be partly explained by differences in coping, job-search attitude, self-efficacy, and subjective norms towards job-search behavior. Measures to reduce the negative impact of poor health on re-employment should address the interplay of health with job-search cognitions and coping resources.

AB  - General Medicine Practitioners (GPs) are often the first point of contact for advice and management in cases of dental related pain. The reasons for presentation to the General Practitioners, rather than the dentist, include non-classic presentation of dento-facial pain, lack of coordinated after hours dental care, poor patient education, patients' prescription of their GP as the primary coordinator of integrated total health care and financial considerations. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude and awareness of the common oral diseases and to create awareness of the prevailing dental conditions among general practitioners, techniques for better diagnosis, and appropriate management protocols for different dental conditions. A questionnaire study was carried out among 130 General Practitioners in the suburban areas of Nagpur City using an online survey tool. 21 questions related to dental or denture-related problems and benign and malignant disease were presented in the questionnaire. The doctors have spent an average of 5 minutes to finish the survey. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. Out of 130 General Practitioners 71 were well versed about plaque and calculus, whereas 86% felt that referral of the patient to a dentist is the more appropriate way to treat a dental abscess. The results of the study show that general practitioners had good dental knowledge. They were well aware about most of the dental conditions, along with the various oral manifestations of systemic diseases, and life threatening conditions. It is essential that the general practitioners should keep their knowledge updated with time. Oral health education can be included in the medical curriculum to emphasize a positive attitude towards oral health.

AB  - Recently, 194 World Health Organization member states called on the international organization to develop a global campaign to combat ageism, citing its alarming ubiquity, insidious threat to health, and prevalence in the media. Existing media studies of age stereotypes have mostly been single-sourced. This study harnesses a 1.1-billion-word media database comprising the British National Corpus and Corpus of Contemporary American English-with genres including spoken/television, fiction, magazines, newspapers-to provide a comprehensive view of ageism in the United Kingdom and United States. The US and UK were chosen as they are home to the largest media conglomerates with tremendous power to shape public opinion. The most commonly used synonym of older adults was identified, and its most frequently used descriptors were analyzed for valence. Such computational linguistics techniques represent a new advance in studying aging narratives. The key finding is consistent, though no less alarming: Negative descriptions of older adults outnumber positive ones by six times. Negative descriptions tend to be physical, while positive ones tend to be behavioral. Magazines contain the highest levels of ageism, followed by the spoken genre, newspapers, and fiction. Findings underscore the need to increase public awareness of ageism and lay the groundwork to design targeted societal campaigns to tackle ageism-one of our generation's most pernicious threats.

AB  - The Coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) originated in China at the end of 2019, the virus festered there for four months before spreading globally. Impacting the developed and developing world including Indonesia. It has transformed social, economic and political practices social life, everyday habits and government policies, with multi-dimensional consequences on human life. The present study endeavours to explore the relationship between religiosity, social capital, and psychological well-being of the general public, particularly in terms of coping with the pandemic. In addition to this, the study aims to highlight the importance of public awareness regarding social distancing, use of religion as a coping mechanism, and living a healthy lifestyle during pandemic. For knowing the perception of the masses, an online survey by using a self-administered questionnaire was carried out among coronavirus patients, the general public, social media activists, students, and professionals across Indonesia. The findings indicate that the pandemic has altered the lifestyle of the masses in different ways and that people have varied perceptions towards this virus regarding its spread and preventive measures. The study also reveals that, social capital (beta = .418, p < .001), psychological well-being (beta = .343, p < .001), and religious coping (beta = .145, p <. 01) have a significant amount of the variance of coronavirus situational stress (F = 69.77, p < .001, R2 = 0.485). Lastly, the study suggests that, adopting preventative measures, standard operating procedures that are sustainable and healthy forms of coping with the pandemic will be equally as important as medical care in order to contain and eventually eradicate the virus.

AB  - The response of churches to the challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic invites a closer examination of the relationships between virtual and embodied religious communities during a time of social distancing. The speed and the scale of the closure of church buildings during Easter 2020 sheds light upon the multiplicity of practical, emotional, and spiritual responses to a relationship between church and people that is increasingly dominated by online interactions. Such a seismic shift in social culture opens up the possibility and challenges of a new understanding of belonging and participation in a religious community. Given its liturgical, pastoral, and sacramental significance, Easter 2020 was a highly charged moment for the relationship between the Christian churches and the faithful, and between religious worship and social media. In the shift from embodied community to virtual congregation that followed, the material absence of physical presence in collective worship was striking, as was the psychological presence of that absence. This paper analyses different understandings of religion, church, and community in the period of a pandemic, and argues for the value of an approach that situates the debates spawned in the context of historical precedent, personal experience, and theoretical approaches to networks, communities, religion, and social media.

AB  - How do cultural norms, ideologies, and beliefs shape public opinion and media framing of race-based athletic activism? This paper uses media coverage of and commentary on the 1968 American 'revolt of the Black athlete' to explicate the deep cultural structures that help explain both support and opposition. The paper begins with a brief, schematic overview of the proposal for a Black Olympic boycott that was the centrepiece of 1968 organising and how it was reported by sports journalists and in the mainstream media. The second section identifies the reasons American reporters were, on the whole, so opposed to the proposed boycott: the inherent lack of support for the athletes' racial change agenda and the far-more-familiar arguments that sports were not the proper venue for activism. The third section argues that a whole constellation of cultural norms and beliefs-about sport culture, colour-blind visions of racial justice, and liberal democratic ideals about politics and social change-coalesced to make race-based sport protest appear both unnecessary and inappropriate. The conclusion summarises the implications for understanding both public reception of and media responses to contemporary, race-based athletic activism as well as for tracking institutional changes and cultural shifts unfolding in the Black Lives Matter era.

AB  - "Mental travel" is a cognitive concept embodying the human capacity to intentionally disengage from the here and now, and mentally experience the world from different perspectives. We explored how individuals mentally "travel" to the point of view (POV) of other people in varying levels of personal closeness and from these perspectives process these people's social network. Under fMRI, participants were asked to "project" themselves to the POVs of four different people: a close other, a non-close other, a famous-person, and their own-self, and rate the level of affiliation (closeness) to different individuals in the respective social network. Participants were always faster making judgments from their own POV compared with other POVs (self-projection effect) and for people who were personally closer to their adopted POV (social-distance effect). Brain activity at the medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex in the self-POV was higher, compared with all other conditions. Activity at the right temporoparietal junction and medial parietal cortex was found to distinguish between the personally related (self, close, and nonclose others) and unrelated (famous-person) people. No difference was found between mental travel to the POVs of close and nonclose others. Regardless of POV, the precuneus, anterior cingulate cortex, prefrontal cortex, and temporoparietal junction distinguished between close and distant individuals within the different social networks. Representational similarity analysis implicated the left retrosplenial cortex as crucial for social distance processing across all POVs. These distinctions suggest several constraints regarding our ability to adopt others' POV and process not only ours but also other people's social networks and stress the importance of proximity in social cognition.
   NEW & NOTEWORTHY Mental-travel, the ability to mentally imagine oneself in a different place and time, is a fundamental cognitive concept. Investigation of mental-travel in the social domain under fMRI revealed that a network of brain regions, largely overlapping the default-mode-network, is responsible for "traveling" to points of view of different others; moreover, this network distinguishes between closer and less-close others, suggesting that mental-travel is a rich dynamical process, encompassing individuals in different proximities and these individuals' social network.

AB  - Purpose This study aimed to investigate: (1) the characteristics of people using, or had previously used, assistance animals within community living in Australia; (2) positive and/or negative experiences of these users; and (3) educational resources that may aid public awareness. Materials and methods An online survey was distributed through Australian assistance animal organisations and social media channels. Past/current assistance animal users (n = 112) responded to questions on demographic and types of animal supports used, experience of assistance animal use, community attitudes experienced, and perspectives about the need for public education. Data were analysed with descriptive and inferential statistics. Content analysis provided additional insights of the positive and/or negative experiences assistance animal users had faced. Results Nearly all participants used an assistance dog (n = 111), and 37 (33%) used the animal for more than one type of support. Seventy percent reported experiencing both positive and negative community attitudes/reactions. Length of time of having an assistance animal was associated with significantly higher prevalence of positive attitudes/reactions, whilst users who received medical support from the animal tended to experience more negative community attitudes/reactions than other users. The majority (90%) agreed that more public education is needed regarding assistance animal public access rights. Conclusions This study is the first in Australia to undertake a large-scale survey of assistance animal users with a range of disability types. It highlights the benefits and challenges of assistance animals, which could be useful to consider when determining the most appropriate support for an individual.

AB  - Depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help are associated factors of suicide in adolescents. As parents are the main decision-makers of receiving professional help for their children's depression and suicide, parental factors influencing their children's suicide should be examined. Moreover, parents' help-seeking attitude for their own mental health problems could affect their children's mental health problems. Therefore, this study examined the serial mediation of adolescents' depression, depression stigma, and attitude toward psychiatric help in the relationship between parental attitude toward psychiatric help and the suicidal ideation of their children, using data of 103 parent-child pairs. A cross-sectional study was conducted by employing a self-administered survey. A serial mediation analysis was performed using Amos 25.0. Parental attitude toward psychiatric help directly and indirectly influenced children's suicidal ideation. Children's depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression mediated the relationship of parental attitude toward psychiatric help and their children's suicidal ideation. When parents have a more positive attitude toward psychiatric help, their children's suicidal ideation become more decreased. Enhancing only parental attitude toward psychiatric help may make a positive change on their children's suicidal ideation. The study findings imply that when developing and applying youth suicide prevention programs, how parents affect their children's suicidal ideation should be considered as well as adolescents' depression stigma, attitude toward psychiatric help, and depression. Given the results of this study, healthcare providers may better evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention programs for preventing adolescents' suicide.

TI  - Health Care Professionals as Relatives in Organ Donation Interviews: Analysis of the Important Role of Health Care Professionals as Family Members
T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
KW  - ATTITUDES
AB  - Introduction. The organ and tissue donation interview is a vital step in obtaining the donation. Therefore, it is important to obtain as much information as possible regarding the relatives of the potential donor prior to this interview and know if there is a health care professional among the relatives who may act as an interlocutor. Objective. The objective of this study is to assess the influence that relatives who are health care professionals may have if present at the interview for the organ and tissue donation request. Methods. This is a descriptive study of all the organ donations from 1996 to 2019. Variables of the interview record form were completed by the Regional Transplant Coordination Office. Quantitative variables are expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range), and qualitative variables are expressed in percentage. The c2 test was used for inferential statistics. Results. Health care professionals were present as interlocutors in 8.4% of the total interviews conducted (9279). Organ donation was accepted in 86% of these interviews, while the relative who was a health care professional gave a 93.8% (729) positive response to the donation. Having a health care professional as an interlocutor favors the acceptance of the donation (odds ratio 9.325, 95% confidence interval: 5.05417.205; P < .001). Conclusion. Health care professionals have a very positive attitude toward donation. This attitude positively impacts other relatives? acceptance of the donation.

AB  - Purpose Based on social exchange theory and the substitutes for leadership theory, this paper aims to investigate whether an organization's high-commitment HRM strategy can substitute for the effect of servant leadership in promoting employees' affective commitment, psychological empowerment and intent to remain with the organization. Design/methodology/approach This study's hypotheses were tested with moderation and mediation analyses conducted on a sample of 172 Chinese employees. Findings The results show significant negative interaction effects between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership, such that high levels of one will reduce the positive effect of the other on affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Further, the effects of high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions are mediated through affective commitment and psychological empowerment. Finally, support was found for a mediated moderation model where the negative interaction effect between high-commitment HRM systems and servant leadership on turnover intentions is mediated through affective commitment. Practical implications - The results of this study can help practitioners identify alternative means to influence employees' positive attitudes and work motivation when implementing high-commitment HRM systems is not feasible for the organization. Originality/value This study contributes to the leadership literature by providing evidence supporting the substitutes for leadership theory and describing the specific conditions under which this theory is valid, as well as contributing to the HRM literature by examining the dynamic interaction of HRM and leadership.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   Demographers are increasingly interested in connecting demographic behaviour and trends with 'soft' measures, i.e., complementary information on attitudes, values, feelings, and intentions.
   OBJECTIVE
   The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how computational linguistic techniques can be used to explore opinions and semantic orientations related to parenthood.
   METHODS
   In this article we scrutinize about three million filtered Italian tweets from 2014. First, we implement a methodological framework relying on Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis, which is used to extract sentiments. We then run a supervised machine-learning experiment on the overall dataset, based on the annotated set of tweets from the previous stage. Consequently, we infer to what extent social media users report negative or positive affect on topics relevant to the fertility domain.
   RESULTS
   Parents express a generally positive attitude towards being and becoming parents, but they are also fearful, surprised, and sad. They also have quite negative sentiments about their children's future, politics, fertility, and parental behaviour. By exploiting geographical information from tweets we find a significant correlation between the prevalence of positive sentiments about parenthood and macro-regional indicators of both life satisfaction and fertility level.
   CONTRIBUTION
   We show how tweets can be used to represent soft measures such as attitudes, values, and feelings, and we establish how they relate to demographic features. Linguistic analysis of social media data provides a middle ground between qualitative studies and more standard quantitative approaches.

AB  - In the international context of efforts to combat the stigmatization of people with mental health problems, representations and attitudes about these illnesses have not to date been widely investigated in France. However, new technologies offer an unprecedented opportunity to collect such information on a large scale and to deploy more efficient action against stigma.
   Objectives. - The Crazy'App survey was designed as an instrument for studying potentially stigmatizing representations and attitudes towards mental disorders. It asks respondents to react, rather than to standard diagnostic labels or case vignettes, to video testimonies by people with different mental disorders talking about their experiences.
   Methods. - The web survey was made available on smartphone or computer and advertised on various media and during a French exhibition about mental disorders, mental health and well-being ("Mental Desordre", Cite des sciences, Paris, 2016). It consisted of short (<2 min) video testimonials by four people presenting respectively anorexia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and addiction to alcohol. Each testimony was immediately followed by series of questions to which participants were to respond using visual analog scales. The questionnaires investigated different domains, such as the causes of each of these mental disorders, the possible treatments and the respondent's personal attitudes in hypothetical situations (e.g. working with the person seen in the video). After having completed the survey, respondents were offered an opportunity to compare their own responses to those of the other respondents, and watch expert psychiatrists interviews delivering clinical and scientific knowledge and sharing their own attitudes.
   Results. - The respondents (n = 2600) were young, mostly women, educated and concerned about the subject. They exhibited good knowledge of the disorders. They reported a multi-causal view of the etiologies, where psychological causes were rated higher than neurobiological causes (although less so for respondents reporting having had a mental disorder themselves), while other types of causes (environmental, spiritual, and nutritional) received much lower ratings. Respondents also expressed high potential social proximity, but this result varied according to the type of disorder, in particular, the social distance and the perception of dangerousness were greater for addiction and bipolar disorder.
   Conclusions. - Crazy'App operationalizes emerging strategies in the efforts to combat stigma, implementing what is known as a "contact based intervention" in English-speaking countries. While it does not erase the differences in attitudes observed from one pathology to another, this type of survey -intervention based on video testimonies could help to reduce the desire for social distancing from people with mental disorders, even in a particularly sensitized and informed population. Multimedia technologies are an efficient way to offer rich, potentially interactive content better able to embody people and their actual experiences than clinical descriptions or even life narratives. However the use of videos could put the focus on the individual characteristics (physical, gestural, verbal, nonverbal. . .), and this should be cautiously taken into account according to the anti-stigma objectives. Connected technologies also make it possible to enhance the more classic de-stigmatization actions focused on the deconstruction of preconceived ideas, making the action more participatory, while simultaneously assessing their efficacy. By mediating contact with individuals and behaviors perceived as deviant, the aim would be to develop psycho-social skills and concrete abilities for action in the general population, to include people with mental disorders in the community.

AB  - Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target-how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group-as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions.

AB  - Background: Stigmatizing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking are important barriers for people with mental health problems to obtain adequate professional help. This study aimed to examine: (1) population attitudes toward depression and toward seeking professional help in four European countries; (2) the relation between depression stigma and attitudes toward help-seeking; (3) the relation between both attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics; and (4) differences in attitudes across countries.
   Methods: A representative general population survey (n=4011) was conducted in Germany, Hungary, Ireland, and Portugal, assessing attitudes toward depression and toward help-seeking, and a number of socio-demographic variables.
   Results: Respondents showed a moderate degree of personal stigma toward depression and a strikingly higher degree of perceived stigma. Although a substantial majority showed openness to seek professional help, only half of the people perceived professional help as valuable. More negative attitudes were found in Hungary and were associated with male gender, older age, lower educational level and living alone. Also, personal stigma was related to less openness to and less perceived value of professional treatment.
   Limitations: The survey was cross-sectional, so no causal inferences could be drawn.
   Conclusions: Personal and perceived stigma toward depression deserves public health attention, since they impact upon the intention of people with depression to seek professional help. Public media campaigns should focus on the credibility of the mental health care sector, and target males, older people, and those with a lower educational level and living alone. The content of each campaign should be adapted to the cultural norms of the country for which it is intended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social distancing is the core policy response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). But, as federal, state and local governments begin opening businesses and relaxing shelter-in-place orders worldwide, we lack quantitative evidence on how policies in one region affect mobility and social distancing in other regions and the consequences of uncoordinated regional policies adopted in the presence of such spillovers. To investigate this concern, we combined daily, county-level data on shelter-in-place policies with movement data from over 27 million mobile devices, social network connections among over 220 million Facebook users, daily temperature and precipitation data from 62,000 weather stations, and county-level census data on population demographics to estimate the geographic and social network spillovers created by regional policies across the United States. Our analysis shows that the contact patterns of people in a given region are significantly influenced by the policies and behaviors of people in other, sometimes distant, regions. When just one-third of a state's social and geographic peer states adopt shelter-in-place policies, it creates a reduction in mobility equal to the state's own policy decisions. These spillovers are mediated by peer travel and distancing behaviors in those states. A simple analytical model calibrated with our empirical estimates demonstrated that the "loss from anarchy" in uncoordinated state policies is increasing in the number of noncooperating states and the size of social and geographic spillovers. These results suggest a substantial cost of uncoordinated government responses to COVID-19 when people, ideas, and media move across borders.

   Design/methodology/approach - This study obtained 221 responses from Indonesian youngsters, which was used to validate the proposed model using structural equation modeling analysis.
   Findings - The direct effect indicated that perceived behavior and social distance attitude were the most significant predictors of intention followed by boredom and place attachment (PA), and the indirect effect of loneliness and social presence. In addition, moderating impact contributed significantly by providing profound knowledge toward the result.
   Originality/value - The combination of PA and personal traits based on the push-pull-mooring framework relating to the virtual third place adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic offered a comprehensive model that has not been explored extensively by previous studies.

AB  - Health promoters who use the mass media to encourage people to change their health behaviours usually underestimate the importance of audience's mental predispositions, which may determine their susceptibility to such influences. This paper presents research findings that show how some elements of an audience's mentality are related to their attitudes towards healthy lifestyle promotion in the mass media (HLPMM). The research project, undertaken between 2007 and 2009, comprised: a qualitative study using in-depth interviews (N=30); a self-administered survey on a purposive sample (N=237) and a computer-assisted personal interview or interviewing (CAPI) survey on a representative sample of Polish adult population (N=934). The findings from the first two studies were used to construct a scale to investigate the attitude towards HLPMM. This scale was applied in a nation wide survey and, as a result, four dimensions of the attitude were identified: (1) appraisal of the idea of HLPMM; (2) appraisal of HLPMM practice; (3) propensity to receive media messages promoting healthy lifestyle and (4) propensity to avoid such messages. Moreover, the survey results confirmed the hypotheses whereby a higher degree of individualism, a higher degree of authoritarianism, a weaker demanding orientation and generalised trust are related to a more positive attitude towards HLPMM. The aforementioned relationships indicate that producers of media messages promoting a healthy lifestyle need to take account of their audience's mentality, since knowledge of mental predispositions of the target audience may help them make the message more suitable for specific recipients.

We further examined whether internal religious coping and external religious coping mediated both relationships. Results indicated a significant association with religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services, as well as external religious coping and internal religious coping. Results also showed a nonsignificant association with both religious coping and negative attitudes towards mental health services. Finally, external religious coping mediated the relationship between religiosity and negative attitudes towards mental health services for men but not for women.

AB  - In December 2020, we conducted a telephone survey to determine what factors are connected to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy among adults in Nevada. The survey was based on factors identified in other studies, such as demographic variables (age, race, ethnicity, gender, household income, urbanicity, educational attainment), health status, previous COVID-19 infections, social media engagement, adherence to social distancing guidelines, beliefs about COVID-19, and political ideology identifications. Using a proportional odds model, we compared vaccine hesitancy levels to determine the odds of being more likely versus unlikely to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Of 1,000 people surveyed, 30.4% exhibited vaccine hesitancy. Findings showed that adults with significantly lower odds of vaccine hesitancy included those who were male, older, worried about COVID-19 infection or its community effects, adhered to social distancing, and reported higher incomes. Adults who identified as African American or Black or as multiple or "other" races exhibited significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy than White adults. Adults self-identifying as conservative had significantly higher odds of vaccine hesitancy than others. Vaccine hesitancy levels suggest possible hurdles to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic in a state with high visitor volumes and demographics that resemble the country's future as minority White, highlighting possible lessons for future pandemics. Most measures of COVID-19 worry were not significantly associated with vaccine hesitancy, suggesting that vaccination efforts should focus on other motivators. COVID-19 vaccination efforts should also directly encourage uptake by younger and middle-aged adults who are female, African American, have lower incomes, and identify as conservative.

AB  - Electronic communication is emotionally gratifying, but how do such technological distractions impact academic learning? The current study observed 263 middle school, high school and university students studying for 15 min in their homes. Observers noted technologies present and computer windows open in the learning environment prior to studying plus a minute-by-minute assessment of on-task behavior, off-task technology use and open computer windows during studying. A questionnaire assessed study strategies, task-switching preference, technology attitudes, media usage, monthly texting and phone calling, social networking use and grade point average (GPA). Participants averaged less than six minutes on task prior to switching most often due to technological distractions including social media, texting and preference for task-switching. Having a positive attitude toward technology did not affect being on-task during studying. However, those who preferred to task-switch had more distracting technologies available and were more likely to be off-task than others. Also, those who accessed Facebook had lower GPAs than those who avoided it. Finally, students with relatively high use of study strategies were more likely to stay on-task than other students. The educational implications include allowing students short "technology breaks" to reduce distractions and teaching students metacognitive strategies regarding when interruptions negatively impact learning.

AB  - Several electronic-engagement-related questions arise at work due to the beginning of a new era of social distancing, lockdowns, quarantining, and sanitization. These terms were not so common before. What challenges do employees face while working from home? Why do they face those challenges? How are they overcoming these challenges? In summary, in a work-from-home setting, what are the issues and solutions in engaging remote workers electronically? To answer these questions, 23 information technology (IT) employees in India and four in the United Kingdom were interviewed, and data were analyzed using interpretive phenomenological analysis (IPA). A few information technology employees from the United Kingdom were also interviewed to ensure the transferability of the results. Along with a few suggestions, six challenges emerged. These may help employers formulate their electronic engagement strategies for employees in a better manner.

AB  - Aims: Poor academic achievement is strongly related to smoking but studies that examine the mechanism between academic achievement and smoking are lacking. The aim of this study, therefore, was to examine the smoking-related cognitions (i.e. attitude, social influence, self-efficacy and intention to smoke) in relation to academic achievement and determine whether these cognitions explain different patterns of smoking. Methods: The study uses the data of a longitudinal study that was carried out in Finland, and the sample comprised 1,096 students in grades seven to nine. Results: During the seventh-grade students with poor academic achievement reported more positive attitudes to smoking and a greater social influence of their peers regarding smoking, weaker self-efficacy to refuse smoking and more intentions to smoke in the future compared to students with high academic achievement. Moreover, the follow-up analyses after a 24-month interval revealed that sel-fefficacy to refuse smoking of students with poor grades had become weaker compared to students with high grades. Furthermore, the influence of seventh-grade academic achievement predicting ninth-grade weekly smoking was partially mediated through the self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke. Conclusions: Differences in academic achievement may have an impact on adolescents' self-efficacy beliefs and the intention to smoke in the future. To reduce health inequalities a strong input on continuing research to improve smoking prevention methods, especially for students with low academic achievement, is needed.

AB  - Background The U.S. is experiencing an opioid overdose health crisis, largely driven by opioid use disorder (OUD). College students have relatively high rates of substance use disorders. Objectives To identify perceived knowledge of and perceived helpfulness of various OUD treatments, including medications for OUD (MOUD), among college students. Methods A convenience sample of students enrolled at two public universities during Fall 2018/Spring 2019 were recruited for an online cross-sectional survey. Questions examined reported knowledge of and perceived helpfulness of MOUD (i.e. methadone, buprenorphine, naltrexone) and non-MOUD treatments for OUD (e.g. peer support groups, individual counseling, group counseling, outpatient treatment). Logistic regression examined associations between knowledge, perceived helpfulness, and demographic variables. Results We received 1,439 responses and kept 1,280 (39% male; 61% female). Respondents were significantly more likely to report knowledge about non-MOUD treatments than MOUD treatments (48.7% of respondents reported being very knowledgeable about individual counseling, 4.4% about methadone, 3.8% about naltrexone, and 3.4% about buprenorphine). Among those reporting at least some MOUD knowledge, few perceived MOUD as helpful/very helpful (methadone 14%, naltrexone 14%, and buprenorphine 11%). Among those reporting at least some counseling knowledge, 71% felt counseling was helpful/very helpful. Perceived treatment knowledge was significantly and positively associated with perceived treatment helpfulness. Conclusions Students had more positive attitudes toward non-MOUD treatments than toward MOUD despite greater efficacy of the latter for OUD. Colleges could provide information about MOUD during orientation, in course work, through student extracurricular organizations, or through college health clinics.

AB  - This paper primarily focuses on the family language policy of bilingual Russian-Estonian and Russian-Spanish families in relation to the maintenance of Russian as a heritage language. Its main objective is to identify social factors that either help or hinder this process. In doing so, this paper searches for commonalities and specificities of the mainstream attitudes towards Russian as a heritage language in Estonia and Spain, by analysing the sociolinguistic situation of Russian in both countries and by examining the factors conditioning the maintenance of Russian as a heritage language in family settings. Our research is based on an in-depth analysis of a variety of sources, mainly quantitative statistical and demographic data on self-reported language behaviour and language ideologies in mixed families from Estonia (n = 40) and Spain (n = 40). The main results of our comparative study confirm the general positive attitude towards Russian as a heritage language, but they also highlight an important variability of these attitudes both between countries and within each community. We show that these attitudes directly determine the principles of family language policy, the parents' strategies to transmit Russian as a heritage language, and the level of proficiency in Russian as a heritage language in the second generation. These results allow us to conclude that, as a heritage language, Russian relies on strong attitudinal support in even small communities, like Estonian or Spanish, but also that its confident transmission should rely on external subsidy.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to investigate the use patterns and ownership of smartphone apps among students at the Department of Library and Information Science (DLIS) at the South Valley University (SVU), Egypt. This study may help faculty members and students, as well as DLISs in general and SVU's DLIS, in particular, to understand the nature and purpose of such use.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study used quantitative research methodology in the form of a survey, which was undertaken from February to March 2015. The survey instrument was a self-administrated questionnaire, with a response rate 82.7 per cent (441/533).
   Findings - The findings of this study showed that smartphone users (82.7 per cent) at SVU's DLIS tended to be junior females. Smartphone non-users (17.3 per cent) tended to be also young females but primarily sophomores. The highest percentage of smartphone users had been using smartphones for four to five years, and the largest number of students was described to be advanced users who heard first about these mobile devices through friends and the Web. Most users had 21 to 25 apps. Social apps were the most popular and included Facebook, e-mail and Twitter. For professional purposes, students used smartphones more for communication purposes than learning purposes. Apps related to educational purposes included Google Mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia Mobile. Students perceived most apps to be easy to use and useful to them. There were a number of uses for socializing including messaging, following the news and playing games. Students had mainly positive attitudes towards apps with a few negative concerns. Almost all students confirmed that they trust most apps. Barriers related to the use of apps included training and lack of awareness. Further research may be needed to specify the relationship between the students' use of these apps and their academic performance. The main tasks done on smartphone devices were mainly for socializing. Students indicated that popular tasks and activities, such as sending and receiving messages, following the news, making communications, making chat, making friends, finding specific information, finding general information, making discussion groups, playing games, completing class assignments, checking materials related to courses, doing business, seeking jobs, watching movies, listening to music and accessing library services are important tasks accomplished by them through the use of these devices. The current study indicated very positive attitudes towards the use of these apps. Student at least agree with the statement that smartphone apps allow for easy dissemination of information, provide too much information, increase the speed of finding information, help communication, convenient, secure, build confident and reduce paper use. However, a large number of students also at least agree with the statement that these apps are time consuming, intimidating, addictive, violate privacy, require high language and technical skills, harmful and frustrating. Almost all students confirmed that they are at least trustful in some apps, such as WhatsApp, e-mail, YouTube, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter and Viber. A large number of smartphone users surveyed in this study have been described to make excessive usage of social apps, such as communication apps, messaging/texting apps and social networking sites, which were at the forefront of use. Additionally, a large number of them adopted these devices, especially for communication purposes. The most used apps were Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, WhatsApp, YouTube and Viber. For professional purposes, students used smartphones more for communication purposes than learning purposes. However, some of the students were using some of apps related to educational purposes, such as Google mobile, Facebook, e-mail, Twitter, YouTube and Wikipedia mobile but not on a regular basis. Students perceived the use of e-mail app, Google mobile, Facebook app WhatsApp, Kik, Twitter, YouTube, Google maps, Viber, Line, Skype, Tango, Instagram, Flickr and Wikipedia mobile as at least fairly easy to them.
   Additionally, they perceived the use of e-mail app Google mobile, WhatsApp, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Viber, Instagram, Wikipedia mobile, Google maps, Kik, Skype, Line, Tango and Flickr as at least fairly useful to them, especially for the purpose socialization more than learning.
   Research limitations/implications - This study focuses only on undergraduate library and information science students belonging to SVU's DLIS, Egypt. Any findings and conclusions resulting from this study are limited in scope to only SVU's DLIS's undergraduate students. The study does not contain a significantly large sample of a population from across Egypt to draw meaningful widespread conclusions indicative of such a larger population.
   Practical implications - This study provides valuable insight into the use pattern of smartphones among a very important client group. It may serve as useful input to researchers who are interested in the study of mobile internet technologies (MITs), particularly in the education society.
   Originality/value - Being the first study of its kind about university students in Egypt, it is considered a pioneering and a unique study among studies conducted in the field of ICTs and MITs, especially with this category of information users.

AB  - Results of radiology imaging studies are not typically comprehensible to patients. With the advances in artificial intelligence (AI) technology in recent years, it is expected that AI technology can aid patients' understanding of radiology imaging data. The aim of this study is to understand patients' perceptions and acceptance of using AI technology to interpret their radiology reports. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 13 participants to elicit reflections pertaining to the use of AI technology in radiology report interpretation. A thematic analysis approach was employed to analyze the interview data. Participants have a generally positive attitude toward using AI-based systems to comprehend their radiology reports. AI is perceived to be particularly useful in seeking actionable information, confirming the doctor's opinions, and preparing for the consultation. However, we also found various concerns related to the use of AI in this context, such as cyber-security, accuracy, and lack of empathy. Our results highlight the necessity of providing AI explanations to promote people's trust and acceptance of AI. Designers of patient-centered AI systems should employ user-centered design approaches to address patients' concerns. Such systems should also be designed to promote trust and deliver concerning health results in an empathetic manner to optimize the user experience.

AB  - Objectives Following the outbreak of COVID-19, social distancing restrictions limited access to face-to-face mental health services in Western Australia (WA), necessitating a rapid transition to non-face-to-face alternatives, including telehealth. The current study investigated barriers and facilitators to telehealth access and engagement, and preferences for child and youth mental health service delivery during and beyond COVID-19. Methods Three participant groups were recruited via social media and partner organisations, and completed a tailored online survey: i) young people (14-25 years) who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services (n = 84), ii) parents of young people with a child aged 0-25 years who had ever accessed or attempted to access mental health support or services with or on behalf of their child (n = 68), and iii) professionals working in the child or youth mental health sector (n = 167). Results Regarding barriers to engagement, young people were primarily concerned with the privacy implications of telehealth and its efficacy relative to face-to-face alternatives. Parents and clinicians were more concerned with the technological pitfalls of telehealth (e.g., internet-connectivity, picture/sound issues). Telehealth's accessibility was highlighted as a facilitator for all groups. Although certain participant groups were considered to be more suited to telehealth than others, most participants endorsed a blended approach to the future provision of mental health services. Conclusions To facilitate a blended approach to the delivery of child and youth mental health services, participants recommended more reliable and affordable internet access, implementing funding models that support telehealth delivery, and training for clinical staff.

AB  - In the context of ethical consumption, we examine the effects of farmers' facial expression in print advertising on consumers' responses to local food. Furthermore, we try to verify the moderating role of emotional intelligence (EI) on consumers' responses to the advertising message strategy. The advertising message strategy that connects farmers and consumers is expected to create more favorable responses among consumers toward local food and its retailers. This study examines consumers' responses (perceived product quality, trust, and a positive attitude toward the local food retailer) to three conditions of farmers' facial expression in the advertisement (neutral facial expression, positive facial expression, and product only, with no portrait) across two levels of EI (low and high). We find that farmers' positive facial expressions in the advertisements have the greatest positive effects on consumers' perceived product quality, trust, and attitude toward the local food retailer under a high level of EI. Therefore, individuals with a high level of EI were more influenced by facial expressions in print advertising, whereas those with a low level of EI were less influenced by facial expressions in print advertising, and their responses were indifferent to whether the local food farmer had a neutral or a positive facial expression in print advertising. Our findings suggest that marketing practitioners consider personal characteristics such as EI in persuading local food consumers in target markets to implement strategies to promote local food purchase and consumption.

AB  - Problem: Many studies focus on knowledge and attitudes of unaffected people towards epilepsy and people with epilepsy (PWE). The perspective of PWE themselves is much less explored.
   Methods: We invited PWE in Germany to answer a questionnaire on their knowledge and attitudes towards epilepsy and PWE.
   Results: The questionnaire was completed by 230 PWE (median age: 40 years; min./max.: 19/83; 66 % female). Of PWE, 22 % thought that PWE are more helpful, and 10 % thought that PWE are friendlier than other people. Nevertheless, reservations about relationships and friendships with other PWE existed: of the participants, only 74 % would definitely go on a date with another PWE, and 90 % would definitely include another PWE they liked into their circle of friends. Swimming was judged as more dangerous for PWE than for healthy people by 71 % of PWE. Of PWE, 86 % correctly assumed it was not useful to hold a person having a seizure to the ground. Putting a solid object in the mouth was considered not useful by 85 % of PWE. Of PWE, 20 % would definitely administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure. For 67 % of PWE, certain preconditions should have to be fulfilled such as an available document with instructions. Of PWE, 11 % stated they would not administer an available emergency medication if another PWE had a seizure.
   Conclusion: Although positive attitudes of PWE towards other PWE exist, we also found some reservations calling for psychosocial support. Most PWE had sufficient knowledge about risks of certain activities and about measures to be taken during a seizure. Nevertheless, a small group of PWE showed knowledge gaps. Thus, educational support still seems essential.

AB  - Background/purpose: This study was undertaken to document the knowledge, attitude and behavior among family caregivers, and to identify the related factors influencing their behavior in promoting their and children's oral health.
   Materials and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect self-administered questionnaires from 503 family caregivers, who cared for 6-12 year-old children with disabilities in 10 special schools. Multiple regression models were used to analyze the association between caregiver's oral health behaviors and related factors.
   Results: Most caregivers were female (74.8%). The top three sources of oral health knowledge among caregivers were dentists (66.60%), books (34.59%) and television (31.21%). Comparison of oral health knowledge and attitude scores among different education levels of caregivers yielded statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). Eighty-four percent of caregivers cleaned their teeth twice a day and 46.12% used dental floss. More than half of caregivers (60.44%) assisted their children to brush teeth. Only 12.65% took their children to receive fluoride varnish services. Caregivers' favorable oral health behavior was found to be significantly associated with a higher education level, better knowledge and positive attitude. The determining factor of caregivers' preventive behavior was attitude. Education level influenced the caregiver's knowledge. Knowledge is positively associated with attitude.
   Conclusion: Inadequate knowledge is the major factor preventing caregivers from favorable oral health behavior. Oral health related educational programs aimed at promoting caregivers' behavior must take into consideration the caregivers' knowledge level first. Education programs should be recommended to caregivers with a lower education level. (C) 2017 Association for Dental Sciences of the Republic of China. Publishing services by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the prevalence of bed-sharing and examine correlates of bed-sharing habits in early adolescents.
   Methods: Participants were 1452 early adolescents from 10 primary schools in Shanghai, China. Children's health status and past history, family environment and parents' attitude towards bed-sharing, and children's sleep arrangements were surveyed. Sleep was assessed by the Children's Sleep Habit Questionnaire. Tanner stage was determined by the endocrinologist.
   Results: The median of age was 10.83 years (range: 9.42-12.92; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.79-10.83) and boys accounted for 51.17%. The prevalence of bed-sharing was 16.8%. Positive parental attitude toward bed-sharing (OR: 9.87; 95% CI: 6.57-14.83), asthma (OR: 2.15; 95% CI: 1.16-3.98), smaller residential space (OR: 1.90; 95% CI: 1.17-3.09), extended family (OR: 1.59; 95% CI: 1.16-2.18), and being physically less mature (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.16-4.91) increased the likelihood of bed-sharing. Bed sharers were more likely to have bedtime resistance (OR: 12.20; 95% CI: 8.59-17.33), sleep anxiety (OR: 3.76; 95% CI: 2.74-5.15), and poor sleep quality (OR: 3.21; 95% CI: 2.28-4.81) compared to non-bed-sharers. Furthermore, bed-sharing was associated with daytime sleepiness (OR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.10-2.13) but not with sleep duration.
   Conclusions: Bed-sharing is highly prevalent among Chinese early adolescents and is significantly related to sleep quality. Parental positive attitude toward bed-sharing was the most determining factor. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Christchurch attack on March 15, 2019, on two mosques by a white supremacist is marked as a lethal incident in the history of New Zealand. In this deadly attack, at least 5o Muslims were killed and more than 5o got fatal injuries. The oddity found in this attack was that both the shootings, one on mosque Al Noor and the other on Linwood Islamic Centre, were broadcast live on Facebook. Though, the incident sparked a wave of anger throughout the Muslim world. However, that Jacinda Arden the Prime Minister of New Zealand stood in front and showed sympathy with Muslims by assuring them justice. In this way, the primary purpose of this study was to examine the representation and framing of Jacinda Ardern in post-Christchurch attack press coverage in the Muslim country newspapers. The study found that most of the stories related to Jacinda Ardern are found in Daily Dawn Pakistan, New Straits Times of Malaysia, and in the UAE's leading newspaper Khaleej Times. However, the Tehran Times of Iran has given less coverage to Jacinda. Further, findings of the framing of Jacinda Ardern in the Muslim world press after Christchurch's attack showed most of the stories published in the four newspapers have and have framed her neutral and positive. Besides, frames like the icon of peace, anti-racist, Jacindamania, comparison of JA, and anti-Islamophobia are represented higher and paragon of leadership and redefining leadership are framed lowest in the Muslim world press.

AB  - Two experiments evaluated the effects of exposure to pictures of suntanned and untanned fashion models on attitudes regarding the importance of having a tan. In Experiment 1, 128 women were randomly assigned to view images of photographer's models that had been digitally altered to make it appear that the model either did or did not have a tan. Participants who viewed images of the models without a tan expressed significantly less positive attitudes toward tanning than did those who viewed the same models with a tan. In Experiment 2, 169 women were randomly assigned to view advertisements taken from fashion and beauty magazines that contained models who appeared to have suntanned skin, models who appeared not to have a tan, or no models at all. The results demonstrated that participants who viewed ads depicting models with untanned skin expressed less favorable attitudes toward tanning than did those who viewed control ads or those who viewed tan models. Given escalating skincancer rates, it is important to examine the role that media exposure may play in promoting risky behaviors.

AB  - The increasing trend of using new media technologies and particularly social media (SM) among students provides an advantage for lecturers. Apparently their importance accelerated with the application of social distancing during a pandemic crisis such as the one World has been experiencing since the end of 2019. In this article, the stories of two academics are used expressing experiences, motives and perceptions on benefits and challenges of using SM to support teaching and learning in the classroom. The stories which form the data of the research describe how and why the participants started to use SM, their intended purpose and the ways of use. Besides, reasons, difficulties and positive as well as the negative sides are explored. The findings show that the virtual learning environments provided by SM facilitated the development of students' enthusiasm and interaction with peers assertively, thus increasing the students' participation. Because of emerging technologies, SM platforms surge and plummet quickly; therefore, it is important for institutions to either develop their platform or to subscribe to existing ones for effective knowledge sharing at an institutional level with clear ethical rules.

AB  - Background We developed the informed health choices (IHC) primary school resources to teach children how to assess the trustworthiness of claims about the effects of treatments. We evaluated these resources in a randomised trial in Uganda. This paper describes the process evaluation that we conducted alongside this trial.
   Objectives To identify factors affecting the implementation, impact and scaling up of the intervention; and potential adverse and beneficial effects of the intervention.
   Methods All 85 teachers in the 60 schools in the intervention arm of the trial completed a questionnaire after each lesson and at the end of the term. We conducted structured classroom observations at all 60 schools. For interviews and focus groups, we purposively selected six schools. We interviewed district education officers, teachers, head teachers, children and their parents. We used a framework analysis approach to analyse the data.
   Results Most of the participants liked the IHC resources and felt that the content was important. This motivated the teachers and contributed to positive attitudes. Although some teachers started out lacking confidence, many found that the children's enthusiasm for the lessons made them more confident. Nearly everyone interviewed thought that the children learnt something important and many thought that it improved their decision-making. The main barrier to scaling up use of the IHC resources that participants identified was the need to incorporate the lessons into the national curriculum.
   Conclusion The mostly positive findings reflect the trial results, which showed large effects on the children's and the teachers' critical appraisal skills. The main limitations of this evaluation are that the investigators were responsible for both developing and evaluating the intervention.

AB  - Television is an important political tool in Latin America. In recognition of its ability to shape public opinion and influence political behavior, Brazilian electoral authorities provide political parties with free television airtime in the weeks preceding elections. While Brazil's publicly financed electoral program levels the playing field between parties, it may contribute to intraparty resource disparities. This article contends that racial considerations influence how party elites distribute television airtime and thus contribute to the political marginalization of Afro-Brazilians. Using original data from Rio de Janeiro's 2012 municipal elections, it shows that party officials provide Afro-Brazilian candidates significantly less airtime than their white counterparts, even after controlling for theoretically important nonracial candidate characteristics. Moreover, it shows that there are racial differences in how candidates use the airtime they are awarded. Afro-Brazilian candidates are nearly ten times more likely than whites to focus on racial issues in their campaign ads. These results provide new insight about why Afro-Brazilians are rarely elected to public office and, when elected, the types of issues they may address.

AB  - Positive attitudes towards the aged and expectations of the ageing process have been recognised as important drivers of healthy ageing. Utilising novel methods previously used to improve attitudes towards older adults, the current article reports the impact of imagined contact with an older adult on expectations of ageing and ageing anxiety compared to a control. Two hundred and one undergraduate students were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (1) imagined contact with a 75 year old male, (2) imagined contact with a 75 year old female, or (3) a control. Results revealed that imagined contact with either an older male or female was associated with more positive expectations of ageing in male participants, both immediately after the intervention and at a four week follow-up, compared to the control. No such results were found for female participants. Among male participants, the relationship between imagined intergenerational contact and expectations of ageing was mediated by ageing anxiety, indicating that males in the imagined contact conditions experienced significantly better expectations of ageing through reduced anxiety about ageing, compared to the control. No indirect effect of ageing anxiety on the relationship between imagined intergenerational contact and expectations of ageing was found for female participants. Implications of these findings and suggestions for future research will be discussed. Overall, the findings of the current study suggest that imagined contact may be an efficacious alternative for decreasing ageing anxiety and for producing more positive expectations of ageing when the opportunity for direct contact is unavailable.

AB  - In lay perception, dirty work is a type of labor that degrades human dignity. Work can be perceived as dirty on three bases: social (related to the subordinate position or associated with contact with stigmatized people), physical (related to direct contact with garbage and waste), and moral (related to jobs considered sinful, dubious, or defying social norms). "Dirty" stigma makes workers objects of dehumanization and discrimination, in particular, people distance themselves from dirty workers and are not ready to help and support them. In the experimental study (N = 340), we investigated how certain types of dirty workers are dehumanized compared to nondirty workers and the indirect effect of the type of dirty work on attitudes toward the social support of dirty workers via animalistic (attribution of uniquely human traits) and the mechanistic (attribution of human nature traits) dehumanization. The results show that individuals are willing to offer more social support to a low status but not dirty worker rather than to social or moral dirty workers. At the same time, less social support is provided to nondirty than to physical dirty worker. Animalistic and mechanistic dehumanization mediates the relationship between the types of dirty work and the attitudes toward social support. In particular, less dehumanization leads to more positive attitudes toward social support. The limitations and future directions of the obtained results are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundOrgan donation is a life-saving process for patients suffering from an advanced organ failure.A disparity between donated organs and required organs for transplantation is one of the major problems in Iran. Since personal attitudes about organ donation is a main factor influencing willingness to donate organ, the present study sought to provide a deeper understanding of the attitudes of university students in Iran regarding organ donation.MethodsThis qualitative study was conducted in 2016. Semi-structured interviews were held for collecting data from eighty five students from various universities in Hamadan city, Iran. Using a purposive sampling method, the students were selected based on the maximum variation. The content analysis method was used for data analysis by the research team and criteria for the study's rigor was considered.ResultsOverall, the students had positive attitudes toward organ donation by brain-dead patients. Nevertheless, not of them stated that they would become an organ donor. During the data analysis, 376 primary codes, 13 categories, and 6 themes were developed. Themes were cognitive readiness, mediators of decision making, beliefs and motivations, interactions with the health system, dependency, and integrity of the body. Also, thirteen sub-themes were developed.ConclusionMany factors influence the students' attitudes toward organ donation. Identification and explanation of these factors can help healthcare managers and policymakers for planning and improving the organ donation culture in the society.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study was to investigate the level of social media use among students, and the way in which it affects their performance and attitude when used in the classroom in Saudi Arabia. The study explores students' attitudes to using social media to perform activities in the classroom and in their future careers.
   Design/methodology/approach - A convergent mixed methods design was adopted, administering an online survey to a sample of 622 university students and conducting interviews with 20 students.
   Findings - The results revealed that the relationship between the level of a student's social media usage and GPA (Grade Point Average) was negatively correlated. Moreover, the students with a high level of social media usage generally reported a highly positive attitude towards using social media in classroom activities. Finally, the students' level of social media usage was found to predict their attitude towards performing classroom activities using social media.
   Research limitations/implications - This study has implications for both theory and practice. For example, the findings confirm the ways in which social media are deployed, according to uses and gratification theory. In particular, social media are used by Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University students for escapism, social integration and interaction, establishing personal identity, and meeting affective and cognitive needs. Meanwhile, the theoretical implications of this study are that new dimensions and social media terms can be added to the assumptions of uses and gratification theory. For example, virtual tolerance corresponds to escapism, virtual communication corresponds to integration and social interaction, virtual problems can be matched with personal identity and affective needs, and virtual information corresponds to cognitive needs.
   Practical implications - On a practical level, the results could be useful for students, teachers, educational policymakers and society. The results would show students how high social media usage could have a negative impact on their performance. Therefore, they should control their usage by managing their time, for example, via time management apps, if necessary. In particular, students could use social media in their learning and to develop their skills. A positive attitude among students, with regard to using social media in classroom activities, should correspondingly increase teachers' use of social media in the teaching process. This implies the expected benefits for teachers of using social media to teach and communicate with students. In addition, policymakers need to use social media as a means of reaching those population segments who display high social media usage, and who are unlikely to use traditional media to connect with those who formulate policy.
   Social implications - It is important to consider that high levels of social media use have a tendency to affect users' health, causing neck and back pain and psychological issues, for example, stress and depression. This points to a pressing need for society's institutions to raise public awareness of the disadvantages of high social media usage.
   Originality/value - This study could serve as a useful source of information for faculty members seeking to integrate social media into their curricula. It could also encourage students to activate social media in their learning and communication with teachers and peers, while at the same time reducing their non-academic social media usage. This study provides a scale for measuring students' social media usage and attitudes to undertaking classroom activities via social media in the Saudi context. The scale is validated through adaptation of the scales developed by Sahin (2018) and Kitchakarn (2016).

AB  - How do people form their political beliefs? In an effort to address this question, we adopt a neuropsychological approach. In a natural experiment, we explored links between neuroanatomy and ideological preferences in two samples of brain lesion patients in New York City. Specifically, we compared the political orientations of patients with frontal lobe lesions, patients with amygdala lesions and healthy control subjects. Lesion type classification analyses revealed that people with frontal lesions held more conservative (or less liberal) beliefs than those with anterior temporal lobe lesions or no lesions. Additional analyses predicting ideology by extent of damage provided convergent evidence that greater damage in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex-but not the amygdala-was associated with greater conservatism. These findings were robust to model specifications that adjusted for demographic, mood, and affect-related variables. Although measures of executive function failed to mediate the relationship between frontal lesions and ideology, our findings suggest that the prefrontal cortex may play a role in promoting the development of liberal ideology. Our approach suggests useful directions for future work to address the issue of whether biological developments precede political attitudes or vice versa-or both. This article is part of the theme issue 'The political brain: neurocognitive and computational mechanisms'.

AB  - Background: Negative attitudes toward breastfeeding in public have consistently been identified as a key barrier to breastfeeding continuation. In order to design effective social marketing campaigns to improve public attitude toward breastfeeding in public, it is critical to identify segments of the population who are less likely to support this activity, their underlying reasons, and the medium through which they can be reached. Research aim: The aims were to (a) identify the underlying dimensions that drive acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public, (b) test whether specific population segments were more or less likely to support breastfeeding in public, and (c) identify suitable media outlets to reach them. Methods: A cross-sectional survey testing agreement with 60 statements was administered online between May 2016 and May 2017 and was completed by 7190 respondents. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify 12 dimensions driving acceptance or opposition to breastfeeding in public. The influence of demographics and media consumption on attitudes toward breastfeeding in public was tested using Welch's t tests and one-way analyses of variance (ANOVAs). Results: Acceptance of breastfeeding in public was found to differ with gender, age, religion, and parental and breastfeeding status, but not household income. Support for breastfeeding in public also varied with media consumption habits. Conclusions: This work lays the foundation to design effective social marketing campaigns aimed at increasing public support for breastfeeding in public.

AB  - Background People with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) from low income diverse communities are experiencing the health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic most acutely. Method To better understand the impacts of the pandemic on the wellbeing of adults with IDD from an urban US region and how they are managing the associated disruptions, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with 14 participants. A modified grounded theory approach was used to analyze data. Results Participants experienced stress in response to pandemic media reports and attempted to cope by sanitizing and wearing masks. These did little to reduce stress and may have added to frustration with non-compliers. Social distancing limited access to family, leading to isolation. Participants who engaged in spiritual practices, physical fitness and creative activities were more successful in coping. Conclusions People with IDD may benefit from mindfulness practices or developing creative hobbies to be better equipped to cope.

AB  - Uncertainty, fear, and distress have become prevalent in the lives of U.S. residents since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The unpredictable reality of social distancing, shutdowns, and isolation have affected daily routines and influenced well-being and health. Drawing on consumer culture theory, we conducted an exploratory study to examine the mediating role of consumer spirituality in the subjective well-being of religious Christians during COVID-19 and to discover links between well-being and health outcomes. Participants from the United States (n = 104) were recruited via a Qualtrics' online panel. Findings show that religiosity among Christians enhanced subjective well-being, demonstrating the positive effect of religious beliefs, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, spiritual consumption mediated this relationship, suggesting the importance of possessions to religious expression and subjective well-being. Implications for messaging about health and well-being are discussed.

AB  - BackgroundDigital health technologies are being increasingly developed with the aim of allowing older adults to maintain functional independence throughout the old age, a process known as healthy ageing. Such digital health technologies for healthy ageing are expected to mitigate the socio-economic effects of population ageing and improve the quality of life of older people. However, little is known regarding the views and needs of older people regarding these technologies.AimThe aim of this study was to explore the views, needs and perceptions of community-dwelling older adults regarding the use of digital health technologies for healthy ageing.MethodFace-to-face, in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with community-dwelling older adults (median age 79.6 years). The interview process involved both abstract reflections and practical demonstrations. The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed according to inductive content analysis.ResultsThree main themes and twelve sub-themes addressing our study aim resulted from the data obtained. The main themes revolved around favorable views and perceptions on technology-assisted living, usability evaluations and ethical considerations.ConclusionsOur study reveals a generally positive attitude towards digital health technologies as participants believed digital tools could positively contribute to improving their overall wellbeing, especially if designed in a patient-centered manner. Safety concerns and ethical issues related to privacy, empowerment and lack of human contact were also addressed by participants as key considerations.

AB  - Biodiversity is in worldwide decline and it is becoming increasingly important to expand biodiversity awareness and achieve broad-based support for conservation. We introduce the concept of species literacy, as knowledge about species can be a good starting point for engaging people in biodiversity. However, concern has been raised about a general lack of knowledge about native species. We explored species literacy via a species identification test in the Netherlands, and we investigated potential drivers of it. The dataset included 3210 general public participants, 602 primary school children aged 9/10, and 938 biodiversity professionals.
   A considerable gap in species literacy was found between professionals and laypeople. Knowledge about common, native animals was particularly low in children, who on average identified only 35% of the species correctly. Mammals received relatively high identification scores as compared to birds. Laypeople's species literacy increased with age and educational level, and was associated with positive attitudes towards nature and animals, media exposure and having a garden.
   The results indicate that a considerable part of the Dutch lay public is disconnected from native biodiversity. This points to a separation between people and nature that could hinder future efforts to preserve biodiversity. Our assessment can help bridge the gap between laypeople and professionals, as it can help set up communication and education strategies about native biodiversity that fit prior knowledge.

AB  - Background: Despite the United States having one of the leading health care systems in the world, underserved minority communities face significant access challenges. These communities can benefit from telehealth innovations that promise to improve health care access and, consequently, health outcomes. However, little is known about the attitudes toward telehealth in these communities, an essential first step toward effective adoption and use.
   Objective: The purpose of this study is to assess the factors that shape behavioral intention to use telehealth services in underserved Hispanic communities along the Texas-Mexico border and examine the role of electronic health (eHealth) literacy in telehealth use intention.
   Methods: We used cross-sectional design to collect data at a community health event along the Texas-Mexico border. The area is characterized by high poverty rates, low educational attainment, and health care access challenges. Trained bilingual students conducted 322 in-person interviews over a 1-week period. The survey instrument assessed sociodemographic information and telehealth-related variables. Attitudes toward telehealth were measured by asking participants to indicate their level of agreement with 9 statements reflecting different aspects of telehealth use. For eHealth literacy, we used the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS), an 8-item scale designed to measure consumer confidence in finding, evaluating, and acting upon eHealth information. To assess the intention to use telehealth, we asked participants about the likelihood that they would use telehealth services if offered by a health care provider. We analyzed data using univariate, multivariate, and mediation statistical models.
   Results: Participants were primarily Hispanic (310/319, 97.2%) and female (261/322, 81.1%), with an average age of 43 years. Almost three-quarters (219/298) reported annual household incomes below $20,000. Health-wise, 42.2% (136/322) self-rated their health as fair or poor, and 79.7% (255/320) were uninsured. The overwhelming majority (289/319, 90.6%) had never heard of telehealth. Once we defined the term, participants exhibited positive attitudes toward telehealth, and 78.9% (254/322) reported being somewhat likely or very likely to use telehealth services if offered by a health care provider. Based on multivariate proportional odds regression analysis, a 1-point increase in telehealth attitudes reduced the odds of lower versus higher response in the intention to use telehealth services by 23% (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.73-0.81). Mediation analysis revealed that telehealth attitudes fully mediated the association between eHealth literacy and intention to use telehealth services. For a 1-point increase in eHEALS, the odds of lower telehealth use decreased by a factor of 0.95 (5%; OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93-0.98; P<.001) via the increase in the score of telehealth attitudes.
   Conclusions: Telehealth promises to address many of the access challenges facing ethnic and racial minorities, rural communities, and low-income populations. Findings underscore the importance of raising awareness of telehealth and promoting eHealth literacy as a key step in fostering positive attitudes toward telehealth and furthering interest in its use.

AB  - Background Vaccine hesitancy presents an obstacle to the campaign to control COVID-19. It has previously been found to be associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, low medical trust, minority ethnic group membership, low perceived risk from COVID-19, use of certain social media platforms and conspiracy beliefs. However, it is unclear which of these predictors might explain variance associated with others. Methods An online survey was conducted with a representative sample of 4343 UK residents, aged 18-75, between 21 November and 21 December 2020. Predictors of vaccine hesitancy were assessed using linear rank-order models. Results Coronavirus vaccine hesitancy is associated with youth, female gender, low income, low education, high informational reliance on social media, low informational reliance on print and broadcast media, membership of other than white ethnic groups, low perceived risk from COVID-19 and low trust in scientists and medics, as well as (to a much lesser extent) low trust in government. Coronavirus conspiracy suspicions and general vaccine attitudes appear uniquely predictive, jointly explaining 35% of variance. Following controls for these variables, effects associated with trust, ethnicity and social media reliance largely or completely disappear, whereas the effect associated with education is reversed. Conclusions Strengthening positive attitudes to vaccination and reducing conspiracy suspicions with regards to the coronavirus may have a positive effect on vaccine uptake, especially among ethnic groups with heightened vaccine hesitancy. However, vaccine hesitancy associated with age and gender does not appear to be explained by other predictor variables tested here.

AB  - Objective: Cervical cancer is known to impair women's sexual function. This study aimed at investigating the attitudes and behavior of radiation oncologists regarding sexual functioning of female cervical cancer patients who receive radiation therapy.
   Methods: A total of 186 radiation oncologists were included. A self-reported questionnaire was used to investigate the attitudes and behavior of radiation oncologists. The oncologists were queried on their history of consultation on sexual issues, attitudes, and behavior toward sexual issues and considerations of sexual life for cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy.
   Results: Among 120 radiation oncologists who completed the questionnaires, 101 (84.2%) had been consulted on sexual issues, of whom only 29 (24.2%) were consulted by more than 10% of cervical cancer patients who received radiation therapy or their families. Compared with those without a history of consultation, radiation oncologists with a history of consultation were more likely to agree that "radiation oncologists should deal with a patient's sexual issues" (88.1% vs 68.4%) and disagree that "sex is private and should not be interfered with" (66.2% vs 44.5%). Five radiation oncologists (4.2%) had received special training to deal with the sexual issues of cervical cancer patients who receive radiotherapy, and 112 oncologists (93.3%) did not have any information on sexual functioning to give the their patients.
   Conclusions: History of consultation on sexual issues affects radiation oncologists' attitudes and behavior toward sexual issues of cervical cancer patients. Radiation oncologists should have a more positive attitude toward sexual issues and should receive more specific relevant training.

AB  - Encounters between animals and humans in zoos and aquariums are being increasingly enhanced, mediated and extended using digital technologies. This article presents the results of research into the design, use and experience of stereoscopic (3D) 180 degrees film viewed via a Virtual Reality (VR) headset at the zoo. This technology has recently emerged as an affordable consumer device with increasing uptake in education and museums. Drawing on research methodologies from the field of human-computer interaction, this project followed a 'research-through-design' approach, which sought to discover more about the potential of VR technologies in the zoo generally, through the process of designing a particular installation. This paper reports on the results of a qualitative interview-based study into zoo visitor experiences of using a specific VR installation, a 5-min video encounter that combined footage shot inside the little penguin Eudyptula minor enclosure during feeding, and behind-the-scenes preparation of food, with narration by the zookeeper in each scene. It was found that visitors had positive attitudes towards the use of VR video in the zoo as an addition to the experience of seeing live animals. The paper further discusses the specific opportunities for VR video via the key themes that emerged in the qualitative evaluation: cognitive immersion, emotional immersion, physical presence and social presence. This paper therefore supports further investigation of VR video as a form of visitor experience to be deployed alongside keeper talks, animal presentations and behind-the-scenes experiences, with clear opportunities for positive visitor experience, conservation caring, and ensuring the welfare of animals in captivity in zoos.

AB  - The Anatomy Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ) was designed by Smith and Mathias to explore students' perceptions and experiences of learning anatomy. In this study, the psychometric properties of a slightly altered 34-item ALEQ (ALEQ-34) were evaluated, and correlations with learning outcomes investigated, by surveying first- and second-year undergraduate medical students; 181 usable responses were obtained (75% response rate). Psychometric analysis demonstrated overall good reliability (Cronbach's alpha of 0.85). Exploratory factor analysis yielded a 27-item, three-factor solution (ALEQ-27, Cronbach's alpha of 0.86), described as: (Factor 1) (Reversed) challenges in learning anatomy, (Factor 2) Applications and importance of anatomy, and (Factor 3) Learning in the dissection laboratory. Second-year students had somewhat greater challenges and less positive attitudes in learning anatomy than first-year students. Females reported slightly greater challenges and less confidence in learning anatomy than males. Total scores on summative gross anatomy examination questions correlated with ALEQ-27, Pearson's r=0.222 and 0.271, in years 1 and 2, respectively, and with Factor 1, r=0.479 and 0.317 (all statistically significant). Factor 1 also had similar correlations across different question types (multiple choice; short answer or essay; cadaveric; and anatomical models, bones, or radiological images). In a retrospective analysis, Factor 1 predicted poor end-of-semester anatomy examination results in year 1 with a sensitivity of 88% and positive predictive value of 33%. Further development of ALEQ-27 may enable deeper understanding of students' learning of anatomy, and its ten-item Factor 1 may be a useful screening tool to identify at-risk students.

AB  - This study uses a hierarchical statistical model to explore what drives African attitudes toward foreign countries, an understudied and underappreciated topic in the fields of African studies, political psychology and international relations. Enabled by increasing access to information, technology and resources, African peoples across the continent are directing their national stages like never before. Yet when it comes to international engagements on the continent, there is little scholarly focus on African sentiment toward foreign countries. The present study finds that the drivers of attitudes toward foreign countries vary, depending on which foreign country is under consideration by the respondent. For China, positive sentiment is associated with individuals who report having assets, belong to the president's party, view domestic governance positively, are more politically interested, are more trusting, are educated and are more frequent news consumers. While political interest, trust, education, news consumption and positive evaluation of domestic governance also correspond to positive attitudes toward the USA, so does being employed and perceiving the domestic government as corrupt. When it comes to attitudes toward former colonies, trust, education, news consumption, positive evaluations of domestic governance, perceiving the domestic government as corrupt, employment, identification with the president's party and support for democracy are associated with positive sentiment. For China, the USA and former colonies, negative sentiment is associated with individuals who identify as Muslim.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this paper is to identify, empirically analyze and validate the relationship between various social media marketing activities influencing the attitude of Indian consumers toward green products and their willingness to pay (WTP) a premium price for them.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Data was collected from 536 respondents who not only use various social media channels for purchases and gaining information but also prefer and buy green products across India. Exploratory factor analysis was done for the refinement and validation of the questionnaire items, and structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationship among various variables.
   Findings
   The findings of the empirical study confer consumer's attitude toward green products being shaped by four main social media marketing activities, namely, word of mouth, interaction, entertainment and customization, whereas trendiness was found to be insignificant toward predicting consumer's attitude. The positive attitude so formed has a significant and positive impact on the willingness of consumers to pay a premium price for green products.
   Originality/value
   This research takes a lead in analyzing the construct WTP a premium for green products because this has been comparably less explored in Indian context. As spending a little extra by Indian consumers is a super sensitive issue, studying their willingness is therefore an important construct to be taken into account.

AB  - Introduction: Considering health professionals among high-risk individuals, we aimed to evaluate their knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) regarding COVID-19.
   Methodology: This cross-sectional study was conducted among the health professionals (medical doctors, nurses, pharmacists, physiotherapists, hospital technicians and technologists) providing services at seven hospitals of Punjab province of Pakistan. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge, attitude and practices regarding COVID-19.
   Results: All of the participants (N = 429) reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source (65%) of this information. Mean knowledge score was 12 +/- 2.1, with 75.5% of participants having satisfactory knowledge. Doctors were found to have significantly better knowledge scores than the other health professionals (p = 0.001). Mean attitude score was 8.0 +/- 1.2, with a wide majority of health professionals (86.5%) having positive attitudes. Regarding preventive practices, around 64% reported of always covering nose and mouth with a tissue paper during sneezing or coughing and nearly 65% disposed of the dirty tissue paper in trash bin. Only 40% of the participants reported that 'if they do not have tissue, they cough or sneeze into upper sleeves'. Around 45% reported that they used face mask during their working hours in hospitals nowadays. Mean practice score was 23.3 +/- 3.6, with 73.4% of health professionals having satisfactory practices.
   Conclusions: The overall COVID-19 related KAP of Pakistani health professionals are satisfactory, however some misperceptions and malpractices uncovered in the present study must be addressed to effectively combat COVID-19.

AB  - Pharmacists play a vital role in providing counseling to the hypertensive patients to understand disease, risk factors, medications, and non-pharmacological measures required in controlling Blood Pressure (BP). This study aims to evaluate the impact of pharmacist delivered counseling services on KAP levels and control of BP in hypertensive patients. A prospective, open-labeled, randomized control trial was conducted among hypertensive patients attending medical outpatient department of Non-governmental Organization (NGO) Hospital located in rural settings in Anantapur district, Andhra Pradesh, India. The study was performed after getting ethical clearance from the Institutional Review Board with a registration number of RIPER/IRB/2018/038 and in accordance with ICH-GCP and CONSORT guidelines. The study was carried out for a period of one year from February 2018 to January 2019. The findings of the study reveal that there was a significant difference in the mean systolic and diastolic BP levels in intervention (138 +/- 10.5, 82.3 +/- 7.2) and control group (146.0 +/- 8.2, 87.2 +/- 5.4) at final follow-up visits. The mean percentage of knowledge, attitude, and practice towards hypertension management were significantly improved in the intervention group compared to control group. The study concludes that pharmacist is an integral part of the health care team to improve the health outcomes in hypertension. The study shows that patients had positive attitude levels regarding the management of hypertension. Due to lack of knowledge and awareness, the patients were under irrational practices. Finally, the pharmacist mediated counseling had significantly improved the KAP levels and BP control.

AB  - Background An ED visit provides a unique opportunity to identify elder abuse, which is common and has serious medical consequences. Despite this, emergency providers rarely recognise or report it. We have begun the design of an ED-based multidisciplinary consultation service to improve identification and provide comprehensive medical and forensic assessment and treatment for potential victims.
   Methods We qualitatively explored provider perspectives to inform intervention development. We conducted 15 semistructured focus groups with 101 providers, including emergency physicians, social workers, nurses, technologists, security, radiologists and psychiatrists at a large, urban academic medical centre. Focus groups were transcribed, and data were analysed to identify themes.
   Results Providers reported not routinely assessing for elder mistreatment and believed that they commonly missed it. They reported 10 reasons for this, including lack of knowledge or training, no time to conduct an evaluation, concern that identifying elder abuse would lead to additional work, and absence of a standardised response. Providers believed an ED-based consultation service would be frequently used and would increase identification, improve care and help ensure safety. They made 21 recommendations for a multidisciplinary team, including the importance of 24/7 availability, the value of a positive attitude in a consulting service and the importance of feedback to referring ED providers. Participants also highlighted that geriatric nurse practitioners may have ideal clinical and personal care training to contribute to the team.
   Conclusions An ED-based multidisciplinary consultation service has potential to impact care for elder abuse victims. Insights from providers will inform intervention development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a pilot interdisciplinary inhouse training in palliative care (PC) for gynecological oncologists.
   Competencies of participants from a gynecological university department were evaluated taking part in an interdisciplinary PC course in a pre and post design. The multiprofessional course covered basic principles of PC, symptom management and communication taught by PC specialists. Competencies were evaluated using self-designed questionnaires before (ISPG-1), right after (ISPG-2), and 6 months after the training (ISPG-3) (inhouse seminar palliative care in gynecology: ISPG).
   31 persons from the department of gynecology took part in the course, of which 27 answered the first questionnaire (seven nurses (26%), 19 doctors (71%), one profession not indicated (3%), median working experience in gynecological oncology: 5 years). Return rates were: ISPG-1 27/31 (87.1%), ISPG-2 20/31 (64.5%) and IPSG-3 14/31 (45.2%). A more positive attitude towards PC could be observed in the majority of participants after the course (ISPG-2 62%, ISPG-3 71%). They felt more competent in the care of palliative patients (46%). PC would be initiated earlier and the interaction with other disciplines was improved (ISPG-2 85%, ISPG-3 100%). The participants assessed a significant improvement of their skills in all palliative fields which were analyzed.
   PC inhouse training improves the understanding of PC and the interdisciplinary approach in the management of patients with advanced disease. It is a feasible and useful instrument to improve the competencies in generalist PC of specialists in gynecological oncology.

AB  - Background: Among the various types of stem cells which have been suggested for therapeutic purposes, human amnion epithelial cells (hAEC) are highly promising. Purpose: This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the Taif University population toward the therapeutic potential of hAEC. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study carried out among the students of Taif University. A self-administrated questionnaire was used in this descriptive study. The questionnaire consisted of demographic information, knowledge, and attitudes regarding stem cells and hAEC. The data was analyzed using descriptive statistics in SPSS-IBM 25. Results: Out of 1026 subjects, 908 (88.6%) were female, 686 (66.9%) from the age group of less than 25 years, 984 (96%) Saudi nationals, and 834 (81.45%) were undergraduate students. Unfortunately, 35% of the subjects in this study have no idea about stem cells and 55% have never heard about hAEC. Only a moderate level of knowledge score was noticed among the participants about stem cells. Significantly (P= 0.001) high percentage of females would like to conserve their human amniotic epithelial cells for family or for research purposes. More than 88% of the subjects would like to have awareness programs in the community about human amniotic epithelial cells. The knowledge and attitude scores were shown to have a substantial positive association. Conclusion: As a result of this research, it is suggested that various stem cell educational programs and awareness campaigns need to be implemented in universities in order to improve stem cell knowledge and encourage a more positive attitude toward the use of stem cells for therapeutic purposes.

AB  - Background: Increasing substance use among adolescents has prompted investigation in the emergence and evolution of substance use behaviors. Two basic elements which are influenced in person's behavior are self-efficacy and outcome expectancies. While the importance of these construct is high, their origin is less clear. In the present study we sought to elucidate influences of social influence on the development of cognition factors as predictors of substance use behavior.Methods: Structural equation modeling was used to assess the fit of a model that proposes that self-efficacy and outcome expectancies are mediators of the association between social influences and substance use behavior in 720 adolescents, aged between 14 and 18, in the cross-sectional survey in Isfahan, Iran.Results: Positive expectancies, in contrast to negative ones, form positive attitudes regarding drug use. The phenomenon combined with a sense of low resistance self-efficacy leaded to the substance use behavior. The model provided a good fit to the data and explained 53% of the variance in substance use behavior in adolescents.Conclusions: Results of the study shed light on the development of substance use-related cognitions and contribute to our understanding of the structural relationship between social influence, expectancies, and self-efficacy in substance use behavior in adolescents.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to examine the effects of mediated contact between ethnic Koreans and migrant workers in South Korea. Positive contact generated more positive perception of and affect toward the migrant workers but did not change South Koreans' social distance from migrant workers. The effects of negative contact, on the other hand, were consistently significant across all three attitude measures. When the effect sizes of positive and negative mediated contact were compared, positive contact generated a stronger effect, albeit only marginally significant, than negative contact on the perception of migrant workers. In the affect and social distance measures, no significant difference was found. Furthermore, negative mediated contact increased power values through its influence on the attitudes toward migrant workers; parallel indirect effects of positive contact on universalism values were not found. Theoretical and practical implications of these findings are discussed, followed by suggestions for future studies.

AB  - Entertainment persuasion theory was applied to investigate how an epilogue to a dramatic episode with an educational subtext about bipolar disorder affected viewer processing and response. In an experiment, viewers (N=89) were randomly assigned to watch the episode either with or without an epilogue. Exposure to the epilogue increased recognition of the subtext. It also increased counterarguing against the subtext, but only among viewers less involved with the episode's story. The epilogue decreased social distance for people with bipolar disorder and decreased their belief that bipolar disorder is not treatable. These findings speak to the utility of epilogues as a tool to both reinforce intended entertainment-education messages and to combat misinformation. This function is particularly useful for entertainment portrayals of stigmatized conditions, which are at greater risk of being misunderstood. To avoid viewer reactance, epilogues should be paired with highly involving narratives.

AB  - Waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS or hookah) is common among adolescents and college students in the USA. However, there has not yet been a large-scale, nationally representative study independently examining WTS among young adults who are not in college.
   This study sought to examine associations between attitudes, normative beliefs, certain socio-demographic factors and current WTS among young adults not in college and compare them to young adults in college.
   A total of 3131 US adults ages 1830 completed an online survey about WTS behaviour, attitudes, normative beliefs and relevant socio-demographic factors. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine independent associations between these variables and current WTS stratified by student status.
   Ever WTS was reported by 29% of young adults not in college and by 35% of those in college, and current use rates were 3 and 7%, respectively. Multivariable models demonstrated that positive attitudes and perceived peer acceptability of WTS were significantly associated with increased current WTS for both young adults not in college [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.72; 95% CI: 2.003.71 and AOR = 2.02; 95% CI: 1.502.71, respectively] and young adults in college (AOR = 3.37; 95% CI: 2.484.58 and AOR = 2.05; 95% CI: 1.492.83, respectively). The magnitude of these associations was not significantly different when comparing individuals in college and not in college.
   Among young adults, WTS is common in non-college-based populations as well as in college-based populations. Therefore, prevention programming should extend to all young adults, not only to those in college.

AB  - Using online comments posted on news stories as the context, this study aimed to examine the interplay between the third-person perception (TPP) - that people believe media message have a greater effect on changing the attitudes of others compared with themselves - and online incivility. It also examined whether people's agreement with the content of the comments would influence the TPP. Results of an experiment (N = 301) showed incivility muted the persuasive effect of online comments, so only civil comments produced a TPP, whereby people felt comments had greater persuasive power over others compared with themselves. However, counter to predictions, whether people agreed with the comments did not influence the TPP. Findings also supported the TPP social distance corollary such that subjects perceived comments as having the largest third-person perceptual gap between the self and those who disagreed with them. Results are discussed in relation to TPP and face and politeness theories. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the increase in numbers of multimedia technologies around us, movies and videos on social media and OTT platforms are growing, making it confusing for users to decide which one to watch for. For this, movie recommendation systems are widely used. It has been observed that two-thirds of the films watched on Netflix are the recommended ones to its users. The target of this work is to use implicit feedback given by other users to recommend movies, i.e., ratings given by them. Implicit feedback will help to enhance Data Sparsity as for a replacement logged-in user, the system won't have details of their past liked movies. So, matching the similarity with other users is often a plus point to recommend movies that they would like. The anticipated result will depend upon the positive attitude; i.e., if the predicted rating is high, then it'll be recommended; otherwise it'll not be recommended. The performance of the methodology is measured with accuracy and precision values for different strategies. It gives the best accuracy and highest precision values using Logistic Regression (LR) and lowest recall value as compared to other algorithms. This technique gives an accuracy, precision, and recall value of 81.9%, 69.82%, and 32.5%, respectively, using LR.

AB  - Social participation is a crucial condition for successful learning in inclusive primary schools. Unfortunately, students with non-compliant classroom behaviour are at risk of being socially excluded from their class. Recently, students' attitudes have been identified as the central indicator of the social participation of students with non-compliant behaviour in the classroom. However, the determinants of students' attitudes are unclear. In accordance with the 'contact theory' and the principle of 'homophily', we investigated the relationship between students' attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour, their contact experiences with peers with non-compliant behaviour, and their experiences of having behavioural difficulties or formally assessed special educational needs (SEN) themselves. 589 fourth grade primary school students completed a questionnaire on their contact experiences and attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour. Additionally, teachers provided information on students' behavioural difficulties and formal SEN. Results from a multilevel regression analysis revealed that students' attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour could be explained by their contact experiences. Overall, our findings emphasise the importance of students' contact experiences in relation to their attitudes towards peers with non-compliant behaviour and mark an important initial point for the implementation of future interventions (e.g. peer-mediated learning) that foster valuable contacts and positive attitudes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this research is to examine the impact of high-involvement work systems (HIWS) on absorptive capacity. In addition, the mediating effect of happiness at work in the relationship between high-involvement work practices and absorptive capacity is analyzed. Design/methodology/approach A 2-1-2 bathtub multilevel mediation model was used to analyze a sample of 783 employees from 111 bank branches, gathering data at three different times. Findings The results reveal that HIWS positively affect absorptive capacity. In addition, they show that happiness at work partially mediates the relationship between HIWS and absorptive capacity. Originality/value Happiness at work is a fundamental element for knowledge absorption. The findings support the basic assumptions of the job demands-resources model, and demonstrate how HIWS, acting as a job resource, lead to positive attitudes (happiness at work) and, in turn, to positive outcomes (absorptive capacity). The proposed HIWS, based on the assumptions of the mutual gains model, reveal a positive employment relationship with effects on both HAW and organizational outcomes. If organizations expose their employees to management practices that have specific benefits for their HAW, employees are more likely to perform their jobs in ways that will promote their absorptive capacity.

AB  - Objective: In recent years, Vietnam has been recorded as one of the most endemic areas of dengue fever (DF). Thus, controlling DF has become a matter of concern to healthcare professionals and the government. Nevertheless, there has been little research exploring inhabitants' awareness about DF in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The aims of the study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) regarding DF by the population in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.
   Methods: In July 2018, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 1,175 people in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, using an administered questionnaire.
   Results: Only 38% of participants had good knowledge, and 55% of the population reached the satisfactory practices score, while 74% showed positive attitudes relating to DF. Unlike many other studies, education level was not associated with KAP score. However, marital status and monthly income seemed to be related to participants' knowledge levels. In addition, the main sources of information in this research were television and the Internet.
   Conclusion: This study showed that participants lacked knowledge regarding DF and practices to prevent it. These results recommend improving the population's knowledge and practices through campaigns aimed at preventing breeding of mosquitoes.

AB  - As explicit administrative expectations to use meaningful inquiry-based instructional activities and formative assessment tasks might influence teachers' classroom practices, this study assessed science teachers' use of contemporary educational activities and assessment tasks above and beyond their conceptions of traditional teaching and learning and their attitudes toward using final tests. Data were gathered from 127 primary school science teachers from 60 Israeli public schools. The results showed that although used less frequently than final tests, formative assessment tasks were used to some extent by the participants during learning processes. Partial least squares structural equation modeling results pointed to the mediating role of teachers' positive attitudes toward tests in linking their conceptions of traditional teaching to increased use of summative assessment tasks (final tests). Moreover, teachers who reported using constructivist educational activities, more specifically collaborative practices, also reported using formative assessment tasks. Contrary to expectations, this study's model did not point to a significant negative connection between teachers' traditional conceptions of teaching and learning and their tendency to use constructivist activities in their classes. It is inferred that in practice teachers need to respond to explicit administrative expectations to use meaningful inquiry-based instructional activities and formative assessment and therefore might use those activities in spite of their traditional conceptions of teaching and learning.

This cross-sectional study was conducted in 7 faculties of Mersin University. The research data were collected using a questionnaire. The questionnaire included sociodemographic characteristics, the "Environmental Attitudes Scale," and the "Environmental Risk Perception Scale." 774 students who filled out questionnaires were evaluated. Results. The sample included 55.8% females. Environmental Attitudes Scale mean scores of students were identified as 81.1 +/- 11.3. The highest perceived risk was release of radioactive materials associated with nuclear power generation. The environmental attitudes and risk perception scores were higher in Health Sciences than in the other faculties. Females were more positive towards the environment and had higher risk perceptions than the men. There is a negative correlation between age and resource depletion risk and global environmental risk score. Conclusion. Students had a positive attitude to the environment and had moderate-level risk perception about the environment. Environmental awareness of students, especially those studying in the Social Sciences, should be increased. The environmental education curriculum should be revised throughout all the courses.

AB  - Owing to strict access control implemented on university campuses during COVID-19, college students experienced increased isolation, resulting in several physical and mental health issues. This study investigates the relationships among perceived built environment, walking attitudes, walking behavior, physical and mental state, and the impact of COVID-19. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among undergraduate students (N = 429) at Dalian University of Technology, China, on September 20 (Sunday) and 21 (Monday), 2020. The survey questionnaire included questions related to socio-demographic factors, perceived environment (accessibility, road condition and safety, and aesthetics), walking attitudes, walking behavior (number of walking trips), physical and mental state, and the impact of pandemic. Subsequently, two structural equation models (SEMs) were developed to analyze the proposed conceptual framework. The empirical results indicated that the SEMs fit the data well, thereby validating the conceptual framework. Perceived environment (especially accessibility), attitudes, and walking behavior significantly influenced physical and mental state. Perceived environment mediated the effects between attitudes and walking behavior and physical and mental state. The pandemic negatively impacted attitudes and physical and mental state. The effect of perceived accessibility on walking behavior and that of walking behavior on physical and mental state were stronger on weekends, whereas the effects of attitudes and the pandemic on physical and mental state were stronger on weekdays. The findings indicate that universities should implement appropriate strategies to improve the objective and subjective built environment, especially accessibility, and cultivate positive attitudes among students to promote walking and improve physical and mental health during COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Febrile seizure is one of the most common kind of seizure in the children. Majority of mothers had adequate information about febrile seizures, but there were still mothers' negative beliefs about febrile seizures and these misconceptions can lead to inappropriate or even harmful actions to control seizure in the child.
   Aim: To explore k knowledge, beliefs and practices related to immediate home management among mothers of children with febrile seizures.
   Methods: The present study is a descriptive- analytical comparative study which includes 156 mothers who referred to "17- Shahrivar" health care center and neurology clinic in Rasht city and attended in the study. 78 patients were in the recurrence group and 78 patients were in the non-recurrence group. Data were collected through a questionnaire consisting of knowledge, attitude and home management questions, and finally, the data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and analytical statistics (independent t-test, Spearman and Pearson correlation coefficient).
   Results: The findings showed that the majority of the units in the group with and without recurrence were male. The mean score of knowledge in children' mothers without recurrence was higher than children' mothers with recurrence (p <0.023). The majority of mothers in both groups had a positive attitude.None of the mothers in both groups performed well.
   Conclusion: In this study, mothers' knowledge level is low which, in its turn, is effective in the treatment and recurrence trend of seizure. This issue highlights the necessity of educating mothers through medical centers and mass media.

AB  - We analyze a novel agent-based model of a social network in which agents make contributions to others conditional upon the social distance, which we measure in terms of the "degrees of separation" between the two players. On the basis of a simple imitation model, the emerging strategy profile is characterized by high levels of cooperation with those who are directly connected to the agent and lower but positive levels of cooperation with those who are indirectly connected to the agent. Increasing maximum interaction distance decreases cooperation with close neighbors but increases cooperation with distant neighbors for a net negative effect. On the other hand, allowing agents to learn and imitate socially distant neighbors increases cooperation for all types of interaction. Combining greater interaction distance with greater learning distance leads to a positive change in the total social welfare produced by the agents' contributions.

AB  - Background: Satisfaction with life is recognized to be a factor in alleviating burden in stressful caregiving duties. However, the mechanism underlying this relationship is indistinct. Positive aspects of caregiving (PAC) may help to regulate caregiving burden among caregivers of older adults. The study aims to examine whether positive caregiving characteristics mediate the effect between satisfaction with life and burden of care. Methods: Participants were 285 caregivers of older adults (aged 60 and above) in Singapore and were recruited in a cross-sectional, self-report study (mean [M] = 47.0 years; 64.6% females). Measures included in the study were the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), Positive Aspects of Caregiving (PAC), and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS). Mediation analyses were used to study the indirect effects of life satisfaction on caregiver burden through features of PAC. Results: Mean scores for the ZBI, PAC, and SWLS scales were M = 23.15 (standard deviation [SD] = 15.98), M = 34.55 (SD = 8.19), and M = 23.56 (SD = 6.62) respectively. Results from the mediation analysis revealed that the association between life satisfaction and caregiving burden was significantly mediated by the PAC (P < .001). Discussion: Positive aspects of caregiving may be a mechanism that links satisfaction with life and caregiver burden. Findings may represent attempts to manage caregiving duties as well as maintaining a positive attitude toward their responsibilities.

Design/methodology/approach The study sample consists of 205 business students from two B schools in India. Data was collected through the survey method, and the moderated-mediation model was statistically tested using SPSS Process Macro software. Findings The findings of the study suggest that the attitude towards social and environmental accountability (SEA) is positively associated with the intention to purchase environmentally sustainable products (IPESP). Moreover, this relationship is mediated and moderated by AEA and materialism, respectively. Practical implications The findings of the study reveal that a consumer with low materialism and a positive attitude for both environmental sustainability and environmental advertising has higher chances of purchasing environmentally sustainable products. Originality/value This study contributes to the existing literature on sustainability by providing a basis for understanding the moderated-mediation mechanism, which affects the relationship between SEA and IPESP; two key variables that have not been examined in combination.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed our way of living. To minimize life losses, multi-level strategies requiring collective efforts were adopted while waiting for the vaccines' rollout. The management of such complex processes has taken benefit from the rising framework of the Internet of Things (IoT), and particularly the Radiofrequency Identification (RFID) since it is probably the most suitable approach to both the micro (user) and the macro (processes) scale. Hence, a single infrastructure can support both the logistic and monitoring issues related to the war against a pandemic. Based on the COVID-19 experience, this paper is a survey on how state-of-the-art RFID systems can be employed in facing future pandemic outbreaks. The three pillars of the contrast of the pandemic are addressed: 1) use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), 2) access control and social distancing, and 3) early detection of symptoms. For each class, the envisaged RFID devices and procedures are discussed based on the available technology and the current worldwide research. This survey shows that RFID could generate an extraordinary amount of data so that complementary paradigms of Edge Computing and Artificial intelligence can be tightly integrated to extract profiles and identify anomalous events in compliance with privacy and security.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Countries worldwide have adopted unprecedented infection control and prevention measures to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 virus. The success of these measures depends on the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of the general population toward COVID-19.The objective of this study was to measure the KAP of adult Greek residents toward COVID-19. METHODS: A cross-sectional nationwide survey (n=1,004) was conducted during between April 28,2020 to May 03,2020 using a mixed methodology for data collection: Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI) and Computer Assisted web Interviewing (CAWI).A proportionate stratified by region systematic sampling procedure was used to ensure a nationally representative sample of the urban/rural population. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire. RESULTS: 35% of respondents reported correctly the five most commonly related to COVID-19 symptoms (i.e. cough, fever, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms and myalgia). Most respondents (>90%) knew that coronavirus can be transmitted by droplets from human-to-human and contaminated surfaces. Avoiding touching the face with one's hands and social distancing were identified as the most appropriate prevention and control measures against COVID-19 by over 95% of respondents. The median (IQR) of the total knowledge score was 17 (16-19).45.6% of respondents believed that the novel coronavirus was developed by humans in laboratories, and 79.4% and 69.0% believed that novel coronavirus is more contagious and more lethal than flu virus H1N1, respectively.41.1% of respondents stated that they had proceeded to social distancing before government measures were taken. CONCLUSION: Overall, the Greek general population had adequate knowledge of the symptoms, transmission routes and prevention measures of the COVID-19,although there is undoubtedly still room for improvement.

AB  - Purpose Drawing from conservation of resources (COR) theory, this study empirically tests the impact of transformational leadership on commitment to and intention to support organizational change, proposing self-efficacy as a mediating mechanism. This study also aims to study whether the extent of change in the organization moderates the proposed relationship between transformational leadership, self-efficacy and change reactions. Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted with a sample of 298 employees going through a major organizational change. The proposed moderated mediation relationship was tested by using PROCESS macro. Findings The findings showed that self-efficacy mediated the relationship between transformational leadership and reactions to change. Moreover, the extent of changes experienced by the employees moderated the relationship between self-efficacy and outcome variables. In other words, in high change contexts, self-efficacy appeared as a more salient and instrumental resource leading to positive reactions.
   Practical implications - The results guide change managers to display a transformational leadership style to enhance self-efficacy of change recipients to generate positive attitudes and behaviors during change. Also, this study shows that self-efficacy particularly gains importance when the extent of change is high.
   Originality/value - This study makes several important contributions to the organizational change literature. First, it shows that leaders play a crucial role in generating resources that enhance employees' positive reactions to change. Second, the conditional factor of the extent of change has not received much attention in the literature. This study raises attention to the fact that the importance of such resources may differ across low versus high extent of change contexts.

AB  - In Mexico, many seniors are alone for most of the day or live in public nursing homes. Simple interaction with computer systems is required for older people. This is why we propose the exploration of a medium well known by seniors, such as the television (TV). The primary objective of this study is to improve the quality of life of seniors through an easier reminder system, using the television set. A technological platform was designed based on interactive television, through which seniors and their caregivers can have a better way to track their daily activities. Finally, an evaluation of the technology adoption was performed with 50 seniors living in two public nursing homes. The evaluation found that the elderly perceived the system as useful, easy to use, and they had a positive attitude and good intention to use it. This helped to generate initial evidence that the system supported them in achieving a better quality of life, by reminding them to take their medications and increasing their rate of attendance to their medical appointments.

AB  - Purpose - The primary purposes of this paper are to understand perceptions regarding ICT use to support knowledge management (KM) and to identify suitable ICTs to support such initiatives. The aim is to study these objectives from the theoretical perspectives of the SECT model (i.e. socialization, externalization, combination and internalization).
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 100 working professionals who had prior KM implementation experiences participated in an online survey.
   Findings - The authors found that survey respondents held positive attitudes towards the use of ICT to support different phases of the SECI model. It was also found that single ICT as well as varied combinations of ICTs were frequently used to facilitate the different phases of the SECT model.
   Research limitations/implications - The nature of this study may reduce the generalizability of its findings to other tasks or economic and cultural environments. Replication of this study in other contexts (e.g. other industries) would be extremely useful.
   Practical implications - Understanding individuals' perceptions of ICT use as well as use of ICTs to support KM practices is important as it may affect the outcome of KM initiatives. Further, since spending on KM software and services are predicted to increase in the coming years, this research is therefore very timely.
   Originality/value - This study systematically examines the use of single ICT as well as combinations of ICTs to facilitate different phases of the SECI model. This will contribute to an understanding of how ICT can be used to support KM initiatives in organizations.

AB  - How and why does protest shape participants' attitudes? We study this issue using panel data gathered both before and after Ukraine's Euromaidan protests. We argue that frames play a key role in this process. We find that protest participation increased alignment of protesters' policy preferences with the main protest frames by stabilizing existing attitudes that were in alignment and changing attitudes that conflicted with the dominant frame. Attitudes on core protest issues also became more coherent. We find no comparable effects for issues less central to the protests, and all effects vary as the framing and protest environment changed. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of attitude change, showing that while protesters also experience significant increases in efficacy, interest, and participation, these changes only partly explain attitudinal changes. These findings speak to both the short- and long-term mechanisms by which protest participation can shape public opinion.

AB  - Romantic jealousy, a complex response to a real or perceived threat to a romantic relationship, can have serious negative consequences for individuals, partners and perceived rivals. The likelihood of a jealous response is heightened among individuals who experience attachment anxiety, and online communication and social media provide unique fodder for romantic jealousy. The purpose of the current study is to test whether the association between attachment anxiety and online jealousy (jealous response to ambiguous hypothetical online scenarios) is moderated by negative attitudes about online communication. Individuals in dating relationships were asked about attachment anxiety and attitudes about online communication (i.e., apprehension and concern about misunderstandings) as well as emotional, cognitive, and behavioral online jealousy. Hierarchical linear regression revealed an attachment anxiety-attitude interaction, such that the link between attachment anxiety and jealousy was stronger for participants with relatively low levels of negative attitudes about online communication compared to participants with relatively high levels of negative attitudes. The current study expands knowledge about attachment anxiety and jealousy in the context of online communication and social media, and highlights the importance of considering attitudes about online communication when studying relationship processes in the digital arena.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to explore the communicative rituals of opening and closing manifested in e-mail-based Internet Public Library's (IPL's) online reference interaction.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 400 transcripts comprising user queries and responses by IPL librarians are examined. The opening and closing elements are identified to examine the way in which 1PL librarians and users construct social space; that is, communicate their interpersonal and affective stances during the course of seeking and offering information.
   Findings - The results of data analysis show regular patterns of verbal and structural politeness indicators of opening and closing e-mail discourse. Linguistic elements such as greetings and acknowledgement are included in all the sampled transcripts; i.e. a 100 percent occurrence. Closing rituals have a 95 percent occurrence of linguistic features such as acknowledgement and invitation for follow-up. In contrast, there is a low occurrence of personalized openings through greeting by user name (26 percent). This lack of personalization also occurs in closings: personalized farewell through use of librarian name appears in only 8 percent of closings.
   Research limitations/implications - The employment of the various politeness tactics in opening and closing reflects the librarian's attention and concern to user's information needs, interests and wants. Such communicative competence narrows social distance and brings forth close socio-interpersonal space for interaction; this may, in turn, improve the overall quality of reference service. Research findings also indicate that more use of personal names may decrease the social distance between the librarian and user, resulting in increased solidarity and proximity.
   Originality/value - The study provides new insights into linguistic politeness and the functions of address forms such as personal names with a view toward developing effective opening and closing rituals that contribute to the enhancement of virtual reference services.

KW  - LIMITS
AB  - It is well known that political elites can shape public attitudes toward policies and values. Less is known, however, about whether elites can also influence public perceptions of social groups they praise or denounce. I test this by analyzing the attitudinal effects of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign announcement speech, in which he referred to Mexican immigrants as "rapists" and "criminals." First, to provide causal estimates, I analyze survey data using a counterfactual approach. I find evidence that Trump's statements negatively affected public opinion toward immigrants particularly among groups with restrictionist tendencies. Second, using a panel survey experiment, I corroborate this causal relationship but find that these effects are short-lived. This explains why restrictionist politicians like Trump constantly prod natives to keep their messages' effects from dissipating. I also find that only negative messages are consequential and find no evidence that elite statements are more impactful than those from non-elites, suggesting that the power of elite rhetoric lies primarily in its capacity to reach the masses via the news media.

AB  - With the high frequency and intensity of worldwide disasters, cause-related marketing campaigns with sudden disasters are becoming increasingly popular. However, little is known about whether and how cause acuteness may influence consumer attitudes. This research aims to extend this research area through investigating the relationship between cause acuteness and consumer attitudes toward the product, as well as its underlying mechanism and boundary conditions. Based on a moral psychology perspective, we propose a theoretical model focusing on the mediating role of moral elevation in influencing consumer attitudes. This model also incorporates product-cause fit and information transparency as moderators underpinning necessary conditions that are likely to lead to positive consumer attitudes. Four empirical studies were conducted to test our model. Our research results reveal that consumers have more positive attitudes toward the product associated with a sudden disaster than with an ongoing tragedy. Furthermore, the positive effect of cause acuteness on consumer attitudes is mediated by enhanced moral elevation, which occurs under the conditions of high product-cause fit and high information transparency.

AB  - Previous neuroeconomic studies have observed that people display sympathetic neural responses toward others' misfortunes. We argue that the reverse emotions, such as gloating or schadenfreude, may also emerge in certain circumstances. To examine this theory, we recorded feedback-related negativity (FRN) toward others' large or small gains or losses in a stock market context. We adopted the framework of social distance, according to which we hypothesized that because others in the stock market are far away, unidentified, and indistinct, people would show less sympathy or even schadenfreude toward others' large losses. The results indicated that FRN at Fz was significantly less negative when observing larger decreases in others' stock, indicating that others' large losses are not unexpected negative events in the stock market and suggesting the existence of schadenfreude. Our research contributes to the understanding of social neurofinance by demonstrating the schadenfreude effect in relation to the stock market. This study also provides new information regarding the relationship between FRN and the social emotions that form the expectations of gain and loss.

AB  - This study aimed to explore factors perceived to affect the intention of premarital sexual behaviours among junior high school students in Muang District, Thailand. A stratified random sampling technique was employed to select three schools out of ten public junior high schools. A situation analysis was conducted following a focus group discussion and in-depth interview. The informants included six junior high school students, five parents, three teachers, two health professionals and two school administrators. A thematic analysis was employed for the data analysis. Results illustrated negative attitude, social media, the internet use, socio-environmental space, peer pressure, social belief, low self-efficacy, generation gap and sexual education were the factors perceived to affect the intention of sexual behaviours. An integrated implementation of a comprehensive sexual education was the way forward to increasing self-efficacy.

AB  - The current study aims to investigate students' attitudes towards the use of distance education during COVID-19 in Morocco. The first cases of COVID-19 starting from the first weeks of March 2020 has obliged educational authorities to suspend face-to-face education. Immediately, distance education was declared the alternative means to complete the academic year. Moroccan TV channels started broadcasting lessons for different levels at different times. Moreover, teachers and students started using social media and university platforms to share lessons. However, not all students agree with distance education in the adopted format. Accordingly, the current study investigates the attitudes of Moroccan English Department students at Moulay Ismail University. A mixed-method design was adopted by triangulating data from five-point Likert scale questionnaires and a focus group. The results showed that students generally prefer face-to-face education rather than distance education. However, part-time students reported positive attitudes towards distance education. It is recommended that both distance education and face-to-face education should be planned by teachers, coordinators, and administrators.

AB  - This article examines the combined influence of cognitions (i.e., impact beliefs) and affect (i.e., feelings) on normative beliefs (i.e., support for management options) about wolves and brown bears. Data were obtained from stratified random face-to-face interviews (n=1,611). The survey was conducted in the Abruzzo Lazio and Molise National Park (central Italy), where people have a long history of coexistence with large carnivores. Knowledge was hypothesized to moderate the relationships of beliefs and feelings on support for management actions. Path analyses supported the role of affect in mediating perceived impact beliefs and support for the protection of large carnivores. Knowledge moderated these relationships in the case of wolves but not brown bears. Residents of the national park had more knowledge about bears than wolves, which might partly explain both the stronger effect that knowledge had on the affective component and its lack of a moderating effect on the bear model. Overall, our findings show the positive attitude of residents toward large carnivores and support the idea of affect being more important than cognition in predicting normative beliefs.

AB  - Background The COVID-19 pandemic has had profound effects on the utilization of health care services, including Emergency Medical Services (EMS). Social distancing measures taken to prevent the spread of the disease have greatly affected the functioning of societies and reduced or halted many activities with a risk of injury. The aim of this study was to report the effects of lockdown measures on trauma-related EMS calls in the Finnish capital area. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all EMS calls in the Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) catchment area between 1 January and 31 July 2020. Calls were identified from the HUH EMS database. Calls were grouped into pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown periods according to the restrictions set by the Finnish government and compared to the mean number of calls for the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. Statistical comparisons were performed using Mann-Whitney U-test for weekly numbers and percentages. Results During the study period there was a total of 70,705 EMS calls, of which 14,998 (21.2%) were related to trauma; 67,973 patients (median age 61.6 years; IQR 35.3-78.6) were met by EMS. There was no significant change in the weekly number of total or trauma-related EMS calls during the pre-lockdown period. During the lockdown period, the number of weekly total EMS calls was reduced by 12.2% (p = 0.001) and the number of trauma-related calls was reduced by 23.3% (p = 0.004). The weekly number of injured patients met by EMS while intoxicated with alcohol was reduced by 41.8% (p = 0.002). During the post-lockdown period, the number of total and trauma-related calls and the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol returned to previous years' levels. Conclusions The COVID-19 pandemic and social distancing measures reduced the number of trauma-related EMS calls. Lockdown measures had an especially significant effect on the number of injured patients intoxicated by alcohol met by the EMS.

AB  - Objectives Mental health problems are prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic, but their effect on adherence to precautionary measures is not well understood. Given that psychological morbidities are associated with lower treatment adherence, and that precautionary measures are important in containing the spread of COVID-19, this study aims to determine if people with mental health problems have lower adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19. Design We conducted a cross-sectional territory-wide online survey between 17 June and 31 July 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinically significant mental health problems, adherence to precautionary behaviours, and confounding factors such as sociodemographic factors and self-reported physical health were assessed. Setting The link to the questionnaire was disseminated to the general population in all 18 districts of Hong Kong using various social media platforms. Participants 1036 individuals completed the survey. Of them, 1030 met the inclusion criteria of being adult Hong Kong residents. Primary outcome Adherence to precautionary measures against COVID-19, including wearing face mask, frequent handwashing, household disinfection, social distancing, minimising unnecessary travel, and stocking up on food and daily essentials. Results Of the 1030 participants, 166 (16.1%) had clinically significant mental health problems. Interestingly, they were more likely to stock up on food and daily essentials during the pandemic (7 (4.2%) vs 15 (1.7%), p=0.04; unadjusted OR=2.49, 95% CI=1.00 to 6.21, p<0.05) and had a lesser tendency to stop social distancing even if the pandemic subsides (86 (51.8%) vs 513 (59.4%), p=0.07; unadjusted OR=0.74, 95% CI=0.53 to 1.03, p=0.07). The latter association remained significant after adjusting for the confounding factors (adjusted OR=0.68, 95% CI=0.48 to 0.96, p=0.03). Conclusions Contrary to our hypothesis, people who are mentally unwell might go beyond the recommended precautionary measures. Our findings highlight the need to identify mental health problems and provide care and support for those who might go too far with precautionary measures.

AB  - Purpose
   Life insurance remains an essential part of financial and social security. The insurance penetration rate is high in the developed countries but very low in developing countries such as Malaysia, with only 4.8% penetration and extremely low underwritings. Therefore, this study aims to scrutinize the underlying determinants of a household purchase behaviour of life insurance.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The data generated from the administration of survey questionnaires to 325 households were analysed, using structural equation modelling to obtain the research purposes.
   Findings
   The analysis reveals that the knowledge of life insurance, attitudes towards life insurance, subjective norms (SN), trust and risk perception, affect the tendency of a household to purchase life insurance. The results of this study also highlight that households' purchase-propensity influences the purchase behaviour of life insurance. Concurrently, the intention to purchase has mediating effects on explanatory variables and purchase behaviour.
   Originality/value
   This paper established awareness, SN, perceived behavioural control, trust and risk perception as the key determinants promoting positive attitudes towards purchasing life insurance. The findings of this study can be successfully applied to different stakeholders in a similar context. This study suggests that the managers of life insurance companies should adjust their policy guidelines in accordance with the positive relationship between the constructs and consumers' intention to purchase life insurance.

AB  - Background: Several randomized trials have reported that graded exercise therapy (GET) is an effective treatment for chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). These trials were not blinded and relied on patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). We investigate whether bias introduced by this study design influenced the results.
   Methods: We extracted standardized mean differences from the most recent meta-analysis on exercise therapy for CFS to analyze their size, consistency over time, and congruence with objective measurements. A narrative review methodology was used to examine mediation analyses, plausible mechanisms of improvement, and risk of response bias.
   Results: Patient-reported improvements in exercise trials for CFS tend to be small, transient, and poorly supported by objective measurements. The risk of expectancy effects and response bias was high as patients were actively encouraged to adopt a positive attitude towards exercise therapy. Mediation analyses suggest that self-reported improvements in fatigue and physical function are not mediated by objective measures of fitness.
   Conclusions: Treatment effects seen in exercise trials for CFS could be the result of bias associated with the use of PROMs in nonblinded trials. This might explain the discrepancy between positive results reported in randomized trials and views on exercise therapy expressed by patient organizations. We hope that this case study furthers critical assessment of patientreported improvements in areas of medicine where blinding of therapists and trial participants faces practical limitations.

AB  - Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam's largest city, supports a vibrant street food culture. Most of the city's street-engaged food traders are poor and unskilled women, and there is scant research about how they build social networks and social capital that sustain their microbusinesses. This article focusses on the intimate socialities that street-engaged food traders develop with customers, shop owners and sister-traders in order to stabilise their incomes while their informal street-trading activities are policed and potentially shut down. Recent COVID-19 lockdown and social-distancing measures disrupted the crucial interpersonal relations of street trading and left the traders with no income. This article explores traders' strategies for achieving economic security, and outlines transformations of intimate socialities into mediated and digital relations after the lockdown.

AB  - Women leaders in the workforce are adversely affected by two sets of stereotypes: women are warm and communal but leaders are assertive and competent. This mismatch of stereotypes can lead to negative attitudes toward women leaders, however, not all individuals will be equally sensitive to these stereotypes. Men and women characterized by a need for cognitive closure (the desire for stable and certain knowledge) should be particularly sensitive to these stereotypes because they can be stable knowledge sources. We hypothesized that (a) negative attitudes toward women leaders in the workforce would vary with individuals' need for closure, independent of their gender, and that (b) binding moral foundations (a concern for the larger group and its norms and standards) would mediate this association. In two studies, MTurk workers completed measures of negative attitudes toward women managers (Study 1, n=149), stereotyped beliefs of women as not wanting or deserving high status positions in the workforce (Study 2, n=207), as well as need for cognitive closure, moral foundations, social desirability, gender, and political orientation. Our results were consistent with our hypotheses and suggest that attitudes toward woman managers can reflect acceptance of pre-existent norms. If these norms can be changed, then changes in attitudes could follow.

AB  - There are two classes of explanations of prejudice: situational and personality. In a sample of Polish community members (n=394), we tried to understand individual differences in prejudice towards refugees (i.e., classical and modern prejudice along with social distance) by considering the role of individual differences in the Dark Triad traits (i.e., narcissism, psychopathy, and Machiavellianism), collective narcissism (i.e., agentic and communal), social dominance, and authoritarianism. Both the Dark Triad traits and collective narcissism were associated with prejudice towards refugees among Poles, but the association for the former was fully mediated by social dominance-an effect that was stronger in men-whereas the association for the latter was partially mediated by authoritarianism-an effect that was stronger in women. We discuss our findings referring to a dual process model of prejudice.

AB  - Choosing the right way of programming can prevent learning difficulties, contribute to increasing students' motivation to learn, and make teaching process more effective. The article is focused on assessing which way of programming, visual or textual, is appropriate for intermediate and advanced learners in the context of creating mobile applications. Three ways of programming were examined during an extracurricular programming course for teenagers aged 12-18 with previous programming experience and positive attitude to programming. The course was aimed at programming mobile applications. MIT App Inventor 2 as a visual programming tool and Android Studio with Java as a textual programming tool were chosen. Due to the gap between two programming tools, the method of transition from visual to textual programming using Java Bridge Code Generator and Java Bridge Library as mediators was implemented. The research results are based on the analysis of data obtained from participatory observations, interviews with students, questionnaires and source codes of applications created by students. The case study shows a difference in students' performance between visual and textual programming in favour of visual programming. However, the difference in students' attitudes toward visual and textual programming was the opposite in favour of textual programming, regardless of age and learning performance. These results suggest that App Inventor visual programming environment is advantageous at the beginning of learning programming, but may be perceived as too limited and not enough motivating for intermediate and advanced students, even though programming in Android Studio professional teed based environment is too challenging for them.

AB  - Background and objectives: The fast detection of and response to threatening stimuli is an important task of the human visual and motor systems, and is especially challenging when stimuli are ambiguous. This study investigates the perception, evaluation and fast response to ambiguous natural spider stimuli in spider-fearful and non-anxious participants.
   Methods: Stimuli were created by gradually morphing natural images of spiders and non-spiders (a crab, a starfish, a bunch of keys, and a flower). In Study 1, participants rated the images on perceptual and emotional dimensions and responded to them in a response priming task to measure rapid information processing. In Study 2, results were validated and extended in a different paradigm by using a go/no-go task.
   Results: As expected, spider-fearful participants showed an interpretative bias for ambiguous stimuli (i.e., perceived them as more similar to spiders) and rated spider(-like) stimuli as more unpleasant, arousing, and disgusting. In Study 1, spider stimuli were preferentially processed in spider-fearful participants as observed in faster responses to spider targets-however, responses were not different to comparison participants for ambiguous stimuli. Study 2 suggests that this finding can be explained by differences in stimulus duration.
   Limitations: No participants with positive attitudes towards spiders or a second fearful comparison group were included.
   Conclusions: We suggest that these findings can be explained by the nature of the applied tasks that tap into early phases of visual processing, thereby relying on feedforward-mediated low-spatial-frequency information extracted via the fast, subcortical path to the amygdala.

AB  - Background
   England's Time To Change (TTC) social marketing campaign emphasised social contact between people with and without mental health problems to reduce stigma and discrimination.
   Aims
   We aimed to assess the effectiveness of the mass media component and also that of the mass social contact events.
   Method
   Online interviews were performed before and after each burst of mass media social marketing to evaluate changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour and associations between campaign awareness and outcomes. Participants at social contact events were asked about the occurrence and quality of contact, attitudes, readiness to discuss mental health and intended behaviour towards people with mental health problems.
   Results
   Prompted campaign awareness was 38-64%. A longitudinal improvement was noted for one intended behaviour item but not for knowledge or attitudes. Campaign awareness was positively associated with greater knowledge (beta=0.80, 95% CI 0.52-1.08) and more favourable attitudes (commonality OR 1.37, 95% CI 1.10-1.70; dangerousness OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.22-1.63) and intended behaviour (beta=0.75, 95% CI 0.53-0.96). Social contact at events demonstrated a positive impact (M=2.68) v. no contact (M=2.42) on perceived attitude change; t(211)=3.30, P=0.001. Contact quality predicted more positive attitude change (r=0.33, P<0.01) and greater confidence to challenge stigma (r = 0.38, P<0.01).
   Conclusions
   The favourable short-term consequences of the social marketing campaign suggest that social contact can be used by anti-stigma programmes to reduce stigma.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the risks and opportunities associated with Facebook usage and to explore the moderating role of psychosocial (mal)adjustment, nationality and age in these relationships. This correlational study involved a sample of 452 Brazilian and 500 Portuguese youths, aged between 14 and 20 years. Results showed that these youths spent a daily average of 61-120 minutes on Facebook, three to four times per week, displaying a positive attitude towards its use. These characteristics were most notable in the Brazilian youths [t(950) = 5.64, p < .001; 1(950) = -5.07, p < .001; and t(950) = - 6.85, p < .001, respectively]. The Portuguese youths ran more risks than the Brazilians [1(950) = 6.36, p < .001], but both youths equally enjoyed the opportunities. In the case of the Portuguese youths, the risks and opportunities were moderated by the frequency of use, in other words "the higher the usage, the more risks and opportunities" (beta = -235 p < .001and beta = -.167, p < .001, respectively). The psychosocial adjustment indicators did not moderate the effects of Facebook usage habits in risks and opportunities. The less psychosocially adjusted youths were those who ran more risks and also made the most of the opportunities. The results are discussed in light of the role of psychological, socio-cultural and developmental factors.

AB  - Drones, a small aviation craft that can hold sensors and be directed to certain locations, have been explored and utilized in domains such as public safety, traffic monitoring, and healthcare. Yet, the scientific research of drone usage still in progress. This article investigates the following: (1) how the public perceives a drone as a healthcare tool, and (2) what the concerns are of public acceptance of drones in healthcare. A qualitative approach with demographic questions such as participants' age, education level, current knowledge of drones, as well as willingness to learn about the technology was used. The contribution is to have an understanding of how the public perceives drones. The results can be used in enhancing public views of drones through skilled personnel and an educated workforce. In a conservative community such as Saudi Arabia, the public holds a relatively positive attitude towards drones. Respondents are aware of such technology from different sources, mainly TV news. Informants also did show a decent level of perceived beneficial usage of drones in healthcare. There are few participants who disclosed concerns of safety, security, and privacy for the usage of drones in healthcare due to a lack of knowledge about the technology. The results propose that government and industry stakeholders should invest more in increasing public awareness of technology. Media coverage will likely influence the public view and help the community move forward.

AB  - More and more people make opinions on air quality on social media, as science develops and the seriousness of air quality issues. Studies on sentiment analysis keyed to this kind of public opinions will do help in the introduction and perfection of policy of air quality. The evaluation of opinions sentiment is still a hard point in at this stage. There are only a few researches about the factors of the value of opinions sentiment. This article uses opinions related to air quality from Sina Weibo (Chinese Twitter) users, by online questionnaire surveys, and studies the results of opinions sentiment value about air quality in different groups, aiming at doing a research on the evaluation influence factors of opinions sentiment value on air quality. Furthermore, we came up with a solution synthesizing the influential level to calculate opinions sentiment value. We found amounts of respondents had a negative attitude to the opinions. We can now say with some confidence that education is the most significant influence factor on the public to tell the degree of sentiment level of air quality opinions. The sentiment calculation method where we come up could reduce the one-sidedness of different individuals' evaluations of the same opinion to some extent. The research could be reference for air quality management from the perspective of public opinion sentiment analysis.

AB  - Consumers are increasingly watching and sharing promotional and persuasive videos online via YouTube and other social media. Recent research has begun to explore both the content characteristics and the user motivations behind bona fide "viral" hits. The current study explores how both user motivations and emotional content of video messages containing the arousing emotion of disgust influence sharing intention among an undergraduate student sample (N = 456) and representative U.S. adult sample (N = 455). Some results mirror previous research and theory: Greater arousal and emotional response experienced while viewing was predictive of increased sharing intent across video message types and sources, as were positive attitudes and perceived social norms concerning sharing. Unique results also emerged in the data, revealing that advertising video messages elicited greater sharing intent than news videos and user-generated videos. In line with functional theories of disgust, videos which elicited higher-order, socio-moral disgust led to greater sharing intent than those that elicited sexual and pathogen avoidance disgusts. Implications for marketers and content creators are discussed.

AB  - We propose to use ambient sound as a privacy-aware source of information for COVID-19-related social distance monitoring and contact tracing. The aim is to complement currently dominant Bluetooth Low Energy Received Signal Strength Indicator (BLE RSSI) approaches. These often struggle with the complexity of Radio Frequency (RF) signal attenuation, which is strongly influenced by specific surrounding characteristics. This in turn renders the relationship between signal strength and the distance between transmitter and receiver highly non-deterministic. We analyze spatio-temporal variations in what we call "ambient sound fingerprints". We leverage the fact that ambient sound received by a mobile device is a superposition of sounds from sources at many different locations in the environment. Such a superposition is determined by the relative position of those sources with respect to the receiver. We present a method for using the above general idea to classify proximity between pairs of users based on Kullback-Leibler distance between sound intensity histograms. The method is based on intensity analysis only, and does not require the collection of any privacy sensitive signals. Further, we show how this information can be fused with BLE RSSI features using adaptive weighted voting. We also take into account that sound is not available in all windows. Our approach is evaluated in elaborate experiments in real-world settings. The results show that both Bluetooth and sound can be used to differentiate users within and out of critical distance (1.5 m) with high accuracies of 77% and 80% respectively. Their fusion, however, improves this to 86%, making evident the merit of augmenting BLE RSSI with sound. We conclude by discussing strengths and limitations of our approach and highlighting directions for future work.

AB  - Introduction: Biobanking is a relatively new concept in the Arab region. Targeting different stakeholders to introduce the concept of biobanking and develop an acceptance of it among them is important for the growth of biobanking in the region. Undergraduate students of life sciences represent an important segment of stakeholders, since they constitute potential future biobank customers. Limited funding, lack of awareness of the existence of the term biobanking itself among these students, and questions regarding best marketing strategies presented challenges to planning for the most effective message delivery to this target group. Methods: A specific course was designed for undergraduate students of life sciences, which was conducted at the Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, Egypt. The course was conducted twice in 2016 and included lectures covering biobanking, quality, ethics, information technology, and translational research. Facebook and word-of-mouth were used for marketing and advertising. Results: A total number of 125 participants attended both courses cumulatively. Facebook appeared to have been an effective marketing outlet, especially when paid advertisements were used. Evaluation of knowledge, measured using a pretest and posttest, demonstrated some improvement in knowledge of participants. Evaluation forms filled after the course showed positive attitude toward content and message delivery by a majority of participants. Facebook was also used as an evaluation method through analysis of engagement with posts created after course completion. Conclusions: Biobanking education can be carried out effectively with limited resources. Understanding the needs of the target group and using appropriate methods of communication are essential prerequisites to a well-tailored curriculum and effective message delivery. Using Facebook appears to be an effective and affordable method of communication and advertising. Targeting undergraduate students of life sciences interested in research is a good investment and can be very effective in increasing awareness about biobanking inside the research community.

AB  - Objectives To evaluate the barriers and facilitators for allied health professional's participation in pressure ulcer prevention.
   Design Mixed method cohort study.
   Setting Single centre study in an acute university hospital trust.
   Participants Five physiotherapists and four occupational therapists were recruited from the hospital trust. Therapists had been working in the National Health Service (NHS) for a minimum of one year.
   Main outcome measures Therapist views and experiences were collated using an audio recorded focus group. This recording was analysed using constant comparison analysis. Secondary outcomes included assessment of attitudes and knowledge of pressure ulcer prevention using questionnaires.
   Results Key themes surrounding barriers to participation in pressure ulcer prevention included resources (staffing and equipment), education and professional boundaries. Fewer facilitators were described, with new training opportunities and communication being highlighted. Results from the questionnaires showed the therapists had a positive attitude towards pressure ulcer prevention with a median score of 81% (range 50 to 83%). However, there were gaps in knowledge with a median score of 69% (range 50 to 77%).
   Conclusions The therapist reported several barriers to pressure ulcer prevention and few facilitators. The primary barriers were resources, equipment and education. Attitudes and knowledge in AHPs were comparable to data previously reported from experienced nursing staff. (C) 2016 Chartered Society of Physiotherapy. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Job satisfaction is a core variable in the study and practice of organizational psychology because of its implications for desirable work outcomes. Knowledge of its antecedents is abundant and informative, but there are still psychological processes underlying job satisfaction that have not received complete attention. This is the case of employee emotion regulation. In this study, we argue that employees' behaviors directed to manage their affective states participate in their level of job satisfaction and hypothesize that employee affect-improving and -worsening emotion regulation behaviors increase and decrease, respectively, job satisfaction, through the experience of positive and negative affect. Using a diary study with a sample of professionals from diverse jobs and organizations, for the most part, the mediational hypotheses were supported by the results albeit a more complex relationship was found in the case of affect worsening emotion regulation. This study contributes to expanding the job satisfaction and emotion regulation literatures and informs practitioners in people management in organizations about another route to foster and sustain positive attitudes at work.

AB  - Using an innovative fabrication technique, eco-friendly faux leather (EFFL) has been newly developed as a green leather alternative for the Chinese and Korean markets. Value-belief-attitude logic drawn from the heuristic-systemic model (Zuckmand and Chaiken in Psychol Mark 15(7):621-642, 1998) and value-belief-norm theory (Stern et al. in Environ Behav 27(6):723-743, 1995) is proposed to explicate the consumer acceptance attitudes toward the EFFL product. The findings from the multi-group structural equation modeling analysis of online data (n = 600) support the relevancy of VBA logic in which utilitarian and hedonic value motivate pro-environmental belief, and the EFFL product attributes significantly mediate belief and positive attitude toward the EFFL product. The discrepancies across two countries and two age cohorts are noteworthy when pro-environmental belief and product-related information lead to different consumer VBA processes in specific market segments. This study presents insights which provide novel opportunities for managerial implementations and theoretical advancements in eco-friendly related subjects and issues.

AB  - Extensive reading has been used as an approach to L2 instruction in foreign language contexts, where there is a need to provide rich and extensive input to learners. Previous research has shown that this type of instructional intervention is associated with improved performance in L2 reading comprehension and writing, as well as with increased positive attitudes toward L2 reading. However, not enough research has investigated the factors that mediate its effectiveness with young L2 learners. This study investigated the role of L1 reading-related factors in L2 learning under extensive reading-while-listening instruction. The findings of the study indicated a relationship between L2 learning gains in writing and positive L1 reading attitudes, a supportive reading environment at home, mother's reading interest, and parents' education level. The study concluded that extensive L2 reading-while-listening instruction allows some learners to gain additional benefits, but without disadvantaging the others. This has implications for teaching programs in the primary school context investigated, which should take learner background profiles into account when implementing this type of L2 instruction.

AB  - This study examines the direct impact of three dimensions of the institutional environment on managerial attitudes toward the natural environment and the direct influence of the latter on the environmental sustainability orientation (ESO) of small firms. We contend that when the institutional environment is perceived by owner-managers as supportive of sound natural environment management practices, they are more likely to develop a positive attitude toward natural environment issues and concerns. Such owner-manager attitudes are likely to lead to a positive and proactive orientation of their firms toward environmental sustainability. The study uses survey data from 166 small manufacturing firms located in three Philippine cities. First, the study develops and tests the measurement models to examine the validity of the constructs representing the firm's institutional environment, managerial attitudes toward the natural environment and the ESO of firms. Second, the study develops and tests the structural models examining the institutional environment-managerial attitudes-ESO linkages. Multi-sample invariance structural model analysis shows the mediating role of managerial attitudes in the institutional environment-ESO nexus. The findings show that ESO is a construct comprising three dimensions: knowledge of environmental issues, sustainable practices and commitment toward environmental sustainability. The cognitive, regulatory and normative elements of the institutional environment are strongly linked to positive managerial attitudes toward environmental sustainability, which in turn, positively influences the firm's overall ESO. Managerial attitudes play a mediating role in the institutional environment-ESO linkages. The managerial, practical, research and policy implications of the research findings are discussed.

AB  - Background: The patient's understanding of the illness may mediate beliefs towards its treatment. There is a paucity of studies examining the relationships between these variables in depression. This study was conducted to know the relationships between explanatory models and attitude to medication in depression. Materials and Methods: 494 patients with depression in remission were assessed with sociodemographic proforma, Drug Attitude Inventory, and Mental Distress Explanatory Model Questionnaire. Results: A favorable attitude toward medication was observed in 57.49% of participants. Mean scores on MDEMQ subscales Stress, Western Physiology, Non-Western Physiology, and Supernatural were 32.96, 21.87, 10.06, and 47.55, respectively. Statistically significant associations were found between attitude towards medication and the patient's marital status (more negative attitude with single status, chi 2 = 11.72, df = 3, P = 0.008) and occupation (more negative attitude among unemployed patients, chi(2) = 4.17, df = 1, P = 0.041). The scores of explanatory models did not differ based on positive or negative drug attitude. Conclusion: Though explanatory models are not linked to patient attitudes toward medication, patients who are single or unemployed have a negative attitude toward medications. Such negative attitude may impair compliance and worsen patient outcomes.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether learners from different cultures adopt a serious 3D game to facilitate the learning of transferable managerial skills (ethics) and knowledge.
   Design/methodology/approach A cross-sectional, cross-country survey study (n=319) was conducted recruiting participants from one North American and two British universities. The survey data and the conceptual model have been analysed and tested using confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling.
   Findings Participants displayed positive attitudes towards the 3D game and responded positively to theory presented as "real-life" scenarios; gamification techniques such as interactions and dialogue, and rewards and progression levels, which are part of the game, albeit the participants' adoption was driven more by extrinsic motivations (rewards) than intrinsic ones (ease of use and entertainment). In addition, the empirical results suggest that when gender is taken into account, the perceptions and needs of cross-cultural learners in serious gaming environments vary and display characteristics that are similar to Rogers' five adopter categories; thus, culture could significantly shape learners' decisions to adopt a serious game as a managerial learning tool.
   Research limitations/implications For future researchers, this paper highlights various levels of training, support and promotional awareness that need to be considered to facilitate the adoption of serious games for managerial learning.
   Practical implications For academics and practitioners in work-based learning and managerial training environments, this paper highlights the salient factors that need to be inherent in a serious 3D game, and best practices for scaffolding existing instructional approaches or training interventions.
   Originality/value In light of Rogers' five adopter categories, this cross-country study involving culturally diverse learners provides key insight into the potential application of serious games as a practice-based learning instrument in academia and industry.

AB  - Before herd immunity is reached, preventive practices still play an important role in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. Adherence to preventive behaviors could be determined by individuals' health beliefs, which would be influenced by antecedent factors such as previous exposure to pandemic stressors. Applying the health belief model (HBM), this study aims to examine the mediation association among COVID-19 stressors, HBM constructs, and preventive behaviors. Longitudinal data were collected from 1225 Chinese college students using web-based surveys at wave 1 (w1; between January 31 and February 11, 2020) and wave 2 (w2; between March 20 and April 3, 2020). Participants reported their COVID-19 stressors (w1), five HBM constructs (w2), and preventive behaviors (w1 and w2). Paired t-tests suggested that social distancing and self-quarantine behaviors decreased while precautionary behaviors increased from w1 to w2. Path analysis indicated that two HBM constructs (perceived barriers and self-efficacy) mediated the association between COVID-19 stressors and precautionary behaviors. These findings suggested that tailored prevention intervention for college students should attend to perceived barriers and self-efficacy. Individuals who exposed to multiple pandemic stressors merit particular attention and intervention should account for their early pandemic stress experiences.

AB  - Many people perceive climate change as psychologically distant-a set of uncertain events that might occur far in the future, impacting distant places and affecting people dissimilar to themselves. In this study, we employed construal level theory to investigate whether a climate change communication intervention could increase public engagement by reducing the psychological distance of climate change. Australian residents (N = 333) were randomly assigned to one of two treatment conditions: one framed to increase psychological distance to climate change (distal frame), and the other framed to reduce psychological distance (proximal frame). Participants then completed measures of psychological distance of climate change impacts, climate change concern, and intentions to engage in mitigation behavior. Principal components analysis indicated that psychological distance to climate change was best conceptualized as a multidimensional construct consisting of four components: geographic, temporal, social, and uncertainty. Path analysis revealed the effect of the treatment frame on climate change concern and intentions was fully mediated by psychological distance dimensions related to uncertainty and social distance. Our results suggest that climate communications framed to reduce psychological distance represent a promising strategy for increasing public engagement with climate change.

AB  - As China prepares to host the 2022 Winter Olympics, the Beijing Winter Olympics Organizing Committee has committed to making public participation a fundamental part of its broader sustainability objectives. Unfortunately, the existing research on information openness and public participation towards Winter Olympic Games is limited in the perspective of host residents. Therefore, this article aims to understand the information disclosure and public participation, as well as the roles information and technologies (ICTs) play in achieving environmental sustainability. With the help of self-administered questionnaires, data were compiled. The survey was conducted in April 2017 with 650 residents in Beijing and Zhangjiakou via face-to-face interviews to obtain a random and statistically representative sample of host residents. Our findings indicated that only few respondents participated in the limited activities of Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The respondents' views on important issues of public participation varied obviously including the participating level, principles, time, ways, mechanism, and influencing factor. The analysis illustrated over 70% of respondents had the positive attitudes towards ICTs roles and functions in Beijing 2022. ICTs have helped the public to obtain information about environmental management and sustainability issues, and to facilitate public awareness and collective action by building new management practices. This study has implications and contributes to the burgeoning literature surrounding the Olympic Games by providing an in-depth analysis of public participation in relation to the theory.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine online purchase behaviours amongst young consumers in Australia and the USA. It also aims to develop and test a theoretical framework of young consumers' online purchase behaviour. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected through online surveys targeting young online shoppers in Australia and the USA. A multi-group structural equation modelling was used to test the proposed structural model and hypotheses. Findings The model shows a good fit with the data. Young consumers in Australia and the USA have positive attitude towards online shopping that significantly affects their online purchase intentions. Social motive negatively impacts online purchase intentions in the Australian sample. Escapism and value motives positively affect Australian and American young shoppers' online purchase intentions. Young consumers in Australia and the USA are very familiar with the online shopping process. The familiarity strongly triggers their information search behaviour that leads to online purchase intentions. Originality/value Using the generational cohort theory, this paper contributes to the extant literature by providing insights on the Australian and American young generation's unique values and characteristics that influence their online purchase behaviours. This research also contributes insights for the marketers and policy makers to improve their marketing efforts and services and appeal to this young segment, based on their unique values and characteristics.

AB  - Background. The aim of this study is to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to pre-CRT in patients of stage II/III rectal cancer. Materials and Methods. Questionnaires regarding the knowledge, attitudes, and practices of pre-CRT were mailed to 145 rectal cancer patients in II/III stage between January 2012 and December 2014, and 111 agreed to participate and returned completed questionnaires to the researcher. Logistic regression model was used to compare sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and attitude with practice, respectively. Results. A total of 145 patients were approached for interview, of which 111 responded and 48.6% (54) had undergone pre-CRT. Only 31.5% of the participants knew that CRT is a treatment of rectal cancer and 39.6% were aware of the importance of CRT. However, the vast majority of participants (68.5%) expressed a positive attitude toward rectal cancer. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that knowledge level (p = 0.006) and attitudes (p = 0.001) influence the actual practice significantly. Furthermore, age, gender, and income were potential predictors of practice (all p < 0.05). Conclusion. This study shows that, despite the fact that participants had suboptimal level of knowledge on rectal cancer, their attitude is favorable to pre-CRT. Strengthening the professional health knowledge and realizing the importance of attitudes may deepen patients' understanding of preoperative therapy.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to propose a research framework to examine the effects of consumer consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle on the attitudes toward eating "green" simultaneously in a single study. Besides, the mediating role of healthy lifestyle in forming a positive attitude toward eating "green" is also examined in this study. Design/methodology/approach A questionnaire-based approach was applied in this study. The unit of analysis was individual consumer (aged 18 years and above) who lived in Klang Valley, Malaysia. PLS-SEM was used to test the structural relationship of the constructs in the model based on the 300 useable data collected. Findings The results indicated that health consciousness, food safety concern and healthy lifestyle have a significant effect on attitudes toward eating "green", whereas environmental and price consciousness did not have such effect. A healthy lifestyle also mediates the relationship between health consciousness and attitude toward eating "green". An individual's healthy lifestyle that focused on physical health-related activities will increase the effect of consumer health consciousness on their attitudes toward eating "green". Practical implications The outcome of this study provided deeper insights for firms to assess the feasibility of entering or expanding their operations in the green market with more enduring and effective sales and marketing strategies. Originality/value Consumers' acceptance of or resistance toward organic food had become the centre of the research focus by the academician and the industrial practitioners over the years, despite the inconsistencies of the results obtained to predict such behavior. In this study, besides examining the direct effect of the proposed variables on the attitudes toward eating "green", the mediating role of a healthy lifestyle in forming such attitudes was also examined.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19) is pandemic and currently becomes a serious cause of death worldwide. It is caused by a SARS-CoV-2 belonging to a family known as corona virus. The aim of this study is to assess the community knowledge, attitude and practice strategy implementation on SARS-CoV-2 disease 2019 (COVID-19). A cross-sectional survey study was done from July to October, 2020 in Woldia town, Northeast Ethiopia. Interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 404 respondents. Data collected were analyzed using descriptive statistics and chi-square test with a 95% confidence interval to know the association of socio-demographic characteristics with the knowledge, attitude and practices towards COVID-19. From a total of 404 responses collected (64.1%, n = 259/404), (50.7%, n = 205/404) and (39.6%, n = 160/404) of the respondents were between ages 18-39 years, males and were diploma and above, respectively. The majority of the respondents had good knowledge about the transmission mode and symptoms of COVID-19 and they obtained information mainly through mass media. The knowledge of the respondents about the transmission mode of COVID-I9 through coughing and sneezing, direct contact with infected person and touching contaminated materials was statistically associated with education and occupation (p <0.001). Among the total respondents (53.7%, n = 217/404) had a negative attitude that COVID-19 pandemic will not be controlled. The attitude of the respondents towards successfully controlling of COVID-I9 was statistically associated in terms of age, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.001). Most of the respondents (63.1%, n = 255/404), (58.9%, n = 238/404), (66.8%, n = 270/404) and (63.9%, n = 258/404) did not wash hands with soap, avoidance of touching the nose and mouth, practicing social distancing and wearing of face masks in public or crowded places, respectively. The practices of the respondents towards COVID-19 were statistically associated with sex, marital status, education and occupation (p < 0.01). COVID-19 is currently the cause of death and it has a great impact on the economy, politics and social interactions in the study area. The government should strength the health system by increasing surveillance activities in detecting cases. Our findings suggest that the community should practice the WHO and EMoH recommendations to minimize the spread of the virus.

AB  - A stochastic model estimated the consequences of a COVID-19 super spreader event occurring in the local municipality of Stavanger, Norway as a result of a night on the town. The model imposed different infection control regulations and compared these different scenarios. For Stavanger's 161 locations of service, secondary transmissions from a super spreader event was estimated to infect a median of 37, requiring the quarantining of 200 guests given no infection control regulations, 23 and 167 when imposing social distancing regulations and other hygienic infection control measures, 7 infected and 63 quarantined guests with restrictions placed on the guest capacity, and 4 infected and 57 quarantined guests with both forms of restriction in use.

AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to investigate social media posts regarding pilon fractures and its relationship to patient injury perception. We evaluated Instagram media posts in patients who have suffered pilon fractures for the following variables: gender, tone, discussion of rehabilitation, activities of daily living (ADL) reference, incision/scar reference, pain, post of radiograph/imaging, external fixation reference, discussion of bracing/splinting, pre- or postoperative swelling, and need for reoperation. Results were determined by comparing each variable to gender and tone of the post to study patient injury perception. Methods: Public Instagram posts from within a 1-year time period were isolated and evaluated using the hashtag "#pilonfracture." Individual posts were analyzed by authors. In total, 241 patient posts were included for investigation and analysis of patient injury perception via social media. Results: Of all included posts, 88% of posts had a positive tone. A majority of the posts (66.8%) mentioned rehabilitation and postoperative progress. There were significant associations between positive tone and rehabilitation (P = .0001), as well as positive tone and ADLs (P = .0361). Conclusion: Reported outcomes after surgical management of pilon fractures are generally poor. Nonetheless, this analysis of patients sharing their experience on social media after open reduction internal fixation of pilon fractures demonstrates a mostly positive attitude toward the injury and recovery. A positive tone of the post was significantly associated with mentions of rehabilitation and ADLs.

AB  - This study examined whether news stories about violent shooting homicides impact implicit and explicit attitudes about race. To explore these relationships, the authors used a 3 (race: White, Black, control) x 3 (role: victim, perpetrator, control) x 3 (multiple messages) mixed factorial design. The study found that high social dominant-oriented (SDO) individuals expressed more empathy in general, with the most empathy toward Black perpetrators in homicide news stories in comparison to low SDO individuals. Ironically, for high SDO individuals, perpetrators in the stories received more explicit negative Black stereotyping than victim in the stories. These findings indicate that aversive racism occurs in the processing of news stories. This has practical implications for journalists because stereotyping and bias in news coverage could reinforce aversive racism.

AB  - The onset of technological innovations (mobile and handhelds, virtual reality, multi-touch screens, and interactive 3D) have provided creative ideas and perspectives for online communication, dissemination, and protection of cultural heritage for costume museums. Digital costume museums (DCM) digitized clothing collections for the Internet, conducive to enhancing visitors' understanding, enjoyment, and positive attitudes and stimulating further learning, experience, and exploration. However, little attention has been paid to the influence and effects of these technologies on visitors' experience toward digital costume museums. Improving users' behavior intention and expanding the influence of digital costume museums are issues that need further discussion. In this study, we expand the technology acceptance model (TAM) by adding information quality and information richness as the system characteristics, constructing the research model, and 11 hypotheses of users' behavior intention toward digital costume museums. Analysis of data collected from 265 costume-related respondents reveal that information quality (IQ) positively influences perceived convenience (PC) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), while information richness (IR) has a positive impact on perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived playfulness (PP). The finding also reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived playfulness (PP) are significant predictors of users' behavior intention (BI) toward using digital costume museums. The research conclusion enriches academic theories and brings practical inspiration for managers, curators, and practitioners to construct and innovate digital costume museums.

AB  - It has recently been found that individuals high in autistic traits tend to believe that they are usually not treated fairly. In the present study, it is assumed that such a lowered personal belief in a just world is based on cumulative humiliation experiences that stem from autistic pragmatic language problems (e.g., communicating in a monotonous voice, not being "in tune" with others during conversations). Furthermore, the less individuals believe that they receive fair treatment, the more they may develop a negative attitude toward human nature (i. e., believing that humans are generally untrustworthy, unfair, and unhelpful). The serial multiple mediation model reflecting these assumptions received initial empirical support in a nonclinical sample (N = 344). Implications for professional health care are addressed.

AB  - The thousands of deaths and disabilities due to workplace accidents and injuries each year emphasize the importance of safety research. Despite occupational safety research that has contributed to identifying antecedents of safety, little is known about why and how safety knowledge leads to safety behaviours and how personal and situational factors interact to promote occupational safety. Using a multilevel, multisource, and time-lagged research design, the present study investigates whether safety knowledge affects safety behaviours through safety attitudes and further tests whether supervisory safety attitudes can impact the strength of these relationships and play a role as moderators of the proposed mediated relationship. Data were collected from workers (N = 177) and supervisors (N = 42) in a construction company in the energy industry at two time points. Results indicate full support for the moderated mediation model, demonstrating that worker safety attitudes partially mediate the relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours. Moreover, when supervisors had positive attitudes towards safety, both the direct relationship between worker safety attitudes and safety behaviours and the indirect relationship between safety knowledge and safety behaviours were more positive compared to when supervisors had negative safety attitudes. Theoretical and practical implications for occupational safety are discussed.

AB  - Background: Although peer-to-peer contact might empower patients in various ways, studies show that only a few patients actually engage in support groups.
   Objective: The objective of our study was to explore factors that facilitate or impede engagement in face-to-face and online peer support, using the Theory of Planned Behavior.
   Methods: A questionnaire was completed by 679 patients being treated for arthritis, breast cancer, or fibromyalgia at two Dutch regional hospitals.
   Results: Our results showed that only a minority of the patients engaged in organized forms of peer support. In total 10% (65/679) of the respondents had engaged in face-to-face meetings for patients in the past year. Only 4% (30/679) of the respondents had contact with peers via the Internet in the past year. Patients were more positive about face-to-face peer support than about online peer support (P < .001). In accordance with the Theory of Planned Behavior, having a more positive attitude (P < .01) and feeling more supported by people in the social environment (P < .001) increased the intention to participate in both kinds of peer support. In addition, perceived behavioral control (P = .01) influenced the intention to participate in online peer support. Nevertheless, the intention to engage in face-to-face and online peer support was only modestly predicted by the Theory of Planned Behavior variables (R-2 = .33 for face-to-face contact and R-2 = .26 for online contact).
   Conclusion: Although Health 2.0 Internet technology has significantly increased opportunities for having contact with fellow patients, only a minority seem to be interested in organized forms of peer contact (either online or face-to-face). Patients seem somewhat more positive about face-to-face contact than about online contact.

AB  - As a result of the COVID-19 outbreak, teaching in universities needed to be quickly transitioned from regular on-campus classes into technology-enhanced teaching formats. In this article, we present the case study of Chemnitz University of Technology (Germany), where digital classes were introduced in a matter of weeks. By analyzing syllabus data, we found that the use of video and video conferencing is an important current development. Related to these findings, we present evidence from instructional psychology and social media research that can help in the design of teaching during this crisis. We highlight the need for multimodal learning, that is, learning settings that use multiple sensory modalities. Importantly, we present a strategy of hybrid campuses for this and potential future emergencies. This approach describes how the social distancing measures currently in effect can be used to re-think higher education based on a reasonable use of technology. Taken together, the COVID-19 crisis can be a time of major reform in higher education that will accelerate the process of digitalization in an unprecedented way.

AB  - This article analyses the political style of the Dutch nationalist-populist celebrity politician Geert Wilders and examines the ways in which his self-stylisation epitomises both the strategic use of national imagery, and the affective embodiment of associated sentiments in his public persona. Using insights from imagology, we argue, firstly, that Wilders' use of national images allows him to align himself with the traditional narrative of Dutch collective resistance to foreign rule and thus to authenticate his political attitude as compliant with that of the Dutch national character. Secondly, turning to the field of celebrity studies, we demonstrate that this self-stylisation also involves a form of emotional work. In speeches, texts, campaign advertisements, and tweets, Wilders projects an affectively charged public self that 'moves' the audience and lends a sense of urgency to his politics as well as a feeling of authenticity to his political persona.

AB  - Are people's perceptions of the newsworthiness of events biased by a tendency to rate as more important any news story that seems likely to lead others to share their own political attitudes? To assess this, we created six pairs of hypothetical news stories, each describing an event that seemed likely to encourage people to adopt attitudes on the opposite side of a particular controversial issue (e.g. affirmative action and gay marriage). In total, 569 subjects were asked to evaluate the importance of these stories 'to the readership of a general-circulation newspaper', disregarding how interesting they happened to find the event. Subjects later indicated their own personal attitudes to the underlying political issues. Predicted crossover interactions were confirmed for all six issues. All the interactions took the form of subjects rating stories offering 'ammunition' for their own side of the controversial issue as possessing greater intrinsic news importance.

AB  - The authors investigated the effects of reading different types of online comments about a company on people's attitude change based on individual's prior attitude toward the company. Based on Social Judgment Theory, several hypotheses were tested. The results showed that the effects of online comments interact with individuals' prior attitudes toward a corporation. People with a strong negative attitude toward a corporation were less influenced by other's online comments than people with a neutral attitude in general. However, people with a prior negative attitude were more affected by refutational two-sided comments than one-sided comments. The results suggest that the effects of user generated content should be studied in a holistic manner, not only by investigating the effects of online content itself, but also by examining how others' responses to the content shape or change individuals' attitudes based on their prior attitudes.

AB  - Aims: Little is known about the influence of parents' screen media habits and attitudes towards screen media on children's screen use. We investigated associations of parental screen use, their smartphone addiction and screen media attitudes, with children's recreational screen use. Methods: This study was based on a population-based cross-sectional survey sent between May 2019 and November 2020 to a random sample of 6820 Danish parent-child dyads who answered questions regarding their screen media habits. Children were 6-11 years of age and had to reside with the parent. Multivariable adjusted regression analyses were conducted (in October 2021) separately for screen media use on weekdays and weekend days. Results: The analyses included 5437 parents (41.0 years, 67.6% girls) and 5437 children (8.9 years, 48.2% girls). The adjusted relative odds of excessive amounts of screen use of children (>3 hours/weekday and >4 hours/weekend day) was 5.8 (95% confidence interval (CI) 4.6; 7.3) on weekdays and 7.2 (95% CI 5.9; 8.8) on weekend days comparing the fourth and first quartile of parental screen use. Children of parents in the fourth quartile of parental screen use had 2.1 (95% CI 1.7; 2.5) and 2.5 (95% CI 2.2; 3.0) greater odds of screen use before bedtime on all week and weekend days, respectively. Children of parents who had a positive attitude towards their child's screen use or were at high risk of smartphone addiction had significantly higher screen use and more frequent problematic screen use. Conclusions: Parent's screen media habits and attitudes were strongly associated with their children's recreational screen use.

AB  - Background: This study examines the evidence for a third- person effect (TPE) in the reactions of individuals affected by depression to direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements for antidepressants. TPE predicts that people will perceive the self to be less vulnerable to such advertisements than others. Previous research has identified such an effect, but did so in general population surveys. Past Previous research has also found a link between depression and diminished self-serving biases; whether this would be the case for TPE is unknown. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to 148 participants in an Internet depression support group to investigate their perceptions of the influence of direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements for antidepressants. Results: Consistent with expectations derived from third-person effect TPE research, participants, although relatively neutral in their attitudes toward such advertisements, nevertheless perceived other individuals with depression as more influenced than themselves. Positive attitudes towards DTC advertisements and depressive symptoms at the time of the survey were each negatively associated with this third-person perception (TPE). Conclusions: Individuals who have been diagnosed with depression and who participated in an online depression support group believe that they are less vulnerable to the influence of DTC advertisements than the typical person with a history of depression. This is moderated by attitudes towards DTC advertisements as well as by depressive symptoms, each of which is associated with a weakened TPE. Depression and Anxiety 28:160-165, 2011.

AB  - Background Stigma associated with mental disorders is rooted among many pharmacists, and represents a major barrier to patient support in community-based psychiatry. We developed an assessment scale that is specifically designed to assess the level of stigma that pharmacists may have toward schizophrenia, and then examined the effects of reducing stigma with an educational program that focuses on communication with patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (PDS) using the newly developed Stigma Scale towards Schizophrenia for Community Pharmacists (SSCP). Methods SSCP was developed by exploratory factor analysis with promax rotation based on responses from 822 randomly selected community pharmacists. Furthermore, a randomized controlled trial was conducted for 115 community pharmacists to clarify the effects of reducing the stigma of schizophrenia using an educational program for them with a focus on communication with PDS. Participants were individually allocated to two groups: educational lecture group (56; only attending a lecture on schizophrenia) or contact-based intervention group (59; communicating with PDS and attending the lecture). The stigma assessment using SSCP was conducted immediately before and after the educational intervention. Results A total of 4 factors and 27 items were extracted from the exploratory factor analysis to comprise the SSCP. Cronbach's alpha of SSCP, social distance at professional pharmacy service (factor I), attitudes towards PDS (factor II), self-disclosure (factor III), and social distance in personal (factor IV) were 0.89, 0.88, 0.76, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. Educational program-related changes of the median (interquartile range) total SSCP score from baseline were - 9.0 (- 16.0 - - 5.0) in the contact-based intervention group and - 3.0 (- 7.0-1.0) in the educational lecture group, reflecting a significant reduction of stigma levels in the contact-based intervention group. On examining the SSCP subscales, scores for factor I and factor II significantly improved. The educational program was more effective for pharmacists aged 20-39 years or with negligible experience of communicating with PDS at work and/or in private life. Conclusions SSCP and the educational program for community pharmacists that focuses on communication with PDS were useful for assessing and reducing, respectively, the stigma attached by these pharmacists to schizophrenia.

AB  - In this article, we investigate the integration of concept-based pragmatics instruction, grounded in Vygotskian sociocultural psychology, in an intact second-semester French class (n = 13) over the course of an academic term. Our focus is on learners' appropriation of the concepts of self-presentation, social distance, and power with respect to the French second-person pronoun system (i.e., tu versus vous) as revealed through language awareness questionnaires, appropriateness judgment tasks, and computer-mediated strategic interaction scenario performances. Following this three-tiered approach to analysis, our findings show that learners developed a deeper and more systematic understanding of tu and vous, that they were able to apply the concepts in planning language use, and that their use of tu and vous became more sensitive to maintaining symmetrical social relationships.

AB  - Precautionary measures of physical isolation, social distancing, and masks have all aided in controlling the spread of COVID-19. However, detection of the virus is crucial to implement isolation of infected individuals. This paper presents the innovative repurposing of lab materials, workspace, and personnel in response to the COVID-19-induced shutdown and consequential shortage of commercially made virus transport media (VTM). This method for VTM production highlights the ability of standard research labs to fulfill the needs of those affected by the pandemic and potential recurrence of outbreaks. Further, the collaboration of the various entities at The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center (OSUWMC) allowed for efficient production and distribution of VTM tubes to facilitate mass COVID-19 testing. We propose that implementation of this process by university research labs would enable quicker interventions, potentially better outcomes, and prevention of further spread of disease.

AB  - The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has greatly threatened the global health system and triggered the public health emergency. In order to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare and prevention information have been delivered through omni-media channels (e.g., television, radio, social platform, etc.). As a traditional outlet, the short message service (SMS) can timely provide abundant anti-epidemic alerts to mobile users. In this paper, we aim to investigate mobile users' attitudes toward COVID-19 public-interest SMS sent from government authorities and then explore the insight from messaging texts collected between January and April 2020 in China. In general, respondents show a positive attitude towards content and the necessity of public-interest SMS during the pandemic. However, we find that gender and age differences not only affect content evaluation, but also influence reading and forwarding behaviors. For the necessity of SMS, it shows significant difference between the 18-25-year-old and over 40-year-old group, with the middle and elder group showing serious attitudes and giving higher remarks than the youth due to the habits of media usage. However no significant difference is presented between females and males. In terms of content, the category of topics and releasing institutions are analyzed, respectively. Due to the centralized responses and coordination of prevention and control in China, the messages from COVID-19 disposal organizations (e.g., municipal steering group and provincial CDC) account for more than 70% among four cities.

AB  - This paper examines the effects of cyberbullying using a mixed method approach, by combining interviews, focus groups and a survey of 7,000 students. In the inductive stage, and following an axial coding analysis, we identified 153 concepts related to conflicts, which were divided into three thematic units to explain the greater impact of cyberbullying: (1) social distance; (2) privacy exposure; and (3) range of the material. The survey concluded that: (1) the victims of bullying and cyberbullying present higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being compared to non-bullied students, and those who were bullied in both channels presented higher levels of loneliness and lower levels of social well-being than those who were bullied in only one of them; (2) the victims of cyberbullying showed lower levels of individual well-being compared with those who had never been bullied, as with those who suffered face-to-face bullying. This difference was explained by testimonies indicating that most of the cyberbullying was related to intimate content, which has a higher impact on image perception.

AB  - The quality of stockmanship has a major influence on farm animal welfare and productivity. Farmers' attitudes are reflected in their behavior toward animals which, in turn, affects animal behavior, welfare and productivity. Yet attitudes toward behaviors that are positive for the animal's welfare have been neglected in previous studies on farmers' attitudes. Our objective was to examine the relationship between farmers' attitudes toward improvement of animal welfare and productivity of the animals. In a framework of the theory of planned behavior, we used a conceptualization of the improvement of animal welfare based on an earlier on-farm interview and questionnaire studies of farmers' methods for constructing such behavior as an object of evaluation, and standardized production parameters that make farms comparable. Psycho-social, production and demographic data from 124 farms were subjected to correlation analyses. Among the farmers' attitudes and attitude-related perceptions, the significance of subjective norms, as well as perceived importance and ease of improving animal welfare, had relevant associations with piglet productivity. The most powerful factor related with several production parameters was the perceived significance of researchers and other specialists as a source of a subjective norm: appreciating researchers was associated with more piglets born, lower piglet mortality and more weaned piglets. Considering it easy to provide the animals with a favorable environment correlated negatively with piglet mortality and positively with the number of weaned piglets. The importance of humane treatment of animals was positively correlated with the number of weaned piglets, as was the perceived ease of catering for the farmer's own well-being. Studying the production parameters of the distinctively positively-oriented farmers' pigs in relation to the average production figures strengthened these results: the farmers with the most positive attitudes (except for the perceived ease of catering for own well-being) gained 0.34-0.54 piglets per litter more than average farmers. In general, farmer attitudes were more strongly correlated with production parameters of gilts and piglets in first parity litters than of multiparous sows and their piglets. Farms with good results in terms of production parameters appeared to also be farms with farmer having more positive attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control in relation to practices that improve the animals' welfare. The indicated link between farmers' attitudes and production parameters warrants further studies on how farmer behavior mediates this association and on causal relationships between attitudes, animal welfare and production.

AB  - The authors focus their attention on the current regime of self-isolation, which arose in the context of the spread of a new coronavirus infection. Currently, the Russian population is forced to change their social behavior adapting to the conditions dictated by the pandemic. Within this article, based on secondary data analysis, the authors consider the transformational contradictions of social behavior, highlighting the aspect of virtuality. On the part of social institutions there are new organizational and management strategies that are implemented through social distancing of citizens and wearing masks in public places, as we as the self-isolation of the population, the transition of professional activity to the remote mode. The reaction of the population is expressed in such social practices as distrust of social institutions represented by the state and the media, denial of the coronavirus, non-compliance with the self-isolation regime, fear of the economic crisis, the transition of labor activity to a remote mode, a change in the approach to consumption and its structure.

AB  - An online diary study was performed to investigate deception across different media. One hundred and four individuals participated in the study, with 76 completing the diaries. Individuals were most likely to lie on the telephone. Planned lies, which participants also rated the most serious, were more likely told via SMS (short message service) text messaging. Most lies were told to people participants felt closest to. The feature-based model provides a better account of the deceptions reported by participants than do media richness theory or social distance theory. However, the authors propose a reworked feature-based model to explain deception across different media. They suggest that instant messaging should be treated as a near synchronous mode of communication. We suggest that the model needs to distinguish between spontaneous and planned lies.

AB  - Purpose The COVID-19 pandemic has led to disorder in work and livelihood of a majority of the modern world. In this work, we review its major impacts on procedures and workflow of clinical physics tasks, and suggest alternate pathways to avoid major disruption or discontinuity of physics tasks in the context of small, medium, and large radiation oncology clinics. We also evaluate scalability of medical physics under the stress of "social distancing".
   Methods Three models of facilities characterized by the number of clinical physicists, daily patient throughput, and equipment were identified for this purpose. For identical objectives of continuity of clinical operations, with constraints such as social distancing and unavailability of staff due to system strain, however with the possibility of remote operations, the performance of these models was investigated. General clinical tasks requiring on-site personnel presence or otherwise were evaluated to determine the scalability of the three models at this point in the course of disease spread within their surroundings.
   Results The clinical physics tasks within three models could be divided into two categories. The former, which requires individual presence, include safety-sensitive radiation delivery, high dose per fraction treatments, brachytherapy procedures, fulfilling state and nuclear regulatory commission's requirements, etc. The latter, which can be handled through remote means, include dose planning, physics plan review and supervision of quality assurance, general troubleshooting, etc.
   Conclusion At the current level of disease in the United States, all three models have sustained major system stress in continuing reduced operation. However, the small clinic model may not perform if either the current level of infections is maintained for long or staff becomes unavailable due to health issues. With abundance, and diversity of innovative resources, medium and large clinic models can sustain further for physics-related radiotherapy services.

AB  - This study examines the effects of economic news on people's self-reported interest and their evaluations of the national economy while distinguishing among the tone of the content, the level of uncertainty with which economic information is presented, and the issues covered in the news. Analyses of experimental data (N = 2,168) show that negative news about inflation is consumed with the most interest. Also, the negative effect of bad economic news on people's economic evaluations is strongest among news consumers who are most interested in the news. The results challenge conventional wisdom about the moderating role of issue obtrusiveness in media effects research. Furthermore, the focus on interactions reveals that typical economic news features shape public opinion not only in isolation and but even more so when their impacts are combined.

AB  - Controversial taboo appeals as an executional cue in viral advertising have commonly been used by advertisers. In this context, the study investigates the role of medium context on the effectiveness of controversial taboo ads. By implementing a tightly controlled experiment which deals with controversial taboo ads embedded in a press article and in a viral context, the study finds that the viral medium context does not lead to a more positive attitude toward the embedded brand or to more positive purchase intentions. In addition, a viral medium context triggers `unintended consequences' that lead consumers to undermine the level of tabooness of the viral advertising and subjective norms. To increase the external validity of the research, the results were replicated for two kinds of controversial taboo appeals; one related to sexuality, and the other to death. The results provide useful implications for theory and practice. Extending viral advertising research, a different angle on controversial viral advertising has been taken, shifting from an advertiser and brand focus, to a societal and social one. The work leads to a better understanding of the ethics of controversial viral advertising, and demonstrates its role in the trivialization of taboo behaviors and imagery. The results confirm the need for more regulation of online buzz communication and encourage regulatory bodies to extend policies of viral advertising regulation.

AB  - Dadvertising-advertisements that portray dads as active caretakers-is predicted to be particularly relevant to men who are new or first-time fathers. This research tests a conceptual model for understanding the effects of anxiety, wishful identification, and emotional response on new and expectant dads' empowerment, attitude toward the dadvertisement, and attitude toward the brand. Six hypotheses were tested through a between-groups experimental design utilizing two ad stimuli-one that showed a progressive/nurturing dad and one that showed a hypermasculine/traditional dad. Findings indicate that dadvertisements depicting nurturing fathers were evaluated more positively on emotional responses, wishful identification, and progressive ad perceptions than hypermasculine/traditional portrayals. Increased anxiety was related to less positive emotions toward, and weakness perceptions of, the modern fatherhood ad stimulus, as well as less positive perceptions of, and wishful identification with, the advertisement. Finally, mediation effects were found among positive emotional responses, positive dad perceptions, and wishful identification on dadvertising outcome variables, including more positive attitudes toward the ad, brand, and empowerment. This research contributes to the understanding of consumer responses toward dadvertisements and the differing responses toward the portrayals of fatherhood in ads.

AB  - Advergames are increasingly popular for online advertising campaigns. However, few IS studies have investigated the effectiveness of this unique advertising strategy. This study sheds light on the effectiveness of advergames by studying three design factors of advergame: interactivity, fit, and expectancy. We use multiple dependent variables (e. g., attitude toward advergames, attitude toward brand, and purchase intention) to evaluate the effectiveness of advergames. Based on work from human-computer interaction research and the transportation theory, we propose two-way interaction effects of interactivity, fit, and expectancy on attitudes toward advergame, and also their main effects on attitude toward brand. A positive mediating relationship from attitude toward advergame to attitude toward brand, and to purchase intention is also hypothesized. We conducted a 2*2*2 factorial design experiment in an online 3D virtual world environment to test our hypotheses. The results show that, in the high fit condition, both high interactivity and low expectancy lead to a more favorable attitude toward advergames. However, in the low interactivity condition, low expectancy generates a more positive attitude toward advergames. Interactivity and attitude toward advergames have significant positive effects on attitude toward brand, which, in turn, positively impacts purchase intention.

AB  - Breast cancer and its treatment are particularly distressing for patients because of their potential impacts on body image. The most difficult phase of cancer treatment is usually the first year after a diagnosis. Cancer patients with strong resilience have the positive attitude, internal strength and external resources needed to cope with the disease and its treatment. This cross-sectional study investigated the mediator roles of hope and social support in the association between body image distress and resilience. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data for a convenience sample of 141 breast cancer patients undergoing treatment in southern Taiwan. Structural equation modeling was used for data analysis. The results showed that the final model had a good fit to the data and accounted for 51% of the total variance in resilience. The model of multiple parallel mediators of resilience revealed that hope and social support had mediator roles in the effect of body image distress on resilience. Hope had an important partial mediating role in the association between body image distress and resilience. Social support also had a partial mediating role in the relationship between body image distress and resilience. Social support did not directly affect resilience and indirectly affected resilience through hope. Psychosocial interventions aimed at reducing the impact of body image distress and increasing resilience in breast cancer patients should focus on cultivating hope and increasing social support, particularly support from family members and health professionals.</p>

AB  - This research paper aims to investigate the effect of utilizing Twitter in a foreign language classroom and how it would affect students' attitudes towards learning Arabic media related vocabulary. The researchers used qualitative and quantitative methods as a methodological approach to the study. The subjects of the study are American undergraduate students studying Arabic for their third semester, 11 participated in the study. The participants were asked to open Twitter accounts in order to practice reading up-to-date tweets from global news agencies. Participants took pre and post-tests, then were asked to take a questionnaire; a structured interview was also carried out along with reflections to have a better understanding of the students' attitude towards the use of Twitter in the classroom. The data were gathered throughout the semester and analyzed qualitatively and the participants' responses were coded for certain themes and then analyzed. The findings indicated that the students had a positive attitude towards the use of Twitter in learning vocabulary for specific topics -in this study media/political-related vocabulary- in the foreign language classroom. In addition, the quantitative data used as confirmation and showed vocabulary gains after the Twitter treatment. The study's findings can be applied to any foreign language and can have important implications and recommendations for language teachers and educators in the field. The findings will add valuable recommendations on how to integrate social media platforms in a foreign language classroom.

AB  - In this article we analyze data from high-quality surveys conducted in the United States and the United Kingdom that included multiple symbolic and operational measures of political ideology and psychological orientations. Our overarching goal is to elucidate the nature of conceptual and empirical connections between neoliberalism and social conservatism. In so doing, we revisit three major questions about public opinion in neoliberal societies: (1) Are ordinary citizens "innocent" of ideology? (2) Are social and economic dimensions of ideology structurally and functionally independent? (3) Are support for laissez-faire capitalism and opposition to welfare-hallmarks of neoliberal ideology-unrelated or negatively related to authoritarianism? In contrast to previous investigations relying upon fewer and poorer measures, we found that ordinary citizens do indeed hold coherent political attitudes, and their attitudes about social and economic issues are closely aligned. For instance, we observed that for five previously published ideological instruments, social and economic attitudes were robustly correlated in two large U.S. samples (with rs ranging from .40 to .69)-for respondents who were relatively low (.31 <= r <= .60) as well as high in political sophistication (.50 <= r <= .77). Contradicting prior claims, we found no evidence that support for the free market was negatively associated with authoritarianism for any group of respondents or any measure of authoritarianism. On the contrary, economic conservatism and the endorsement of neoliberal attitudes were strongly associated with right-wing authoritarianism, social dominance orientation, economic system justification, and gender-specific system justification (with rs ranging from .53 to .76). We conclude that the political belief systems of ordinary citizens are coherently organized around support for versus opposition to both social and economic forms of inequality in contemporary capitalist societies.

AB  - Background Evidence so far shows that Waldorf students are characterized by average science achievement but at the same time high socioeconomic status and high science motivation. Moreover, Waldorf education is characterized by high emphasis on inquiry-based science education (IBSE). The present study investigates if the specific attitude-achievement constellation of Waldorf students in science may be explained by the high level of IBSE. Methods Propensity score matching was applied to control for Waldorf students' more advantageous social background using the Austrian PISA 2015 sample (N = 7007 15-year old students). After propensity score matching, 1107 matched controls were included alongside all 149 Waldorf students. Results The results show that Waldorf students report higher enjoyment in learning science and more interest in broad science topics than matched controls. On the other hand, they demonstrate lower science achievement. Mediation analyses show that, although Waldorf students' more positive attitudes towards science can be almost entirely attributed to their higher exposure to IBSE, their underperformance in science cannot. Conclusions These results indicate that attending a school type with a high level of IBSE (Waldorf) may have positive effects on attitudinal outcomes (enjoyment and interest in science) whereas it does not seem to have notable effects on science achievement. This indicates that IBSE could be applied in educational contexts aiming to increase students' scientific attitudes.

AB  - Purpose: To evaluate radiologists' education, knowledge and skills of research, attitude toward evidence-based radiology (EBR), understanding of terms and use of related published work in clinical practice and the association between these variables and sociodemographic characteristics. We also aim to assess the availability of resources and to identify sources and the main barriers to implementing EBR.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 87 radiologists completed a questionnaire, which consisted of eight sections related to radiologists' demographic characteristics, and EBR-related questions. Descriptive statistics were used, and the association between EBR-related parts and sociodemographic characteristics was performed.
   Results: Ninety-three percent of the radiologists believed that EBR is necessary in practice. Only 40% received formal training in search strategies and 29.9% in critical appraisal of research literature during academic preparation. Moreover, 21-62% of the respondents completely understand specific terms related to EBR. Sixty-three percent stated that they can access relevant databases and the Internet at workplace. Research articles were only used by 24% to make a clinical decision. Almost 50% reported that they read or reviewed <= 1 article per month. The primary barrier to implementing EBR was the lack of colleagues' support. Understanding terms and the number of articles used in clinical decision were significantly related to education (P-value=0.001, 0.007) and hospital section (P-value=0.002, 0.027) respectively.
   Conclusion: Radiologists showed positive attitude toward EBR. However, there is a lack in information resources, colleagues' support, use of published literature, understanding of research terms and the ability of radiologists to access relevant databases at workplaces.

AB  - Adolescents spend a substantial part of their leisure time with playing games and using social media such as Facebook. The present paper examines the link between adolescents' computer and Internet activities and computer literacy (defined as the ability to work with a computer efficiently). A cross-sectional study with N = 200 adolescents, aged 17 on average, was conducted. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that an increase in time spent playing games on a PC/Mac was related to higher scores on practical and theoretical computer knowledge. Moreover, practical computer knowledge was higher for adolescents who liked playing shooters, fantasy games, or Facebook-games. Frequency of social media use was associated with higher scores in practical computer knowledge. A bootstrap analysis indicated that this relationship was mediated by a decrease in computer anxiety, not by more positive attitudes toward the computer. Gender yielded substantial main effects on the media literacy variables but the associations between the computer and Internet activities and the literacy aspects were similar for boys and girls. This study is expected to encourage future longitudinal research on adolescents' incidental learning during leisure time computer and Internet activities. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Social media platforms are integrated into the lives of students. Their use in education has been studied, but this research is scarce in nursing. The objective of this study was to develop and validate the questionnaire "Use and views of the social media for nursing education" through a pilot study, to describe the use and attitudes of nursing students to social media. Methods: Cross-sectional design to validate the modified scale "Students' Use and Views of the Social Media questionnaire." The sample consisted of 107 undergraduate nursing students. Results: The factor analysis extracted three main components to explain social media use for nursing education, with component 1 being the "Need to use media in my professional training," component 2-"To deepen my professional knowledge" and component 3 "Contrast information." High reliability was demonstrated with Chronbach's alpha value (0.84). Conclusion: The final tool was proven to have high validity and reliability values, so it is positioned as a viable tool to explore this reality. Students use social media for education in a high proportion and have positive attitudes regarding their education inclusion.

AB  - More research than ever before uses public opinion data to investigate society and politics in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Ethnic identities are widely theorized to mediate many of the political attitudes and behaviors that MENA surveys commonly seek to measure, but, to date, no research has systematically investigated how the observable ethnic category(s) of the interviewer may influence participation and answers given in Middle East surveys. Here we measure the impact of one highly salient and outwardly observable ascriptive attribute of interviewers-nationality-using data from an original survey experiment conducted in the Arab Gulf state of Qatar. Applying the total survey error (TSE) framework and utilizing an innovative nonparametric matching technique, we estimate treatment effects on both nonresponse error and measurement error. We find that Qatari nationals are more likely to begin and finish a survey, and respond to questions, when interviewed by a fellow national. Qataris also edit their answers to sensitive questions relating to the unequal status of citizens and noncitizens, reporting views that are more exclusionary and less positive toward out-group members, when the interviewer is a conational. The findings have direct implications for consumers and producers of a growing number of surveys conducted inside and outside the Arab world, where migration and conflict have made respondent-interviewer mismatches along national and other ethnic dimensions more salient and more common.

AB  - Grid-scale electrical energy storage technologies (GESTs) - like compressed air energy storage (CAES), flywheels, lithium ion batteries, and pumped hydro storage - will play a key role in the decarbonisation of national electricity systems. While the public acceptability of energy infrastructure is important, little is known about public attitudes towards GESTs.
   This study presents the findings of an online survey (N = 2058), based upon the Comprehensive Technology Acceptance Framework, designed to provide insight into the nature of public attitudes towards GEST deployment in two Western industrialised nations, Canada (n = 1014) and the United Kingdom (n = 1044).
   We show here that public attitudes towards GESTs are positive in both countries. Participants showed a relative preference for pumped hydro (37-40% favoured this option) versus batteries (23-25%), compressed air (13-17%), flywheels (14%), or none (8-10%). Structural equation modelling was used to identify the predictors of general attitudes towards GEST deployment. General attitudes were directly predicted by positive and negative affect, perceived risks and benefits, and trust in developers. We also show that trust in developers and environmental worldviews are significant mediated predictors of general attitudes, and that our overall model of general attitudes was comparable within both countries.
   The findings hold implications for the design and delivery of public engagement and communication programmes pertaining to GESTs. They confirm the need to employ trusted communicators, reflect the potential value to using environmentally-framed messaging, and advocate in favour of approaches that both respond to the genuine concerns of citizens and are designed to promote more informed public discourse about their inclusion (or exclusion) in national electricity networks.

AB  - Starting from the intuition that people with high environmental concern have a better perception of public transport and therefore a better perception of the utility of public transport, we construct a theoretical model in which the effect of environmental concern on mode choice habits is mediated by the indirect utility of travel. Travel procures the direct utility of providing access to activities, but it also offers an indirect utility that is inherently personal and perceptual. We approach the indirect utility of public transport by measuring perceptions of time and feelings. The indirect utility of the car is approached by measuring affective and symbolic motives. Taking into account car use habits and habits of public transport use, the results show that people who have a high environmental concern perceive public transport use as easier, more useful and more pleasurable than people who do not have that environmental motivation. Such positive attitudes foster public transport use. Conversely, low environmental concern generates non-instrumental motives for car use, such as affective and symbolic motives. However, the relationship between affective and symbolic motives and car use habits is not robust. We can conclude that environmental concern influences mode choice habits and that the effect is partially mediated by perceptions and feelings towards public transport but not significantly by affective and symbolic motives for car use.

AB  - Background
   Can deliberate interaction between the public and persons affected by leprosy reduce stigmatization? The study described in this paper hypothesises that it can and assesses the effectiveness of a 'contact intervention'.
   Methods/Principal Findings
   This cluster-randomized controlled intervention study is part of the Stigma Assessment and Reduction of Impact (SARI) project conducted in Cirebon District, Indonesia. Testimonies, participatory videos and comics given or made by people affected by leprosy were used as methods to facilitate a dialogue during so-called 'contact events'. A mix of seven quantitative and qualitative methods, including two scales to assess aspects of stigma named the SDS and EMIC-CSS, were used to establish a baseline regarding stigma and knowledge of leprosy, monitor the implementation and assess the impact of the contact events. The study sample were community members selected using different sampling methods. The baseline shows a lack of knowledge about leprosy, a high level of stigma and contrasting examples of support. In total, 91 contact events were organised in 62 villages, directly reaching 4,443 community members (mean 49 per event). The interview data showed that knowledge about leprosy increased and that negative attitudes reduced. The adjusted mean total score of the EMIC-CSS reduced by 4.95 points among respondents who had attended a contact event (n = 58; p < 0.001, effect size = 0.75) compared to the score at baseline (n = 213); for the SDS this was 3.56 (p < 0.001, effect size = 0.81). About 75% of those attending a contact event said they shared the information with others (median 10 persons).
   Conclusions/Significance
   The contact intervention was effective in increasing knowledge and improving public attitudes regarding leprosy. It is relatively easy to replicate elsewhere and does not require expensive technology. More research is needed to improve scalability. The effectiveness of a contact intervention to reduce stigma against other neglected tropical diseases and conditions should be evaluated.

AB  - The ability of authoritarian regimes to maintain power hinges, in part, on how well they are able to manipulate the flow of information to the masses. While authoritarian states have had success controlling traditional media, the growth of social media over the last decade has created new challenges for such regimes. The Russian experience offers an example of how an authoritarian regime responds to this potential threat. Because of the massive demonstrations surrounding the 2011-2012 Duma elections, the ruling Russian government suspected that social media provided a significant impetus for the demonstrations. Social media, through its dissemination of opposition blogs, could have helped drive negative attitudes about the governing party. As such, the government responded by employing strategies to tighten their grip on the digital flow of information. We use survey data to demonstrate that exposure to blogs via social media at the time of the demonstrations led many to believe that the elections were fraudulent. Ultimately, we contend that Russian fears concerning the importance of social media for the fomenting of opposition movements is well grounded. Social media can drive support for opposition in an autocratic state.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 is the causative agent of the ongoing coronavirus disease pandemic. Initial estimates of the early dynamics of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, suggested a doubling time of the number of infected persons of 6-7 days and a basic reproductive number (R-0) of 2.2-2.7. We collected extensive individual case reports across China and estimated key epidemiologic parameters, including the incubation period (4.2 days). We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3-3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6-9 days, we calculated a median R-0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8-8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

AB  - Mental illness (MI) stigma has been characterized as multi-dimensional including problems of knowledge (stereotypes), attitudes (prejudice) and behavior (discrimination); however, most research practice is predominantly applying unidimensional behavioral measures such as social distance scales. Moreover, specific types of MIs and different forms of discriminatory behaviors are not being differentiated. The Stereotype Content Model predicts that group stereotypes (warmth, competence) are linked with different forms of discriminatory behaviors (harm or facilitation) via emotional prejudices (pity, envy, contempt). The present study sought to establish how differential stereotypic perceptions of MI subgroups elicit distinct forms of behavioral discrimination via emotional prejudices. A community sample (N = 60) was randomly assigned to one of three conditions representing MIs across the warmth-competence stereotype space. Patterns of self-completed measures for stereotypes, emotions and behaviors differed significantly between conditions. The association between stereotypes and behaviors were largely mediated by emotions. Systematic patterns of stereotypic perceptions, emotional prejudices and behavioral discrimination are present for individuals with different types of MIs. Hence, generic measures of discrimination, such as social distance scales, may be misleading. Intervention strategies should consider the systematic variation of the factors involved in stigma, differentiating by type of MI and discriminatory behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: Radiographs paired with clinical examination help provide an accurate diagnosis of caries, pulp, and periapical pathoses, and reveal problems related to tooth development and eruption. Although radiation dosage from dental radiograph is low, it is one of the most frequently undertaken radiographic procedure. Due to the faith entrusted by the parents on the dentists regarding their children's care, it is the moral responsibility of the dentist to inform about the biohazards associated with radiation to the parents. The aim of the study was to assess the knowledge and attitude of parents toward dental radiography for children.
   Materials and Methods: A total of 450 questionnaires were distributed to the parents of children studying in 3 different schools. Children were instructed to get the questionnaires filled by their parents, which were collected after 2 days. The questionnaire included 2 sets of questions, for testing the attitude and knowledge of parents toward radiography for children. The collected data were tabulated and presented in graphical manner.
   Results: Among the 357 questionnaires returned, 54 were incomplete and 3 were further excluded. Analysis was performed on 300 questionnaires. More than half of the participants believed dental radiographs are safe and useful. Knowledge of the parents regarding radiography was relatively low. Furthermore, 92% of the parents said that the dentist explained the reasons for undertaking dental X-rays, but only 8% felt that the associated risks were explained to them.
   Conclusion: Although parents had a low level of knowledge regarding dental radiography, they had a positive attitude toward the same.

AB  - Background The Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) is the primary causative agent of cervical cancer. HPV vaccination against human papillomavirus is more effective against cervical cancer. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the knowledge and attitudes toward the human papillomavirus vaccines among female high-school students. Methodology This cross-sectional study was conducted among female high-school students in Jimma town, Ethiopia. Study participants were selected using a simple random sampling method. Self-administered interviews were conducted using a structured questionnaire. Data were entered using Epi-data version 3.5, exported and analyzed using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) version 21. The Chi-squared (chi 2) test was performed to determine the statistical significance between the outcome variable and independent variables. Results A total of 366 students participated in this study with a response rate of 94.8%. Only half (52.7%) and nearly one-third (31.4%) of the respondents had good knowledge and positive attitudes toward HPV vaccination, respectively. The predictors that included parents' educational status (chi 2 = 1.479, P = .003), students participating in school mini-media (chi 2 = 1.519, P = .036), students who had a smartphone (chi 2 = 2.118, P = .008), availability of radio or television (TV) at home (chi 2 = 2.163, P = .049), and students who received information from social-media (chi 2 = 2.15, P = .025) were significantly associated with knowledge of the HPV vaccine. Conclusion Overall knowledge and attitude toward HPV vaccination were low. All concerned bodies should work jointly to enhance the knowledge and attitudes of female students toward Human Papilloma Virus vaccination.

AB  - In Malaysian education, an approach to inculcate Environmental Citizenship (EC) comprising positive attitudes and pro-environmental behaviour is to try and improve Sustainable Development (SD) awareness based upon knowledge of the environment, social, cultural, and economic domains. However, will the increase of knowledge of these domains suffice for enhancing EC? The paper discusses a 2019-2020 nationwide survey conducted to determine the EC status and SD awareness. The study had 1976 respondents, and statistical analysis revealed that the overall self-perceived EC and SD awareness levels were high among Malaysians. However, correlational analysis between the EC and the SD knowledge component domains revealed low associations indicating a lack of interconnectedness between the domains. Environmental values, investigated as an exploratory variable in the study, appeared to have a mediating role between the EC and SD awareness component domains. Further analysis using PLS-SEM software revealed that values did play a mediating role. Based on these findings, the paper argues for an emerging model for a missing pedagogical link in transforming Malaysian EC through SD awareness education for pro-environmental behaviour. Implications for an education policy are discussed.

AB  - Adoption is not an event that ends with a child's placement, but a lifelong process that affects various dimensions of the adoptee's life. This study examines how adoption-related problems and social support affect life satisfaction among international adoptees from South Korea, and whether their attitudes toward adoption mediate these effects. Data were obtained from the 2013 Survey on International Korean Adoptees. Of the adoptees surveyed, 68.3% experienced social discrimination and 72.1% acknowledged having an identity crisis growing up. Path analysis revealed that negative experiences and social support directly and indirectly affected adoptees' life satisfaction. International adoptees who experienced identity crises and social discrimination worried more about their adoption status and felt less life satisfaction, whereas adoptees with more social support expressed positive attitudes toward adoption and felt greater life satisfaction. Adoptees' attitudes toward adoption were positively related to their life satisfaction, and this partially mediated the effects of negative experiences and social support of international adoptees. This study's results support the need for post-adoption services to address identity crises and social discrimination among international adoptees at all developmental stages and additionally emphasize the protective role of social support.

TI  - Informal Caregivers' Perspectives on the Mandated No Visitation Policy During COVID-19 Pandemic in Long-Term Care: A Qualitative Study
T2  - JOURNAL OF GERONTOLOGICAL NURSING
LA  - English
KW  - FAMILY CAREGIVERS
AB  - The current descriptive qualitative study aimed to explore how informal caregivers of persons residing in long-term care (LTC) facilities are coping with the no visitation policy during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Semi-structured interviews were conducted approximately 1 month after the no visitation policy was implemented. Interview questions explored how informal caregivers are feeling, coping, and staying connected and involved with loved ones residing in LTC. Recruitment (N = 14) occurred through social media, email, and word of mouth. To maintain social distance and reduce transmission risk, interviews were conducted by phone. Through systematic data reduction, six themes emerged: (a) Reminiscing About Life Before COVID-19, (b) Feelings Related to Physical Separation, (c) Our Loved Ones Are Lonely and Don't Understand, (d) Creating Ways to Stay Connected, (e) Recognition and Concern for LTC Staff, and (f) Coping During Future No Visitation Mandates. Results of this study may assist LTC administrators and nurses if no visitation policies are required in the future.

AB  - Objective: To test the hypothesis that changes in alcohol-related attitudes and expectancies mediate the effect of alcohol advertising on youth drinking.
   Design: Longitudinal survey with a 9-month interval.
   Setting: Twenty-nine public schools in 3 German states.
   Participants: A total of 2130 sixth-to eighth-grade students (age range, 11-17 years; mean, 12.2 years) who were nondrinkers at baseline.
   Main Exposures: Exposure to alcohol and nonalcohol advertising was measured at baseline with masked images of 17 commercial advertisements with all brand information digitally removed; students indicated contact frequency and brand names.
   Outcome Measures: Positive attitudes toward alcohol, current alcohol use, lifetime binge drinking.
   Results: A total of 581 of the students (28%) started to drink alcohol during the observation period. Alcohol use initiation was positively related to baseline alcohol advertisement exposure. This effect of alcohol advertisement exposure on alcohol use was partially mediated by a change in alcohol-related attitudes, which explained about 35% of the total effect after controlling for baseline covariates and exposure to other advertising contents. The analysis revealed similar results for binge-drinking initiation.
   Conclusion: More favorable attitudes about alcohol may be one path through which alcohol advertising exerts behavioral influence.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate the usability and long-term adherence to the mobile hyperacuity app Alleye in patients with retinal pathology. Methods We enroled 72 patients (95 eyes) mainly treated for wet AMD (48/95; 50.5%). We calculated changes of clinical characteristics and the System Usability Score (SUS), and personal ratings of usefulness and number of tests performed per month at a follow-up visit of eighteen months. Results At baseline, mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 74.9 letters (SD 14.8), mean age was 69.9 (SD 11.4) and 39/72 (54.2%) were female. Of included patients, 47/72 (65.2%) reported to use mobile devices daily. The retention rate until last follow-up was 73.6 % (53/72). The median SUS score at baseline was 90 (interquartile range (IQR) 82.5-95) and 92.5 (IQR 82.5-95) in the follow-up. No association between changes of SUS and clinical characteristics was seen. At baseline, 76.4% (55/72) stated that they would recommend the app to a friend, 83.3% (60/72) were very satisfied with the app and 58/72 (80.6%) of respondents said they trusted the app. These assessments remained similar among patients remaining on the program until the follow-up. Patients who dropped out of the study (n = 19) did not differ in age, gender, BCVA, and SUS at baseline, but stated that they did not use the mobile device daily (Odds Ratio 7.40 (95%CI: 2.32-23.65); p = 0.001). Conclusions The majority of users willing to perform home monitoring with the Alleye app are satisfied with the usability and have a positive attitude towards its trustworthiness and usefulness.

AB  - Objectives Adolescents tend to overestimate the extent of peers' unhealthy snacking consumption and such misperceptions have been associated with increased personal unhealthy snacking. This study aims to test whether a Social Norms Approach (SNA) intervention which challenges these misperceptions of peers' unhealthy snacking will have a positive effect on students' personal unhealthy snacking behaviours, related attitudes, and behavioural intentions. Design A quasi-experimental study tested the effectiveness of an in-school SNA intervention (n = 163) compared to a control condition (n = 95) among 11-12-year-old students. Method Both conditions received healthy eating information, while students in the SNA intervention received additional normative feedback (outlining the discrepancies between perceived and actual unhealthy snacking of the majority based on baseline data) delivered through an interactive poster-making session. Students completed self-reported measures of personal unhealthy snacking, related-attitudes, behavioural intentions, and normative perceptions (descriptive and injunctive) at baseline, post-intervention, and at a 3-month follow-up. Results Students who received SNA feedback were significantly less likely to overestimate peers' unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention (F(1,232) = 16.405, p < .001), and at 3-month follow-up consumed fewer unhealthy snacks (F(1,232) = 6.133, p = .014) and had less positive attitudes towards unhealthy snacking (F(1,198) = 8.779, p = .003). The changes in personal snacking attitudes at 3-month follow-up were mediated by changes in normative misperceptions about peers' unhealthy snacking attitudes post-intervention, which indicated that the reductions in normative misperceptions following SNA messages mediated the effect of the intervention. Conclusion The results indicate that in-school SNA interventions which challenge normative misperceptions constitute a promising strategy for reducing unhealthy snacking in young adolescents.

AB  - Background Mobile health (mHealth) has good potential for promoting self-care in patients suffering from chronic diseases. The patients' positive attitude toward this technology is a key factor for the successful implementation. The present study was conducted to investigate the asthma patients' use of mobile phone functionalities and their desire to receive self-care services through this technology. Methods This survey study was conducted in Iran in 2018. The study population consisted of 146 patients suffering from asthma. The data collection tool was a questionnaire containing items on the demographic characteristics of patients, current use of mobile phone functionalities, and desire to use them for receiving self-care services. Data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics. Results Out of the 160 questionnaires distributed, 146 (91.25%) were completed. The majority of the participants had smartphones (84.9%). Less than half of the participants occasionally used mobile phone functionalities including mobile phone calls (42.5%) and mobile Internet (40.4%) to receive asthma-related information. A significant number of the participants had never used smartphone applications (72.6%) and E-mail (66.4%) to receive asthma-related information. The participants had their greatest use of Internet search, followed by social media, to receive information about asthma symptoms, allergenic and irritating substances, medicinal therapy, and how to use therapy aids. The participants were most willing to use social media for receiving asthma information, communicating with other patients, receiving reminders about doctor's appointment, and receiving warnings about the lack of asthma control. Conclusion In Iran as a developing country, asthma patients use Internet search mostly to receive instructional information and are willing to use social media rather than other mobile phone functionalities to receive self-care services. These patients believe that mobile phones are appropriate for receiving instructional information and reminders.

AB  - Background: Surgical site infections (SSIs) are among the most common serious complications after surgery and associated with preventable morbidity, mortality, and increased health care costs. The use of surgical antimicrobial prophylaxis (SAP) is an effective measure that helps to protect against SSIs. This study aims to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice of surgical staff towards preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis in surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan.
   Methodology: An observational descriptive study was conducted among doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan in order to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) towards surgical antibiotic prophylaxis (SAP). A four-section multiple-choice questionnaire was designed and hand-delivered to registered doctors in the surgery department at an academic tertiary hospital in Sudan. The WHO guidelines were used to evaluate the answers of the participants.
   Results: Out of 56 doctors requested to participate in this study, only 49 responded and their response rate was 87.5%. Six (12.5%) surgeons had good knowledge about appropriate SAP. However, 16.3 and 24.5% of the respondents were aware of appropriate SAP in the case of Ig E-mediated reaction to penicillin and risk of Gram-negative infections, respectively. The surgeon's attitude score about the need for local and national guidelines for SAP was 98 and 100%, respectively. Accordance of the physician's practice with ASHP guidelines regarding timing of the first dosage of SAP was 35.4% while correct administration of an intraoperative dose was 42.9% in agreement with the guideline. 53.1% knows when to stop SAP after surgery correctly.
   Conclusion: Although the participants in this study showed a positive attitude towards antibiotic prophylaxis guidelines, their knowledge and strict adherence to a protocolized practice per WHO checklist should be improved in order to reduce the incidence of preventable surgical site infections.

AB  - Background: In South Africa malaria is endemic in Mpumalanga, Limpopo and the north-eastern areas of KwaZulu-Natal provinces. South Africa has set targets to eliminate malaria by 2018 and research into complementary vector control tools such as the Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is ongoing. It is important to understand community perceptions regarding malaria transmission and control interventions to enable development of community awareness campaign messages appropriate to the needs of the community. We aimed to assess knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding malaria transmission to inform a public awareness campaign for SIT in Jozini Local Municipality, Mamfene in KwaZulu-Natal province.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in three communities in Mamfene, KwaZulu-Natal during 2015. A structured field piloted questionnaire was administered to 400 randomly selected heads of households. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize data.
   Results: Of the 400 participants interviewed, 99% had heard about malaria and correctly associated it with mosquito bites. The sources of malaria information were the local health facility (53%), radio (16%) and community meetings (7%). Approximately 63% of the participants were able to identify three or four symptoms of malaria. The majority (76%) were confident that indoor residual spraying (IRS) kills mosquitoes and prevents infection. Bed nets were used by 2% of the participants. SIT knowledge was poor (9%), however 63% of the participants were supportive of mosquito releases for research purposes. The remaining 37% raised concerns and fears, including fear of the unknown and lack of information on the SIT.
   Conclusion: Appropriate knowledge, positive attitude and acceptable treatment-seeking behaviour for malaria were demonstrated by members of the community. Community involvement will be crucial in achieving success of the SIT and future studies should further investigate concerns raised by the community. The existing communication channels used by the malaria control program can be used; however additional channels should be investigated.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to examine the prospective association between life satisfaction and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, stroke, and cancer. Previous studies suggested that psychosocial factors may affect the development of chronic diseases but the impact of positive attitudes, in particular life satisfaction, is yet to be determined.
   Methods: The analysis included 50,358 participants of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Germany study in Potsdam and Heidelberg. Life satisfaction was assessed in a baseline interview and incident cases of chronic diseases were identified and verified during follow-up. Hazard ratios were calculated using Cox proportional hazards regression models that were systematically multivariable-adjusted for established risk factors and prevalent diseases.
   Results: During an average of 8 years of follow-up 2,293 cases of cancer, 1,840 cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, 440 cases of stroke, and 562 cases of myocardial infarction were observed. Women who were unsatisfied with life at baseline showed in all models a significantly increased risk of cancer (HR: 1.45; 95% CI: 1.18-1.78) and stroke (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.05-2.73) as well as an increased risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus by trend across categories (p-trend=0.04) compared to women very satisfied with life. In men, a relationship between life satisfaction and stroke was found but did not persist after consideration of lifestyle factors and prevalent diseases. No significant association was observed between life satisfaction and risk of myocardial infarction.
   Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that reduced life satisfaction is related to the development of chronic diseases-particularly in women and partly mediated by established risk factors.

AB  - This study aimed to develop and implement a customized training program related to the delivery of an integrated human immunodeficiency virus - sexually transmitted infections (HIV-STI) risk reduction intervention for peer-facilitators and to evaluate its immediate outcome including changes in trainee knowledge, attitudes, and self-reported competence and confidence. We developed and delivered a structured training program and materials about HIV and STI prevention in a university setting. The training was offered to candidate facilitators who were planned to be involved in a larger project, known as Integrated HIV-STI Risk Reduction Program. Ten candidate facilitators participated in the training program and completed both the pretest and posttest survey questionnaire. The data were analyzed using SPSS version 17.0 software package and Wilcoxon signed rank test was applied to assess the impact of the training program. Overall, the trainees' performance in HIV-related and STI knowledge, attitude and stigma scores had significantly increased compared to the baseline.. The median scores for HIV and STI knowledge after the training significantly increased from 22.0 to 30.5 (p=0.007) and 8.0 to 9.5 (p=0.005), respectively, whereas the median score on the positive attitude towards HIV and STI prevention rose from 39.0 to 57.0 (p=0.011). Upon completion of the program, 80-100% of the trainees believed that they were competent and confident in performing most of the designed sexual health intervention activities. This preliminary study suggests that a customized on-site training program on sexual health intervention could significantly improve their knowledge, attitude and practice related to HIV-STI prevention.

AB  - Background: Evidence-based medicine (EBM) is renovating the field of medicine as it is being acknowledged as the standard and basis of clinical judgment. As general governmental hospitals are at the forefront of health-care in Kuwait, the practice of EBM among physicians could improve the health of the population. The aim was to assess the knowledge, attitude, practice, and barriers of EBM among physicians practicing in general governmental hospitals in Kuwait.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study with self-reported questionnaires was used to survey 439 physicians in Kuwait's 6 general hospitals with a response rate of 74%.
   Results: Respondent's knowledge of EBM was considerably low with a median knowledge score of 13 out of 20. Overall female physicians, undergraduates from Kuwait and Ireland, and those that received formal EBM training scored higher knowledge scores. Most respondents were unaware of well-known EBM resources, however more than half (69.3%) were aware of 'Hp-to-date' and used it for clinical decisions. Most of the respondents had positive attitudes towards EBM: 88.2% either 'strongly welcomed' or 'welcomed' the promotion of EBM. Lack of investment by health-care authorities was the main perceived barrier to EBM.
   Conclusion: Overall, even though participants were not well-informed in regards to EBM, half of them claim that their practice is EBM-based and use EBM resources to support clinical decisions. Formal EBM training and integration of EBM in undergraduate programs considerably promotes EBM practice.

AB  - Purpose This research examines the influence of the learning environment and students' attitudes towards choosing an accounting career mediated by intention to enhance the current knowledge. Design/methodology/approach The online survey is adopted to test the research model of this research. There are 503 useable responses collected with the effective response rate of 72 per cent. Data analysis and hypothesis testing use Partial Least Square as part of the Structural Equation Modelling technique. Findings The results of this research indicate that accounting students possess positive attitude both towards the intention to enhance the current knowledge and choosing their accounting career. The learning environment includes educators and friends who give significant influence on students' intention. Besides, current knowledge enhancement is also discovered to be able to mediate the link between attitude, learning environment and intention to choose accounting career. Research limitations/implications - Different generations may generate either different perception or different orientation in choosing accounting career. Therefore, future research can consider wider coverage and more updated object. Practical implications - Findings of this research suggest that periodic improvement and renewal are necessary to administer to create an optimum learning environment, in term of teachers' capacity, teaching materials and supporting social environment.
   Originality/value This research contributes to any research related to attitudes towards choosing an accounting career. This study is the leading study that combines students' attitudes, learning environment, current knowledge enhancement, and career choice in one single model.

AB  - In two cross-sectional questionnaire studies with N = 1792 German and Indian students, aged between 12 and 17 years, we investigated the relation between personal belief in a just world (BJW) and positive as well as negative dimensions of school-specific well-being. Furthermore, we considered students' personal experience of teacher justice as possible mediator in this relation and controlled for confounding effects of gender, neuroticism, and locus of control. In Study 1, we used multilevel modeling to analyze the German data and to control for class-level effects. In accordance with our hypotheses, Study 1 showed that the more students believed in a personal just world, the better their positive attitudes toward school, their academic self-esteem, and their enjoyment in school were, and the less somatic complaints in school, social problems in school, and worries toward school they experienced. These associations partly differed between classes, but generally persisted when controlled for sex, neuroticism, and locus of control. Finally, the association between personal BJW and well-being was at least partly mediated by students' personal experience of teacher justice. In Study 2, we focused on the generalizability of the pattern of results across different cultural contexts. However, we did not aim to carry out comparative research. Results from bootstrap mediation analyses were predominantly the same as in Study 1. The adaptive functions of BJW and implications for future school research are discussed.

AB  - Background: Positive affect contributes to the healthy life style, which, in turn, explains life satisfaction and psychological well-being among the elderly. Existent literature has reinforced that physical activity participation influences development of positive affect for the elderly. Because of the increased life constraints and physical problems, however, maintenance of positive affect might be challenging for elderly people. Methods: Data were drawn from a sample of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe. A total sample of 3845 males and 3912 females aged between 65 and 103 years from 16 European countries was analyzed. Perception of life constraints, health problems, physical activity engagement and positive affect were measured by a structured questionnaire. Confirmatory factor analysis and a technique of structural equation modelling were employed using Amos 18 to examine the hypothesized relationships between study variables. Results: Perceived life constraints and physical problems significantly affected the acquisition of positive affect among the elderly. Physical activity was found to have a significant path coefficient towards the measure of positive attitude and emotion. Physical activity was also a significant mediator between physical problems and positive affect. Conclusions: This study extended our understanding of how the perception of life constraints and health problems influence the elderly's daily experience. Study finding reinforced the goodness of physical activity participation to enhance positive affect among the elderly. We should administer sustainable and evidence-based physical activity including interventions and infrastructure to improve positive affect and psychological well-bing among the elderly.

AB  - Medicinal research is exploring an increasing number of botanical substances with potentially favorable health effects, amongst others resveratrol. For marketing botanicals in consumer products, it needs to be determined which food products consumers prefer as a carrier and what kind of communication they react most favorably to. An online survey and experiment with 578 Danish respondents analyzed attitude towards a resveratrol product, varying carrier type and health information. Attitudes were more favorable for food categories perceived as natural (versus processed). Categories perceived as serving functional (versus hedonic) needs were significantly more favorably received when health information was phrased as 'natural'. Respondents expressing concerns about agricultural and food technology were more likely to state less positive attitude towards the product when the information was phrased as 'scientific'. When presented with a mock-up media report contradicting the naturally framed health information, attitude towards the product decreased more for categories perceived as natural. The same was observed for categories perceived as serving hedonic needs, but only if these had been presented with scientifically phrased health information. The results underline the crucial importance of perceived naturalness of product and information to consumer's acceptance, and the decisive role of consumer's beliefs. Food producers need to explain naturalness in marketing new health-related substances, while policy makers must ensure legislation allows and secures truthful and correct communication on naturalness.

AB  - Purpose - Consumers often discuss brands and companies online, but no research details how service providers' responses to online reviews influence other readers' perceptions of the reviews and responses. Based on justice theory and the accountability principle, both integrated in equity theory, the purpose of this paper is to examine how service providers should react to different degrees of negative reviews to enhance readers' attitudes, patronage intentions, and intentions to spread positive word of mouth.
   Design/methodology/approach - A 3 (review set balance: positive, neutral, negative) x 6 (response strategy) full-factorial between-subjects experiment included 973 respondents.
   Findings - More negative balance demands more effort from the service provider to create positive attitudes and encourage behavioural intentions. If a minority of reviewers are dissatisfied, no response is necessary; if the review set is neutral, the service provider should apologize and promise to resolve the problem; if a majority of reviewers are dissatisfied, the most effective response includes both an apology, promise and compensation. These effects are mediated by readers' perceived trust in the response. Word of mouth also requires more effort than favourable attitudes or patronage intentions.
   Research limitations/implications - This research reflects the authors' choices with regard to review set balance and managerial responses, which ensure internal validity but may limit external validity.
   Originality/value - This study applies offline service recovery strategies to an online review context. It also explicitly incorporates the bystander (potential customer) perspective.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate people's attitude towards providing symptom information electronically before a consultation. Specific areas investigated include a) attitudes and experiences with regards to acquisition of information related to symptoms, b) attitudes towards computer based communication of symptoms to the general practitioner and how they preferred to carry out such reporting, and c) attitudes towards storage, use and presentation of symptom-data in general, and particularly in a symptom based surveillance setting.
   Methods: Data was collected from 83 respondents by use of convenience sampling.
   Results: The respondents were familiar with using the Internet for health purposes, such as acquisition of information related to their symptoms prior to a consultation. The majority of respondents had a positive attitude towards providing information about their symptoms to the general practitioner's office as soon as possible after falling ill. Over half of the respondents preferred to use e-mail or a web-interface to perform this task. Eighty four percent were willing to have their symptom data stored in their EPR and 76 percent agreed that the general practitioner might access the symptoms together with the prevalence of matching diseases in order to assist the diagnostic process during the next consultation.
   Conclusions: The results of this study support the applicability of electronically mediated pre-consultation systems both for improving primary care consultation and for use in symptom based surveillance, including real-time surveillance.

AB  - The novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has impacted every facet of society. One of the non-pharmacological measures to contain the COVID-19 infection is social distancing. Federal, state, and local governments have placed multiple executive orders for human mobility reduction to slow down the spread of COVID-19. This paper uses geotagged tweets data to reveal the spatiotemporal human mobility patterns during this COVID-19 pandemic in New York City. With New York City open data, human mobility pattern changes were detected by different categories of land use, including residential, parks, transportation facilities, and workplaces. This study further compares human mobility patterns by land use types based on an open social media platform (Twitter) and the human mobility patterns revealed by Google Community Mobility Report cell phone location, indicating that in some applications, open-access social media data can generate similar results to private data. The results of this study can be further used for human mobility analysis and the battle against COVID-19.

AB  - Oral health and dentistry are seldom the subject of medical reality TV. This study investigates whether the dental segments within the British medical reality show, 'Embarrassing Bodies', may contribute to the anthropological understanding of oral health and social status, through semiotic and thematic analysis. This methodology involves close examination of both the visual and narrative themes within the programme. The show presents mouths afflicted by oral disease as traumascapes, the framing of which provides voyeuristic appeal. The portrayal of dental disease as negatively affecting human flourishing through shame and the inhibition of intimacy was common across the analysed cases. The key themes of intimacy and social distance; discipline, blame and personal responsibility; carnography; disciplining gaze and authority; and redemption and rebirth were identified through analysis. The cases also present a strong correlation between a lack of personal responsibility and the development of dental disease within the wider context of social class, with the dentist as a disciplining authority, enforcing professional and societal norms.

AB  - Language use is a psychologically rich, stable individual difference with well-established correlations to personality. We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain-and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.

AB  - Recent theoretical frameworks assume that the ideological attitudes of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA) and social dominance orientation (SDO) predict individuals' attitudes toward immigrant groups, and that these predictive relations are affected by contextual factors. Based on these assumptions, we conducted a meta-analysis of the relations between ideological attitudes and anti-immigrant attitudes in 155 samples from 17 countries (total N = 38,522 participants). As potential correlates of cross-national differences in these relations, socioeconomic indices, cultural worldviews, and collective perceptions of immigrants were considered. RWA was a particularly strong predictor of anti-immigrant attitudes in countries where immigrants were perceived as increasing the crime rate and as not being beneficial to the economy (e.g., Germany, Italy); and SDO was a particularly strong predictor in countries with a higher relative unemployment rate of immigrants (e.g., Belgium, Sweden). We discuss the interplay of individual and sociocultural factors and offer directions for future research.

AB  - Prior research shows that highly religious consumers are more stable through times of uncertainty, in part due to religious support networks. However, several situations (e.g., pandemics, epidemics, natural disasters, mass shootings) represent unique changes where routine large gatherings are restricted due to uncertainty. In such situations, highly religious consumers may experience the greatest disruption to life, potentially resulting in stability-seeking consumption behaviors. Three studies test and confirm this relationship in the coronavirus pandemic context. Specifically, study 1 shows that priming awareness of restricted in-person religious gatherings increases consumption in comparison to a general religious prime or control condition. Study 2 confirms that consumers with higher (lower) levels of religiosity are the most (least) likely to increase consumption, and that situational concern and stability found through purchasing sequentially mediate this relationship. Study 3 provides practical implications revealing that stability-based messaging reduces consumption in comparison to standard social distancing messaging.

AB  - Background: Collectivism has been identified as a protective factor against COVID-19 - perhaps due to increased conformity with social norms regarding prevention behaviors. Other studies have also found that individualism can inspire uptake of preventative behaviors as a means of personal protection. It is possible that these cultural orientations may promote different patterns of prevention (e.g. mask wearing vs. social distancing). Furthermore, existing studies examining the role of individualism and collectivism during the COVID-19 pandemic have frequently failed to account for other psychological processes, including differences in personality, which could help provide a better understanding of the psychological process underlying prevention behavior.
   Methods: Participants were recruited using social media advertisements. The Cultural Orientations Scale measured individualism-collectivism and hierarchism-egalitarianism. The Ten Item Personality Inventory measured the five factor model of personality. Multivariable models, dominance analyses and structural equation mediation tests were used to identify the most important predictors of COVID-19 prevention behavior (i.e. mask-wearing, hand-washing, reducing social interactions, physical distancing, staying at home and social bubbling), controlling for demographic and situational factors.
   Results: Among 774 participants, most (i.e. 60-80%) reported uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors. Higher vertical (hierarchical) collectivism was associated with staying at home and higher horizontal (egalitarian) individualism was associated with mask-wearing and reducing social interactions. Neither Vertical Collectivism nor Horizontal Collectivism were significantly associated with any of the prevention behaviors when controlling for personality traits and confounding variables. Agreeableness was identified as a key mediator of the correlation between these cultural orientations on general uptake of COVID-19 prevention behaviors.
   Conclusions: Cultural orientations (e.g. collectivism-individualism, hierarchism-egalitarianism) and personality traits (e.g. Agreeableness) are salient correlates of COVID-19 prevention behaviors and therefore should be accounted for in the development, design and delivery of health promotion messages aiming to increase uptake of these behaviors.

AB  - This study extends current knowledge by exploring the effect of different annotation formats, namely in-text annotation, glossary annotation, and pop-up annotation, on hypertext reading comprehension in a foreign language and vocabulary acquisition across student proficiencies. User attitudes toward the annotation presentation were also investigated. Data were collected from 83 non-English-majored university students in Taiwan in a 4-week period. Each week participants read 3 passages, each with different annotation formats as a treatment condition and one passage without annotation as a control condition. Posttests of reading comprehension and vocabulary recognition followed each passage. The results indicate that, for reading comprehension, the in-text format led to the lowest performance among all types of annotation, including the control condition. The best performance was observed in the condition where annotations were presented in the pop-up format. No interaction effect between format and proficiency was detected. For vocabulary acquisition, reading passages with hypermedia annotations significantly benefit vocabulary learning for participants of medium and high proficiencies compared with the control condition. No significant differences were found among the 3 formats. The beneficial effect, however, did not extend to low-proficiency participants. Participant feedback revealed a positive attitude toward annotations. Among the 3 annotation formats, the glossary type was considered the least preferred type by participants. Findings of the research provide insights on the design and instruction for online reading. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented threat to global human wellbeing, and the proliferation of online misinformation during this critical period amplifies the challenge. This study examines consequences of exposure to online misinformation about COVID-19 preventions. Using a three-wave panel survey involving 1,023 residents in Singapore, the study found that exposure to online misinformation prompts engagement in self-reported misinformed behaviors such as eating more garlic and regularly rinsing nose with saline, while discouraging evidence-based prevention behaviors such as social distancing. This study further identifies information overload and misperception on prevention as important mechanisms that link exposure to online misinformation and these outcomes. The effects of misinformation exposure differ by individuals' eheath literacy level, suggesting the need for a health literacy education to minimize the counterproductive effects of misinformation online. This study contributes to theory-building in misinformation by addressing potential pathways of and disparity in its possible effects on behavior.

AB  - People share their emotions on social media and evidence suggests that in times of crisis people are especially motivated to post emotional content. The current Coronavirus pandemic is such a crisis. The online sharing of emotional content during the Coronavirus crisis may contribute to societal value change. Emotion sharing via social media could lead to emotional contagion which in turn could facilitate an emotional climate in a society. In turn, the emotional climate of a society can influence society's value structure. The emotions that spread in the current Coronavirus crisis are predominantly negative, which could result in a negative emotional climate. Based on the dynamic relations of values to each other and the way that emotions relate to values, a negative emotional climate can contribute to societal value change towards values related to security preservation and threat avoidance. As a consequence, a negative emotional climate and the shift in values could lead to a change in political attitudes that has implications for rights, freedom, privacy and moral progress. Considering the impact of social media in terms of emotional contagion and a longer-lasting value change is an important perspective in thinking about the ethical long-term impact of social media technology.

AB  - The restriction imposed by COVID-19 pandemic has caused a great social change in the world and has affected many sectors, including the sport industry by having an impact and altering the normal development of the sport competitions and events. Therefore, it is fundamental to know sport fans' opinions about the professional championships during the confinement period. The sample is composed by 1025 professional sports leagues fans and major sporting events celebrated in Spain, with people in the age range 18-70. The instrument used to collect data was an adaptation of the American questionnaire designed by Seton Hall University. The results show that 55% of fans thought that sport leagues and events were cancelled on time. Furthermore, 92.8% of the survey respondents would not attend a live match without social distancing measures or without the existence of a vaccine; 67.4% would follow it through mass media resources with the same interest. The population group under 25 feels safe attending sports leagues or events (9.7%). These results might help to take decisions based on preventive measures to guarantee security within the sport context.

AB  - Microfinance has been addressed as a mechanism to increase financial access to the poor as one of the sustainable development goals. Accordingly, a more comprehensive understanding of the determinant factors of microfinance sustainability is necessary to implement further these financial institutions in rural areas. This research seeks to develop sustainability microfinance models and policy formulation to alleviate poverty in rural communities in East Sumba. We collect the data by distributing questionnaires to 148 stakeholders of the Tapa Walla Badi microfinance group in Mbatakapidu and the Rinjung Pahamu microfinance group in Wangga village. Focus group discussions in those locations supplement the data from the questionnaires. The endogenous and mediating variables of this study are microfinance sustainability and governance factors, respectively. Meanwhile, the exogenous variables are social, economic, and environmental factors. We then quantitatively analyze the data by using structural equation modeling (SEM) through the analysis of moment structures (AMOS). The findings show the mediating role of governance factors in microfinance sustainability. To do so, the MFIs need to maintain their positive attitudes towards the environment and implement green practices to achieve sustainability. The last but not least, this study provides empirical evidence regarding the level of adaptation of small-scale MFIs to green MFIs. Thus, the transformation process towards a green MFI can survive in the long-run through good governance support. The MFIs can oversee the process by initiating green practices and launching environment-based loan products.

AB  - Despite a steady decline in crime, CCTV usage in public areas has increased rapidly, spreading to residential areas and even non-metropolitan regions in Japan. However, few studies have focused on public attitudes toward CCTV in residential areas, and little is known about how these attitudes have changed over the years. This study examined how public attitudes toward CCTV in residential areas (i.e., neighborhood streets, parks, and shopping areas) have changed between 2008 and 2019. The study used data from two online cross-sectional questionnaires and multi-group structural equation modeling. Our results suggest that respondents were more supportive of CCTV in all sites and that the difference in attitudes between non-metropolitan and metropolitan residents decreased significantly in 2019. In particular, the percentage of respondents who focused on negative impacts (e. g., invasion of privacy) decreased, percentage who agreed with the potential of CCTV to reduce crime decreased, and percentage who believed in the ability of CCTV to reduce fear increased. Although demands for the use of CCTV data for non-security purposes would increase to create data-driven smart cities, the expansion of CCTV installation needs to be carefully considered according to the different socio-economic contexts of each region, including crime risks.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness of higher education institution as a sustainability communication channel. The theory of planned behavior was used to examine the degree to which a student's tenure at a large university with active and visible sustainability initiatives is associated with changes in views about sustainability and changes in reported sustainability behaviors.
   Design/methodology/approach - This study involved a campus-wide online survey on undergraduate students at a large mid-western university. A direct measurement approach to the theory of planned behavior was used to measure changes in attitudes, normative beliefs, perceived behavioral controls and self-reported behaviors on five different environmental sustainability behaviors.
   Findings - Overall findings support the notion that higher education institutions can be effective communication channels for sustainability issues, as students who have been in college for a longer period of time reported somewhat more positive attitudes, normative and efficacy beliefs and more sustainable behaviors.
   Practical implications - By measuring specific components of the theory of planned behavior, this study provides insights on specific areas in which campaigns targeting college students in different college years could become more effective.
   Originality/value - Few studies have assessed college as an effective sustainability communication channel despite the fact that it is potentially a powerful channel to reach a large population at their critical age. This study also measures specific components to sustainability behaviors by using the theory of planned behavior as a guiding framework.

AB  - Background: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major threat to global health and antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) are useful to limit the momentum of AMR. This study was intended to determine the attitudes of clinicians about AMR, ASP strategies, and their readiness to participate in ASPs. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was carried out among clinicians working in teaching hospitals of Punjab between August and November 2018. A multistage sampling method was used. Descriptive statistics and Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed for data analysis. Results: A response rate of 77.9% (670 forward slash 859) was achieved. Most of the physicians (n = 302, 71.7%) compared to surgeons (n = 134, 70.9%) and anesthetists (n = 25, 41.7%) considered AMR as a serious health problem in Pakistani hospitals (p < 0.001). Clinicians were agreed that hospital audit and feedback (n = 434, 64.8%), restriction of certain antibiotics (n = 424, 63.3%), readily accessible microbiological data (n = 453, 67.6%), and regular educational sessions (n = 496, 74.0%) are imperative approaches to implement ASPs. Median ASP and AMR scores were significantly associated with age, experience, and types of clinicians (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Despite poor previous knowledge of ASPs, all clinicians showed a positive attitude towards hospital ASPs. Several approaches suggested by clinicians will be helpful to implement hospital ASPs in Pakistan.

AB  - Background: Innovative surveillance methods are needed to assess adherence to COVID-19 recommendations, especially methods that can provide near real-time or highly geographically targeted data. Use of location-based social media image data (eg, Instagram images) is one possible approach that could be explored to address this problem.
   Objective: We seek to evaluate whether publicly available near real-time social media images might be used to monitor COVID-19 health policy adherence.
   Methods: We collected a sample of 43,487 Instagram images in New York from February 7 to April 11, 2020, from the following location hashtags: #Centralpark (n=20,937), #Brooklyn Bridge (n=14,875), and #Timesquare (n=7675). After manually reviewing images for accuracy, we counted and recorded the frequency of valid daily posts at each of these hashtag locations over time, as well as rated and counted whether the individuals in the pictures at these location hashtags were social distancing (ie, whether the individuals in the images appeared to be distanced from others vs next to or touching each other). We analyzed the number of images posted over time and the correlation between trends among hashtag locations.
   Results: We found a statistically significant decline in the number of posts over time across all regions, with an approximate decline of 17% across each site (P<.001). We found a positive correlation between hashtags (#Centralpark and #Brooklynbridge: r=0.40; #BrooklynBridge and #Timesquare: r=0.41; and #Timesquare and #Centralpark: r=0.33; P<.001 for all correlations). The logistic regression analysis showed a mild statistically significant increase in the proportion of posts over time with people appearing to be social distancing at Central Park (P=.004) and Brooklyn Bridge (P=.02) but not for Times Square (P=.16).
   Conclusions: Results suggest the potential of using location-based social media image data as a method for surveillance of COVID-19 health policy adherence. Future studies should further explore the implementation and ethical issues associated with this approach.

AB  - Nuclear energy has received substantial recent attention, marketed as a 'green' solution to global climate change (GCC) with calls for new reactors. However, considerable debate exists about whether it represents a viable solution to GCC. Given the complexity and urgency of the issue, a full and balanced debate is desirable. Since media play an important role in shaping public perception, we examined print media coverage of proposed reactors in Georgia-one site in the southeastern United States, which has been the focus of such proposals. We analysed the content of editorials and news articles from two local newspapers-the Augusta Chronicle and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The former exclusively published pro-nuclear opinion pieces whereas the latter published a mix of pro- and anti-nuclear opinions. The majority of news articles in both newspapers generally presented balanced arguments. Pro- and anti-nuclear arguments most often reflected economic and environmental benefits and risks, whereas informational text primarily detailed regulatory processes and financing. Findings suggested that informational text was not necessarily 'neutral', sometimes masking covert pro- and anti-nuclear content. Implications for how findings might shape public opinion and strategies for shaping media and extending public deliberation are discussed. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - This study examines the impact of message fatigue and what makes people fatigued in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Data collected with a Qualtrics panel (N = 744) showed that both active (i.e., reactance) and passive (i.e., inattention) resistance in message processing mediated the relationships between message fatigue and intentions to follow three types of preventive behaviors against COVID-19 (i.e., wearing masks, social distancing, and washing hands). The indirect effect of message fatigue on intention to seek COVID-19 information was explained by inattention but not reactance. Analyses of open-ended responses identified 18 types of COVID-related information that individuals were tired of hearing about. About 73.38% of participants (n = 546) reported that they were tired of hearing about at least one type of information about COVID-19, with mask-wearing being the most frequently mentioned (21.91%). The results extend existing research on message fatigue-evoked resistance to persuasion and provide practical implications for public health message design.

AB  - As major sport events have been cancelled and postponed in response to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the necessity to protect and provide a holistic approach to the professional athlete has never been greater. To do so one must understand the negative consequences for athletes in relation to the cancellation and postponement of such events caused by a communicable pandemic. The aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of how athletes were affected during the current COVID-19 pandemic. It will also discuss the role of athletes during a pandemic. Athletes like other celebrities can be role models. They can encourage appropriate behaviours including social distancing to help stall the spread of the virus through social media. The article ends with a short discussion on the resumption of sports after lockdown. In such a context of uncertainty, maximum caution is needed for resumption of sports to ensure a smooth return to previous high levels of training and fitness.

AB  - This study explores how South Korean individuals managed the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their daily lives during a time of continuous and sustained social distancing using 8241 Instagram posts from May 6 to June 16, 2020. Co-word analysis found two main theme clusters highlighting individuals' endeavors in daily life management and their fear of COVID-19 infection. DMR topic modeling analysis resulted in five higher-order themes, each reflecting different aspects of people's COVID-19 experiences. Overall, the results shed light on individuals' resilience in managing their daily lives despite the fear and discomfort caused by the pandemic. Results also highlight the possibility that the discursive practices of Social Network Services (SNS) reinforce hatred against social minorities and frame otherizing COVID-19 patients as legitimate. The present study suggests the need for a range of social support to help individuals and communities during the prolonged pandemic, including a long-term, large-scale psychological quarantine system. Deliberate social measures also need to be taken to promote the process of social sharing through media texts and SNS to resist hateful frames and othering of social minorities. Limitations of the study and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - Objective Non-adherence to COVID-19 guidelines is a major public health issue. This study explored factors that explain college student party behavior (PB; defined as attending a college party wherein COVID-19 guidelines, including masks and social distancing were ignored) during the pandemic. Method Freshmen students at a northeastern university (N = 207; 72% women) responded to an online Fall 2020 semester survey. Results The percentage of students who participated in on-campus partying during past month was 11.6%, with 20.3% participating in off-campus partying. Living on campus and higher perceived norms for partying were associated with higher levels of on-campus PB, whereas higher perceived norms for partying, stronger college alcohol beliefs, and a more conservative political ideology accounted for significant variance in off-campus PB. Conclusions Efforts to reduce party behavior should target misperception of party behavior norms as well as college alcohol beliefs, and take into account students' residence and political ideology.

AB  - Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak has profoundly changed the organization of hospital activities. We present our experience of reorganization of a nuclear medicine service settled in Northern Italy during the pandemic period of March and April 2020 characterized a government-mandated lockdown. Our service remained open during the whole period, performing approximately 80% of the routine practice, while maintaining it COVID-free despite the geographical context characterized by a high risk of infection. Reorganization involved all aspects of a nuclear medicine department, following local, national, and international guidelines for prioritizing patients, telephone and physical triages, deployment of appropriate personal protective equipment, social distancing, and logistic changes for scheduling examinations and disinfection procedures. All staff remained COVID-19-negative despite the unintentional admission of 4 patients who later turned out to be positive for the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. These adopted measures would serve as the basis for safe nuclear medicine services in the post-lockdown phase.

Integrating the Empathy-Attitudes-Action model with the Developmental Peacebuilding Model, a two-wave study was conducted to assess youth's behavioural intentions and actual behaviours toward refugees. Across two waves (N = 383, 52 % male, 48 % female; 14-16 years old), empathy at Time 1 predicted more positive attitudes toward ethnic minorities at Time 2, which in turn was positively related to four outcomes aiming to foster prosocial change for refugees: helping behaviour and realistic helping at the interpersonal level, collective action intentions at the structural level, and signing a petition aiming for cultural change. That is, outgroup attitudes mediated the link from empathy to three types of prosocial action toward refugees. The findings suggest that youth not only volunteer to help an individual outgroup member, but also support broader structural and cultural change that will benefit those they may never meet. Implications for recognising and supporting the constructive agency of youth toward disadvantaged groups in conflict settings are discussed.

AB  - Although previous research has shown that deliberative discussions have consequences for intergroup attitudes, very little is known about this impact during the formative adolescent years. In addition, the mechanism explaining the mechanism through which discussions affect intergroup attitudes is not clear. This 3-wave study of Swedish adolescents (N = 892, 51.1% girls, M-ageT1 = 13.41, nested in 35 classrooms) examined the role of teacher-initiated political discussions in the classroom for the development of youth attitudes toward immigrants. The results of multilevel analysis showed that adolescents who perceived political discussions to be less frequent increased in anti-immigrant attitudes compared to youth with more frequent discussions. Similarly, classrooms with less deliberative atmosphere were more negative toward immigrants than classrooms with a higher frequency of discussions, and this effect remained two years after the students moved to new schools. Mediation analysis revealed that general political interest (but not news consumption) explained the effects of classroom discussions on attitudes: Youth who perceived that their teachers frequently initiate political discussions developed higher general political interest and, in turn, lower anti-immigrant attitudes than youth with less frequent discussions. The findings show an important role of classroom political discussions for the formation of intergroup attitudes in adolescence. The findings suggest that frequent discussions reduce the risk of prejudice development by stimulating youth general political interest.

AB  - Background Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, prevention behavior adoption occurred in a rapidly changing context. In contrast to expectancy-value theories, the Prototype Willingness Model (PWM) is well-suited for investigating novel and socially informed behaviors.
   Purpose We explored whether PWM social cognitions predicted coronavirus prevention behaviors.
   Method A representative sample of United States adults (N = 738; M-age = 46.8; 51.8% women; 78% white; April 2020) who had not had COVID-19 reported PWM predictor variables (perceived vulnerability, prevention descriptive norms, prototypes engaging in prevention behavior, and prevention behavioral intentions). Two weeks later, participants reported their prevention behaviors (handwashing, mask-wearing, social distancing, etc.) and future public health behavioral willingness (contact tracing, temperature checks, etc.).
   Results Controlling for putative demographic, past behavior, and coronavirus-contextual (e.g., local infection rates) covariates, mediation models indicated that higher norms and favorable prototypes were associated with greater prevention behavioral intentions, which in turn predicted increased prevention behavior, F(18, 705) = 92.20, p < .001, R-2 = .70. Higher norms and favorable prototypes associated both directly and indirectly (through greater prevention behavioral intention) with greater willingness to engage in emerging public health behaviors, F(15, 715) = 21.49, p < .001, R-2 = .31.
   Conclusions Greater descriptive norms and favorable prototypes for prevention behavior predicted: (a) future prevention behaviors through increases in behavioral intentions and (b) willingness to participate in emerging public health behaviors. These results held across demographic groups, political affiliation, and severity of regional outbreaks. Public health efforts to curb pandemics should highlight normative prevention participation and enhance positive prototypes.

AB  - Vaccination against COVID-19 may present the most effective strategy to control current viral pandemic. The success of delivering mass vaccination, on the scale of what would be applied to contain COVID-19, largely depends on the compliance of the public to programs mandated by public health officials. This study was aimed to evaluate the perception and possible hesitance of people in Jordan toward a tentative COVID-19 vaccine using self-administrated online survey. During the study period, a total of 1287 agreed to participate in the study. More than half of the participants (n = 734, 57%) were females and the majority (n = 893, 69%) had a University degree. Most of the participants (n = 871, 68%) believed that scientists have adequate tools to develop a safe and efficacious COVID-19 vaccine and two-third of them (n = 861, 67%) believed that developing vaccines would end the pandemic. However, around half of them (n = 665, 52%) reported not having adequate information on the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. Preference of study participants to achieve immunity against COVID-19 using natural way was the most commonly reported reason to refuse vaccination (n = 826, 64%), followed by their concern about adverse effects associated with the vaccine (n = 781, 61%). In conclusion, the sampled participants showed an overall positive attitude toward receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Educational campaigns using television and social media are recommended to better inform the public of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccine in reaching a "herd immunity" based strategy to control the current pandemic.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has reshaped the way Americans deal with death and dying. Social distancing restrictions prevented or delayed end of life services for families who lost loved ones to COVID-19. Alternatively, some took to the internet to express their grief through online memorialization. Using content analysis, this study analyzes 200 randomly selected online memorials from the COVID Memorial website, a website created to share the stories of those lost to COVID-19 on social media. Our findings offer insight into memorial author demographics, how memorial authors framed and understood death due to COVID-19, and the COVID-19 pandemic through online memorialization. Two major themes emerged during data analysis, "references to COVID-19 death" and "COVID-specific directives to readers." The former, details how memorial authors framed and understood the death of a loved one to COVID-19. The latter details "advice" or "directives" authors gave to readers about social distancing guidelines and other guidelines meant to prevent the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - Brand personality is a useful tool that forms a favorable brand image and that ultimately builds powerful brand equity. However, there has been insufficient empirical research on the brand personality of Korean dance. In the context of using culture and the arts to support national competitiveness, we examine traditional Korean dance in terms of a potential brand personality that can influence the perceptions of global consumers. We look at how this brand can affect consumer perceptions of how easy it is to learn Korean dances as well as their perceptions of the physical benefits of these dances. The respondents included global consumers who had listened to or watched Korean dance music and videos on TV and the Internet, searched for and watched Korean dance videos on YouTube, and searched for Korean dance information on social media at least once. A survey was conducted over the course of four months, from October 2020 to January 2021, in four countries: South Korea, the USA, the UK, and South Africa. Valid data were obtained from 649 individuals. We conducted an empirical study by applying and integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) to the brand personality of Korean dance. A structural equation model was used to analyze the responses. The brand personality of Korean dance enhanced its perceived ease of use and its perceived usefulness among global consumers, which led to positive attitudes toward the dances. Furthermore, it led to a sustainable behavioral intention, that is, interest in learning traditional Korean dances. Since no studies have integrated Korean dance into a single brand personality to use it as a cultural asset, this study makes considerable contributions to the literature.</p>

AB  - There is a lively debate whether to consider vote decisions based on leader evaluations a threat to democracy, as this has long been assumed to constitute irrational decision-making behavior. Empirical evidence indicating that leader effects are not necessarily expressions of irrationality has recently mounted up, though skepticism towards leader effects remains resilient especially when considering voters being influenced through media coverage of party leaders. This paper studies some of the core assumptions of the 'irrationality of leader effects' thesis, by testing the conditionality of mediated leader effects based upon four voter characteristics: education, political interest, ideological distance to the leader's party and political cynicism. Two datasets are combined: a manual content analysis of leadership images in television coverage and a five-wave panel-dataset in the four months preceding the 2012 Parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. The results are mixed: one the one hand, being influenced by leadership images through the media is not a shortcut for voters who are incapable of understanding politics, while ideological considerations and other political attitudes are not completely excluded from the decision-making process, but, on the other hand, mediated leader effects are found to be strongest for voters who care least about politics. Thus, the empirical evidence can be brought to bear on both sides of the discussion, and, hence, does not conclusively settle the issue how mediated leader effects must be considered in relation to the irrationality of the vote decision.

AB  - Previous studies have shown that external threats, such as financial crises and natural disasters, might fuel negative attitudes, emotions, and behaviors towards outgroup members. However, it is unclear what types of outgroups are likely to be targeted when an external threat is taking its toll. In this study, we examine two types of outgroups that might be at risk of becoming victims of intergroup hostility. The first is the "ultimate scapegoat" outgroup which has a long history of negative relations with the ingroup. The second is the "context-dependent" outgroup which is viewed as an outgroup only in certain contexts. We utilized the COVID-19 crisis and the highly diverse social makeup of Israeli society to explore the extent to which each type of outgroup would be targeted. Results from our study (N = 664), conducted during the first peak of COVID-19 in Israel, show that higher levels of exposure to COVID-19 predicted lower willingness to aid outgroups and that outgroup dehumanization mediated this association. However, this held true only when the target outgroup was a context-dependent outgroup. When the target group was the ultimate scapegoat, exposure to COVID-19 did not predict ingroup willingness to aid them. Our findings contribute to our theoretical and practical knowledge on how intergroup hostility proliferates during external threats and, as such, are valuable to scholars, practitioners, and policymakers working to reduce intergroup tensions during large-scale crises.

AB  - Two experimental studies were carried out to investigate the effect of company size and cause proximity on consumer response to CSR initiatives. Findings from Study 1 demonstrated that, for a large company, the national cause led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially responsible corporate image than the local cause. By comparison, for a small company, the local cause produced more positive attitudes toward the ad and the company, and a more socially conscious corporate image than the national cause. Further delving into the cognitive mechanism of this fit effect, Study 2 investigated the mediating role of message credibility and explored how the mediation varied with consumers' level of cause involvement. A series of moderated mediation analyses showed that when company size and cause proximity were congruent, participants displayed higher message credibility, which led to more favourable attitudes toward the ad and the company and a better corporate image than in an incongruent condition. This research suggests that company size does matter in consumer response to CSR engagement and offers initial explanations for it. Implications and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - The achievement of innovation performance by means of open innovation (OI) is not automatic and intellectual capital (IC) can play a pivotal role. In 2020, COVID-19 challenged the sanitary systems and required to rapidly introduce innovative health technologies. By unleashing multitudes of brains, OI may help. However, the pandemic introduced social distancing that acted to the detriment of firms' IC, which should guarantee OI successfulness. This tension pushed us to investigate how OI affects IC to provide effective and timely innovative solutions during crises. We studied a company that rapidly modified its telemedicine product to provide a Local Health District (LHD) with an effective solution for monitoring COVID-19 patients. By distinguishing between OI developed prior to (ex-ante) and post (ex-post) the COVID-19 outbreak, we show that ex-post OI can build on IC strengthened by ex-ante OI and hence allow higher performance needed to combat the pandemic.

   Motivation for the study: Eskom has improved the remuneration of engineers over the years but continued encountering challenges to attract and retain them. The researcher investigated whether the perceived lack of transformational leadership caused the challenges experienced by the organisation.
   Research approach/design and method: This was quantitative study, which used convenience-sampling method to obtain 585 completed questionnaires from the engineers.
   Main findings: The researcher performed a one-way Anova test to establish if engineers from a gender and educational qualification perspectives were different from each other on the eight sub-factors identified through exploratory factor analysis. The p-values were greater than 0.05, meant that there was no statistical difference between genders and between engineers with different educational qualifications. The researcher conducted a post-hoc pairwise test (p-values < 0.05) on different age groups and results revealed that older respondents (31 - 40 years of age) had greater positive attitude on the perception of before-selection, during-selection and development than the younger group (18 - 30 years of age). In addition, the study revealed that transformational leadership mediated the relationship between talent acquisition and retention of engineers.
   Practical/managerial implications: The study emphasises that not only salaries are important to attract and retain engineers, but also effective leadership is essential, especially the transformational leadership philosophy.
   Contribution/value-add: South Africa has a dearth of engineers. The study results illustrates the importance of transformational leadership philosophy in addressing the challenge the organisation faces. Therefore, the organisation must consider designing programmes to help leaders embrace the transformational leadership philosophy.

AB  - The objective of the following study was to analyze the associations of caregivers' literacy practices and beliefs, and children exposure to screen media with lexical density and syntax development during the first three years. A total of 136 primary caregivers of infants between 12 to 40 months of age (M= 26.34, SD = 7.55) were evaluated. The participants completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, a reading comprehension test, a literacy practices and beliefs survey and the CDI (McArthur Bates Communicative Development Inventory) part II (words and sentences). In addition, children's daycare attendance was considered. After controlling for age, gender, parent's education level and daycare attendance, positive attitudes towards literacy and frequency of PC use contributed to CDI vocabulary scores, while shared reading frequency was associated with CDI syntax scores. These results indicate that both parent-child shared reading and PC use provide a context for verbal interaction and joint attention that stimulates language development.
   Impact Summary
   Prior State of Knowledge: There are contradictory results about the relations between home literacy, screen media exposure and language development during the first years of life. Also, most of this research has been conducted in WEIRD countries.
   Novel Contributions: Parents attitudes about reading and shared reading were more important in explaining language development than books quantity, caregiver's reading comprehension and self-reading practices. Regarding screen exposure, only frequency of PC use was a significant predictor of children's vocabulary scores.
   Practical Implications: The positive associations of literacy beliefs, practices and screen times with vocabulary might indicate that both shared reading and screen coviewing provide a context for parent-child joint attention and verbal interaction that promotes word learning.

AB  - Purpose To examine the relationship between parenting styles and parental attitudes towards oral health practices in children. Methods Parents of children aged 4-6 years presenting to four public dental clinics completed the Parenting Styles Dimensions Questionnaire (PSDQ) and a questionnaire on parental attitudes, child diet and oral hygiene practices. Child oral health was evaluated using Plaque Index (PI) and dmft-Index. Results Three hundred and eighty-nine children (mean age: 62.3 +/- 9.8 months) were recruited. The median dmft was 4 (IQR = 9) and median PI was 1.5 (IQR = 0.8). An authoritative parenting style was observed in 95.1% of parents. Authoritative parents were more likely to monitor sweets/snacks intake (P = 0.004) and less inclined to offer sweets/snacks in exchange for good behaviour (P = 0.04) than permissive parents. However, actual between-meal snacking frequency did not differ between styles (P = 0.43). Permissive parents were less likely to ensure bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.001) or brush thoroughly when busy or tired (P = 0.03) compared to authoritative parents; these attitudes were associated with higher frequencies of actual omission of bedtime toothbrushing (P = 0.006) in their children. A higher frequency of omitting bedtime toothbrushing significantly predicted a permissive parenting style (OR = 12.1, P = 0.009). Parenting styles were not associated with dmft (P = 0.72) and/or PI (P = 0.34). Conclusions Authoritative parenting was associated with positive attitudes regarding both preventive dietary and oral hygiene practices. Actual oral hygiene practices were more ideal in children with authoritative parents, but parenting styles had no impact on actual dietary habits.

AB  - Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a highly effective therapy for recurrent Clostridioides difficile infection. Stool donors are essential, but difficult to recruit and retain. We aimed to identify factors influencing willingness to donate stool. This multi-center study with a 32-item questionnaire targeted young adults and health care workers via social media and university email lists in Edmonton and Kingston, Canada; London and Nottingham, England; and Indianapolis and Boston, USA. Items included baseline demographics and FMT knowledge and perception. Investigated motivators and deterrents included economic compensation, screening process, time commitment, and stool donation logistics. Logistic regression and linear regression models estimated associations of study variables with self-assessed willingness to donate stool. 802 respondents completed our questionnaire: 387 (48.3%) age 21-30 years, 573 (71.4%) female, 323 (40%) health care workers. Country of residence, age and occupation were not associated with willingness to donate stool. Factors increasing willingness to donate were: already a blood donor (OR 1.64), male, altruism, economic benefit, knowledge of how FMT can help patients (OR 1.32), and positive attitudes towards FMT (OR 1.39). Factors decreasing willingness to donate were: stool collection unpleasant (OR 0.92), screening process invasive (OR 0.92), higher stool donation frequency, negative social perception of stool, and logistics of collection/transporting feces. We conclude that 1) blood donors and males are more willing to consider stool donation; 2) altruism, economic compensation, and positive feedback are motivators; and 3) screening process, high donation frequency, logistics of collection/transporting feces, lack of public awareness, and negative social perception are deterrents. Considering these variables could maximize donor recruitment and retention.

AB  - Functional foods which enhance satiety and hence offer appetite control can support weight loss efforts, but consumers' perceptions of such products are not fully understood. Urban-dwelling Australian consumers (n = 1629) trying to lose or to maintain weight rated written product concepts offering appetite control benefits for purchase intent and believability. In general, all product concepts were rated moderately for purchase intent, although products that were more likely to be commonly consumed, and that were a solid format received significantly higher ratings. Believability of product concept statements was found to vary significantly depending on product category. Compared to consumers trying to maintain their weight, consumers actively trying to lose weight tended to rate product concepts higher for purchase intent, despite similar scores for believability of concept. Age, gender and a sceptical attitude towards functional foods did not tend to strongly influence purchase intent and believability of product concepts offering appetite control. Actively trying to lose or maintain weight also had little influence over the degree to which consumers believed the product concept would deliver the benefits it was claiming. The association between a positive attitude towards functional foods and both purchase intent and believability was significant across all product concept categories, although the impact on purchase intent was largely mediated through believability. In assessing information provided about the active ingredients and functionality of the products, consumers rated as the two most important attributes that the products were clinically tested and that the active ingredient was derived from fruits and vegetables. In a broader perspective, careful communication of the clinical efficacy and effective consumption of appetite control products to assist with weight loss seems warranted.

AB  - Purpose The uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 has forced employees to use telework technologies and platforms to perform different tasks, that is, "mandatory telework". COVID-19 is a unique situation that has shocked economies and societies and led to a reshaping of the perception of employees and firms about work practices. However, due to the recent nature of the phenomenon, it is not usually understood how employees would cope with this forced change. Thus, the study aims to explore COVID-19 awareness and employees' behavior toward mandatory telework. Design/methodology/approach A sample of 201 Danish employees was selected to examine the research questions using partial least square (PLS) structural equation modeling. Findings The findings show that COVID-19 awareness reduces technological anxiety and increases positive attitudes and job satisfaction. The authors have also found the full and partially mediating role of attitude and technological anxiety on the relationship between COVID-19 awareness and job satisfaction. Originality/value The study employed the theoretical lens of job demands-resources theory to understand COVID-19 awareness and technological anxiety dynamics on employees' attitudes toward mandatory telework and job satisfaction during the pandemic.

AB  - Despite the widespread application of Autonomous Vehicles (AV) to various services, there has been relatively little research carried out on pedestrian-AV interaction and trust within the context of service provided by AV. This study explores the communication design strategy promoting a pedestrian's trust and positive attitude to driverless services within the context of pedestrian-AV interaction using non-verbal social cues. An empirical study was conducted with an experimental VR environment to measure participants' intimacy, trust, and brand attitude toward AV. Further understanding of their social interaction experiences was explored through semi-structured interviews. As a result of the study, the interaction effect of social cues was found, and it was revealed that brand attitude was formed by the direct effects of intimacy and trust as well as the indirect effects of intimacy through trust's mediation. Furthermore, 'Conceptual Definition of Space' was identified to generate differences in the interplay among intimacy, trust, and brand attitude according to social cues. Quantitative and qualitative results were synthesized to discuss implications considering the service context. Practical implications were also addressed suggesting specific design strategies for utilizing the sociality of AV.

AB  - We investigated the triggers and functions of nostalgia in consumers' processing of television advertisements in relation to aging. Study 1 explored the contents and triggers of nostalgic experiences by requesting 451 undergraduates to write four different nostalgic descriptions (of scenes, songs, events, and commercials). An analysis of the descriptions using text mining revealed that nostalgic reactions occur in response to events that had been frequently repeated in the past and were separated from the present by a long time interval. Study 2 explored the functions of nostalgia among 737 consumers (15-65 years old) using a survey. Structural equation modeling revealed five steps in the processing of nostalgic advertisements. Aging facilitates a predisposition toward nostalgia. Highly nostalgic consumers are more sensitive to nostalgic triggers. Nostalgic triggers facilitate the retrieval of past events and memorization of advertisements that evoke familiarity and positive attitudes, which, in turn, facilitates the intention to purchase. Nostalgic predispositions and sensitivity to nostalgic triggers increase with age. This tendency was higher among men than among women. We proposed a model of nostalgia based on frequent repetition in the past and a long time-lag between the nostalgia-inducing event and the present.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic era has further energized humans to consider their health more than before, especially in the digital age when they experience a deluge of health information. This study, therefore, examined COVID-19 digital sources, health message types and how the use of African Indigenous language media enhanced people's utilization of coronavirus health messages. Using an online questionnaire and in-depth interview data collection methods, respondents received preventive COVID-19 health messages on social distancing and personal hygiene from mostly interactive digital sources, which hardly infused African Indigenous language media in the health message. However, African Indigenous languages motivated respondents to utilize COVID-19 messages, though people still spread COVID-19 fake news through Indigenous media. Nonetheless, integrating African Indigenous language media into digital health communication can confer credibility on information sources. Still, there is a need to fight the use of digital media to spread fake news.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic spread catastrophically over the world since the spring of 2020. In this paper, a heterogeneous branching process with immigration is established to quantify the human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 in local communities, based on the temporal and structural transmission patterns extracted from public case disclosures by four provincial Health Commissions in China. With proper parameter settings, our branching model matches the actual transmission chains satisfactorily and, therefore, sheds light on the underlying COVID-19 spreading mechanism. Moreover, based on our branching model, the efficacy of home quarantine and social distancing are explored, providing a reference for the effective prevention of COVID-19 worldwide.

AB  - Objectives
   Older adults have been identified as a high-risk population for COVID-19, therefore it is crucial to understand how they perceived and reacted to the emergency. We examined age-related differences in emotions, cognitive attitudes, and behavioral responses to the COVID-19 crisis. Based on the Socioemotional Selectivity Theory, we expected to find a positive approach in older adults, which may translate into lower compliance with restrictive measures.
   Methods: We analyzed data (n = 306) from a nation-wide online survey conducted between April 1st and April 16th, 2020. We compared young (18-29 years), middle-aged (30-50 years), and older (65-85 years) adults' self-reported emotions, attitudes toward the emergency, and compliance with governmental rules.
   Results: Older adults showed lower negative emotions than young and middle-aged adults. Also, older adults were more confident about COVID-related information received, more favorable toward the restrictive measures, and perceived lower underestimation of the emergency compared to the other age groups. However, older people anticipated a longer time for the emergency to resolve. No age-related differences in compliance with the rules emerged.
   Conclusion: Older people showed a positive attitude toward the emergency. This attitude was confined in the here and now and did not extend to expectations for the future. Compliance with rules was high across our sample. However, less compliant individuals were also less confident in COVID-related information received by the media and official sources, suggesting the importance of providing precise and reliable information to promote adherence to restrictive measures.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Global efforts have been exerted to prevent the spreading of the disease through political decisions together with personal behaviors, which depend on awareness of the public. The goal of this study is to assess the knowledge, perceptions and attitude of the Egyptian public towards the COVID-19 disease. We conducted a cross-sectional survey about these points, which was distributed among adult Egyptians. Five hundred and fifty nine persons completed the survey. The mean knowledge score was 16.39 out of 23, gained mainly though social media (66.9%), and the internet (58.3%). Knowledge was significantly lower among older, less educated, lower income participants, and rural residents. Most participants (86.9%) were concerned about the risk of infection. While 37.6% thought that their salary will be continued if they become isolated, 68.5% believed that it should be continued during this period. About 73.0% were looking forward to get the vaccine when available. In general, participants had a good knowledge about the disease and a positive attitude towards protective measures. This knowledge is gained mainly through novel media channels, which have pros and cons. Although the government has taken major steps to educate the public and limit the spread of the disease, more effort is needed to educate and support the lower economic strata. If a vaccine or a treatment is approved, we recommend a government control over its use to preserve the rights of the vulnerable and needy groups.

AB  - Explaining negative attitudes towards immigration in general and threat due to immigration, in particular, has been a major topic of study in recent decades. While intergroup contact has received considerable attention in explaining ethnic threat, group relative deprivation (GRD), that is, feelings that one's group is unfairly deprived of desirable goods in comparison to relevant out-groups, has been largely ignored in cross-national research. Nevertheless, various smaller-scale studies have demonstrated that GRD can have a decisive impact on prejudice. In the current study, we examine the association between GRD and ethnic threat systematically across 20 European countries, thereby controlling for intergroup contact and value priorities. The 7th round of the European Social Survey (ESS) includes questions assessing respondents' feelings of group deprivation compared to immigrants and offers for the first time an opportunity to contextualise the threat-inducing effect of GRD across Europe. A multilevel structural equation model (MLSEM) demonstrates a considerable association between GRD and ethnic threat both on the individual and country levels. The results indicate that GRD is not only an important mediating factor between social structural positions and perceived threat, but also fully mediates the relation between contextual economic indicators and ethnic threat.

AB  - This article examines the reception and dissemination of 'malign information influence' (MII) in a liberal democracy; information sponsored by authoritarian regimes or other hostile actors and projected through international broadcasting outlets across borders. The study contributes to the scarce research on the reception of narratives transmitted by the Russian state-supported media platforms RT and Sputnik, exposing characteristics, political attitudes, and sharing behaviors of RT/Sputnik consumers. A nationwide, representative survey (n: 3033) from November 2020 revealed a surprisingly high number of Swedish RT/Sputnik consumers (7%), with an overrepresentation of young, men and supports of non-parliamentarian parties and the right wing, nationalist Sweden Democratic Party. These consumers are somewhat more willing than non-consumers to disseminate news on social media and in real life despite being distrustful of the sources. The findings strengthen previous research in demonstrating the attractiveness of identity grievance narratives among alternative media consumers, yet the results show that RT/Sputnik consumers also aligned with narratives that contrasts with national security policy. They state less trust in politicians, institutions, the media, news, and journalism, yet are comparatively prone to share unreliable or untrue news content on social media and in real life. The analysis thus identified a section of media consumers who can function as vehicles for the dissemination of MII. The article contributes to the under-researched problem of the potential of MII to take root and provides a basis for future qualitative research that can refine and provide nuance to the knowledge of reception of MII.

AB  - The first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia forced a temporary closure of BreastScreen Australia services. Now reopened, the BreastScreen experience has been redefined for both staff and clients and the journey to the 'new BreastScreen normal' is continually evolving in response to the ongoing threat of COVID-19 and government directives on health policy. Many changes mirror those undertaken in the wider community and emphasise wellness to attend, hygiene and social distancing. Importantly, radiographers have been identified as having a high-risk role and have had to modify positioning techniques and cleaning regimes accordingly. Beyond the pandemic, the 'new normal' needs to be one which enables well women to continue screening with a visible sense of reassurance that all that can be done is being done to ensure the safe and continued early detection of breast cancer.

AB  - The concept of fame has been associated with celebrities, wealth, attractiveness, and social recognition. Nevertheless, people have admiration for the famous who may not be celebrities. Admiration is regarded as one of the emotions of appreciation, or moral emotions, triggered by positive appraisals of excellence. It is present when seeing extraordinary displays of skills talent or achievement. However, theoretical and empirical research on admiration and its psychological effects on people are scarce. In this article, we discuss a qualitative study that explores a collection of experiences of admiration for the famous. Based on 26 in-depth interviews with residents in southern England, we explored why people admire famous individuals and how the experience may produce positive attitudes and behaviors. We found that through admiring famous individuals who are perceived to share similar interests and attributes, people may develop positive thinking about their own lives and may be more active in seeking new opportunities or engaging in self-growth. We also discuss the potential problems of admiration. This exploratory research contributes to the literature of positive psychology and has implications for furthering the understanding of people's well-being.

AB  - YouTube (YT) is the largest global digital video information and communication technology (ICT) channel and has become an important channel for companies and their brands to reach younger target markets with their marketing communications (MC). The main objectives of this research are to determine the effect of YouTube marketing communications (YTMC) on traditional and non-traditional attitudinal relationships, and to establish whether demographic variables and usage factors have an effect on traditional attitudinal relationships among the South African millennial cohort. A multi-stage sampling method was employed and 1,900 millennial cohort members (aged 18-32 years old) participated in the survey. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to assess the hypothesized attitudinal relationships. The study found that YTMC had a positive effect on all of the traditional (and one non-traditional) attitudinal relationships. The most favorable attitudinal responses were evident among older age categories, White ethnic groups, access via computer and mobile devices, longer usage length (in years), lower log-on frequencies, and higher log-on duration. Organizations should review their YTMC strategies to take cognizance of the positive attitudinal relationships and demographic variables and usage factors identified by this research when targeting millennial consumers.

AB  - Immigrants to the United States face rejection from other Americans on the basis of their ethnic group membership. Among members of ethnic minority groups who were born in the United States, rejection is tied to higher ethnic identification and less positive attitudes toward the national majority. Relatively little research has examined this relationship among fast-generation immigrants (i.e., people who were born in another country but who migrated to the United States) or has considered political engagement on behalf of one's ethnic group as an outcome. In this study we examined the relationship among ethnic-based rejection, ethnic and national identification, and ethnic political engagement among first-generation Latino immigrants in the northeastern United States. We found that first-generation Latino immigrants who perceived ethnic-based rejection were less likely to identify with Americans and less likely to report willingness to engage politically on behalf of their ethnic group in the United States. Perceived rejection was not significantly associated with ethnic identification, which was not related to ethnic political engagement. The study demonstrates that ethnic-based rejection has unique implications for identification and ethnic political engagement among first-generation Latino immigrants.

AB  - This paper reports survey findings on the Swiss public's willingness, attitudes, and concerns regarding personalized health research participation by providing health information and biological material. The survey reached a sample of 15,106 Swiss residents, from which we received 5,156 responses (34.1% response rate). The majority of respondents were aware of research using human biological samples (71.0%) and held a positive opinion towards this type of research (62.4%). Of all respondents, 53.6% indicated that they would be willing to participate in a personalized health research project. Willingness to participate was higher in younger, higher educated, non-religious respondents with a background in the health sector. Respondents were more willing to provide 'traditional' types of health data, such as health questionnaires, blood or biological samples, as opposed to social media or app-related data. All respondents valued the return of individual research results, including risk for diseases for which no treatment is available. Our findings highlight that alongside general positive attitudes towards personalized health research using data and samples, respondents have concerns about data privacy and re-use. Concerns included potential discrimination, confidentiality breaches, and misuse of data for commercial or marketing purposes. The findings of this large-scale survey can inform Swiss research institutions and assist policymakers with adjusting practices and developing policies to better meet the needs and preferences of the public. Efforts in this direction could focus on research initiatives engaging in transparent communication, education, and engagement activities, to increase public understanding and insight into data sharing activities, and ultimately strengthen personalized health research efforts.

AB  - Introduction:
   In Onondaga County, New York, around half of all births to Black and Hispanic teenage girls are unintended. The Layla's Got You campaign consists of a chatbot and social media campaign designed to increase contraception knowledge among 16- to 25-year-old Black and Hispanic women in Onondaga County.
   Methods:
   The campaign was co-created with local women in the target audience and employed digital and grassroots community building strategies. Focus groups were conducted among 31 women, during which participants selected the campaign's logo and chatbot name and created the tagline. Participants reviewed chatbot responses and designed Layla's appearance and features, and Black/Hispanic women are featured in website and promotional photos. A community campaign manager pairs digital strategies with grassroots partnerships among a diverse group of stakeholders, including social media influencers, hair salons and health clinics.
   Results:
   Since implementation, the chatbot has received 4,390 messages related to contraception or sexual health. Across social media accounts, the campaign has showed 2,483,683 impressions, average daily reach of 1,710 for Facebook and 943 for Instagram, and 32,816 total engagements across all platforms.
   Conclusion:

AB  - BackgroundHousehold contract tracing (HHCT) is an important strategy for active tuberculosis case finding and offers an opportunity for testing of other diseases such as HIV. However, there is limited data on the patient-centered approach to HHCT. Our study aimed to describe experiences and preferences of household contacts (HHCs) for HHCT.MethodsWe conducted a qualitative study in Rustenburg, South Africa from September 2013 to March 2015. Twenty-four HHCs (>= 18years) had audio-recorded in-depth interviews. We used an inductive thematic analysis approach to develop themes. We made an a priori assumption that we would reach saturation with at least 20 interviews.ResultsThere were 16 (66.7%) females (median age=36years) and eight (33.3%) males (median age=34years). Two themes developed: (i) Positive attitude of HHCs towards TB services provided at home and (ii) HHCs relationship to and acceptance of people living with TB (PLTB). The first main theme emphasized that HHCs appreciated the home visits. Participants preferred home visits because they had negative experiences at the clinic such as delayed waiting times and long queues. HHCs supported the screening of children for TB at home. Participants suggested that the research staff could expand their services by screening for diabetes and hypertension alongside TB screening. In the second main theme, there was a sense of responsibility from the HHCs towards accepting the diagnosis of PLTB and caring for them. A sub-theme that emerged was that as their knowledge on TB disease improved, they accepted the TB status of the PLTB empowering them to take care of the PLTB.ConclusionsHHCs are supportive of HHCT and felt empowered by receiving TB education that ultimately allowed them to better understand and care for PLTB. HHCs were supportive of screening children for TB at home. Future HHCT activities should consider raising community awareness on the benefits of TB contact tracing at households.

AB  - Background: In the emerging era of digitalization and electronic health, skin cancer-related apps represent useful tools to support dermatologic consultation and examination. Yet, little is known about how patients perceive the value of such apps.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate patient attitudes and their awareness toward skin cancer-related apps.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study including 200 patients from the oncological outpatient unit was conducted at the University Hospital (LMU Munich, Germany) between September and December 2018. Patients were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire on the popularity and usefulness of health-related and skin cancer-related apps. A descriptive analysis was performed with the expression of categorical variables as frequencies and percentages. For continuous variables, the median and range were indicated. Contingency tables and chi-square tests were performed to investigate associations between sociodemographic data and selected items of the questionnaire.
   Results: A total of 98.9% (195/197) of patients had never used skin cancer-related apps or could not remember. In 49.7% (93/187) of cases, patients were unsure about the usefulness of skin cancer apps, whereas 42.6% (78/183) thought that skin cancer apps could supplement or support the professional skin examination performed by a physician. However, 47.9% (90/188) were interested in acquiring more information by their dermatologists about skin cancer apps. Young age (P=.002), male gender (P=.02), a previous history of melanoma (P=.004), and higher educational level (P=.002) were significantly associated with a positive attitude. Nevertheless, 55.9% (105/188) preferred a printed patient brochure on skin cancer to downloading and using an app.
   Conclusions: The experience and knowledge of skin cancer-related apps was surprisingly low in this population, although there was a high general interest in more information about such apps. Printed patient brochures were the preferred information source.

AB  - Purpose This research aims to examine the effect of spokesperson facial symmetry on advertisement attitude, brand attitude and purchase intention and the mediating role of source authenticity on attitudinal and behavioral judgments.
   Design/methodology/approach Two studies were undertaken. Study 1 examined the effect of facial symmetry on source authenticity and endorsement effectiveness. Study 2 investigated the influence of the authentic facial cues of freckles and moles on source authenticity and advertisement attitude, brand attitude and purchase intention.
   Findings Findings indicate that source authenticity is the mechanism that explains attitudinal and behavioral judgments toward advertisements featuring asymmetrical spokespeople. The phenomenon observed is due to a proposed source authenticity overgeneralization effect, whereby spokespeople with asymmetrical faces are perceived as more genuine and real which, subsequently, results in more positive attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand and greater purchase intention than advertisements featuring spokespeople with symmetrical faces. The addition of authentic (biological) facial cues (i.e. freckles and moles) on spokespeople with a symmetrical facial structure, however, can heighten perceptions of source authenticity and the manifestation of the source authenticity overgeneralization effect.
   Research limitations/implications This research has implications for marketing managers in the selection and depiction of spokespeople in their advertisements. However, this research is limited, as it only examines the facial feature characteristics of symmetry, freckles, and moles.
   Originality/value This research shows that an asymmetrical facial structure can positively influence source, attitudinal and behavioral judgments. This research also identifies that although symmetrical facial structures dilute source- and endorsement-based judgments, the addition of authentic facial cues, freckles and moles, can reverse the negative effects and enhance perceptions of source authenticity, attitude toward the advertisement, attitude toward the brand and purchase intentions.

AB  - Background: Individuals with physical disabilities face many challenges, especially with mobility. Transportation plays a key role in an individual's health as it provides the access to critical services such as medical visits. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be one possible solution to increase transportation accessibility. However, there is currently limited information detailing the obstacles individuals with disabilities face when it comes to mobility, or research regarding perceptions of this population toward autonomous vehicles. Objective: The goals of this study were twofold: 1) to identify the accessibility needs associated with transportation for individuals with a physical disability and 2) to understand the initial perceptions of this population towards autonomous vehicles to meet these needs. Methods: A survey with multiple choice and short-answer questions was developed to gather data on transportation issues and experiences from individuals with physical disabilities. This survey was distributed to disability networks. Results: Our results illustrate the many challenges that individuals with physical disabilities experience related to transportation, such as cost, time for planning, and convenience of use. We also found that individuals with physical disabilities had an overall positive attitude towards AVs and would be willing to pay the same price as private transportation or possibly more to use AVs if it had the proper accessibility and safety features. Conclusions: Overall, this work can be used to inform decisions surrounding accessibility of current transportation as well as guide the planning and design of autonomous vehicles for a population with physical disabilities.

AB  - Over the past three decades, several studies have explored the concept of Musical Fit in audio-visual advertising. However, a central problem is the inconsistency of the results derived from these studies. The current level of knowledge does not make it possible to safely predict whether and how Musical Fit influences recipients' attention, brand and product recall, and positive attitudes toward commercials, including purchase intentions. One origin of this problem is the lack of a coherent definition and operationalization of Musical Fit. Therefore, this article describes the development of a transparent and applicable instrument to identify and determine Musical Fit in audio-visual advertising. Starting from music's function of transporting and inducing emotions and its ability to communicate referential meaning, we designed a classification system for relating music to the three most important reference points of a commercial: the narration, the product, and/or the target group. Accordingly, Single, Double, and Perfect Musical Fit can be distinguished and classified into different types. To test whether the developed instrument is applicable in practice, we conducted a quantitative content analysis of 594 German TV commercials. After two pilot tests, the inter-coder reliability of two different coders improved to an average of .80, providing an indication of the instrument's practicability. Surprisingly, the most common Musical Fit types were a Single Fit to Narration (50%), a matching largely unaddressed in studies to date, a Double Fit to Narration and Product (21%), and a Perfect Fit (15%), the type that is most difficult to create.

AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused both physical and psychological changes in the general public. The current study aimed to examine the relationship between well-being and coping strategies in response to the pandemic. Furthermore, we aimed to investigate the mediational role of benefit finding. A total of 521 participants aged 18-65 years were recruited from 29 regions of mainland China. Situation-specific coping strategies, including support seeking, personal hygiene practice and social distancing, were measured at Time 1. Benefit finding and well-being were assessed 1 month later. A multilevel mediation model was conducted with region included in level 2 as cluster ID. Support seeking and personal hygiene practice were positive predictors of benefit finding, which further mediated their relationships with well-being, while social distancing negatively predicted well-being. These results highlight the relationships of support seeking, personal hygiene practice and benefit finding with well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings indicate that besides adopting adaptive coping strategies to prevent infection by COVID-19, individuals should be encouraged to recognize benefits associated with the COVID-19 outbreak.

TI  - International citizen project to assess early stage adherence to public health measures for COVID-19 in South Africa
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction
   With over 500 000 infections and nearly 12 000 deaths, South Africa (SA) is the African epicenter of the current Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. SA has implemented a 5-stage Risk-Adjusted Strategy which includes a phased national lockdown, requiring social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face masks. Strict adherence to this strategy is crucial to reducing COVID-19 transmission, flattening the curve, and preventing resurgence. As part of the 22-country International Citizens Project COVID-19 (ICPcovid), this study aimed to describe the SA adherence to the Risk-Adjusted Strategy and identify determinants of adherence.
   Method
   During 24 April-15 May 2020, people were electronically invited, through social media platforms and a text blast, to complete an online survey, accessible via www.icpcovid.com. The survey investigated COVID-19 testing and preventative adherence measures, then used logistic regression analysis to identify predictors of adherence.
   Results
   There were 951 participants, with 731(76.9%) 25 to 54 years. Most (672;70.7%) were female, and 705(74.1%) had a university degree. Since the epidemic started, 529(55.6%) and 436(45.9%) participants stated they were eating healthier and taking more vitamins, respectively. Only 82(8.6%) had been COVID-19 tested, and 1(1.2%) tested positive. In public, 905(95.2%) socially distanced, however 99(10.4%) participants had recently attended meetings with over ten people. Regular hand washing was practiced by 907 (95.4%) participants, 774(81.4%) wore face masks and 854(89.8%) stayed home when they experienced flu-like symptoms. The odds of adhering to the guidelines were lower among men versus women (AOR 0.72, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.528, 0.971) and those who had flu-like symptoms (AOR 0.42, 95% CI = 0.277, 0.628). In contrast, increased odds were reported for those who reported increased vitamin intake (AOR 1.37, 95% CI = 1.044,1.798), and were either cohabiting or married (AOR 1.39, 95% CI = 1.042,1.847).
   Conclusion
   Despite high reported adherence, face mask use and symptomatic individuals not self-isolating, were areas for improvement. However, these factors cannot solely account for SA's increasing COVID-19 cases. Larger general population studies are needed to identify other adherence predictors for a strengthened SA COVID-19 response. While the government must continue to educate the entire population on preventative measures, provide personal protective equipment and stress the importance of adherence, there also needs to be implementation of prioritised prevention strategies for men and single individuals to address their demonstrated lower adherence.

AB  - The long months of social distance to which the pandemic has forced us have certainly accelerated the idea that the remediation of the concept of distance in a digital horizon can open up new spaces of negotiation for many social and cultural practices in the future. But it has also, dramatically, highlighted the limits and risks contained in the very idea that the experience of the meta-universe can really do without the mediation of physical reality and human direct intervention. The reflections and design experience proposed here therefore aim to reflect on the role that the new technologies and traditional professionals are playing in relation with the phygital cultural experience. The idea of the contemporary museum is indagated, questioning, however, the quality of the 'relationship' between the work of art and the user and the ways in which design can respond creatively to the demand for cultural consumption by activating new processes of attribution of meaning.

AB  - A laboratory experiment, funded by the U. S. National Institutes of Health, involved 243 U. S. undergraduate students and employed a 2 (gain-framed vs. loss-framed) x 2 (high vs. low threat) plus control group pretest-posttest experimental design to assess the combined effects of frame (gain vs. loss) and level of threat of public service announcements (PSAs) about marijuana on attitudes, beliefs, and intentions related to marijuana, as well as the relationship of message condition to ratings of PSAs. Results suggest that loss-framed messages may lead to greater perceived threat, as well as reactance, and gain-framed messages may lead to a greater reduction in positive attitudes toward marijuana than loss-framed messages. Finally, frame and threat may interact in a complex way. Further research is suggested to replicate these findings. A substantial body of carefully crafted and systematic research studies examining both content and features of messages increasingly informs mass media prevention efforts, including the development of public service announcements (PSAs). Although the significance of messages on commercial broadcast stations may be diminishing with the increasing role and impact of new media, many of the basic questions addressed by this research are likely to apply across media channels. Nonetheless, important questions about what makes a message effective in changing an individual's attitudes or behavior remain to be answered. In this paper, the authors focus on two theoretically derived strategies that offer possibilities for developing persuasive messages: framing and threat.

AB  - The rapid spread of infectious diseases is a major public health problem. Recent developments in fighting these diseases have heightened the need for a contact tracing process. Contact tracing can be considered an ideal method for controlling the transmission of infectious diseases. The result of the contact tracing process is performing diagnostic tests, treating for suspected cases or self-isolation, and then treating for infected persons; this eventually results in limiting the spread of diseases. This paper proposes a technique named TraceAll that traces all contacts exposed to the infected patient and produces a list of these contacts to be considered potentially infected patients. Initially, it considers the infected patient as the querying user and starts to fetch the contacts exposed to him. Secondly, it obtains all the trajectories that belong to the objects moved nearby the querying user. Next, it investigates these trajectories by considering the social distance and exposure period to identify if these objects have become infected or not. The experimental evaluation of the proposed technique with real data sets illustrates the effectiveness of this solution. Comparative analysis experiments confirm that TraceAll outperforms baseline methods by 40% regarding the efficiency of answering contact tracing queries.

AB  - This study offers a critical analysis of ways women were represented during the peak of protests associated with the Tunisian civil resistance campaign in North Africa from late 2010 through early 2011 among newspapers, wire services, and blogs-launch of the Arab Spring (or Arab Awakening). Theoretical underpinning includes norm theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1982) and gender role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 2002), as well as Gans's (1979) concept of social order as an enduring news value. Enjoined, these frameworks facilitate interrogation of print and visual texts to reveal characterizations of women and how the outcomes may have shaped public opinion on the global stage. Seven themes describe media representations of women among written and photographic reportage: Female Victims, Comparatively Lucky Women, Frivolous Girls, Female Culprits, Invisible Women, Women as Agentic Leaders, and Female Patriotic Citizens. Results underscore how print and wire media consistently clung to traditional female gender stereotypes, representing women as emotional, communal, and nurturing mothers and wives, whereas blog content represented women as fully engaged agentic leaders and citizens.

AB  - Around the globe, many families are experiencing significant anxieties linked to COVID-19. These include health concerns and economic pressures, both of which are frequently taking place against a backdrop of various levels of social isolation. In addition, many parents have been juggling home schooling requirements in the face of radically different work arrangements including the loss of employment altogether. Unsurprisingly, additional challenges and stresses are emerging for separated families, family law professionals, and family courts. In this article - written at a point-in-time in a rapidly evolving COVID-19 context - we reflect on key challenges for separated families in Australia, and some of the emerging professional responses.
   Key Points for the Family Court Community:
   center dot In the context of COVID-19, new challenges and stresses are emerging in Australia for separated families, family law professionals, and family law courts.
   center dot Post-separation family relationship services and the courts are attempting to assist parents to manage problems that have emerged in the wake of the pandemic; in the context of social distancing, they are under pressure to deliver responses that are safe and are perceived to be safe.
   center dot While all aspects of the Australian family law system were ill prepared for the disruption of the COVID-19 pandemic, both services and courts have been quick to respond and adapt.
   center dot The need for rapid adaptation in response to social distancing has required embracing `virtual' service delivery and `virtual' court hearings. These largely untested processes require evaluation.
   center dot Though there are obvious and less obvious dangers, we argue that the need to adapt service delivery in the context of a global pandemic is creating unanticipated opportunities for separated parents, family and relationship support services, and family courts.
   center dot These opportunities and challenges need to be better understood and managed as we move beyond the necessarily immediate responses to the pandemic.

AB  - Background: The devastating impact of the current opioid overdose crisis has led to new involvement of law enforcement officers. Training programs have focused on overdose recognition and response without targeting core attitudinal change by covering addiction or harm reduction principles.
   Objectives: This study examined the impact of a comprehensive overdose education and naloxone distribution (OEND) training on officers' attitudes toward overdose victims, knowledge of and competence to respond to an opioid overdose, and concerns about using naloxone. The training included the common information about overdose recognition and response, with added components covering broader content about addiction and harm reduction principles and philosophies.
   Methods: A total of 787 (83% male) officers were administered surveys before and after attending a 2.5-3 hour comprehensive OEND training. Survey items measured overdose-related knowledge and attitudes, including attitudes about people who use drugs and who overdose.
   Results: Following the training, participants' overdose-related knowledge and perceived competence to use naloxone improved. However, there were more nuanced changes in attitudes toward overdose victims: though 55.3% of officers reported more positive post-training attitudes, 31% reported more negative attitudes, and 13.7% reported no attitudinal change. Younger officers were most likely to report worsened attitudes. Improvements in attitudes toward overdose victims were associated with reductions in both naloxone-related concerns and risk compensation beliefs.
   Conclusions: Despite a comprehensive OEND training that addressed addiction and harm reduction and directly targeted hypothesized drivers of negative attitudes (e.g., risk compensation beliefs), some officers' attitudes worsened after the training. Randomized experiments of different training approaches would elucidate the mediators and moderators underlying these unexpected responses.

AB  - Haiti has the highest number of individuals living with HIV in the Caribbean. Due to Haiti's resource-poor environment and inadequate mental health and substance abuse services, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) may be especially difficult. This study examined associations among demographics, maladaptive coping, partner conflict, alcohol problems, depression, and negative attitudes about medications and their impact on adherence among 194 HIV-positive Haitians. In a mediated directional structural equation model, depression and negative attitudes about ART directly predicted poorer adherence. Greater partner conflict, maladaptive coping and alcohol problems predicted more depression. Maladaptive coping predicted a negative attitude about ART. Alcohol problems predicted partner conflict and maladaptive coping. Significant indirect effects on adherence mediated through both depression and negative attitudes about ART include negative effects of female gender, alcohol problems and maladaptive coping. Results highlight the importance of integrated care for depression, alcohol use and other psychosocial problems to increase ART adherence.

AB  - The number of publications on live online teaching and distance learning has significantly increased over the past two years since the outbreak and worldwide spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, but more research is needed on effective methodologies and their impact on the learning process. This research aimed to analyze student interaction and multimodal communication through Task-Based Language Teaching (TBLT) in a Synchronous Computer-Mediated Communication (SCMC) environment. For this purpose, 90 teacher candidates enrolled in the subject Applied Linguistics at a university were randomly assigned in different teams to create collaboratively digital infographics based on different language teaching methods. Then, all the teams explained their projects online and the classmates completed two multimedia activities based on each method. Finally, the participants discussed the self-perceived benefits (relevance, enjoyment, interest) and limitations (connectivity, distraction) of SCMC in language learning. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through pre- and post-tests, class observation and online discussion. The statistical data and research findings revealed a positive attitude towards the integration of TBLT in an SCMC environment and a high level of satisfaction with multimodal communication (written, verbal, visual) and student interaction. However, the language teacher candidates complained about the low quality of the digital materials, the use of technology just for substitution, and the lack of peer-to-peer interaction in their live online classes during the pandemic.

AB  - Introduction In healthcare, there is ongoing flux in expectations for students and practitioners. Establishing integrated systems of monitoring and evidencing students' development is imperative. With current trends towards the use of technology in tertiary education, online learning environments (OLEs) could constitute more effective evidencing of student progress in the clinical environment. However, there is little research exploring clinical educators' experiences with implementing technology in clinical education. The research aimed to: Examine clinical educators' attitudes towards technology and its use in clinical education. Explore clinical educators' experiences of implementing technologies in a clinical environment. Methods A mixed methods approach was taken to explore the aims. A previously validated technology attitude survey (TAS) was used with slight modifications, as well as open-ended qualitative responses. These explored clinical educators' experiences of the implementation of one specific OLE (PebblePad (TM)) in their clinical environments. The survey was sent to clinical educators involved in the supervision of Medical Imaging students on clinical placement. Results Clinical educators play pivotal roles in students' professional development and, given current trends in tertiary education, are under increasing pressure to utilise OLEs. This poses particular challenges in clinical environments. Irrespective of the challenges, successful implementation of technology in any environment is dependent on the attitudes of the users. Conclusions Clinical environments have specific challenges when implementing technology such as access to computers and time constraints on practitioners. Even with positive attitudes towards technology, a change in pedagogical outlook when using technology in clinical teaching is necessary.

AB  - Low organ donation rates are a major obstacle to the expansion of transplant opportunities in the Middle East. Awareness and opinion about organ donation affect willingness to donate. This study aims to evaluate public attitudes and knowledge about deceased organ donation (DOD) in Jordan in support of larger efforts to increase donor rates. A mixed qualitative and quantitative approach was used. Qualitative, one-on-one interviews were used to create a quantitative survey, which was administered to randomly-selected individuals over a 5-month period. The questionnaire used series of statements to evaluate knowledge and attitude about DOD on a scaling system and converted to scores (0-4). A total of 15 qualitative interviews and 500 quantitative surveys (78.4% response rate) were completed. Only 78 (15.6%) knew they could donate their organs after death. Only 49 (9.8%) were registered as donors, although 373 (74.6%) knew about the registration process. Internet (52.2%) and social media (51.0%) were the most common sources of information. The overall knowledge score was moderately high at 68.8% (2.75 +/- 1.31). Misconceptions persisted about body disfigurement, diagnostic accuracy of brain-death, and waiting list equity. The total attitude score was moderately positive at 65.8% (2.63 +/- 0.02). Public awareness campaigns (85.3%, 3.42 +/- 0.95) and regulatory legislation (78.8%, 3.15 +/- 0.99) were considered especially positive, while negative attitudes about religious importance of educational campaigns and regulatory legislation and would likely benefit from information from health-care providers and religious leaders.

AB  - Celebrities who use Instagram can influence their female followers in many ways, for instance, in influencing their perceptions on body image, adoption of healthy eating lifestyles, and persuading them to purchase products or services endorsed by these celebrities. Accordingly, this study aims to examine the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on Instagram on hijab culture among Muslim women in Malaysia. A cross-sectional survey was conducted among female university students from the International Islamic University of Malaysia (N = 630). In order to participate in the study, respondents completed an online survey and are instructed to think about a favourite female Muslim celebrity they follow on Instagram while completing the research instrument. Results indicate that almost one-third of the most popular Muslim celebrities among females Instagram users are non-traditional celebrities (i.e. bloggers/vloggers, YouTube personalities and social media influencers). Furthermore, attitude homophily and parasocial interaction with said celebrity may significantly influence the likelihood that the celebrity's profile will be visited, and the number of likes on their photos. Finally, after controlling for the respondents' religious educational background, this study found that those who had positive attitude and behaviour towards the hijab, and perceived a higher degree of parasocial bond with Muslim celebrities on Instagram tended to have a more positive perception towards the hijab culture. The repercussions of these findings on the parasocial interaction theory, and the influence of celebrity-fan engagement on social media over hijab culture are discussed.

AB  - The news media shape public opinion, and often, the visual bias they contain is evident for careful human observers. This bias can be inferred from how different media sources portray different subjects or topics. In this paper, we model visual political bias in contemporary media sources at scale, using webly supervised data. We collect a dataset of over one million unique images and associated news articles from left- and right-leaning news sources, and develop a method to predict the image's political leaning. This problem is particularly challenging because of the enormous intra-class visual and semantic diversity of our data. We propose two stages of training to tackle this problem. In the first stage, the model is forced to learn relevant visual concepts that, when joined with document embeddings computed from articles paired with the images, enable the model to predict bias. In the second stage, we remove the requirement of the text domain and train a visual classifier from the features of the former model. We show this two-stage approach that relies on an auxiliary task leveraging text, facilitates learning and outperforms several strong baselines. We present extensive quantitative and qualitative results analyzing our dataset. Our results reveal disparities in how different sides of the political spectrum portray individuals, groups, and topics.

AB  - This study examined the conceptualization of the postmodern public relations practitioner as an organizational activist who contributes to democratic processes in the context of community relations and corporate social responsibility (CSR) in India. Elite, in-depth conversations with 19 senior executives at 16 companies in India well known for their CSR initiatives revealed that practitioners appeared to be both organizational activists and agents. As organizational activists, they acknowledged the existence of diverse voices in local communities, interjected these voices into management discourse, situated decision-making in local contexts, identified tensors in the relationship between the corporation and its publics, and negotiated new meanings through dissensus. Paradoxically, as organizational agents, they used these participatory, open processes of dialogic communication to shape public opinion in favour of the organization, feeding modern organizations' proclivity for consensus. While the findings of the study support the postmodern conceptualization of the public relations practitioner as an organizational activist in the context of CSR and community relations, the agent aspect of the activist-agent dialectic problematizes and complicates this conceptualization thus enhancing understandings of the postmodern practitioner who enacts CSR within a modernist framework and navigates the intricacies of the activist-agent dialectic in their daily performance of building community relations and enabling democratic processes.

AB  - Various intelligent technologies have been applied during COVID-19, which has become a worldwide public health emergency and brought significant challenges to the medical systems around the world. Notably, the application of robots has played a role in hospitals, quarantine facilities and public spaces and has attracted much attention from the media and the public. This study is based on a questionnaire survey on the perception and reception of robots used for medical care in the pandemic among the Chinese population. A total of 1667 people participated in the survey, 93.6% of respondents were pursuing or had completed a bachelor, master or even doctorate degree. The results show that Chinese people generally held positive attitudes towards "anti-pandemic robots " and affirmed their contribution to reducing the burden of medical care and virus transmission. A few respondents were concerned about the issues of robots replacing humans and it was apparent that their ethical views on robots were not completely consistent across their demographics (e.g., age, industry). Nevertheless, most respondents tended to be optimistic about robot applications and dialectical about the ethical issues involved. This is related to the prominent role robots played during the pandemic, the Chinese public's expectations of new technologies and technology-friendly public opinion in China. Exploring the perception and reception of anti-pandemic robots in different countries or cultures is important because it can shed some light on the future applications of robots, especially in the field of infectious disease control.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding Understanding how medical students view the Specialty of Emergency Medicine is important. The knowledge helps the leaders in Emergency Medicine better plan the development of the specialty. In the medical literature, few studies primarily investigated this subject. Most were on the career choice of medical students. This study aimed at addressing this knowledge gap. Methods: It was a cross-sectional questionnaire survey of the year 3 to 5 medical students studying at the Li Ka Shing Faculty of Medicine, the University of Hong Kong. The questionnaire measuring their attitude consisted of 16 items in 3 domains: overall merits of Emergency Medicine, the role and function of emergency physicians and the career prospect in Emergency Medicine. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Their attitude was represented by an attitude score with 80 being most positive and 16 most negative. Results: A total of 298 students participated in the survey. The response rate was 64.5%. The overall median attitude score was 59. Year 5 students had a statistically significant higher score. Emergency Medicine ranked third in their first specialty choice after qualification. There was no statistical relationship between a student's attitude score and the specialty choice. Conclusion: The students' overall attitude towards Emergency Medicine was positive. Senior students held a more positive attitude. A student's specialty choice after qualification did not seem to relate to their attitude towards the specialty.

AB  - In modern educational practices, the issue of dependence on the experience of using multimedia by students and the adoption of technologies in education, the perception of their benefits and effectiveness in blended learning is little covered. The purpose of the academic paper lies in assessing the audiovisual context of multimedia technologies, its acceptance by students in practice on the example of using video lectures in blended learning. The methodology is based on an online survey of 120 students of Ukrainian universities who have assessed the experience level in using video lectures, as well as the constructs as follows: Technology Characteristics, Fit, Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, Attitude, Intention to Use, Actual Use. The results show that the majority of students use video lectures to a certain extent in their training (20,8% have used technology to a certain extent, 49,2% have often used technology in training, 20% are regular users of technology). It has been revealed that most students agree with the relevance of video lectures, the accuracy of lectures, the brevity of lectures, the clarity of lectures, as well as the high quality of lecture videos. It has been estimated that 42,5% believe that lecture videos are an effective tool towards supporting students in hybrid learning. 26,7% of students consider video lectures to be appropriate technologies for online / hybrid courses. In general, 37,5% of respondents find video lectures useful; however, 35,0% do not agree with this statement. 83,3% of students have rated the high level of ease of access to video. In total, 95% of students find lecture videos easy to use. In general, positive attitude of students to video lectures has been revealed.

AB  - Purpose: The main aim of this article is to verify by applied field research the relationship between the e-service quality provided by the travel youtubers and the e-relationship quality with the users, formed by trust, satisfaction and commitment.
   Design/methodology/approach: For the theoretical framework and the creation of the hypothesis there was used a literature review that is focused on travel youtubers, relationship marketing and service quality online. For confirmation of the hypothesis there was applied a quantitative survey technique to 1245 sample units.
   Findings: Dimensions of information and communication, that are part of the quality of the service, are the ones that affect the most in the development of the quality of the relation. As a consequence, travel youtubers have to develop a strategy that includes all kinds of actions of content creation in order to grow their notoriety while not selling any sort of product or service. Hence, the quality of the relation must be defined as a multi-dimensional construct with a superior order formed by trust, satisfaction and commitment as main dimensions that may be influenced (antecedent) or may be admitted of other dimensions (consequents), having them put through clients and users. Therefore, travel youtubers must create among their followers a positive attitude towards themselves. Attitude is formed by cognitive elements (trust), affective elements (satisfaction) and conative elements (commitment).
   Originality/value: This research paper offers theoretical framework confirmed by a field study for measuring quality relationship online by users and travel youtubers and identifies which are the dimensions that form the user's attitude. These attitudes will be transformed into behaviors such as the repetition of purchase and the development of positive word-of-mouth communication.

AB  - Objective The effectiveness of the national drug safety monitoring program directly depends on the active participation of healthcare professionals in reporting suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The aim of the study was to explore community pharmacists' comprehension of pharmacovigilance, their perspectives toward reporting ADRs and investigate the current practice of ADR reporting among pharmacists in Serbia. Methods This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on a sample of pharmacists in Serbia between November 2019 and March 2020 using a pre-tested questionnaire distributed online. Eligible participants were community pharmacists in Serbia who were willing to participate in the study during the data collection period. Non-parametric statistical tests were performed in the analysis of knowledge, perspectives and ADR reporting. The validity and reliability of the survey were measured by exploratory factor analysis. Results The median knowledge score was 6 out of 10 (interquartile range 5-7, range 2-10). No significant differences in the knowledge scores of pharmacists were found based on weekly working hours (U = 24,805, p = .374), working experience (chi(2) = 4.011, DF = 2, p = .135), being a member of a professional organization (U = 24,312, p = .209), or highest level of pharmacy qualification obtained (chi(2) = 3.233, DF = 3, p = .506). Only 28.8% of pharmacists reported ADR at least once a year, while the majority of them have never reported any ADRs. Conclusions Despite the community pharmacists' positive attitude toward adverse drug reporting and their role in the process, they show limited knowledge regarding the issue and highly prevalent under-reporting of ADRs. Educational programs are necessary to increase ADRs reporting.

AB  - Purpose Outsourcing of accounting increasingly attracts research interest, but research concerning the impact of the benefits of outsourcing on firm capabilities and performance across firms remains limited. This paper aims to reveal the unobservable latent classes of firms that outsource their accounting functions by testing a research model concerning the topic. Design/methodology/approach The authors build on accounting outsourcing research and adapt a research model from the literature on business services outsourcing. The authors analyze the data from 261 small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe using finite mixture structural equation modeling (FMSEM) and additional methods. Findings The authors reveal three latent classes with different research models. Thriving outsourcers (N = 103) have a positive attitude toward accounting outsourcing and associate competitive capabilities with mediating the relationship from outsourcing benefits to firm performance. Annoyed outsourcers (N = 143) are dissatisfied with their accounting service provider and only associate outsourcing benefits with competitive capabilities. Convenient outsourcers (N = 15) feel comfortable with their current accounting service provider and associate outsourcing benefits with neither capabilities nor with firm performance. Research limitations/implications The study initiates the discussion about the unobservable heterogeneity among accounting outsourcers. The study introduces the use of the FMSEM method in accounting outsourcing research. Practical implications The study offers novel insights concerning accounting outsourcers and proposes original explanations for their outsourcing decisions that would help both the outsourcers and accounting service providers. Originality/value The study might be the first to categorize accounting outsourcers using FMSEM.

T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - Despite the fact that mobile phones have been transformed over the last decade into information and communication hubs that are fundamental to modern life, there is little information on how this has impacted on mobile phone use while driving. The present study was conducted in Ukraine, where this risky behaviour remains a common driving practice, despite legislative bans. A total of 220 (male = 82%; mean age = 35.53; SD = 10.54) drivers completed an online survey assessing frequency of engaging in a range of mobile phone applications while driving. Four variables of the theory of planned behaviour (general attitude and intention towards phone use while driving, social norms towards mobile phone use, perceived behavioural control, the specific beliefs about being able to engage in distracting activities and drive safely), and type A behaviour pattern were also collected. The results showed that, during the last year, 65% of drivers had read a text message and 49% had written a text using mobile phone applications. Likewise, a substantial proportion of the sample reported using social media while driving, by checking (34%), sending or typing a post (25%) on social network applications. Hierarchical stepwise regressions showed that a positive attitude towards mobile phone use while driving and beliefs about being able to drive safely and write or read a text message were significantly associated with the mobile phone applications use while driving. No associations were found between the type A behaviour pattern and mobile phone applications use.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is growing recognition of the role of mobile learning (M-learning) for undergraduate (UG) academic education and teaching purposes, but teacher attitudes toward it can be variable.
   OBJECTIVE: To determine the attitudes toward the incorporation of M-learning methods for UG medical education among resident doctors at a government medical college in Delhi, India.\
   METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted for 3-months duration (2019) among 60 final year junior and senior resident doctors. The participants were selected from all the preclinical and paraclinical department, and one clinical department selected randomly based on the probability proportion to size method. The data was collected using self-administered instruments including the modified 20-item M-learning Perception Scale (MLPS).
   RESULTS: Social media (36.7%) and instant messaging platforms (85%) were routinely used by the participants for exchanging academic (medical) and health-related information. The mean score for all the MLPS item responses was >3, indicating positive attitudes toward M-Learning. The participants expressed maximum agreement with the views stating M-Learning can "supplement traditional teaching," was "reliable for personal use," and "improves the quality of lessons." The responses of those participants having preexisting familiarity with health information and education portals, and those aware of massive open online courses correlated significantly with higher MLPS scores.
   CONCLUSION: M-learning is visualized as an increasingly relevant teaching and learning medium by early-career resident doctors involved in UG medical education in India.

AB  - Extreme partisan animosity has been on the rise in the US and is prevalent around the world. This hostility is typically attributed to social group identity, motivated reasoning, or a combination thereof. In this paper, I empirically examine a novel contributing factor: the "unmotivated" cognitive bias of overprecision (over-confidence in precision of beliefs). Overprecision could cause partisan hostility indirectly via inflated confidence in one's own ideology, partisan identity, or perceptions of social distance between the parties. Overprecision could also cause this hostility directly by causing excessively strong inferences from observed information that is either skewed against the out-party or simply misunderstood. Using a nationally representative sample, I find consistent support for direct effects of overprecision and mixed support for indirect effects. The point estimates imply a one standard deviation increase in a respondent's overprecision predicts as much as a 0.71 standard deviation decline in relative out-party favorability.

AB  - The aim of this study is to identify combinations of different personality traits among teaching faculty and explore for which combinations college managers should use change leadership to mediate their cognition in a motivation mechanism and for which combinations doing so is not necessary. In this study, two-stage cluster analysis and partial least squares are the methods for identifying different combinations of personality traits and test mediation. This study uses 350 samples for analysis. From the test results, this study first identifies three combinations of personality traits, including "high central force but outgoing", "middle-high central force but outgoing and a little nervousness", and "synthesizing type". The "highly central force but outgoing" and "middle-high central force but outgoing and a little nervousness" do not need to be mediated by change leadership, and teaching faculty who have these two combinations of personality traits will have positive attitudes or thoughts towards the motivation mechanism. Regarding the "synthesizing type", those with this combination of personality traits will demonstrate complex attitudes, reactions, or thinking, and therefore, college managers should think about how to change their attitudes or behaviour through change leadership to communicate and guide them to accept the motivation mechanism.

AB  - COVID-19 has required researchers to change methods to better reflect the new realities of social distancing, sheltering in place, and the use of extended quarantines to isolate from the community. The paper illustrates the implications of shifting recruitment strategies midstream with populations that are already normally considered 'hard-to-reach'. The population in this illustration involves mothers with young children in shared parenting arrangements across three Canadian provinces (Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario) who have experienced domestic violence. Due to public health protocols that required social distancing, strategies typically used to engage vulnerable populations in research, including collaborating with community service providers and face-to-face contact were no longer possible. With limited knowledge and resources, we pivoted our recruitment strategy from the use of posters in agencies to a paid Facebook advertisement strategy. Prior to our social media campaign, our time-intensive recruitment efforts had produced very few responses to our online survey. Our advertisement ran from March 13 to 12 July 2020 and Facebook reported that it 'reached' an approximate 42,488 viewers Through Facebook, we discovered a number of support groups for mothers with young children that only exist online. Rather than putting up posters in their settings, community service providers became online recruiters through their 'tweets', 'likes', and 'sharing' of our study. The impact of COVID-19 on our research has taught us about the power of social media as a recruitment strategy. Facebook is a useful tool to enhance research awareness and engagement with hard-to-reach populations even post COVID-19.

TI  - Religiosity predicts negative attitudes towards science and lower levels of science literacy
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - BELIEFS
AB  - Past research suggests that religion and science may conflict on which is a better tool for explaining the world. This conflict implies that religiosity might negatively impact both attitudes toward science and science knowledge. However, past research has focused mostly on religious affiliation and has not consistently identified such a relation using a general religiosity measure that assesses religious beliefs and religious practice. Using two large, nationally representative datasets as well as two original datasets, and controlling for relevant demographic variables, four studies (N = 9,205) showed that general measures of religiosity are negatively associated with science knowledge, a relation that was partially mediated by an association between religiosity and negative attitudes toward science. Study 2 also showed that parents' reports about their religiosity and its role in their children's upbringing predicted, some 20 years later, their children's attitudes toward science. The studies are correlational but the longitudinal relations in Study 2 suggests that religiosity might undermine science literacy.

AB  - Background: Dental professionals can play a pivotal role in educating the public about the harmful effects of smoking and encouraging them to quit the habit. Aim: This study assesses the attitudes and practices of tobacco cessation counseling (TCC) among dental professionals in Saudi Arabia. Patients and Methods: This questionnaire-based cross-sectional study targeted dentists and dental interns working in government and private sectors in Saudi Arabia. We conducted a descriptive analysis by using SPSS Statistics, version 25.0. Results: A total of 895 respondents (314 interns and 581 dentists) participated in this survey. Although the majority of respondents (93%) reported that they always ask patients about tobacco habits, only 59% reported recording tobacco habits in patients' files, and only 55% of the respondents reported explaining to patients the harmful effects of tobacco. Around 91% of the participants believe that a dental clinic is an appropriate place for TCC, and 22% believe that TCC has a negative impact on dental practice. Smoking status, work setting, and the number of years since graduation were found to be significantly associated with the respondents' attitudes and practices. Lack of training, time limitations, and lack of confidence were barriers for TCC. Conclusions: Dental professionals in Saudi Arabia demonstrated relatively positive attitudes but weak practices of TCC. Continuous education and motivation are needed to improve dentists' confidence, attitudes, and willingness for TCC. Integration of tobacco control education in undergraduate curricula is recommended.

AB  - MorphoDent, a computer-assisted learning program designed to teach the anatomy of the adult dentition, was introduced into the curriculum of dentistry at the University of Saarland in Homburg, Germany. Thirty-six second-year students of the School of Dentistry were introduced to morphoDent alongside the traditional lectures of dental anatomy. Questionnaires that evaluated the students' perceptions of virtual learning as well as aspects of the functionality of the program educational objectives were developed and distributed to the students. Online tests were performed and compared with a traditional examination. All questionnaires were returned. A wide variety of aspects dealing the pedagogic implications of e-learning were evaluated by the students, with the overall result being that students are aware of the needed hardware and technical skills and expect the quality of their studies to improve by implementation of e-learning. All sophomores except one felt that morphoDent had helped them in learning dental morphology and reported enjoying the virtual anatomical examination. One-third reported technical difficulties in operating the program. The average exam score was 2.53 (SD: 0.66) for the traditional and 2.23 (SD: 0.59) for the online dental anatomy test. Students expressed their positive attitude towards e-learning in general and indicated that the use of photorealistic 3D models of human teeth supported the process of individual learning of dental anatomy. The online test could be rated as a good option for students' self-performance rating.

AB  - Heavy dependence on fossil fuels among rural households contributes to GHG emissions and air pollution while increasing landfill loads in Poland. This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences.

AB  - Purpose - In the past two decades, the problem of gender disparities in the use of internet has attracted a remarkable interest of researchers. Several studies revealed that female internet users were the disadvantaged group than males, because they had not the same access, experience and use frequency regarding the internet use. Moreover, the negative attitude of the society towards the females' internet use also made them disadvantaged group. Prompted by these observations, this paper aims to examine gender differences in the use of internet among graduate students of a developing society - in public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
   Design/methodology/approach - Quantitative research design using a questionnaire was used for data collection. Data were analyzed through SPSS version 20.0 by using descriptive and inferential statistics.
   Findings - The findings of this study, similar to previous studies, revealed differences among men and women. Majority of men possessed PCs and were more experienced than women. In addition, they were more skilled and faced problems of computer anxiety and distance with less intensity than women. In addition, women used internet mainly for social interaction, communication, entertainment and were more satisfied with some of the educational resources than men. However, men were more satisfied than women regarding the use of most educational internet resources and spent more time on these than women.
   Originality/value - This is the first study in Pakistan that deals with gender differences in the use of internet among graduate students of a developing society - in public sector universities of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.

AB  - Recent work has suggested that media reporting about the public's policy preferences may be self-reinforcing, contributing to greater policy conformity. This article presents additional evidence in support of this theory and adds new detail about the conditionality of these effects. Results from two experiments are described in which respondents are presented with excerpted news stories containing varying polling information about six separate issues. Findings indicate that (a) exposure to such poll results can elicit differences in support for the issue by as much as 10-15 percentage points; (b) the magnitude of these effects varies systematically and inversely in relation to overall attitudinal intensity levels for each issue; and (c) the opinions of specific subgroups referenced in polls matter, producing larger or smaller effects depending on how salient the group is to receivers of the information. Taken together, these results underscore why news reporting about public attitudes deserves greater attention as an important factor in the policy process.

AB  - The first case of a novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) was diagnosed in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and the outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 March 2020. By the end of March 2020, 136 countries had positive COVID-19 cases. Meanwhile, in response to the virus, countries instigated various forms of 'lock-downs' and social distancing measures. Globally, children and adolescents could not meet and play or hang out with their friends as they did pre-pandemic. These changes essentially drove children (4-18 years) indoors for their play and recreation needs, instigating significant changes in the lives and day-to-day routines of children almost simultaneously in and across national borders. To understand the impact of these changes to children's play worlds and friendship groups, an online questionnaire was developed for children and parents and rolled out in Ireland, Italy, the United States, and England during the summer of 2020 following ethical approvals. The questionnaire consisted of qualitative (open ended) and quantitative (closed) questions and this paper focuses on the changes to children's (4-18 years) indoor play. We found that the various 'lock-downs' and social distancing measures created largely similar impacts on play behaviors and activities in each developed country, irrespective of culture, the globally did indeed become 'local'. Moreover, playing in 'safe settings' such as the home environment, may have helped to build resilience and to enhance protective factors in children's lives as opposed to a demonstration of global homogeneity [merriam-webster.com]. The impact of 'lock-downs' may counter-intuitively have reduced opportunities for cooperative play and parents' mediation of play due to increased parental responsibilities (working from home, home schooling) which reduced the time available to spend with children in non-school activities, including play.

AB  - Individuals' attitudes toward evidence-based practices (EBP) are critical in adopting, implementing and maintaining the EBP in clinical settings. Multiple empirical studies have examined how work context may shape perceptions and attitudes towards EBP. The current study aims to further explore how both work and family contexts, as assessed by three psychosocial indicators (i.e., occupational stress, work-related social support from coworkers, and work-related social support from family), may affect attitudes toward EBP among health care providers in HIV clinics in China. We analyzed cross-sectional survey data from 357 health care providers recruited from 40 HIV clinics across 16 cities/counties in Guangxi China. Structural equation model (SEM) was constructed to test the hypothesized relationships among key study variables. Occupational stress was negatively associated with workrelated social support from coworkers (beta = -.19, 95%CI = [-.31 ,-.12]), which in turn was positively associated with attitudes toward EBP (beta = .17, 95%CI = [.04, .30]). Similarly, occupational stress was negatively related to work-related social support from family (beta = -.34, 95% CI = [-.42,-.25]), which in turn was positively related to attitudes toward EBP (beta = .23, 95%CI = [.12, .35]). Occupational stress was negatively associated with attitudes toward EBP, but the magnitude of association did not reach statistical significance at alpha = .05. Work-related social support from family partially mediated the association between occupational stress and attitudes toward EBP (Sobel's z = 3.27, p < .05). Our findings suggest the importance of integrating work and family contexts, especially family support into the strategies of facilitating the adoption and implementation of EBP. The current study also underscores the needs to reduce occupational stress and enhance work-related social support among health care providers who are in frequent contact with HIV patients. In addition, lack of work-related family support may be a main barrier preventing health care providers from developing a positive attitude toward EBP. Therefore, the interventions aiming for promoting adoption and utilization of EBP need to involve specific strategies to resolve work-family conflicts and improve family members' understanding and support for health care providers in China, especially those who work in a stressful work context such as HIV care.

AB  - This research investigated judgements of moral responsibility for attitude-based discrimination, testing whether a wrongdoer's mental states - awareness and foresight - are central determinants of culpability. Participants read about and judged a target person who was described as consciously egalitarian, but harbouring negative attitudes that lead him to treat African Americans unfairly. Two studies showed that participants ascribed greater moral responsibility for discrimination when the target was aware of having negative attitudes than when he was unaware. Surprisingly, moral judgements were equally harsh towards a target who was explicitly aware that his bias could influence his behaviour as a target who was not. To explain this result, a second study showed that the path from awareness to moral responsibility was mediated by perceptions that the target had an obligation to foresee his discriminatory behaviour, but not by perceptions of the target's actual foresight. These results suggest that bias awareness influences moral judgements of those who engage in attitude-based discrimination because it obligates them to foresee harmful consequences. The current findings demonstrate that moral judges consider not just descriptive facts, but also normative standards regarding a wrongdoer's mental states.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to understand how perceived micro-celebrity-product image congruency and product type affect native advertising effectiveness on Instagram. Additionally, the study aims to understand how advertising skepticism and persuasion knowledge affect the effectiveness of native advertising featuring micro-celebrity.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This study was administered online using a 2 (product type: high self-expressive vs low self-expressive) x 2 (micro-celebrity and product congruity: congruent vs incongruent) between-subjects factorial design to test the hypotheses. A total of 186 participants, all Instagram users living in the USA, were recruited using an Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). After screening out 14 respondents who were not Instagram users or did not fully answer the questions, a total sample of 172 valid and complete responses were included for hypotheses testing.
   Findings
   The results revealed that when native advertising featured highly self-expressive products and micro-celebrities with good product image fit, consumers had a more positive attitude toward the ad and the brand, higher source credibility and higher electronic word-of-mouth intention. In addition, advertising skepticism was found to moderate the effect of micro-celebrity-product fit on source credibility.
   Originality/value
   This study is the first to examine the effect of micro-celebrity and product congruence on native advertising effectiveness. Moreover, the study provides a better understanding of the advertising skepticism and its influence on source credibility. It discusses why a micro-celebrity's image is a critical factor in shaping attitudes toward native advertising. This study contributes to both the native adverting and influencer marketing literature.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious disease primarily spreading through droplet infection which require significant restriction and modification in dental treatment. This study aims to assess the knowledge and attitude of adult population toward COVID-19 and dental treatment and to assess the availability of dental treatment and patient satisfaction during the time of pandemic. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An online survey was conducted using self-designed electronic questionnaire consisting knowledge and attitude about COVID-19 and dental scenario and questions regarding availability of dental treatment received during the time of pandemic. Knowledge scores were assessed on a maximum total score ranged from 0 to 8, and descriptive statistics were done for questions related to attitudes and dental treatment availability. RESULTS: A total of 495 participants with mean age of 36.6 years participated in the study. The mean knowledge score was 7.12 +/- 0.99 and the participants were found to have good awareness and positive attitude regarding COVID-19 were as considerable number of participants were unaware about the risk associated with dental treatment as well as restrictions imposed on dental procedures. About 18% of participants experienced one or other form of dental complaints during the lockdown period. 4% of participants had no accessibility to any form of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Public awareness is to be improved regarding risk of cross infection that can be associated with dental treatment and public should be motivated to use virtual facilities like tele-dentistry so that no dental emergencies is left untreated, at the same time avoiding any sort of unnecessary hospital visit during the pandemic time.

AB  - Recent studies regarding digital game-based learning (DGBL) are increasing, having the potential to enable new forms of learning, however, it remains unclear how DGBL applications can impact young students' creativity. The main purpose of this study is to investigate whether DGBL application technologies (tablets and smart-phones), can improve creativity skills in preschool children (aged 3-6) and "what the main components effective of creative skills are to enhance learning for young children in DGBL". In this study, the procedure is a case study and the researcher used a sample of apps that were preloaded onto one tablet for seven children aged 3-6 years old in grade Foundation Stage 1 and 2 in a selected Montessori pre-school in Malaysia. In the present study, during using educational digital games by young children, the students' creative thinking process and the relationship between these components based on Analyzing Children's Creative Thinking framework (ACCT) are investigated in order to understand perceptions of creativity skills involved in the learning approach. The findings suggest that DGBL can potentially affect students' ability to develop creative skills and critical thinking, knowledge transfer, acquisition of skills in digital experience, and a positive attitude toward learning as well as provide for deep, insightful learning. The students experienced opportunities for engaging the creative thinking process in their activity and thinking issue understanding and learning in educational digital games. This study provides an outlook for researchers, game designers, developers in the field of DGBL, and creativity. This research provides new insights, advice, and effective suggestions on how to increase creative skills, motivate, and improve learning outcomes and demonstrate learning with DGBL composition in teaching young students.

AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that some news media outlets depict certain social groups stereotypically. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to such news influences viewers' automatically activated gut feelings (i.e., implicit attitudes) toward this social group, which, in turn, may be used as a basis for overtly expressed evaluations (i.e., explicit attitudes). This prediction was investigated in three empirical studies in two cultural contexts. In the United States and Austria, results suggest that regular exposure to stereotypical news coverage creates negative implicit attitudes, which, in turn, alter explicit attitudes. A better understanding of the news stereotype effects will allow us to develop strategies to reduce prejudice, which may contribute to the improvement of a humane and open society.

AB  - The precautionary measures taken against COVID-19 in hotel businesses are important in terms of providing the perception of safe tourism to tourists during the pandemic. Thus, this study aims to determine the dimensional structure of the precautionary measures taken against the pandemic in hotel businesses, and to understand if these measures contribute to tourists' satisfaction and their dissatisfaction. In this context, through content analysis 1418 online reviews were examined on TripAdvisor between June and August 2020. Ten main categories and twenty eight subcategories were determined as a result of the analysis. While the safety perceptions of tourists regarding the measures taken were high in Disinfection and Hygiene, Temperature Measurement, it was observed that it was low in Social Distance and Mask Usage. The study offers clear theoretical and managerial implications for tourism literature and hotelier.

AB  - To date, little research has investigated how public perceptions of policies to ban or restrict fossil-fuel extraction change over time; yet this topic is of crucial importance as countries worldwide seek to transition towards 'net zero' economies. This study addresses this gap by focusing on public responses to the 2019 moratorium on shale gas extraction in England, using an analytical framework comprising awareness, interpretations and opinions, and a mixed-method approach combining national survey, social media and local case interviews. Findings show high levels of awareness and support for the moratorium, yet differences between coalitions of interest based on ideology, scale and demographics. Social media analyses reveal a peak in public response across several days during a general election campaign in which different parties took divergent positions on shale gas. Public support for the moratorium - and induced seismicity as the primary reason for its introduction - was evidenced by the national survey, yet coincided with scepticism about its timing, extent and motivation, as indicated by social media activity and local case interviews. For some publics, the moratorium was a ploy to ensure electoral support, embedded in public distrust. This study indicates the merits of a mixed-method approach to understand the psychological and institutional context of public responses to policy change as it unfolds over time, and discusses the longer term implications of politicised attitudes for energy transitions.

AB  - The world has been experiencing an unprecedented global pandemic since December 2019. Lockdowns, restrictions in daily life, and social distancing characterize the new environment in which the world population finds itself, with minor variations depending on the country of residence. Television, social media, and other sources of information tend to influence and provide information about COVID-19 with varying tones. This study investigated the impact of alerts, news, and information about COVID-19 from social and mass media on the emotional state of the people a year and a half after the start of the pandemic. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to 63 participants to assess the relationships between factors such as social media experience, perceived hope, worry, anxiety/depression, attentiveness, trust, health care, health risk, health safety, irritability, mental balance, and emotional state/distress. With the resulting information, a four-factor model was developed to demonstrate the relationships between social media experience, perceived hope, worry, and emotional state/distress. Additionally, a short interview was conducted among the participants in order to collect their opinions and qualitatively analyze them. The developed model demonstrates satisfactory performance characteristics and allows assessment of the delayed influence of incoming information on the people during this unprecedented pandemic.

AB  - A population-based cross-sectional study was conducted during the first COVID-19 wave, to examine the impact of COVID-19 on mental health using an anonymous online survey, enrolling 9565 individuals in 78 countries. The current sub-study examined the impact of the pandemic and the associated lockdown measures on the mental health, and protective behaviors of cancer patients in comparison to non-cancer participants. Furthermore, 264 participants from 30 different countries reported being cancer patients. The median age was 51.5 years, 79.9% were female, and 28% had breast cancer. Cancer participants reported higher self-efficacy to follow recommended national guidelines regarding COVID-19 protective behaviors compared to non-cancer participants (p < 0.01). They were less stressed (p < 0.01), more psychologically flexible (p < 0.01), and had higher levels of positive affect compared to non-cancer participants. Amongst cancer participants, the majority (80.3%) reported COVID-19, not their cancer, as their priority during the first wave of the pandemic and females reported higher levels of stress compared to males. In conclusion, cancer participants appeared to have handled the unpredictable nature of the first wave of the pandemic efficiently, with a positive attitude towards an unknown and otherwise frightening situation. Larger, cancer population specific and longitudinal studies are warranted to ensure adequate medical and psychological care for cancer patients.

AB  - Vaccination is one of the most useful preventive interventions in healthcare. The purpose of our study was to gain overview of the opinions, knowledge, and engagement in vaccination practices among medical students (MS) and junior doctors (JD) in Europe. The survey was distributed from March 2016 until August 2016 via the e-mail and social media of the European Medical Students' Association. In total, 1821 responses from MS and JD from 34 countries in the European region were analysed. The majority of respondents agreed that vaccines are useful (98.7%) and effective (97.2%). Although the necessity of revaccination was supported by 99.2%, only 68.0% of the respondents went through with it. Even though the potential benefit of the flu vaccination seems to be acknowledged by our participants, only 22.1% of MS and JD declared getting the flu shot every or every other season. MS and JD were in favour of specific mandatory vaccination for medical staff (86.0%) and medical students (82.7%). Furthermore, we analysed the self-reported vaccination coverage of our participants regarding 19 vaccines. Of the respondents, 89.5% claimed to provide advice about vaccination to their friends and family. In conclusion, European MS and JD have a very positive attitude towards vaccination. However, their behaviour and knowledge demonstrate certain gaps which should be further addressed in medical education.

TI  - Stigma and Whistleblowing: Should Punitive Damages be Available in Retaliation Cases?
T2  - INDUSTRIAL LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - CONSEQUENCES
KW  - TIME
AB  - This article uses a range of disciplinary perspectives to examine what is meant by stigma and explains that it is a relational concept. It argues that there has been a shift from attributing social stigma to whistleblowing, to regarding whistleblowing as a form of prosocial behaviour, that is, something which contributes to the well-being of others. This shift is evidenced by the attempts to establish supportive organisational cultures through the introduction of specialist employer policies and procedures, the existence of protective legislation and the coverage of whistleblowing in the media. Although it is questioned why stigma should still attach to whistleblowing, it is acknowledged that those who suffer reprisals may well seek stigma damages. Thus the article traces the common law and statutory origins of stigma awards and discusses the appropriateness of exemplary/punitive damages in the employment field. In the conclusion, it is advocated that Parliament expressly provide for exemplary/punitive damages to be awarded in employment cases. In addition, practical suggestions are made about how a more positive attitude to whistleblowing can be achieved, including a possible role for criminal sanctions. The author asserts that a more punitive approach is justified because whistleblowing is an important aspect of the human right to freedom of expression which must be fully protected in order to ensure the proper functioning of a democratic society.

AB  - Objective: To differentiate the burden of caregivers of patients in a vegetative state (VS) on the basis of different coping strategies and prolonged grief.
   Methods: An observational multi-centre study was conducted with 61 caregivers of VS patients hospitalized in specialized units in Italy. The Anxiety and Depression Short Scale, the Prolonged Grief 12 and Family Strain Questionnaire were used to measure caregivers' burden and the Coping Orientations to Problem Experiences to identify the coping strategies used by caregivers. A hierarchical cluster analysis was carried out to group the data and a comparison between clusters was conducted.
   Results: Caregivers were grouped in two clusters defined by the major proximity among the cases of the same group and the major distance from the cases of the other group. The first group was characterized by lower levels of anxiety, depression, family strain and prolonged grief. This group mainly used coping strategies referring to three factors: Social Support, Positive Attitude and Problem Oriented. The second group showed higher levels of anxiety, depression, family strain and prolonged grief and used the Avoidance strategies more than the first group.
   Conclusions: The burden of providing care to a VS patient is mediated by a range of factors including the different coping strategies adopted by caregivers. Support for these caregivers should take this consideration into account and should be subsequently personalized.

AB  - Background: Acceptance by citizens seems to be crucial for the future success of an electronic health record (EHR) in Germany and Austria. We analyzed citizens' knowledge and expectations about the concept and contents of an EHR. We also addressed possible fears and barriers, and we investigated desired EHR functionalities relevant to citizens in the Austrian and German population.
   Methods: Standardized interviews of a convenience sample of 203 Austrian and 293 German citizens recruited in two metropolises.
   Results: Up to three-quarter of the interviewed citizens already collect and store medical documents at home, mostly in paper-based form. No respondents had already used an Internet-based personal health record. Between 80% and 90% of respondents were supportive of the idea of an electronic exchange of health-related data between health care providers as core functionality of an EHR. However, many respondents formulated concerns with regard to data protection and data security within an EHR. The EHR functionalities most supported by respondents included the electronic vaccination record, online information on doctors and hospitals, and the administration of appointments and reminders.
   Conclusion: The results indicate a generally positive attitude towards the EHR. However, the study shows that data protection is an issue for many citizens, and that despite strong media discussion, there are information deficits with regard to the national EHR initiatives.

AB  - IMPORTANCE As society is increasingly becoming more networked, researchers are beginning to explore how social media can be used to study person-to-person communication about health and health care use. Twitter is an online messaging platform used by more than 300 million people who have generated several billion Tweets, yet little work has focused on the potential applications of these data for studying public attitudes and behaviors associated with cardiovascular health.
   OBJECTIVE To describe the volume and content of Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease as well as the characteristics of Twitter users.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We used Twitter to access a random sample of approximately 10 billion English-language Tweets originating from US counties from July 23, 2009, to February 5, 2015, associated with cardiovascular disease. We characterized each Tweet relative to estimated user demographics. A random subset of 2500 Tweets was hand-coded for content and modifiers.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The volume of Tweets about cardiovascular disease and the content of these Tweets.
   RESULTS Of 550 338 Tweets associated with cardiovascular disease, the terms diabetes (n = 239 989) and myocardial infarction (n = 269 907) were used more frequently than heart failure (n = 9414). Users who Tweeted about cardiovascular disease were more likely to be older than the general population of Twitter users (mean age, 28.7 vs 25.4 years; P < .01) and less likely to be male (59 082 of 124 896 [47.3%] vs 8433 of 17 270 [48.8%]; P < .01). Most Tweets (2338 of 2500 [93.5%]) were associated with a health topic; common themes of Tweets included risk factors (1048 of 2500 [41.9%]), awareness (585 of 2500 [23.4%]), and management (541 of 2500 [21.6%]) of cardiovascular disease.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Twitter offers promise for studying public communication about cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Turkey's bid to join the European Union (EU) is more contentious than any previous enlargement of the EU. With the prospect of a predominantly Muslim country joining the Union, religious differences are often argued to be at the heart of public opposition to Turkish membership, whereas economic reasoning seems to dominate arguments in favour. Yet, public opinion on this issue is also highly volatile. This raises the question of the extent to which elite framing of the debate on Turkish accession can shape public opinion. Using a survey-embedded experimental study, we examine the differences in support between people exposed to positive and negative cultural and economic arguments. Our results show that the economic frames are persuasive across the board, whereas cultural (religious) frames are strongly conditioned by individual predispositions on religious diversity.

AB  - Cultured meat can be produced from growing animal cells in-vitro rather than as part of a living animal. This technology has the potential to address several of the major ethical, environmental, and public health concerns associated with conventional meat production. However, research has highlighted some consumer uncertainty regarding the concept. Although several studies have examined the media coverage of this new food technology, research linking different frames to differences in consumer attitudes is lacking. In an experimental study, we expose U.S. adults (n = 480) to one of three different frames on cultured meat: "societal benefits," "high tech," and "same meat." We demonstrate that those who encounter cultured meat through the "high tech" frame have significantly more negative attitudes toward the concept, and are significantly less likely to consume it. Worryingly, this has been a very dominant frame in early media coverage of cultured meat. Whilst this is arguably inevitable, since its technologically advanced nature is what makes it newsworthy, we argue that this high tech framing may be causing consumers to develop more negative attitudes toward cultured meat than they otherwise might. Implications for producers and researchers are discussed.

AB  - This study examined the effects of ad prominence and persuasion knowledge (PK) priming on game users' responses to in-game ads, the advertised brands, and the game. The experimental results suggested that game players showed more negative attitudes toward the brand and the game in response to high prominence ads. In addition, there was a significant interaction between ad prominence and PK priming on recall and attitudes. High prominence ads resulted in better product recall, only when PK was not primed. In contrast, high prominence ads resulted in more negative attitudes toward the game and game players' lower intention to play the game in the future, only when PK was primed. These results suggest that high prominence ads might be preferred when PK is not primed, whereas low prominence ads might be preferred when PK is primed. This study contributes to research on the effects of in-game ads in mobile games and provides practical implications for advertisers and game developers.

KW  - coercive exposure
KW  - web-advertisement effectiveness
KW  - web-advertisement performance
AB  - These days, advertisers make every effort to attract users through coercive exposure, so as to achieve web-advertisement performance. However, the validity of crediting actual performances through forced exposure is a moot point, because accompanied unwanted digressive advertisements and unintended mouse clicks imposed on the user, are nuisance factors that can culminate in a negative way. Hence, this study investigates advertisement performance in an elaborate way by focusing on varying effects of coercive exposures. Moreover, when considering advertisement performance, it is appropriate to examine advertisement fit, that is, whether the advertising contents match with services provided by the host website. The results showed that, when subjectively forced to frequent unsolicited advertisement, a user's negative attitude to the respective advertisement greatly impacts on advertisement performance. Furthermore, if the level of advertisement fit is low, negative attitude is strengthened. This study provides guidelines on more appropriate ways for performing web advertisement, to achieve a genuine performance of advertisement and provide practical web-advertisement strategies for advertisers.

AB  - The relationship between religion and happiness has been seriously understudied in non-Western and non-Islamic societies. Taking religious identity and religious practice as strata, the 2015 Chinese General Social Survey (CGSS) data were used to examine the predicting power of health, politics, and social relationships with regard to happiness in four different groups, as follows: People with a religious identity and practice, people with no religious identity but with a practice, people with a religious identity but no practice, and people with neither a religious identity nor practice. Multiple regression analyses were conducted using the Ordinary Least Squares method. The results demonstrate the influence of the independent variables in the four groups, thus confirming the expectation that different religious practices, as well as identities, play a vital role in moderating the degree of happiness. Physical and mental health are significant predictors of happiness regardless of different religious situations, with the effect of mental health here found to be greater in magnitude on happiness than that of physical health. Political participation was not found to be related to happiness, but having a left-wing political attitude did emerge as strongly predicting happiness. The results concerning social relationships further consolidate the hypothesis that religious practice should be taken into consideration separately from religious identity. This study indicates the importance of further investigating religious practice as an independent factor in religious studies in the context of Chinese society.

AB  - Public Significance Statement COVID-19 and associated social distancing measures have resulted in income loss and change to family routines and family health. The negative effects on families can reduce health resources, which may be associated with more anxiety and depression among adults.
   Background: The objective of the study was to examine the association of COVID-19 with family well-being and adult mental health 1 month into the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Prior pandemics have had long-term effects on mental health. COVID-19 and its related stressors, such as loss of work and social distancing requirements, may have a profound impact on short-term and long-term mental health. Family stress theory indicates that subjective family meaning making and family resources affect how stressors lead to outcomes. Method: Participants, adults ages 18 years and older (N = 416), completed a cross-sectional online survey measuring depressive and anxiety symptoms, family health, subjective family meaning making, and loss of work resulting from COVID-19. Data were analyzed using a structural equation modeling framework. Results: Results indicated that subjective negative family meaning and effects were associated with more depression and anxiety. Higher family health resources were associated with less depression and anxiety. Family health resources mediated the relationships between COVID-19 loss of work with depression and anxiety. Conclusion: COVID-19 associated stressors 1 month into the pandemic had modest effects on family meaning making and family health resources. Individuals from families whose health resources were negatively impacted by COVID-19 reported more anxiety and depressive symptoms. Health care and public health systems should consider family health resources to help reduce the negative effects of COVID-19 on mental health. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the accumulation of stressors over time and the directionality of relationships.

AB  - "The contact hypothesis" refers to the value of heterosexuals' interpersonal contact with gay men and lesbians in lowering negative attitudes toward them. With the increasing number of same-sex parented families worldwide, in spite of a generalized lack of appropriate social and legal protection, the issue of attitudes toward gay and lesbian parents gains special relevance. A sample of 1690 Portuguese heterosexual individuals were asked about their interpersonal contact experiences with gay men and lesbians, their attitudes toward them and toward same-sex parenting. Results revealed that women and non-religious participants were significantly more likely to have gay and lesbian acquaintances and friends, feel more comfortable in their company, and hold less negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians, and gay and lesbian parenting. A path analysis model revealed that interpersonal contact experiences were not directly linked to attitudes toward same-sex families, but were mediated by homonegativity and comfort with gay men and lesbians. These findings extend previous knowledge about the value of interpersonal contact, by highlighting the roles of homonegativity and positive affect as mediators of contact experiences on attitudes toward same-sex parented families.

AB  - Given the disparities in professional help-seeking of Asian Americans, continued empirical effort to identify the predictors, mediators, and moderators of help-seeking attitudes is needed. Although cultural values such as emotional self-control in relation to help-seeking attitudes have received empirical attention, self-compassion in the Asian American help-seeking literature remains unexplored. Thus, we examined the mediating and moderating role of self-compassion on the relationship between the Asian cultural value of emotional self-control and help-seeking attitudes in a sample of 257 Asian American college students. An online questionnaire containing the study measures was used to collect data. Emotional self-control was significantly associated with unfavorable help-seeking attitudes. Moreover, self-compassion was a significant mediator of the relation. Specifically, an increase in emotional self-control was associated with a decrease in self-compassion, which in turn was associated with favorable help-seeking attitudes. Self-compassion was a nonsignificant moderator. We discuss potential explanations for the indirect effect of emotional self-control on help-seeking attitudes through self-compassion, and we address implications of these findings for practice when working with Asian American college students.
   What is the public significance of this article? This study suggests that having compassion on oneself can aid in developing a positive attitude toward professional counseling among Asian American college students. Helping people increase their self-compassion holds much promise for addressing the problem of Asian Americans not seeking professional services because of cultural influences.

AB  - Objective. A school-based vaccination programme to prevent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV), the virus that causes cervical cancer, began in October 2008 in England. The present study evaluated the role of temporal perspective in the formation of attitudes and intentions towards the vaccine.
   Design. A cross-sectional correlational survey of 245 parents of 11-12-year-old girls.
   Methods. Parents read a passage about the HPV vaccine containing information about benefits and concerns parents might have about the vaccine. They then completed a thought listing task and measures of attitude, vaccine efficacy, anticipated regret, intention, and consideration of future consequences.
   Results. Parents with higher consideration of future consequences generated more positive relative to negative thoughts, held more positive attitudes, higher response efficacy, reported higher anticipated regret about not vaccinating their daughters and held more positive intentions. Mediation analyses suggested that the influence of thoughts generated on intention to vaccinate was partially mediated by attitude, perceived vaccine efficacy, and anticipated regret if the vaccine were not taken up.
   Conclusion. Messages emphasizing efficacy of vaccination and anticipated regret are likely to promote vaccination uptake.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to explore informetrics researchers' use of social media for academic activities, their attitudes to the applicability of altmetrics in research evaluation, the factors influencing their attitudes, and the main opportunities and weaknesses of using altmetrics. Design/methodology/approach A survey using a questionnaire was conducted with researchers who participated in the 16th International Conference on Scientometrics and Informetrics ISSI 2017 and a sample of 125 respondents was obtained. Findings Progressively more researchers are using social media for different types of academic activities. The study found that many factors affect informetrics researchers' attitudes in different application scenarios with respect to research evaluation. Researchers who have studied altmetrics and who began using social media platforms recently or frequently have more positive attitudes. Academic users and social users have statistically significantly disparate attitudes toward altmetrics in different disciplines and different application scenarios. Research limitations/implications Our study only focused on 125 informetrics researchers, who participated in ISSI 2017. We mainly used the questionnaire method, but did not conduct in-depth interviews with the researcher's views. Originality/value Informetrics researchers are participants in social media and major researchers of altmetrics. Previous research has examined their use of social media, and this study combines this use of social media with their attitudes to altmetrics to explore the value of altmetrics from a particular perspective. The paper also provides suggestions for the application of altmetrics in research evaluation.

KW  - sport consumers
AB  - As COVID-19 lockdowns force most sport leagues into hiatus, engaging fans has emerged as a key challenge confronting the sport industry. While navigating social distancing protocols, athletes are experimenting with new ways to connect with their fans. Alongside established social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram), TikTok, a short-form video-sharing platform, has gained prominence in terms of registered users and shared content. Yet, little is known about the utility of TikTok as an athlete branding tool. This study uses a netnographic approach to explore the use of TikTok among athletes (N = 10) during the COVID-19 pandemic. Findings reveal that athlete-generated TikTok videos are characterized as playful and authentic. While athletes are recent adopters of TikTok, this emerging social media platform can be profitably integrated into their online branding strategies. Communicating via TikTok presents opportunities for athletes to foster existing fan relationships, promote branded content, and appeal to new fan segments. Overall, athletes and sport practitioners can leverage these findings to create content for an audience that is attracted to novelty and the activities of athletes extending beyond game highlights or interviews.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Virtual meetings have been widely utilized during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to explore the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting by Filipino professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   METHODS: A total of 513 Filipino professionals answered an online questionnaire which covered four latent variables: organizational commitment to virtual meetings, attitude toward virtual meetings, perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as collaboration tool, and perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a social tool. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze the causal relationships between the latent variables construct.
   RESULTS: SEM showed that organizational commitment to virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced the positive attitude of the employees which subsequently led to the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting as a collaboration and social tool.
   CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first study that analyzed the influence of organizational commitment on the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Philippines. Our SEM construct can be applied and extended further, particularly in analyzing factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of virtual meeting during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Objective: The aim of our study was to assess the knowledge and attitude and to find out the statistics regarding public awareness of organ donation in Karachi. This convenient based, cross-sectional study was conducted from the general population of Karachi, Pakistan from December 2015 to December 2016. The respondents were evaluated through a face to face questionnaire. The questionnaire contained variables regarding knowledge and attitude towards organ donation.
   Result: 420 people were approached; amongst them 25 refused to participate, so a total number of 395 respondents consented in the research. The mean age of about 77.5% of the population was in the 18-27 range. More than half of the respondents happened to be students and female (51.1%) (55%) respectively. Our results indicate that there was inadequate knowledge among the general population (25.8%). There was a positive attitude regarding organ donation (75.2%). Television was a popular source of information (27%). 29.90% respondents knew that "Kidney" can be donated. 43.80% of the respondents were oblivious to the allowance of organ donation in their religion. More than half (57.2%) were in favor of the promotion of organ donation.

AB  - Objective: In this postmodern society, people tend to abandon conventional medicine for alternative medical systems, such as acupuncture. What are the reasons for this defiance regarding modern rationality and individualist success? Who turns to acupuncture? Methods: This study (n=89) examined whether world views opposed to the predominance of rationality (i.e., mistrust of science, spirituality, paranormal beliefs) and individualist success or consumerism (i.e., power, achievement, and materialism), typically associated with the postmodern era, might explain this attraction toward acupuncture. Participants were recruited through Internet forums interested in complementary and alternative medicine and completed the questionnaire voluntarily. Results: Attraction to acupuncture related negatively with materialism and achievement as well as positively with spirituality, paranormal beliefs, and mistrust in science. Spirituality, paranormal beliefs, and low achievement were the main predictors of attraction to acupuncture and explained 44% of the variance. The mistrust in science mediated the relationship between spiritual and paranormal beliefs and the attraction toward acupuncture. Low achievement explained the link between low materialism and positive attitudes toward acupuncture. Conclusion: The general mistrust of our rational and individualist modern society is indeed an important predictor of attraction toward acupuncture, in addition to demographic variables.

AB  - Purpose Despite the increasing prevalence of obesity in Italy, it remains largely underdiagnosed and undertreated. We aimed to identify the perceptions, attitudes, behaviours and barriers to effective obesity care among people with obesity (PwO) and healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Italy. Methods The ACTION-IO study was an online cross-sectional survey conducted in 11 countries from June to October 2018. Findings from the Italian cohort are reported here. Results The survey was completed by 1501 PwO and 302 HCPs in Italy. Most PwO (84%) and HCPs (77%) acknowledged the large impact of obesity on overall health. However, fewer PwO (62%) than HCPs (91%) perceived obesity as a chronic disease. Most PwO (84%) assumed full responsibility for their weight loss. A median of 3 (mean 6) years elapsed between when PwO started struggling with obesity and when they first discussed their weight with an HCP. Many PwO expressed that they liked (80%) or would like (74%) their HCPs to initiate weight management conversations, and only 3% were offended by such a conversation. For 77% of HCPs, perceiving their patients as unmotivated or disinterested in losing weight prevented them from initiating these conversations. Short appointment times were also considered a limiting factor for 40% of HCPs. Conclusions Most PwO took complete responsibility for their own weight loss and waited considerable time before seeking help from an HCP.

AB  - As infectious disease outbreaks emerge, public health agencies often enact vaccination and social distancing measures to slow transmission. Their success depends on not only strategies and resources, but also public adherence. Individual willingness to take precautions may be influenced by global factors, such as news media, or local factors, such as infected family members or friends. Here, we compare three modes of epidemiological decision-making in the midst of a growing outbreak using network-based mathematical models that capture plausible heterogeneity in human contact patterns. Individuals decide whether to adopt a recommended intervention based on overall disease prevalence, the proportion of social contacts infected, or the number of social contacts infected. While all strategies can substantially mitigate transmission, vaccinating (or self isolating) based on the number of infected acquaintances is expected to prevent the most infections while requiring the fewest intervention resources. Unlike the other strategies, it has a substantial herd effect, providing indirect protection to a large fraction of the population.

AB  - We are spending our days today in a nationwide lockdown. The government should be lauded for taking a firm stand and announcing this lockdown well in time. Perhaps the benefits of social distancing cannot be more emphasized to prevent the spread of the dreaded coronavirus as witnessed by some of the developed nations who missed out by announcing it very late. In this lockdown period when we are primarily confined to our home, people face this dilemma of what to do and what lies ahead. Suddenly people find themselves in a situation where they are forced to stay at home and there is fear and turmoil all around. The mindset in this situation quickly becomes negative and as is well known "empty mind is devil's workshop." The need of the hour is to get constructively active and keep the positive vibes going.

AB  - The phenomenon of the internationalization of education has been prevalent in developed western countries, with varied and at times contested discourses about international education and students. We wonder how these discourses are constructed and contested in the media and further shape public opinions. Using the critical theories of language, power, and media, we analyzed 44 articles relevant to international education/students and their commentaries in the widely circulated Canadian newspapers. Our findings illustrate three dominant themes as the rhetoric of international education/students in Canada and how they are discursively constructed: (1) international education as a commodity; (2) international students as recipients of the generosity of Canada; and (3) international students as burden/harms to Canadian education/students as well as having moral deficits and being lawfully wrongdoers. This analysis highlights how international students are otherized, essentialized, and silenced as the voiceless despite their strong presence as the fastest growing migrant group in Canada with diverse identities and needs. We close with a discussion of the media analysis on international students as one such example of how dominance such as neoliberalism is taking up e-space like other public domains in social environments, which social workers deeply care about.

AB  - Humans tend to construct their worldview via binaries, that is, two distinct, nonoverlapping elements, such as the juxtapositions of human-animal, human-machine, or male-female. Our research focuses on the binary categories of "heterosexuality-homosexuality" and explores how stable or malleable they are. For this, the authors analyze newspaper coverage of sexuality concepts in the United Kingdom from 1995 to 2010 and quantify if and how tolerance toward ambiguous concepts including "bisexuality" vary across time as well as with gender, political opinion, and expertise. Our findings indicate a distinct "millennial effect" of intolerance toward sexual ambiguity, suggesting that resistance against ambiguity rears up during periods of instability. Conversely, we found higher levels of ambiguity tolerance in left-wing newspapers, broadsheet publications, female journalists, and expert writers, as opposed to right-wing newspapers, tabloid publications, male journalists, and novice writers. Our results can help to better understand to what degree concepts related to human sexuality are relatively hard-wired or rather fluid social categories.

AB  - Background: The I-Change Model for explaining motivational and behavioral change postulates that an awareness phase precedes the motivation phase of a person, and that effects of pre-motivational factors on behavior are partially mediated by motivational factors. This study tests this assumption with regard to physical activity.
   Methods: Observational longitudinal survey study (baseline, three months, six months) amongst Dutch adults (N=2434). Structural equation modelling was used to investigate whether the influence of (1) knowledge, (2) cognizance, (3) cues, and (4) risk perception separately on intention and physical activity were mediated by motivational factors (i.e. attitudes, self-efficacy and social influence). Subsequently, a comprehensive model including all pre-motivational factors was estimated to test the same assumption for all pre-motivational factors simultaneously.
   Results: The results indicate that the associations of cognizance, risk perception and cues with behavior were fully mediated by motivational factors when tested separately. When tested simultaneously only the effect of cognizance remained. Cognizance was most strongly associated with positive attitudes beta=.13, p<.01, self-efficacy beta=.13, p<.01, and intention beta=.14, p<.01. No direct link with behavior was found.
   Conclusion: The results suggest that pre-motivational factors are important to form a motivation; however, they do not directly influence behavior. The inclusion of factors such as risk perception and cognizance would help to get a better understanding of motivation formation and behavior.

AB  - Advertisements featuring celebrities have increased over the years. While we know that the effectiveness of celebrities stems from a transfer of positive affect from celebrity to product, it is still unclear whether celebrities are also able to improve product favorableness in commercials. In the current study, by employing a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment that presented subjects with a combination of a celebrity face and a car that was familiar to their culture, we investigated the neural correlates of celebrity power on car favorableness in advertising. The results showed that neural activity in brain areas associated with reward, memory, semantics, and attention was higher when viewing a combination of a celebrity face and a car compared to viewing a combination of a non-celebrity face and a car. Furthermore, it was found that the scores of car favorableness were positively correlated with neural activity of left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), left anterior insula and left higher-order visual cortex in the occipital lobe. This suggests a possible "transfer effect" of positive attitude, and a feeling for the celebrity, while making a preference-judgment for car.

AB  - Background The prevalence of breast cancer in Iran has increased. An effective approach to decrease the burden of breast cancer is prevention. Objective The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate an educational model, called the ASSISTS, for promoting breast cancer-preventive behaviors in women. Methods A multiphase method was used to develop the model designed to promote breast cancer prevention behaviors. A conceptual model was generated based on a secondary analysis of qualitative data. Then, a structural equation model technique was used to test the relationships among the model constructs. Results The analysis revealed that 7 constructs could be extracted, namely, perceived social support, attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, stress management, and self-care. Based on these constructs, a conceptual model was built and tested using structural equation modeling. The model fit was good, and the model confirmed significant relationships among the 7 constructs of breast cancer prevention. Conclusion Findings revealed that self-care behavior and stress management are influenced directly by attitude, motivation, self-efficacy, information seeking, and social support. In addition, women seek more information when they are motivated, have more self-efficacy, have a more positive attitude toward breast cancer prevention, and experience more social support. Implication for Practice Cancer nurses can be at the forefront of breast cancer prevention. Because they can play a pivotal role in providing information, they can reduce women's stress and increase their self-care behavior. In addition, their social support can positively influence Iranian women's attitude, motivation, and self-care behavior. Furthermore, implementing educational programs based on this model might encourage women to practice preventive behaviors.

AB  - In this article, we test if international football matches in Latin America can be understood as nationalistic collective rituals and if participating in them leads to prejudicial attitudes toward immigrants and to legitimize the national social systems. Based on social identity theory and literature on collective rituals, we propose that participating in collective rituals makes cognitively salient social identity over self-identity through collective emotions. Therefore, individuals are more motivated to perceive the social systems as fair and legitimate and to show outgroup derogation. In Study 1 (N = 414), interest in football was associated with national identification a week before an international tournament in Brazil, Chile, and Spain. This association was mediated by fusion of identity with the national ingroup but not by experiencing collective positive emotions. In Study 2 (N = 118), we used an experimental design and showed that nationalism moderated the effect of participating in nationalistic collective rituals on measures related to behavioral intentions. Specifically, these rituals decreased outgroup prejudice among high nationalistic participants. Collective rituals are discussed as a form of collective self-affirmation that may have reduced defensiveness and led nationalistic individuals to behave according to the predominant values within a society.

AB  - Background: A concerted effort has been made by the Government of India and the Armed Forces to train all health-care workers (HCWs) in various aspects of the prevention and management of COVID-19. This study was conducted to evaluate the efforts by assessing their knowledge, attitudes, practice, and behavior regarding COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A quick online survey, using a web portal and social media platform with a pretested questionnaire, was conducted. Responses were collected for 3 days and analyzed. Results: A total of 988 HCWs participated, including 61 (6.17%) specialist officers, 98 (9.91%) medical officers, 17 (1.72%) dental officers, 135 (13.66%) nursing officers, 518 (52.4%) paramedical staff, and 159 (16.09%) supporting staff. There was a high prevalence (>90%) of knowledge related to symptoms and transmission of the disease with no statistically significant difference in knowledge based on the category of HCW except for bleaching powder requirement (0.001) and chemoprophylaxis (0.001). The majority of the participants (>95%) agreed that lockdown, infection control programs, and repeated training of HCWs are good measures to control COVID-19 spread. Observing full precaution while handling personal protective equipment was the only practice which demonstrated a significant association with increasing qualification of the participant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Levels of knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices are high among HCWs in the Armed Forces, however, feeling of anxiousness and worry prevail being frontline workers with maximum proximity toward patients. Aggressive, continuous, relevant target population-oriented information, education, and communication is the need of the hour, with structured and programmed interventions for positive mental health during course of the pandemic.

Design/methodology/approach Drawing on the political economy theory, the study examines how actors mobilised power by accessing an existing social network to agree a joint public communication strategy in order to ensure public support for the continuation of nuclear power generation in the UK. It traces discursive frames from their inception in private communication to their reproduction in public communication and their dissemination via the media. Findings The study provides evidence of pro-nuclear actors cooperating behind the scenes to achieve consistent public pro-nuclear messaging. It finds evidence of four discursive frames: avoiding knee-jerk reactions, lessons learned, safety and nuclear renaissance. In combination, they guide audiences' evaluation of the consequences of the Fukushima disaster for the UK in favour of continuing the commercial use of nuclear energy. Originality/value The private e-mail exchange between pro-nuclear actors presents a unique opportunity to examine the mobilisation of less visible forms of power in the form of agenda setting (manipulation) and discursive framing (domination) in order to influence policy outcomes and shape public opinion on nuclear energy. This is problematic because it constitutes a lack of transparency and accountability on part of the State with respect to policy outcomes and restricts the civic space by curtailing the articulation of alternative interests and voices.

AB  - Background The world guidance on the measures of social distancing for prevention of COVID-19 has changed the daily habits of great part of the population, and this could influence the care and resilience with diabetes during situations of adversity. This study aimed at assessing the characteristics of diabetic individuals and self-care practices and resilience with diabetes in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. Methods This is a cross-sectional web survey study carried out among adults with diabetes, in which a structured 43-item questionnaire was conducted on the REDCap plataform, including the Diabetes Self-Care Activities Questionnaire and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, to measure socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. The web survey was disseminated through the main social media and data were collected from September 1st to October 19th, 2020. Data analysis was performed according to type of diabetes mellitus (DM) and at a significance level of 5% (p < 0.05). Results Of the 1633 participants, 67.5% were women, 43.2% aged between 35 and 59 years old, 68.0% lived in the south-eastern region of Brazil, 57.1% had a high education level, 49% reported to have DM1 and 140 participants reported to have had COVID-19. Diabetes care mostly involved the use of medications (93%), whereas the least used ones were physical activity (24.6%) and examination of the shoes (35.7%). About 40% of the participants reported to be followed up by telemedicine, 61.5% monitored the glycaemic levels, 61.2% followed a healthy diet and 43.4% left home only to go to the supermarket and drugstore. The mean resilience was 25.4 (SD = 7.7). Conclusions In Brazil, individuals with diabetes followed social distancing and maintained their medication treatment for DM. However, practice of physical activity and foot examination was little followed by the participants, who also had a low level of resilience. These findings showed the importance of patient follow-up in the healthcare services, meaning that telemedicine should be improved and support provided for adaptation in view of the therapeutic setbacks.

TI  - Has loneliness and poor resilient coping influenced the magnitude of psychological distress among apparently healthy Indian adults during the lockdown? Evidence from a rapid online nation-wide cross-sectional survey
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - CARE
AB  - Background
   The burden of psychological distress is increasing with the spread of the pandemic and also with the enforcement of its containment measures. The aim of this research was to determine the proportion of self-reported psychological distress, loneliness and degrees of resilient coping, and to also investigate the relationship of loneliness, coping and other variables with psychological distress among apparently healthy Indians during nation-wide lockdown period.
   Methods
   A cross-sectional, region-stratified survey using pre-designed pre-tested Google form disseminated via different social media platforms was conducted. A total of 1249 responses were analysed all over India. The form enquired about Socio-demographic profile, awareness on COVID pandemic and cases in the surroundings. UCLA Loneliness scale, Brief resilience and coping scale (BRCS) and Psychological distress scale (K6) assessed self-reported loneliness, coping and psychological distress, respectively. Special regressor technique adjusting for endogeneity and heteroskedasticity was used to extract the average marginal effects.
   Results
   Majority of the respondents were 18-35 years old, male, single and urban residents. News media, social media mostly acted as sources of information regarding COVID related news. Overall, 54.47% (95% CI: 51.39-57.53%) and 38.39% (95% CI: 35.57-41.29%) were reported to be lonely and had low resilient coping ability respectively. Around 44.68% had high risk of developing psychological distress. Being a student (average marginal effect coefficient (AME(Coef))(.): -0.07, 95% CI: [-0.12, -0.01]) and perceiving lockdown as an effective measure (AME(Coef): -0.11, 95% CI: [-0.19, -0.03]) were protective against psychological distress. Psychological distress was associated with male respondents (AME(Coef) 0.07, 95% CI: [0.02, 0.11]), low or medium resilient copers (AME(Coef) 0.89, 95% CI: [0.17, 1.61]), and perceiving a serious impact of social distancing measures (AME(Coef) 0.17, 95% CI: [0.09, 0.26]).
   Conclusions
   Psychological distress among Indian population during lockdown was prevalent. Poor coping ability and perceiving social distancing to have a serious impact was found to be significantly contributing to psychological distress. Appropriate measures to address these issues would be beneficial for the community mental health.

AB  - This article is a reflective consolidation of our practice experience in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 period, in which social work educators and practitioners needed to work online in a prolonged period of social distancing. It illustrates in what ways online practices may denote emerging knowledge and skills that are worth further discussion. These reflections have been consolidated as four knowledge/skill domains in our afterthoughts: i) Context, ii) Conversation, iii) Communication-Modality, and iv) Circulation. These insights may inspire social work educators and practitioners to comprehend the potential of media technologies more fully.

AB  - This study presents a careful understanding of the impact of information dependence on public attitudes (PAs) towards genetically modified (GM) technology in China by employing a structural equation modelling approach. Results in this study provide further empirical evidence to support the point of view that PAs towards GM technology vary with their information dependence. Information evaluation is the reasoning mechanism between information dependence and the perception of risks and benefits, ultimately determining PAs towards GM technology. Empirical results can serve as the basis for risk communication, suggesting that the public sector, scientific institutions, scientists, and officials must be more active in sharing scientific knowledge about GM technology with the public by developing more open channels for the dissemination of authoritative information, and public education is also needed. On the other hand, the medias' discourse system on GM technology should return to the scientific field for inspiring a rational attitude towards GM technology.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine when and how the number of "likes" can exert significant influence on consumer evaluations of social media advertising. It sheds a novel perspective on how social media "likes", advertising disclosures and the presence of firm-serving motives influence advertising effectiveness. Design/methodology/approach Study 1 examines how the number of "likes" influences consumer attitudes towards the sponsoring brand by strengthening advertising credibility, when social media ads are effectively (vs non-effectively) disclosed. Study 2 further establishes how the influence of the number of "likes" for effectively disclosed ads varies depending on whether the company states (vs does not state) its firm-serving motives. Findings The authors found that a social media ad displayed with a higher number of "likes" is perceived to be more credible, which can then yield more positive attitudes towards the brand. However, the use of effective disclosures moderates this relationship. To offset this effect, companies can restore the value of "likes" by stating their firm-serving motives openly when they develop social media advertising messages.
   Originality/value The study illustrates a novel mechanism behind how and when the number of "likes" can influence the effectiveness of social media advertising.

Design/methodology/approach This study is based on "Cue utilisation theory" and focusses on how retailers can influence consumers' perception of quality variations by providing them in-store marketing cues. Data was collected through the mall intercept method in New Delhi, India. Data analysis was done using AMOS 25 and the PROCESS SPSS macro. Findings This study establishes the effect of in-store private label marketing in improving consumers' quality perception of PLBs vis-a-vis national brands and thereby leading to a positive attitude towards PLBs. Further, the national brand promotions attitude is found to moderate the relationship between private label marketing and attitude towards PLBs. However, contrary to the authors' expectations, it has a positive effect on this relationship. The study found an insignificant moderation influence of price consciousness. Originality/value This study complements existing literature on "Cue utilisation theory" by demonstrating the importance of in-store private label marketing in improving consumers' attitudes towards PLBs. It also extends to fill some gaps in the literature by studying the direct, mediating and moderating relationship among in-store private label marketing, perceived quality variations, price consciousness, national brand promotion attitude and attitude towards PLBs, especially in an emerging market such as India.

AB  - Dynamic assessment has been widely used in educational literature over the past two decades. The present study aimed at investigating the effect of using dynamic assessment on teaching the rhythm of English to Iranian EFL learners and scrutinizing their attitudes towards it. The participants of the study were 30 Iranian EFL leaners at the intermediate level of proficiency, who were conveniently selected from a foreign language institute in Isfahan, Iran. In order to achieve the objectives of the study, the participants were divided into two homogenous groups, including the experimental group and control group. In this quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest-control-group-design research study, the control group followed traditional method of learning pronunciation and rhythm, while dynamic assessment approach was used to teach the same materials to the experimental group. In contrast to the control group, the experimental group took an active role in the classroom by having more interaction and using the ongoing hints and prompts provided by the teacher. The result of the posttest unfolded that there was a significant difference between the performances of the two groups, and that the experimental group participants managed to outperform the control group members on the pronunciation posttest. Moreover, based on the attitude questionnaire, EFL learners had grown a positive attitude towards the use of dynamic assessment to learn rhythm. The results of this study demonstrated that through the implementation of DA, the proper form of mediation could be provided to the learners regarding their ZPD.

AB  - Objective: To investigate promoters and barriers for cervical cancer screening in rural Tanzania. Methods: We interviewed 300 women of reproductive age living in Kiwangwa village, Tanzania The odds of attending a free, 2-day screening service were compared with sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors, and knowledge and attitudes surrounding cervical cancer using multivariable logistic regression. Results: Compared with women who did not attend the screening service (n = 195), women who attended (n = 105) were older (OR 4.29; 95% Cl, 1.61-11.48, age 40-49 years versus 20-29 years), listened regularly to the radio (OR 24.76; 95% CI, 11.49-53.33, listened to radio 1-3 times per week versus not at all), had a poorer quality of life (OR 4.91; CI, 1.96-12.32, lowest versus highest score), had faced cost barriers to obtaining health care in the preceding year (OR 2.24; 95% CI, 1.11-4.53, yes versus no), and held a more positive attitude toward cervical cancer screening (OR 4.64; 95% Cl, 1.39-15.55, least versus most averse). Conclusion: Efforts aimed at improving screening rates in rural Tanzania need to address both structural and individual-level barriers, including knowledge and awareness of cervical cancer prevention, cost barriers to care, and access to health information.

AB  - Cervical cancer is still a major public health problem worldwide. However, the uptake of human papillomavirus vaccine remains low among college women in Thailand. A cross-sectional and structural equation model to predict the intention to obtain human papillomavirus vaccine by young college women in Thailand was developed and tested. Data were collected from 191 college women aged 18-26 from the non-health sciences who were enrolled in two universities in Southern Thailand. Data collection involved the use of a structured questionnaire, which included demographic information, human papillomavirus and vaccine awareness, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, perceived susceptibility, perceived effectiveness, cost, knowledge of HPV and cervical cancer, and intention to obtain HPV vaccination. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and structural equation modeling.
   The results showed that, in the modified Model of Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Intention among Young Women, attitudes, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, and perceived susceptibility of HPV-related disease all had significant and direct effects on the intention to obtain HPV vaccine, and able to explain 38% of the variance. Attitude was found to be the mediator of knowledge about human papillomavirus and cervical cancer, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control and the perceived effectiveness toward the intention to obtain human papillomavirus vaccination. Thus, nurses should take the initiative and make college women more familiar with the human papillomavirus vaccine, promote positive attitudes towards human papillomavirus vaccination and empower college women to take control of their vaccination decision-making.

AB  - Despite the increasing prevalence of methamphetamine use among the young population in Iran, the body of literature on their methamphetamine use remains slim. This study was designed to investigate the knowledge, attitude, and practices of Iranian youth about methamphetamine to help inform harm reduction policies catered towards young men and women. In a cross-sectional study using multistage sampling in 13 provinces, 4868 participants aged 15-29 years old were recruited. Knowledge, attitude and practices of youth about methamphetamine were assessed through a pilot-tested interviewer-administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were presented and potential associations were assessed using Chi-square test and independent samples t-test. Mean age +/- SD of the participants was 21.8 +/- 5.6 years, and 49.5% were women. Overall, 21.7% and 37.7% of the participants had high knowledge scores and positive attitudes, respectively. Among the 19-29 years old participants, ever methamphetamine use and injection was estimated at 5.74% (95% CI: 4.21, 7.90) and 1.8% (95% CI: 1.13, 2.83), respectively. Most (44.3%) had started methamphetamine use for fun and media (69.1%) was reported as their main source of information on methamphetamine use. Methamphetamine use is a concerning health problem among Iranian youth. Comprehensive multi-sectoral downstream and upstream interventions that involve educational settings, as well as media, are urgently needed to help reduce the burden of methamphetamine use among Iranian youth.

AB  - Latina/o youth lag behind Asian American and non-Latina/o White youth in many academic areas. Previous research has taken a deficit approach to understand the factors that affect academic outcomes for Latina/o youth often neglecting to highlight both the potential positive and negative contributions of gender role values. The present study took a holistic perspective to understand the affect of traditional Latina/o gender role values (i.e., marianismo, machismo, and caballerismo) on the academic attitudes and educational goals of Mexican descent youth. Structural equation models were tested to examine the associations of "positive" and "negative" gender role values on educational goals using 524 Mexican descent adolescents from a mid-sized city in southern Texas. We hypothesized that positive aspects of traditional Latina/o gender role values (i.e., "positive marianismo" and caballerismo) would be associated with more positive attitudes toward academics and higher educational goals. We further expected negative gender role values (i.e., "negative marianismo" and machismo) to have the opposite effect. Additionally, based on the theory of planned behavior and gender schema theory, academic attitudes were hypothesized to mediate the relation between gender role values and educational goals. An alternative model was tested in which educational goals mediated the relation between gender roles and academic attitudes. Results indicated that both models fit the data well, and recommendations are made for future longitudinal research aimed at disentangling the directionality of the relations in the model. Implications for research and practice are discussed.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to identify social and organizational antecedents of stress. This paper also investigates whether attitudes toward organizational changes and reforms might explain stress perception (SP) and mediate the relationships between social and organizational job characteristics and SP.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative approach is used to identify the relationships between the research variables. The investigated population is composed of middle managers working in Swiss public hospitals (n = 720), which are currently being confronted by major reforms.
   Findings - The findings show that perceived social support (work relationships with and support from colleagues), as well as several job characteristics (autonomy in performing tasks, flexibility in the organization of working time, degree of conflict) are significantly related to SP. Moreover, positive attitudes toward change are negatively related to stress, and mediate the relationships between perceived social support as well as job characteristics and SP.
   Practical implications - This paper sheds light on several job characteristics which could contribute to mitigating SP among middle managers. The findings could therefore guide HRM specialists in their efforts to create a favorable work environment so as to facilitate middle managers' activities.
   Originality/value - The innovation of this paper is grounded in the specific population the author investigate, as the empirical inquiry concerns middle managers working in public hospitals. Moreover, this research highlights the central role of job characteristics and attitudes toward change in explaining SP.

AB  - This study evaluates empirically the proposition implicit in much recent gender and CMC research that expressions of gender distinctness among teens in online environments are becoming less frequent and less traditional. Gender preferences were analyzed in linguistic features and communication styles in synchronous text messages, along with self-presentation in user profile pictures, drawing on data from popular English-language teen chat sites collected in 2010. Significant differences were found in speech acts, message tone, and in physical stance, dress, and social distance in profile pictures that generally conform to traditional gender stereotypes. These findings are interpreted in light of previous gender and teen CMC research, adolescent development and socialization patterns, mass media representations, and trends towards media convergence in chat platforms.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic represents a unique global challenge. To deter its spread, several countries have put lockdown and physical distancing measures in place that could have potentially harmful consequences on people's mental health. Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the relationship between anxiety and perceived stress in individuals who were experiencing the COVID-19 lockdown measures, while also analyzing the impact of coping strategies interacting with defence mechanisms. A sample of 1408 individuals (M-age = 34.69; SD = 11.87) completed the Ten Item Perceived Stress Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Form X3, Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced and Forty-Item Defense Style Questionnaire, after providing written informed consent. Results highlighted the significant impact of state anxiety levels on perceived stress, both directly and indirectly. The indirect pathways have been explored by performing three mixed serial-parallel mediation analyses, where significant associations between coping strategies (Social Support, Avoidance Strategies, Positive Attitude, Problem-solving and Turning to Religion) and mature, neurotic, or immature defences have been found. These findings may contribute to orientate prevention and intervention activity during the several management phases of COVID-19.

AB  - Even though the rapid aging of the population is a global phenomenon, reducing negative stereotypes of the elderly and building harmonious relationships between young and old generations have been critical steps to solving ageism issues worldwide. To contribute to these efforts, this paper examined the role of vivid images of people's future self via an age-morphing technology in communication strategies to address the issue of ageism. An online survey with 324 young participants who saw images of the future self was conducted. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the proposed relationships among psychological continuity, group identification, empathy, sympathy, ageism, psychological proximity, attitudes, and behavioral intentions. Results revealed that psychological continuity created through a vivid image of one's future self can lead to group identification with the elderly, influencing one's psychological proximity to issues of the elderly. This relationship is positively mediated by empathy and sympathy, and ageism negatively mediates the relationship. The close feelings to issues relevant to the elderly are likely to elicit a positive attitude toward the efforts of addressing the issues as well as greater participation in relevant social media campaigns for the elderly.

AB  - Research has shown that the mere presence of stimuli that resemble eyes is sufficient to attract attention, elicit aesthetic responses, and can even enhance prosocial behavior. However, it is less clear whether eye-like stimuli could also be used as a tool for nature conservation. Several animal species, including butterflies, develop eye-like markings that are known as eyespots. In the present research, we explored whether the mere display of eyespots on butterfly wings can enhance: (a) liking for a butterfly species, and (b) attitudes and behaviors towards conservation of a butterfly species. Four online experimental studies, involving 613 participants, demonstrated that eyespots significantly increased liking for a butterfly species. Furthermore, eyespots significantly increased positive attitudes towards conservation of a butterfly species (Studies 1, 2 and 4), whereas liking mediated the eyespot effect on conservation attitudes (Study 2). However, we also found some mixed evidence for an association between eyespots and actual conservation behavior (Studies 3 and 4). Overall, these findings suggest that eyespots may increase liking for an animal and sensitize humans to conservation. We discuss possible implications for biodiversity conservation and future research directions.

AB  - Background
   Protection motivation to practice preventive behaviors is necessary for sustained mitigation during coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); however, limited research exists on the ecological sources of influence for COVID-19 protection motivation.
   Aim
   To explore sources of influence (family health, media consumption, and loss of work hours) on COVID-19 protection motivation.
   Method
   An online quantitative survey of U.S. adults (N = 501) aged 18 years or older was administered using Qualtrics with participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk. Data were collected on constructs related to the protection motivation theory and theory of planned behavior as well as sources of influence and intention to socially distance and socially isolate during COVID-19. Constructs were further defined through exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Structural equation modeling was used to determine relationships between constructs.
   Results
   A two-factor model was identified with threat appraisal as one factor and subjective norms appraisal, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention loading as another factor. Higher news media consumption and loss of work hours due to COVID-19 were both significant predictors of increased threat appraisal. Family healthy lifestyle and family health resources were significantly related to increases in the subjective norms, coping appraisal, and behavioral intention appraisal factor.
   Conclusions
   Family health, news media consumption, and loss of work hours are associated with COVID-19 protection motivation. COVID-19 protection motivation might be enhanced through policies and messaging that can affect ecological sources of influence.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to develop an effective health communication strategy to guide the decision-making process of parents considering getting their children HPV vaccines. Using inoculation theory and findings on tone of voice as theoretical frameworks, the present study conducted a 2 (message type: inoculation vs. supportive) x 2 (tone of voice: human voice vs. organizational voice) mixed experiment with a total of 231 U.S. parents (either mother or father of a child eligible for the HPV vaccine). The results revealed that HPV vaccination promotions based on the inoculation message were more likely to generate positive attitudes toward the vaccination, higher intention to vaccinate their children, and higher intention to spread positive word of mouth (WOM) about HPV vaccination. Also, HPV vaccination promotions in the human voice were likely to increase the WOM intention more than those in the organizational voice. In regard to an interaction effect, human voice turned out to be more effective than organizational voice to generate the WOM intention when it comes to supportive messages; inoculation-based messages were similarly effective across the human and the organizational voice condition.

AB  - Information communication technologies (ICT) are an integral part of contemporary family life, though the existing research about its impact is scarce, less than definitive, and individually based, as well as failing to attend to cross-cultural and cross-national dimensions. This study investigates how family clinicians construe the impact of ICT in the clinical context. A survey directed at family clinicians (N = 258) in four countries (Canada, Mexico, Spain and the USA) was designed to gather data on their beliefs about the impact of the emerging ICT on families and on their own clinical practice. The study found differences in the use of ICT across countries and correlation analyses showed there were more positive attitudes about the impact of emerging ICT on family dynamics among the clinicians whose use them the most.
   Practitioner points A constructive attitude towards emerging technology may enhance the effective use of technology in family therapy. The use of technology for personal and professional purposes by therapists may elicit appreciative conversations with families about its impact on family processes. Emerging digital technologies may enable clinicians to involve family members in virtual exercises and participation.

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic drastically altered the way of life around the world. Due to social distancing measures, contact restrictions and fears of infection, social life has changed significantly. These measures along with the stressors associated with the current worldwide situation, will inevitably have an effect on people's interpersonal and personal behaviors.
   Aim: This study evaluates the effect the COVID-19 pandemic and nationwide German lockdown had on the sexual behavior of cis men.
   Methods: An anonymous nationwide web-based questionnaire was conducted among cis men in Germany during the first COVID-19 home isolation (April 20, 2020-July 20, 2020). The questionnaire was distributed via e-mail, online chats and social-media platforms.
   Main Outcome Measures: Data was collected on general characteristics including demographics and socio-economic backgrounds. To evaluate sexual health, questions from the Sexual Behavior Questionnaire were included.
   Results: 523 cis male participated. 414 met the inclusion criteria. Most were heterosexual (n = 248, 59.9%; vs homosexual n = 97, 23.4%; vs bisexual n = 69, 16.7%). 243 (59%) were employed, 153 (37.1%) were students and 16 (3.9%) were unemployed. Most of the participants reported an annual income lower than 75.000 euro . During the lockdown, average weekly frequency of sexual intercourse and masturbation was increased in all groups. Consistently, a significant rise of higher satisfaction with the frequency of sexual contacts during the quarantine was observed (P < .05). Furthermore, the level of sexual arousal increased significantly in all groups (P < .0005). Capability to enjoy sexual intercourse or masturbation increased significantly in heterosexual (P < .0005) and homosexual men (P < .005). Bisexual participants showed a significant increase in general satisfaction with sexual life (P < .05) and a significant decrease in satisfaction in relationship or single life (P < .05). Positive confounders in the changing of sexual behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic were: Being in a relationship or being single, parenthood and being employed.
   Conclusion: Our study firstly describes how COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions and social distancing measurements altered sexual behavior amongst cis male in Germany. Further studies, including sexual minorities specifically, are needed to clarify if the behavior in the first German nationwide quarantine has persisted or transformed as the pandemic proceeded.

AB  - In current American political discourse, individuals tend to mistakenly conflate being an undocumented immigrant with being Latinx. This conflation puts Latinxs who are legal residents or citizens (Latinx-Americans) at risk of being negatively impacted by policies intended to deter undocumented immigrants. We examine whether being the target of anti-immigration policies would lead Latinx-Americans to politically engage on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 1 found that when Latinx-Americans were led to believe that what happens to undocumented immigrants will affect them personally (linked fate), those who were primed with greater conflation of the two groups expressed more positive attitudes toward undocumented immigrants and other Latinxs. Study 2 found that this pattern of effects extended to the willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of undocumented immigrants. Study 2 also examined the role of emotions (anger and fear) in mediating the relationship between the conflation of Latinxs with undocumented immigrants and collective action intentions. Together, the findings shed light on how current immigration policies affect relations among key subgroups within the Latinx community and the conditions under which Latinx-Americans will mobilize on behalf of undocumented immigrants.

AB  - Online learning environments facilitate improved student learning by offering IT tools to enhance student productivity- and creativity-in-learning. COVID-19 impacted social-distancing measures forced an abrupt switch to online learning in most universities, putting immense pressure on the students to creatively adapt to new ways of online learning. Despite the purported positives of online learning, in the COVID-19 scenario, students reported mixed outcomes. While some students could adapt to the 'new normal', others struggled to adjust to the transformed IT-enabled learning scenario. Grounding our work in IT mindfulness literature, we posit that an ITenabled learning environment may have differential impact on students' productivity- and creativity-in-learning, depending on the extent of their IT mindfulness. Besides leveraging the mindfulness-to-meaning theory, we hypothesize the mediating role of techno eustress in the relationship between student IT mindfulness and learning effectiveness. We test the theorized model through data collected via a two-wave survey in a university student population exclusively using IT-enabled learning environments during the pandemic lockdown period. Results indicate that IT mindfulness has significant positive relationships with both productivity- and creativityin- learning. Moreover, these relationships are mediated by the students' techno eustress perceptions. Theoretical and practical implications arising from our study are also discussed.

AB  - It prominently figures that media discourse has acquired a vantage point during the past decades over churches and trade unions as an influential source of information that could drastically shape public opinion. This article indulges into evincing how print media tacitly pass on their subjectivity through the deployment of reporting techniques that are wittingly chosen. Thus, this article moves beyond the formal concepts of narratology into the realm of pragmatics to scrutinize the reporting strategies of media discourse as embodied in Israeli print media. It endeavors to find palpable answers to three core questions that hover around: the reporting techniques utilized, the reasons beyond their use, and the impact of their choice on the redefinition of narratology. In doing so, 20 straight news reports are, respectively, elected for analysis fromHaaretzandJerusalem Postrunning from 2006 onward and endorsing the model of Leech and Short in its second edition. The main findings prove that Israeli print media gain objectivity through the use of direct and indirect speeches and override it when it comes to the free versions of reported speech. Narratology, hence, in its classical view aneeds to be linked to pragmatics in order to come to grips with questions related to intentionality and accountability.

AB  - Fear of evaluation and a negative view of the self are the core aspects of social anxiety. Self-compassion and self-esteem are two distinct positive attitudes toward the self, which are positively related to each other, well-being and good psychological functioning. It is less clear, however, how they interplay in socially anxious individuals and if self-compassion may reduce the negative effect of low self-esteem on social anxiety. The current research aimed at evaluating the directional links between those constructs to check if self-compassion mediates the effect of self-esteem on social anxiety. In this study, 388 adult participants with elevated social anxiety completed measures of self-compassion, self-esteem and social anxiety. As expected, both self-esteem and self-compassion correlated negatively with social anxiety and positively with one another, with lower self-esteem being a stronger predictor of social anxiety. Importantly, self-compassion partially mediated the relationship between self-esteem and social anxiety. These findings suggest that self-compassion partially explains the negative effects of deficits in self-esteem on social anxiety. Practical implications of the research are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: Our study aims to test the effectiveness of binding communication based interventions (vs classical persuasive communication based ones) inciting non-donors to act in favour of blood donation.
   Background: The implementation of effective communication interventions represents a major public health issue. Nevertheless, persuasive media campaigns appear to have little effect on behaviours. Even though non-donors hold a positive attitude towards blood donation, they are not inclined to donate. As an alternative to producing behavioural changes, many recent studies have shown the superiority of binding communication over persuasive communication.
   Methods: All participants, non-donors, were randomly assigned to one of four experimental conditions of a 2 (type of communication: persuasive vs binding) x 2 (source credibility: low vs high) factorial design. Then, they were asked to report their intention to donate blood, and their intention to distribute leaflets regarding blood donation.
   Results: Binding communication is a more effective strategy for increasing intention towards blood donation compared with persuasive communication, especially when combined with high credibility source.
   Discussion: Accordingly this study calls for more consideration of knowledge of social psychology to design effective communication interventions and increase the number of donations.

AB  - The impact of COVID-19 on healthcare in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) is a major challenge requiring urgent measures. Cancer care in LMICs, including Ghana, is faced with inadequate numbers of skilled healthcare professionals and essential material resources which negatively impacts the quality of healthcare and wellbeing of patients. In the face of COVID-19, cancer patients are likely to be affected in three key ways: access to healthcare, increased financial toxicity and increased mental health burden as a consequence of strict measures being implemented to contain the virus in Ghana, including partial lockdowns and social distancing. Some cultural beliefs regarding COVID-19 and its influence on the health and wellbeing of cancer patients have also been discussed. Measures by the government to lessen the burden on citizens and health workers are highlighted with possible recommendations for improvement in cancer care in Ghana and other LMICs during this pandemic.

AB  - Aims
   Time to Change, an anti-stigma programme in England, has worked to reduce stigma relating to mental illness in many facets of life. Newspaper reports are an important factor in shaping public attitudes towards mental illnesses, as well as working as a barometer reflecting public opinion. This study aims to assess the way that coverage of mental health topics and different mental illnesses has changed since 2008.
   Method
   Articles covering mental health in 18 different newspapers were retrieved using keyword searches on two randomly chosen days of each month in 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2019. A content analysis approach using a structured coding framework was used to extract information from the articles. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the change in odds of each hypothesised stigmatising or anti-stigmatising element occurring in 2019 compared to 2008 and 2016 with a Wald test to assess the overall significance of year as a predictor in the model. Further logistic regression models were used to assess the association between the diagnosis that an article was about and the odds that it was stigmatising, and whether this relationship is moderated by year of publication.
   Results
   A total of 6731 articles were analysed, and there was a significant increase in anti-stigmatising articles in 2019 compared to 2008 (OR 3.16 (2.60-3.84), p < 0.001) and 2016 (OR 1.40 (1.16-1.69), p < 0.001). Of the 5142 articles that specified a diagnosis, articles about schizophrenia were 6.37 times more likely to be stigmatising than articles about other diagnoses (OR 6.37 (3.05-13.29) p < 0.001), and there was evidence that the strength of this relationship significantly interacted with the year an article was published (p = 0.010). Articles about depression were significantly less likely to be stigmatising (OR 0.59 (0.69-0.85) p = 0.018) than those about other diagnoses, while there was no difference in coverage of eating disorders v. other diagnoses (OR 1.37 (0.67-2.80) p = 0.386); neither of these relationships showed an interaction with the year of publication.
   Conclusion
   Anti-stigma programmes should continue to work with newspapers to improve coverage of mental illness. However, interventions should consider providing specific guidance and promote awareness of rarer mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia, and evaluation should examine whether reductions in stigma extend to people with all mental illness diagnoses.

AB  - Ebola emerged on U.S. soil during the 2014 midterm election campaign, and the threat of infectious disease became prominent in political rhetoric. African immigrant communities experienced stigma and suspicion during the outbreak. This study investigates the implications of this epidemic on immigration attitudes. We fielded a survey experiment during the Ebola crisis with a sample of 3881 adults in the United States to examine the conditions under which global health threats affect domestic attitudes on immigration. Contrary to expectations, we find that the mere mention of Ebola has no effect on immigration attitudes, even when the identity of the Ebola carrier is described as an African traveler into the United States. Our results show, however, that politicizing the crisis can lead to more exclusionary attitudes toward immigrants. This finding is driven by partisanship: views of immigration were significantly more negative when Republican participants read a statement by a Republican politician critical of President Obama's Ebola response. The study has implications for future epidemics, including the important role political entrepreneurs can play in shaping public perceptions during a disease outbreak. The results raise concerns about how political rhetoric surrounding disease can have both short-term and longer term consequences for vulnerable populations.

AB  - This article examines the implementation problems of media-text discursive positions in the digital context, the means of strategies and scenarios for presenting and evaluating information, and image creation. The literal content of a media text often does not consist of a set of separate meanings of such a statement's components. Such a meanings' asymmetry of assessments can lead to ambiguity and cultural misunderstandings of the media content. All this makes it vital to create effective teaching techniques and modern courses in the media field. This study aims to establish the effectiveness of the training course "Media text creation technologies in the digital context" using a cognitive-pragmatic approach to the presentation of complex material; to show the relevance of pragmatic theories that form a positive attitude to the study of linguistic theory and its use in the digital media environment. The main one in the research methods' complex is the method of an experiment; analysis and synthesis are used to analyze theoretical material; during the pedagogical experiment, methods of observation, questionnaires, statistical methods are used. The hypothesis is that the cognitively and pragmatically oriented approach to media text are balancing the perception and retranslation of the message and its quality in digital media. The result indicates the determination of the "Media text creation technologies in the digital context" training course importance, which is aimed at the study of text-forming technologies in the digital context in a cognitively and pragmatically oriented way. The students' results show that the increase in performance and general satisfaction with the applying innovation in teaching complex and new material indicates that respondents felt a significant improvement in understanding and perception of the texts' pragmatics. The development and implementation of innovative pedagogical technologies that improve and facilitate the learning of the theory and practice of working with media-text in the digital context remain promising.

TI  - Gricean implicature and election predictions: A case of the Zimbabwean 2008 election campaign
T2  - SOUTHERN AFRICAN LINGUISTICS AND APPLIED LANGUAGE STUDIES
LA  - English
KW  - PARLIAMENTARY DISCOURSE
AB  - The article examines the nature of implicature realised in the election-prediction discourse in the Zimbabwean media. The focus is on how the print and electronic media, through its 'digestion' of news (Archakis & Tsakona, 2010), predicted the win or loss of political parties or candidates. The article shows how the media has been shaping public opinion in the run-up to the harmonised elections in Zimbabwe in 2008. In order to achieve this, the researcher employed the Gricean conceptualisation of implicature. It is argued that the cooperative principle and the suggested maxims are not observed during face-to-face conversation only. Taking into account the context of the newspaper, journalists are also expected to observe the cooperative principle and the maxims as they converse with the readers of their newspapers. Thus, the article examines how newspaper reporters try to be cooperative while at the same time aligning readers with a particular ideology and political party. The violation or flouting of the maxims has been observed in the newspaper reports as a strategy to shape public opinion, aligning the readers with a particular winning candidate.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic forced universities to push the use of distance learning, impacting an unprecedented number of students. New norms of social distancing and lockdown had been brought in as university measures, immediately modifying student and lecturer habits, changing from the traditional classroom to e-learning platforms. However, the lack of engagement of students throughout an e-learning system is a regular concern among lecturers when creating content on a system. This study presents an applied gamification concept to e-learning focusing on improving engagement of the various types of personalities of undergraduate students in ERP courses. The gamification design was developed by implementing the pros and cons of each game element to compromise the overall performance of students. Three evaluations were conducted:1) to test whether the student has competently gained ERP knowledge; 2) web monitor to record the activity of students; 3) to evaluate the qualitative information of the game experience by interviews. According to the study, the selection of a game element based on personality traits does not necessarily improve knowledge but proves to allow better engagement in the course. In addition, our finding also provides the suggestions for designing game elements based on personality traits.

AB  - Social distancing measures against COVID-19 imposed restrictions on students that may have affected their physical health and fitness. The objective of this study was to investigate the change in physical fitness of primary school students across the coronavirus outbreaks from 2019 to 2021. This was a retrospective repeated cross-sectional study. We obtained the annual physical and fitness assessment data measured every November for all students at the same primary school in Guangzhou, China. There was a total of 6371 observations in the dataset for three years. The physical fitness of the students was evaluated with an overall physical fitness score, body mass index (BMI), lung vital capacity, physical flexibility (via a sit-and-reach test) and sports task performances (sprint, shuttle run, rope-jumping, and sit-up). Generalised estimating equations were used to determine any significant changes from 2019 to 2021, adjusted for confounders. After the COVID-19 outbreak in 2021, there was a significant elevation in BMI of 0.64 kg/m(2) in 2020 and 0.39 kg/m(2) in 2021 (p < 0.001). The overall physical fitness score was significantly increased by 2.1 and 4.1 points, respectively, in 2020 and 2021 (p < 0.001). Lung vital capacity and rope-jumping performance were significantly improved in both 2020 and 2021 compared with 2019, and sit-up performance was marginally significantly improved in 2020 and significantly improved in 2021. However, students demonstrated poorer flexibility and sprint and shuttle run performance in 2021 compared with 2019. A health promotion programme during and after COVID-19, including online physical education classes, television broadcasts, and a rope-jumping campaign, could account for these positive outcomes, along with the ease of administering rope-jumping and sit-ups at home.

AB  - Objective: Nurse shortage is a critical problem for global healthcare services. It impacts the quality of clinical care. Work engagement is the core competence of hospitals, which indicates employee's positive attitude toward organization and work. This study aimed to explore the relationships among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was designed, and 320 nurses from tertiary hospitals in China completed the questionnaires that included demographic information, calling scale, employee engagement scale, and organizational commitment scale. Pearson correlation was performed to test the correlations among calling, organizational commitment, and work engagement. Stepwise regression analyses were performed to explore the mediating role of organizational commitment. The bootstrap method was employed to confirm the mediating effect.
   Results: Nurses' work engagement score was at the medium degree, whereas calling and organizational commitment were in the medium to high level. The results revealed that calling, organizational commitment, work engagement, and each dimension were positively correlated with one another (r = 0.145-0.922, P < 0.01). The organizational commitment plays a partially mediating effect between calling and work engagement (beta = 0.603 to 0.333, P <0.01).
   Conclusions: The mediation effect of organizational commitment was verified, which provided a comprehensive understanding of how calling impacted work engagement. Moreover, administrators should not only promote interventions to increase work engagement but also pay attention to calling and organizational commitment so as to improve their work engagement. Taken together, increased level of work engagement is required in the current nursing field. (C) 2019 Chinese Nursing Association. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: There has been some ground-breaking research on self-directed learning (SDL) in nursing education which reveals the superiority of SDL to traditional learning methods in terms of students' academic performance and the development of positive attitudes toward the learning process on the part of both students and teachers.
   Objectives: The relationship between students' self-directed learning readiness (SDLR) and students' academic performance, and the mediating role of students' perceptions of the learning environment needs further investigation. In this study, it is proposed that students' perceptions of their learning environment could enhance their SDLR and thus boost their academic performance (in terms of their GPA).
   Design: A descriptive design was used to examine the relationships between the domains of SDLR, which are self-management, desire to learn and self-control and students' perceptions of the learning environment (SPLE) and students' GPA.
   Data source: A survey involving 142 Saudi students from nursing and emergency medical services undergraduate programs in King Saud University was used for this research.
   Results: The results showed that SDLR level positively influenced students' academic performance positively, and that students' perceptions of their learning environment played a significant role in determining their level of SDLR and academic performance.
   Conclusion: It is recommended that nursing and emergency medical services educators provide a supportive learning environment in terms of good teaching, clear goals and standards, appropriate assessment, appropriate workload, and emphasis on independence to encourage students to engage in the process of SDL which can, in turn, enhance their academic performance.

AB  - Background: The present study examined whether there are differences in job-related attitudes and well-being among physicians working in private sector and public sector. In addition, we examined whether psychosocial factors (organizational justice and job control) could mediate these possible differences in different sectors. Methods: Cross-sectional survey data from the Finnish Health Professional Study was used. A random sample of Finnish physicians included 1522 women and 1047 men aged 25-65 years. Outcome variables were job satisfaction, organizational commitment, psychological distress, work ability and sleeping problems. Job control and organizational justice were measured using established questionnaires. Series of regression analyses were performed and the mediational effects were tested following the procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny. Results: Physicians working in private sector had higher levels of job satisfaction and organizational commitment and lower levels of psychological distress and sleeping problems when compared with physicians working in public sector. Private physicians also had higher levels of organizational justice, which acted as a mediator behind more positive attitudes and better well-being in private sector. Private physicians had higher levels of job control but it did not act as a mediator. Conclusions: Private physicians feel better than public physicians and this is partly due to higher organizational justice in private sector. Public health care organizations should invest effort to increase the fairness in their organizations and management and pay more attention in improving the well-being of their employees, which could possibly increase the attractiveness of public sector as a career option.

AB  - The information dissemination in social networks is affected by many factors. However, node attitude which is an important influence factor of information dissemination in social network have not been fully considered in the previous works. Aiming at the problem of the influence of node attitude on information dissemination, this paper proposes an information propagation model based on evolutionary game. Firstly, from the individual point of view, the node's attitude update rules are defined according to non-Bayesian social learning rules. Secondly, an inter-node game matrix based on attitude value is established. Based on the evolution analysis paradigm, an information dissemination model based on node attitude is established. The equilibrium solution of dynamic equations is replicated for both positive and negative attitudes, and the corresponding equilibrium points are stabilized. The validity of the proposed model is verified by numerical analysis and simulation experiments. They all show that the different attitudes of nodes play an important role in information dissemination.

AB  - An experiment aimed at developing creative thinking and emotional literacy in adolescents was carried out. The study involved 25 adolescents aged 14-16 years and their parents-37 people (37-45 years old). Based on the use of the NanoStudio application, a creative improvisation training session was conducted among adolescents in the context of educational cases. The methodology for the development of creative skill turned out to be interesting, exciting, and effective; collaboration with children, according to parents, created an atmosphere of community and promoted an active and passionate desire for joint creative actions. The results of the survey of adolescents demonstrated a positive attitude to the implementation of creative practices which was accompanied by interest, enthusiasm, joy, trust, admiration, delight, and optimism. Since adolescence is a period of increased emotionality, which is characterized by risky behavior associated with the formation of new views, values, and interests, the need of young people for psychological adaptation, the practical value of the study lies in demonstrating the practical experience of transforming the emotional experiences of adolescents into a creative musical product, as an alternative behavior, in terms of interaction of personal, parental, and pedagogical contexts.

AB  - Turkey hosts the largest Syrian refugee population in the world. As an attempt to understand antecedents of residents attitudes towards Syrian refugees, the present study aimed to investigate the relationships between contact experience, perception of threat, and the attitudes. Specifically, we hypothesized that perception of threat would mediate the relationship between contact experience and the attitudes. Frequency of different contact types, threats associated with economic, cultural, and criminal risks, and attitudes towards male or female targets based on preferred social distance were subjected to analyses in an adult sample of 170 women and 183 men. Results revealed a full mediation effect both for female and male Syrian refugee targets. We discussed the findings referring the observed nature of contact as mostly being casual, threat level being high, and attitudes being relatively negative within a specific media-effects framework.

AB  - An online experiment examined the effects of Instagram posts' source types and product-placement types on brand attitude and credibility perception. A 2 (source: brand versus Instagram influencer) x 2 (product placement: product-only [explicit product placement] versus influencer-with-product [moderate product placement]) between-subjects factorial experiment (N = 304) tested the effects of the two manipulated factors on source credibility, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Two-way ANOVAs indicate a main effect of source types on perceived trustworthiness and interaction effects of product-placement and source types on perceived expertise, corporate credibility, and attitude toward brand posts. Consumers exposed to brand as the source conditions indicated no difference in corporate credibility and brand attitude regardless of product-placement types. In contrast, consumers exposed to Instagram influencer as the source conditions indicated higher corporate credibility and more positive attitude toward brand posts when exposed to the influencer-with-product conditions than when exposed to the product-only conditions. Consumers differently react to product placement on Instagram influencers' accounts depending on whether the influencers are present versus absent. Consumers react negatively to influencers' posts when they do not appear with the products they endorse. Parasocial interaction mediates the relationship between product/brand placement types and corporate credibility.

AB  - Methods of communications and the nature of messaging are critically important in influencing public behavior. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in major disruptions to all aspects of life globally and has triggered multiple approaches of health messaging to the general public to communicate COVID-19 preventative measures. This study aimed to identify: (1) differences between age groups in the main avenues used by people to obtain COVID-19 related information; and (2) whether age and information sources were associated with correct interpretation of government messaging relating to how people understand or interpret the terms "self-isolation" and "social distancing." An online survey was conducted in 2020. Participants were aged over 18 years and grouped into age group decades. Differences in sources of COVID-19 information were compared visually between age groups. Logistic regression was used to determine whether age and each of the various methods of communication of COVID-19 information were independently associated with correct response to the self-isolation, or the social distancing statements. There were 3,300 survey respondents 85% female; age sub-groups: 18-29 (7.4%); 30-39 (10.6%); 40-49 (17.6%); 50-59 (22.9%); 60-69 (25.9%); 70-79 (13.9%); and 80+ (1.7%). People accessed public health messaging information from a wide variety of sources that changed as they aged (e.g., older people were more likely to be exposed to COVID-19 information via television news programs and less likely via social media platforms). Age was frequently associated with whether the message key terms were interpreted correctly or incorrectly, but in some cases, it promoted more correct responses whereas in others, fewer correct responses. There was no difference between being exposed to COVID-19 information via mainstream media, compared with social media, or compared with Government sources of information, in terms of whether COVID-19 messages were interpreted correctly. In order to improve future public health messaging, there is a need for multiple avenues of communication to meet the needs and preferences across and within age groups. Further investigation is warranted into the clarity of the content and method of delivery of public health messages, to ensure optimal understanding of public health messages by vulnerable populations and across the community.

AB  - Amongst medical undergraduates, the perception of educational environment (EE) has been associated with academic achievement and positive attitude toward the course. Nonetheless, there are sparse data on how it influences various learning processes and outcomes especially within psychiatry training. Consistent with situativity and self-determination learning theories, we hypothesized that a positive perception of the EE within psychiatry postings will be beneficial for the learning process, specifically pertaining to greater motivation to learn, better engagement, allowing them to feel more equipped, and greater appreciation of the subject. The DREEM (Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure) was administered to fourth-year medical undergraduate students from the Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, Singapore, undergoing psychiatry rotations from 2015 to 2019. The students also completed five additional items evaluating the specific learning processes (motivation to learn, engagement, equipping, and appreciation of the subject) and overall rating of the posting. We examined the relationship between DREEM domains and learning processes using correlation analysis. We explored learning processes as mediators of the relationship between total DREEM scores and overall rating of the posting. Altogether, 1343 (response rate 89.5%) medical undergraduates participated in the study. The overall DREEM score was 157.01 +/- 15.86. Overall DREEM and subdomain scores were significantly correlated with several learning processes (r = 0.354 to 0.558, all p < .001). Motivation and engagement were significant mediators of the relationship between total DREEM scores and overall rating of the psychiatry posting. Our results highlighted that a positive perception of EE was associated with the specific learning processes that mediated the overall rating of the posting. In the context of relevant learning theories and our study findings, improvement of the EE within undergraduate psychiatry training can potentially enhance overall learning experience through better motivation and engagement of our learners.

AB  - ObjectiveThe study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the public in Malaysia. MethodsA cross-sectional study was conducted online among the general public in Malaysia from June 2020 to August 2020 between the second and third wave (Phase 3 of the Recovery Movement Control Order). Participants were conveniently recruited through multiple social media platforms to encourage nationwide participation. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. For descriptive analysis, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to report demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. For inferential analysis, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Chi-square test, and Binary Logistic Regression was used to analyze the study variables' differentiation, association, and correlations. The confidence interval selected for this study was 95%. ResultsA total of 420 respondents participated in this survey. The majority of the participants (n = 412, 98%) were aware of COVID-19. Most participants (60%) learned about the pandemic through social media. About half of the participants had poor knowledge (45.5%) and a negative attitude (43.3%). Participants residing in urban areas showed good preventive practices as compared to those residing in rural areas (P < 0.05). There was a significant association between participants' attitudes and preventive practices toward COVID-19, where the majority of the participants (57.4%) who showed negative attitudes were more likely to follow poor preventive practices. ConclusionDespite having good knowledge, participants with a negative attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to follow the preventive practices of COVID-19. People's mindset and willingness may play an important role to influence their practices. Thus, these are the vulnerable groups, and strategies should be made to change their mindset through proper counseling and education.

AB  - This study aims to assess the effectiveness of immersive environments that have been implemented by museums to attract new visitors. Based on the frameworks introduced by telepresence and media richness theories, and following a constructivist-based learning approach, we argue that the greater the similarity of an online museum experience is to its physical counterpart, the more positive will be the observer's perception of the collection. We reason that the similarity would lead online visitors to develop greater cognitive involvement which in turn will produce more positive attitudes toward the collection. In support of this argument, we present the results of a comparative study in which 565 participants were exposed randomly to four different exhibitions: two-dimensional collections of art and aircraft museums and three-dimensional tours of similar museums. Results indicate that whereas 3D tours have a strong effect on users' intentions to visit the real museum, cognitive involvement and sense of presence mediate the association between these variables. In terms of managerial implications, our study shows that if educational professionals want to stimulate their students to visit museums, 3D tours appear to be more effective for engaging learners through a realistic-looking environment. By offering richer perceptual cues and multimodal feedback (e.g., users can view 3D objects from multiple viewpoints or zoom in/out the objects), the study suggests that participants may increase their reasoning process and become more interested in cultural content.

AB  - The aim of this research is to examine the extent to which certain sociodemographic characteristics of students and teachers, along with computer self-efficacy, attitudes towards the new media and the frequency of using the new media in instruction, can be regarded as predictors of constructivist teaching. The research was carried out on a sample of a group (N=1528) of eighth-grade students (n=1026) and class and subject teachers (n=502) in primary and lower secondary school (ISCED level 1 and 2). Data was collected through survey questionnaires with relevant instruments. The results show that, in terms of students, their sociodemographic characteristics, a higher level of computer self-efficacy, more positive attitudes towards new media and more frequent use of new media, as separate factors, are significant predictors of constructivist learning. In terms of teachers, their attitudes and computer self-efficacy are significant, but their sociodemographic characteristics and the use of new media are not. The entire final series, both in terms of teachers and students, is a significant predictor of constructivist learning, where certain separate dimensions of predictor factors are more significant than others. The greatest variance of constructivist teaching, both in terms of students and teachers, can be explained by the attitude towards new media and computer self-efficacy rather than the use of new media in instruction, as confirmed by some previous theoretical assumptions. Although significant correlations were obtained, the results point to an occasional organisation of constructivist teaching. The possible reasons and implications of such results are explained in this paper.

AB  - Intense concern about obesity in the public imagination and in political, academic and media discourses has catalysed advocacy efforts to implement regulatory measures to reduce the occurrence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. This article explores public attitudes towards the possible implementation of regulations to address obesity by analysing emotions within popular discourses. Drawing on reader comments attached to obesity-relevant news articles published on Australian news and current affairs websites, we examine how popular anxieties about the 'obesity crisis' and vitriol directed at obese individuals circulate alongside understandings of the appropriate role of government to legitimise regulatory reform to address obesity. Employing Ahmed's theorisation of 'affective economies' and broader literature on emotional cultures, we argue that obesity regulations achieve popular support within affective economies oriented to neoliberal and individualist constructions of obesity. These economies preclude constructions of obesity as a structural problem in popular discourse; instead positioning anti-obesity regulations as a government-endorsed vehicle for discrimination directed at obese people. Findings implicate a new set of ethical challenges for those championing regulatory reform for obesity prevention.

AB  - Teachers' belief toward students with special educational needs (SEN) in the regular classroom is a condition that may influence the implementation of inclusive education. Nevertheless, some studies suggest that teachers' attitudes or self-efficacy beliefs toward students with behavioral difficulties (BD) are quite negative, but much less emphasis has been placed on the factors and mechanisms contributing to these attitudes. This study investigates associations between pre-service teachers' (PT) attitudes toward students with BD, PT's individual characteristics including self-efficacy beliefs, and PT's education program characteristics. Participants surveyed were 1,499 PT enrolled in a 4-year teacher education program (bachelor's degree) in Quebec Province, Canada. Descriptive analysis showed that PT's report generally positive attitudes toward students with BD on the three components of attitudes, while behavioral components were significantly more positive than the affective and cognitive components. Among the individual characteristics of PTs, the more advanced their academic level, the more negative their attitudes were on all three components. The characteristics related to the teacher education program (general vs. special) and the number of hours of courses on the BD revealed significant differences only on the cognitive component. Results of the mediation analysis further revealed that the association between the PT's characteristics and the three components of attitudes was mediated by PT's self-efficacy beliefs. Results are discussed considering their implications for the field of teacher education.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic will have long-term consequences due to social and economic disruption. This study aimed to understand the contextual, media, and economic factors associated with anticipated mental health consequences from the COVID-19 pandemic among Americans. A nationally representative survey of 1001 respondents was conducted in April 2020. Chi-square tests and logistic regressions examined anticipated emotional or psychological effects on respondents or members of their households should social distancing measures continue. Specific analyses focused on: 1) COVID-19 experience -knowing someone or being infected; living in a state with a high death rate; or state social distancing policies; 2) media exposure -source of coronavirus information and time spent on coronavirus news; and 3) economics -current economic effects; and anticipated longterm financial effects. 41% of respondents anticipated mental health consequences. Living in a state with a greater COVID-19 death rate (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.10, 2.72) and anticipating long-term financial difficulties (OR 2.98; 95% CI 1.93, 4.60) were both associated with greater likelihood of anticipated mental health consequences. Those whose primary news source was television, as opposed to print or online, were almost 50% less likely to anticipate mental health challenges (OR 0.52 CI 0.33, 0.81), while those who reported spending two or more hours daily on COVID-19 news were 90% more likely (OR 1.90; 95% CI 1.27, 2.85). Aspects of community health, media consumption, and economic impacts influence anticipated poor mental health from the COVID-19 pandemic, suggesting each domain is relevant to interventions to address the consequences.

AB  - The purpose of study was to test an extended model of Ajzen's theory of planned behavior (TPB). to understand the usage of social networking websites (SNWs) particularly the Facebook in Pakistan. The extended model consisted of variables that were past behavior of using Facebook, its manifest and latent functions. A sample of 480 students, between 16 and 24 years of age, was randomly selected from four universities located in Lahore, Pakistan using multistage sampling method. Descriptive statistics of demographic variables were generated to see patterns of Facebook usage. Simple linear regression and multivariate regression analysis was carried out to see the association between independent and dependent variables. The findings of the present study validated the efficacy of standard as well as extended model of TPB by identifying tendencies that can help explain an individual's usage of SNWs in societies like Pakistan. The analysis suggest that an individual's positive attitude towards Facebook, the approval of its usage by significant others' and perceived control over the usage increases the intention to use it. Additionally, higher the intentions to use Facebook, higher will be the actual usage. The intention to continue using Facebook was further strengthened by perceived manifest and latent functions of Facebook. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction and AimsMass media education campaigns targeting parents may influence parent factors that reduce adolescent drinking; however few such campaigns have been evaluated.
   Design and MethodsThe Parents, Young People and Alcohol campaign included two phases of mass media advertising, Cogs and I See, to deliver consistent messages across multiple media channels. The campaign targeted Western Australian parents of 12-17year olds with messages describing alcohol's effect on the developing brain and adolescent physical and mental health. The campaign reinforced the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) Guideline that for under 18s, not drinking is the safest option. Parent knowledge, attitudes and behaviours were assessed via cross-sectional surveys administered before the campaign (Time 1) and at two post-tests (Time 2; Time 3). Post-test campaign awareness and perceptions were also assessed.
   ResultsCampaign awareness was high (48% Time 2; 80% Time 3) and over 86% of parents found the campaign believable and relevant at both post-tests. Increased knowledge of the NHMRC guideline and lower belief in alcohol myths were found at both post-tests compared to Time 1. Less positive attitudes to parental supply were found at Time 2, but were not sustained at Time 3. Parents were more likely to have discussed alcohol risks and limiting drinking with their child at Time 3, but parent-to-child alcohol supply did not change significantly.
   Discussion and ConclusionsThe campaign achieved high awareness and positively influenced parental outcomes. Longer term campaign implementation supported by policy and environmental measures may be required to change parental supply.

AB  - Domestic violence is a worldwide epidemic. This study examines the effects of narrative exemplars and a celebrity spokesperson in anti-domestic violence ads on Lebanese college students' attitudes and beliefs towards domestic violence and whether these effects are impacted by personal experience. The practical significance is derived from the high prevalence of domestic violence internationally, making it important to find ways to effectively use media to address this health-related issue that has huge consequences for the individual and society. This study adds to the theoretical understanding of narrative persuasion and media effects. Results indicated that narrative exemplars in anti-domestic violence ads promoting bystander awareness and intervention were more beneficial for people without relevant experience compared to people who know someone affected by domestic violence. Anti-domestic violence ads without narrative exemplars, but that also featured an emotional self-efficacy appeal targeting bystanders, were more effective for participants who know someone who had experienced domestic violence compared to participants without relevant experience. The presence of a celebrity spokesperson elicited more positive attitudes about the ad than a noncelebrity, but failed to directly affect relevant anti-domestic violence attitudes or beliefs. These results highlight the significance of formative audience research in health communication message design.

AB  - As the COVID-19 pandemic rapidly escalated in early 2020 and shelter-at-home orders cascaded around the world, celebrities streamed live performances from living rooms, home studios, and empty opera houses. Social media buzzed with gratitude for the entertainment, inspiration, and camaraderie that developed between ordinary citizens and celebrities sharing music from isolation via media technology. Celebrities also called upon their industry connections and friendships to create collaborative fundraising events, support working musicians whose tours were cancelled, and highlight amateur performers. Musicians who streamed simple performances from relatively modest homes and provided glimpses of their 'real lives' - their talents, personalities, homes, friendships, and families - won praise from audiences. Touring musicians and theatre performers in particular provide fascinating moments of empowered participatory citizenship during the pandemic. Beloved by relatively small, active fandoms but not widely popular outside their specific genres, these celebrities are positioned to provide meaningful social media connections with their devoted fans while not necessarily garnering high-profile media attention for their efforts. My critical analysis explores how musicians and theatre performers have responded to social distancing by sharing their music and fostering moments of connection with audiences who were seeking comfort during a global crisis.

AB  - The development of organic food products has proliferated over the past few decades, alongside the use of "white" space on products' packaging as an element that communicates quality and sustainability values. Despite a growing interest towards green products, sustainable business practices and aesthetics, there is not enough evidence on how specific design elements (i.e., "white" space) of organic food packaging could affect consumers' brand perceptions, attitude towards the brand (Abr) and purchase intentions (PI). The present study seeks to unveil the role of "white" space as a packaging design element on the effectiveness of organic food products. Based on a content analysis of 406 international packaging designs it establishes the widespread coexistence of organic products with extended, in shades of gray "white" space. A between-subjects experiment with 305 young adults builds on the associations between "white" space and sustainability, and provides evidence on the proposed serial mediation model with perceived naturalness, quality and trustworthiness, and Abr as mediators in the relationship between organic food products and PI, especially when the packaging uses extended "white" space. Pertinent managerial implications with respect to effective packaging design that promotes sustainability values and generates positive attitudes and behaviors towards organic foods are underlined.

AB  - Recent worldwide growing awareness of the global climate changes stressed the importance of developing and supporting the renewable energy sources (RES). However, the public support for RES varies across various countries and regions, especially those abundant in traditional fossil fuels. This paper presents the analysis of the public views of the economics of the renewable energy using the results of the online survey (N = 750) conducted in several regions of the Russian Federa-tion, a country abundant in natural gas and oil. Our results indicate that there is a mixed opinion on trust in RES as opposed to the traditional energy sources. Even though we found some sup-port for the renewable energy technologies, it appears that it is correlated with the respondents ' concerns about the environmental protection and sustainable development as well as with some demographic variables. The outcomes of the regression analysis confirmed that positive attitudes towards climate protection predetermined the support for various types of RES, while the financial or political gains did not come through as significant. The results indicate that public views on the renewable energy sources could and should be shaped by the information campaigns and presen-tations in mass media conducted by relevant policymakers and public authorities.

AB  - The successful impact of healthy eating campaigns often depends on the extent to which messages are effective in changing attitudes and behaviors over time. The present work proposes that healthy eating campaigns can be designed taking into consideration elaboration and validation processes so that the degree of attitude change is maximally influenced and is consequential. The first set of studies described in this review demonstrates the importance of considering elaboration in determining initial attitudes toward healthy foods as well as the subsequent attitude strength consequences (e.g., stability, prediction of behavior, spreading). The second set of studies focuses on the role of perceived validity of one's thoughts in the domain of eating as a potential mediator of the persuasion process. These studies include campaigns promoting positive attitudes toward healthy eating (e.g., eating of vegetables and fruits), and interventions oriented to decreasing the intake of unhealthy food (e.g., taxing junk food). We also discuss the role of modality of information presentation (e.g., verbal and visual information vs. direct physical experience) in those studies. Finally, the review offers a tutorial with concrete recommendations that researchers, practitioners and public policy makers can follow in order to predict both short and long-term attitude and behavior changes.

AB  - Purpose-The aim of this study is to assess the direct and indirect impact of the prominence dimensions of fit between a brand and a cause on consumer intentions to purchase cause-related products by considering cases with more versus less positive attitudes towards a brand and a higher versus lower social cause affinity.
   Design/methodology/approach-The study is based on data obtained via a survey of 403 respondents in Lithuania. A between-subjects study design with different brands and causes was used to identify the role of the differences in brand attitude and cause affinity on the message strength.
   Findings-The data analysis has revealed that the specific prominence dimensions of fit (relationship visibility, relationship explicitness, visuals/colours, local attributes) have a direct and indirect impact, via the message strength, on consumer intentions to purchase cause-related products. Additionally, the mediation of the message strength was dependent on attitudes towards a brand but not on cause affinity.
   Originality/value-This is the first attempt to contribute to filling the research gap regarding the impact of the prominence dimensions of fit on the intention to purchase a cause-related product. Paying special attention to message strength mediation allowed for the assessment of both the direct and indirect effects of the individual dimensions of fit.

AB  - Objective:To assess healthcare workers' knowledge and attitudes about human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, related diseases, and prevention.Methods:A cross-sectional multicenter survey about HPV and its prevention, targeted to healthcare workers involved in HPV vaccine counseling, was performed from May 2017 to December 2018.Results:The overall median knowledge and attitude scores were 69.2% (25-75,p= 61.5-84.6) and 5 (25-75,p= 4-5), respectively. Both knowledge and attitudes statistically significantly differ between physicians and healthcare professions. The median propensity score before and after the educational intervention was stable and high, at 10 (25-75,p= 9-10). The predictors of statistically significantly high knowledge scores are to be a physician, general practitioner, or pediatrician, attending courses/congresses, and consulting technical product characteristics and scientific literature to obtain information about the HPV vaccine. Being a physician and consulting scientific literature to obtain information about the HPV vaccine were found also as predictors of statistically significantly different attitude scores among study participants.Conclusions:Although healthcare workers showed overall positive attitudes towards the relevance of HPV burden and prevention tools, demonstrated knowledge was largely suboptimal, particularly that shown by healthcare professions. Obtained results allow highlighting knowledge gaps, and thus improving counselling to HPV vaccine targets.

AB  - In vitro meat (IVM) grown from animal cells is approaching commercial viability. This technology could enable consumers to circumvent the ethical and environmental issues associated with meat-eating. However, consumer acceptance of IVM is uncertain, and is partly dependent on how the product is framed. This study investigated the effect of different names for IVM on measures of consumer acceptance. Participants (N = 185) were allocated to one of four conditions in an experimental design in which the product name was manipulated to be 'clean meat', 'cultured meat', 'animal free meat', or 'lab grown meat'. Participants gave word associations and measures of their attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the product. The results indicated that those in the 'clean meat' and 'animal free meat' conditions had significantly more positive attitudes towards IVM than those in the lab grown meat' condition, and those in the 'clean meat' condition had significantly more positive behavioural intentions towards IVM compared to those in the 'lab grown meat' condition. Mediation analyses indicated that the valence of associations accounted for a significant amount of the observed differences, suggesting that anchoring can explain these differences. We discuss these results in the context of social representations theory and give recommendations for future research.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the knowledge, attitude and practice of self-medication in medical undergraduate students.
   Method: This cross-sectional questionnaire-based survey was conducted from January to June, 2017, among undergraduate students of Ayub Teaching Hospital, Women Medical College, International Medical College and Frontier Medical College in Abbottabad, Pakistan. The sample comprised students of first, second, third, fourth and fifth professional year. Data was collected using self-generated questionnaire.
   Results: Of the 400 subjects approached, 300(75%) returned the questionnaire fully completed. Of them, 208(69.3%) were females and 92(30.66%) were males. The most common age group was 22-25 years 182(60.7%). Self-medication was found to be prevalent among 297(99%) subjects and 139(46.3%) respondents had practised self-medication in the preceding 6 months more than two times. Over-the-counter drugs were commonly used for the self-medication in 295(98.3%) cases. Overall, 285(95%) respondents had a positive attitude towards self-medication. Media was found to be the most common source of information for 93(31%) cases.
   Conclusion: High prevalence of self-medication was noticed, with over-the-counter drugs being the most commonly used. Proper educational awareness programmes about self-medication can control the issue.

AB  - Objective
   To investigate Australian urologists' knowledge, attitudes and beliefs, and the association of these with treatment preferences relating to guideline-recommended adjuvant radiotherapy for men with adverse pathologic features following radical prostatectomy.
   Subjects and methods
   A nationwide mailed and web-based survey of Australian urologist members of the Urological Society of Australia and New Zealand (USANZ).
   Results
   157 surveys were included in the analysis (45% response rate). Just over half of respondents (54%) were aware of national clinical practice guidelines for the management of prostate cancer. Urologists' attitudes and beliefs towards the specific recommendation for post-operative adjuvant radiotherapy for men with locally advanced prostate cancer were mixed. Just over half agreed the recommendation is based on a valid interpretation of the underpinning evidence (54.1%, 95% CI [46%, 62.2%]) but less than one third agreed adjuvant radiotherapy will lead to improved patient outcomes (30.2%, 95% CI [22.8%, 37.6%]). Treatment preferences were varied, demonstrating clinical equipoise. A positive attitude towards the clinical practice recommendation was significantly associated with treatment preference for adjuvant radiotherapy (rho = 0.520, P < 0.0001). There was stronger preference for adjuvant radiotherapy in more recently trained urologists (registrars) while preference for watchful waiting was greater in more experienced urologists (consultants) (b = 0.156, P = 0.034; 95% CI [0.048, 1.24]). Urologists' attitudes towards clinical practice guidelines in general were positive.
   Conclusion
   There remains clinical equipoise among Australian urologists in relation to adjuvant radiotherapy for men with adverse pathologic features following radical prostatectomy.

AB  - This article is devoted to the analysis of cognitive distortion in the mass media as a method of forming a civic identity. Due to the increasing influence of mass media and information technologies, the growth of information impact, the problem of the formation of civil identity is becoming more and more significant, and the mass media is a tool for the formation of civil identity. The authors consider the method of cognitive distortion in the mass media as a method of forming a civic identity in modern media. Culture in the Russian and Chinese traditions reveals both universals and peculiarities. The authors analyze how the attitude to civil identity is transmitted in Russian and Chinese media discourses, which allows us to understand the difference in background knowledge and identify cognitive distortions in translation. The authors see differences in the ethno-pedagogic strategies of the state that ensure a positive attitude to civic identity in the Chinese digital space, which has parallels with the Soviet discourse. At the same time, the authors believe that the assimilation of Western models of admiration for their values has a negative impact on the formation of generational continuity and ethno-socio-cultural experience in the traditions of countries.

AB  - Background. Information about organ donation and transplantation (ODT) is the basis on which attitude toward this subject is shaped. The information about ODT that teachers can provide to school children is fundamental for them to develop a favorable attitude to this matter in the future.
   Objectives. The aims of this study were: 1) to determine the type of information on ODT received by secondary school teachers; 2) to determine through which means teachers obtain information about donation; and 3) to determine the influence of each information source on their attitudes.
   Methods. A sample was selected from 10 secondary schools, which were geographically stratified in southeast Spain. A validated questionnaire was applied about attitude toward ODT among teachers (n = 327), which was completed anonymously and was self-administered. The statistical analysis used the Student t test and the chi-square test.
   Results. The questionnaire completion rate was 88% (n = 288); 99% (n = 286) of the responding teachers stated that they had received some information about ODT, and 40% (n = 117) indicated that they had good or very good information. The teachers received information about ODT from several sources, the most frequent being audiovisual means: television (89%), press (60%), and radio (47%). Social/family means were also important, such as conversations with other people (51%) and conversations with family members (39%). Teachers who reported having good information were more in favor of ODT than those who had limited or no information (P = .001). Only the exchange of information through conversations with family members was related to a positive attitude (P = .009).
   Conclusions. Most secondary school teachers in southeast Spain receive information about ODT. However, fewer than half think that the information is good. Teachers receive information through different means, especially audiovisual means, mainly television. Nevertheless, the social/family means has the most influence on attitude.

AB  - The novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has affected the normal life of people around the world and has forced them to maintain social distance, self-quarantine and closing of many businesses. So, the people wish to share the information regarding the pandemic through social media e.g. Twitter. The key objective of this paper is to identify the sentiment associated with the pandemic by utilizing the tweets regarding the Coronavirus (COVID-19) and by using the python libraries to perform the task. We analyze the sentiment of people when Coronavirus has attained a peak level using the machine, deep learning techniques and TextBlob. We have classified the sentiments into positive and negative classes using the Machine Learning (NB, SVM, Logistic regression) approaches and deep learning-based Bi-LSTM model. The Bi-LSTM approach has achieved better accuracy (0.87) compared to the traditional machine learning models for Twitter sentiment classification. From the overall analysis, we could conclude that people are confident and they express more positivity towards the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Such an analysis will help the policy and decision-makers to address the needs of the public appropriately.

AB  - Creativity is a commonly assumed characteristic of entrepreneurs. It is proposed to be a necessary, although not sufficient, prerequisite for entrepreneurship. This study aimed to deepen our understanding of the relationship between self-perceived creativity and entrepreneurial intentions. To do so, we conducted a cross-sectional survey study among 559 university students. We tested an expanded model based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB), which included self-perceived creativity as a distal antecedent of entrepreneurial intentions. In addition, we examined both the role of perceived family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, in boosting self-perceived creativity. While some empirical evidence has indicated a direct link between (perceived) creativity and entrepreneurial intentions, the TPB posits that three antecedents (attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control/self-efficacy) would be the only direct determinants of intentions. All other factors are theorized to indirectly influence intentions through one or more of these components. The results of partial least squares structural modelling refuted this assumption. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy and positive attitudes did indeed mediate the self-perceived creativity - entrepreneurial intentions link, but self-perceived creativity explained additional variance in entrepreneurial intentions, beyond these TPB components. In addition, our results showed that family and university support for creativity, as well as taking a creativity course, were significant predictors of self-perceived creativity. Postgraduate students, and particularly male students, perceived greater university and family support and reported greater self-perceived creativity than did undergraduate students. We conclude that teaching creativity contents and practice are a useful way to enrich entrepreneurship programmes.

AB  - Aim - This study was aimed to investigate knowledge and attitudes of H1N1 influenza among pharmacy students.
   Material and Methods - A cross-sectional study was carried out among undergraduate and postgraduate students of the Punjab University College of Pharmacy, University of the Punjab, Lahore from February-May 2018. A self-administered questionnaire was used to evaluate knowledge and attitudes of H1N1 influenza. All data were analyzed using SPSS 22.
   Results - The median age of study participants (N=420) was 20 years, with majority of females (72.4%), undergraduate students (96.7%) belonging to middle economic class (89.8%). The median knowledge score was 18, with 38.1% having poor, 55.7% moderate and 6.2% excellent knowledge score (score <17, 17-25, and 26-34, respectively). The median attitude score was 47 (9); around 52% of the participants were found to have positive attitudes. Initially, there was a significant difference of knowledge score, not attitude, among age categories. However, in post hoc analysis, after Bonferroni adjustment (P<0.017), individuals > 26 years of age had better knowledge scores than 21-25 years (p=0.015) and <= 20 years (p=0.005) age categories. Gender had no significant influence on the knowledge as well as attitude score. Futhermore, postgraduate students had signifcanlty better knowledge scores, not attitude, than undergraduates (p=0.002).
   Conclusions - Our findings highlight the need to equip pharmacy students with comprehensive knowledge of H1N1 influenza so that in future they can help increase the public awareness at community pharmacies, hospitals or the communities they reside.

AB  - An online cross-sectional study was carried out to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practice about coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among primary health care providers (PHPs) at three tertiary care hospital, Peshawar, Pakistan. Data was collected via email and online social media platforms. Statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 25.0 was used for data analysis. Among the total participants (n = 114), 74 (66.7%) were male and 37 (33.3%) were female. The mean scores for knowledge, attitude and practice were 12.7 +/- 0.89, 8.9 +/- 4.1 and 7.3 +/- 1.2, respectively. Most of the participants knew the term COVID-19 and its mode of transmission (90%), signs and symptoms (84%) and risk factors (72%) associated with it. Most of the participants agreed that COVID-19 can be transmitted through coughing and sneezing (74.3%) and 84.6% were in favor that COVID-19 can be prevented by adopting preventive measures. Around 68.8% of the participants disagreed with the use of antibiotics in the prevention of COVID-19. Ninety percent of the respondents were avoiding close contact with the people having cough and flu-like symptoms. Most PHPs had good knowledge, positive attitude and reasonable practices regarding COVID-19. Moreover, focused training programs for PHPs at the Government level can further improve their understanding of risks and preventive strategies related to COVID-19, which will help them to provide appropriate care to their patients as well as to protect themselves from this infection.

KW  - CORONAVIRUS
AB  - Objective The aim of this study was to assess COVID-19-related knowledge, attitudes, and preventive practices of two Pakistani university populations.
   Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among students and employees of two higher education institutions in Lahore, Pakistan, namely the University of Lahore and the Gulab Devi Educational Complex. Participants were recruited using a convenient sampling method. A validated 45-item, self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Total possible scores were 0-14 for knowledge (scores < 7, 7-10 and > 10 were considered to indicate poor, moderate and good knowledge, respectively); 0- 7 for attitude (scores > 5 were considered to indicate a good attitude); and 0-18 for COVID-19 preventative practices (scores > 12 were considered to indicate good preventative practices).
   Results Of the 417 enrolled participants, 416 reported that they were aware of COVID-19 and social media was the major source of their information. Mean scores were 10.12 +/- 2.20 for knowledge (good, moderate and poor knowledge in 50.2%, 42.8% and 7.0% of participants, respectively); 5.74 +/- 1.28 for attitude (65.4% of individuals had a positive attitude); and 11.04 +/- 3.34 for COVID-19 preventative practices (only 36.5% of participants had good preventive practices).
   Conclusion Pakistani university students and employees have good knowledge and attitudes regarding COVID-19, but unsatisfactory preventive practices. Therefore, health regulators should use multiple communication approaches, such as electronic, print and social media, phone messages, etc., to increase awareness and improve practices related to COVID-19.

AB  - Background. Exercise is considered to be the most effective strategy to treat, prevent and delay frailty, a prevalent geriatric syndrome observed in clinical practice. Encouraging frail older people to take up exercise is crucial in the management of this condition. The study aimed to explore pre-frail and frail older peoples' perspectives in relation to being advised about exercise and their perceptions of the general practitioners' (GPs) role in promoting exercise for older people.
   Methods. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 community-dwelling older (median age 83 years) participants screened pre-frail or frail using the FRAIL Screen. Their attitudes towards exercise, the advice received, their access to relevant information and their perceptions of the GP's role in promoting exercise were explored. Thematic analysis was conducted to analyse data.
   Results. The majority of participants had a positive attitude towards exercise, and many participants indicated a preference for being advised firstly by their GPs and then other healthcare professionals. Participants living in the community reported difficulties in accessing information on exercise and indicated that local governments and GP practices should promote exercise for older people more actively. Participants living in retirement villages, however, reported having access to relevant information and being encouraged to participate in exercise.
   Conclusion. This research identified a gap in current practice, demonstrating that GPs, healthcare providers and local governments should promote exercise for older people more actively. Convincing health professionals to encourage regular exercise among their older patients would provide an opportunity to avoid and manage frailty in this population.

AB  - Ex-offenders face many barriers during the process of community reentry, including difficulty obtaining housing or employment. These barriers are often the result of stigma and discrimination that can negatively affect domains of functioning and well-being that are central to successful reintegration. Implicit theory suggests that stigmatizing attitudes may be explained through beliefs regarding the invariable (fixed mindset) or malleable (growth mindset) nature of human attributes. Prior work demonstrated how these mindsets can explain attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for community reentry. In this manuscript, we report on two studies that examined whether attitudes toward ex-offenders and support for their reentry can be influenced through a brief mindset-based persuasive reading. In Study 1, we piloted a brief, experimental manipulation among a student sample (n = 352) to induce growth mindsets regarding criminal behavior to foster positive attitudes toward ex-offenders and their reentry. In Study 2, we replicated the first study in a community-based sample (n = 451) and tested ex-offender race as a potential moderator. Mediation analyses demonstrated a causal pathway between mindset condition, attitudes toward ex-offenders, and support for reentry, and provided empirical evidence that the mindset-based experimental manipulation can foster growth mindsets and support for ex-offender community reentry, regardless of ex-offender race. Findings present directions for developing a potentially low-cost and time-effective strategy that can be disseminated easily through online or other media platforms, and tailored to target specific barriers to reentry. Further research is needed to establish the persistence of effects on attitudinal changes over time.

AB  - Background : Chlamydia trachomatis infection in pregnancy may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In the Netherlands, testing for C. trachomatis is based on risk assessment. We assessed midwives 'knowledge, test practices, assessment of risk behavior, and attitudes regarding testing for C. trachomatis infection during pregnancy. We evaluated the association between midwives 'characteristics and their knowledge of C. trachomatis infection in terms of symptomatology and outcomes. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study among primary care midwives in the Netherlands. Between September and November 2011, midwives from all Dutch primary care midwifery practices were invited to complete a questionnaire about C. trachomatis infection. Results: Of the 518 midwives invited to participate in this study, 331 (63.9%) responded. The overall median knowledge score for questions about symptomatology and outcomes was 10 out of a maximum score of 15. The median knowledge score was higher among midwives in urban areas. In total, 239 (72.2%) midwives reported testing pregnant women for C. trachomatis. The primary reason for testing was a request by the woman herself (96.2%), followed by symptoms of infection (89.1%), risk behavior (59.3%), and risk factors for infection (7.3%). Almost 25% of midwives showed positive attitudes towards universal screening for C. trachomatis. Conclusions: Midwives were knowledgeable about symptoms of infection, but less about outcomes. Midwives test pregnant women for C. trachomatis mainly on the women's request. Otherwise, testing is based on symptoms of infection rather than on known risk factors. This may contribute to under-diagnosis and under-treatment, leading to maternal, perinatal, and neonatal morbidity.

AB  - The relation of mothers' attitudes on the effects of maternal employment on children, psychological well-being, sensitivity of the mother, and children's socioemotional development were examined in mothers who worked full time (consistently) and mothers who were unemployed during their children's early years of growth from 6 months of age. Longitudinal observations of 1,213 mothers and children from age 1 to 36 months from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Study of Early Child Care were analyzed using structural equation models. Mothers and children benefited when maternal attitudes were consistent with the mothers' actual employment status. Among consistently employed mothers, those with positive attitudes about employment had better psychological well-being. When mothers who were unemployed, they believed that maternal employment would have positive consequences for their children's development, they preferred working outside home and they were more likely to show a low level of psychological well-being and poor quality of mother-child relation. Additionally, maternal well-being mediated the relation between a mother's attitudes and a child's social competence. For both groups, better psychological well-being of mothers was positively related to better child's socioemotional outcome. Maternal sensitivity, however, did not mediate the relation between maternal attitudes and child's social outcomes. The findings shed light on the need for a sensitive measure of characterizing mothers who work versus those who stay at home in order to better understand the effects on a child's development.

AB  - Background: Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease of public health importance and one of the leading causes of permanent physical disability. Nevertheless, the drop in prevalence following multidrug therapy has resulted in the neglect of leprosy. The annual incidence of leprosy has remained the same in Ethiopia since decades with more than 76 % of the reported new cases coming from Oromia and Amhara Regional States. This study was aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude and skill of general health workers in leprosy control activities at public health facilities in Oromia and Amhara Regional States.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2011 to February 2012 at different public health facilities in selected eight zones in Oromia and Amhara Regional States. A multistage sampling method was used to obtain representative samples. High and low endemic zones for leprosy were included in the study in both regional states. Data were collected from general health workers through a structured self-administered questionnaire and at on-site assessment of their performance. Baseline socio-demographic data, health workers' attitude towards leprosy and their knowledge and skill in the management of leprosy were assessed. Bloom's cut off point was used to describe the knowledge and practical skills of the respondents while Likert's scale was used for attitude assessment.
   Result: A total of 601 general health workers responsible for leprosy control activities at public health facilities were included in knowledge and attitude assessment and 83 of them were subjected to practical evaluation, with on-site observation of how they handle leprosy patients. These included medical doctors (4 %), health officers and nurses with Bachelor degree in Science (27 %), clinical nurses with diploma (66 %) and health assistants (2.8 %). The median age of the respondents was 26.0 years and females made up of 45 %. Generally the knowledge and skills of the respondents were found to be poor while attitude towards leprosy was positive for the majority of the respondents. The result showed that 519 (86.3 %) had poor knowledge. Overall 155 (25.8 %) of the respondents had positive attitude towards leprosy while 205 (34.1 %) had intermediate (mixed) attitude and 241 (40.1 %) had negative attitude to the disease. Among 83 respondents assessed for diagnosis of leprosy only 15(18.0 %) diagnosed leprosy correctly. Variation in knowledge and attitude indicated a significant difference (p < 0.05) among different health institutions, professions, gender, in-service training and years of experience.
   Conclusion: The current finding underlines that although leprosy control activities are integrated to the general health services in the country, the knowledge and skills of leprosy diagnosis, treatment and management by health workers was unsatisfactory. Hence, attention should be given to develop training strategies that can improve health worker knowledge and promote better leprosy management at public health facilities. This could be achieved through pre-service and in-service training and giving adequate emphasis to leprosy related practical work and continuous follow-up.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate disciplinary differences in the use of networked information for research and scholarly communication at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), Oman. The paper produced quantitative data on how and why academics within different disciplines utilise networked information either made available internally through the university library, or externally through services accessed by the internet.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted with academic staff at SQU.
   Findings - Statistical analysis found a number of significant differences between respondents in the science disciplines and those in the social sciences and humanities with regard to their use of, and attitudes towards, digital information services. While respondents from science disciplines show overall longer and more frequent use of networked information, respondents from humanities and social sciences indicated more positive attitudes towards library networked services.
   Research limitations/implications - The Arab country context presents a challenge in determining the degree to which results can be extrapolated to other environments, in that disciplines are also divided by language. Science disciplines teach in English, and the social science and humanities in Arabic.
   Originality/value - While similar studies have been undertaken in developed countries, this study is an attempt to establish some data for a developing Arab country.

AB  - Among minority members, positive contact with the majority was previously found to improve not only the attitudes toward the majority but also the attitudes toward minority outgroups (the secondary transfer effect; STE). However, the roles of negative intergroup contact and minority groups' social status in the STE have not been yet examined. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated the association between both positive and negative contact with the national majority group (Finns) and mutual attitudes among high-status Estonian (n = 171) and low-status Russian (n = 180) immigrants in Finland. Two mediators of the STE were tested: attitudes toward the majority (attitude generalization) and public collective self-esteem (diagonal hostility). While positive and negative STEs emerging via attitude generalization were expected to occur among both immigrant groups, the mediating effect of public collective self-esteem was assumed only for members of the low-status group. In both immigrant groups, the relationship between positive contact with the majority group and attitudes toward the other immigrant group was positive and indirect through more favorable attitudes toward majority group members. The same mechanism characterized negative contact, where the indirect effect was mediated by less positive attitudes toward Finns. As predicted, public collective self-esteem mediated the effects of positive and negative contact with majority group members on attitudes toward the other minority only among low-status Russian immigrants. The results call for the acknowledgement of different mechanisms explaining the STE among minority groups enjoying different social statuses in host society. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 crisis highlighted issues of trust in government and experts, as citizens were asked to accept restrictions on liberties in order to slow the spread of the virus. Based on a survey of 1992 Australians conducted in May 2020, this paper reports on the attitudes of Australians toward the responses of their State and Federal governments to the pandemic. Unsurprisingly, we found support for government responses differed with partisan alignment. However, when we controlled for values differences, we found that values predicted social distancing attitudes and behaviour. This oppugns the common conclusion in political psychology that party alignment is a proxy for values. Scientists were trusted more than political institutions or actors for accurate COVID-19 information, and likewise, traditional media were preferred to online sources. These findings have implications for policy communication when individual action is required to address collective goals.

AB  - COVID-19 pandemic burdens forensic practice worldwide. The experience of crisis management is a lesson learned that guides future preparedness for similar casualties. Thus, the present study takes an in-depth look at the knowledge, attitude, and practice of forensic practitioners during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Arab world. A comprehensive questionnaire was adopted in compliance with optimum international standards for the management of deaths during the pandemic. The survey was electronically distributed in 13 Arab countries. The responses were received from 29 forensic practitioners from 11 countries. Total median knowledge, attitude, and practice scores of respondents constituted 37.9%, 74%, and 36.8% of optimum scores respectively. Regarding knowledge, better scores are related to risk assessment and routes of exposure to Coronavirus, whereas, least scores were related to ventilation and negative pressure system. Most of the participants had a positive attitude, 85.2% were concerned about proper management of COVID-19 deaths, and 77.8% trusted the decisions of their teams. Considering practice, better scores are related to forensic staff competence, whereas, least scores were related to the implementation of ideal safety measures. Participants described the management process as useful (52%), reliable (35%), high quality (21%), and cost-effective (17%), however, they expressed challenges as staff infection, limited resources, and infrastructure issues. This survey guides readjusting of procedures and future preparedness for similar disasters in the Arab world. This research adopted a questionnaire that could be used in initial and periodic assessments in any medicolegal institute worldwide. Also, it could support infrastructure projects and disaster management plans.

AB  - Objectives: To share the experience of study skill module development and implementation for first year MBBS students at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College (LNH&MC). To compare the change in students' selfassessment of their knowledge of study skills before and after the course.
   Methods: This quasi-experimental study was conducted from November 2019 to April 2020. A structured study skills course was offered to 100 first year MBBS students of Liaquat National Hospital & Medical College, Karachi. Steps involved in the development included identification of outcomes, instructional objectives, content and instructional strategies. Students were given two questionnaires. In the first questionnaire, students rated their interest in implementing the learning techniques learnt. In the second questionnaire, students rated their level of knowledge of effective study skills before and after the course. Analysis included computing percentages for students' preferred study skill technique. Change in knowledge was assessed by comparing retrospective pre-post self-rating using Wilcoxon Signed Ranks Test (two-tailed).
   Results: Analysis of survey forms showed that more than 50% of the students were willing to implement active listening techniques, metacognitive note taking and writing reflections in their future study practice. There was also a statistically significant change in students' self-rating of their knowledge about study skills (pre-test median 3, post-test median 4, p0.00).
   Conclusion: This study provides an insight of structured study skills course development and implementation in early medical college studies that could help them in combating academic stress. In addition, students' response about their preferred technique and their feedback comparison concluded their positive attitude towards the course.

AB  - Awareness and comprehension of disease origin, transmission, and control in a health crisis are mainly affected by the knowledge, attitude, and practices (KAP) of the general public. We conducted the current study to assess KAP among the general population of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), India, based on an online cross-sectional survey. Participants completed a questionnaire we developed consisting of KAP questions. We also collected sociodemographic information and source of information about disease awareness. The main source of information regarding COVID-19 was Internet social media (66.3%) followed by TV (17.4%). We conducted nonparametric analyses on KAP scores using a Mann-Whitney U and Kruskall-Wallis H tests (P< .05) to find out the association with sociodemographic characteristics. The overall knowledge score (correct answer) was 88.9%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, and occupation. The positive attitude score was 73.3%, which was significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, and geographic area. Overall, 93.0% positive practices were observed in the general population based on asked questions. These scores were significantly associated with gender, age, qualification, marital status, area, and occupation. On the basis of the Spearmen correlation test (P< .01), a significant correlation was observed between scores of knowledge and attitude, withr(s)= +0.28,P= .000, knowledge and practices scores asr(s)= +0.24,P= .000, and attitude and practices scores asr(s)= +0.24,P= .000. However, due to the limited sample presentation in the survey, the study is unable to generalize to lower socioeconomic communities.

AB  - Background. Peer crowds are macro-level, reputation-based subcultures with shared preferences, values, and behavior. The Country peer crowd has been the focus of tobacco industry research and marketing but has yet to be the primary focus of public health research. The current study explores the utility of Down and Dirty, a Social Branding tobacco education campaign, in changing Virginia Country teens' chewing tobacco-related attitudes and behavior. The relationship between chew use and Country peer crowd identification was also explored. Method. To evaluate the campaign, a cross-sectional survey was administered online for 3 years from 2014 to 2016. Responses were collected via social media advertisements targeting 13- to 18-year-old Country youth from Virginia (total n = 1,264). Participants reported peer crowd identification, chew-related attitudes and behavior, and campaign engagement and appeal. Results. Compared with Wave 1, Waves 2 and 3 Country teens who engaged with Down and Dirty had greater odds of holding strong attitudes against chew. Among campaign-engaged Country teens, odds of chew use were lower at Waves 2 and 3, and lower odds were associated with liking the campaign. Related to chew prevalence, Country teens demonstrated greater odds of past 30-day chew use compared to non-Country teens, and higher Country identification was associated with greater odds of chew use. Discussion. Down and Dirty is a promising intervention associated with positive attitudinal and behavioral outcomes for high-risk Country teens. Additionally, this study helps document tobacco-related behavioral patterns of the Country peer crowd, a priority for ongoing tobacco education, especially around chew.

AB  - Scientific research on leisure has proven its contribution to physical and psychological well-being in adolescents, especially regarding the practice of structured leisure activities. Leisure is considered a privileged context for adolescents to develop and learn several developmental skills, such as emotion regulation (ER). Nevertheless, the relationship between leisure and ER has been under-researched in adolescents. The present cross-sectional study aims to test a conceptual model concerning the relationship of leisure attitudes and leisure satisfaction with adolescents' positive functioning and to explore the role of emotion self-regulation strategies in that relationship. Thus, we hypothesized that leisure attitudes would be a predictor of leisure satisfaction; leisure satisfaction would be a predictor of positive functioning dimensions (self-esteem; satisfaction with life; psychological well-being); and the relationship between leisure satisfaction and positive functioning dimensions would be mediated by emotion self-regulation strategies [cognitive reappraisal (CR) and expressive suppression (ES)]. The participants in this study were 654 adolescents from 10th, 11th, and 12th grade, aged between 14 and 19 years old. Data were collected using self-report questionnaires. The structural equation analysis showed that leisure attitudes are a significant predictor of leisure satisfaction, and that leisure satisfaction significantly predicts all positive functioning dimensions. CR mediated the relationship between leisure satisfaction and self-esteem. These findings highlight the importance of developing positive attitudes toward leisure to increase adolescents' levels of leisure satisfaction. This study also supports the importance of leisure satisfaction for achieving adolescents' positive functioning. Future studies should continue to examine the role of emotion self-regulation strategies on leisure, especially regarding CR.

AB  - Social support plays a key role in well-being, yet one of the major preventative efforts for reducing the spread of COVID-19 involves social distancing. During times of crisis, social support is emphasized as a coping mechanism. This requires many people to change their typical ways of connectedness and assumes that people have existing healthy relationships or access to technology. The purpose of this article was to explore the potential impact of COVID-19 on loneliness and well-being. Social support is an important consideration for understanding the impact of COVID-19 Psychological First Aid and Skills for Psychological Recovery, which are tools used to inform response methods to help people connect '5 during isolation and are interventions that could be adapted to COVID-specific needs for what may be a prolonged isolation and postisolation. Given the many unknowns of COVID-19, studies are needed to understand the larger behavioral health impact to ensure resources are available, current, and evidence informed. Future studies are also needed to understand how access to technology may help buffer loneliness and isolation and thus improve the social outcomes of the current pandemic.

AB  - BackgroundSpontaneous reporting (SR) of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) from patients can be considered as a valuable activity providing both objective and subjective data. However, improving the rate of under-reporting has been a major challenge to ensure successful operation of the SR system. This study aimed to assess knowledge, attitude, and intent to report ADRs and explore the factors contributing to consumers' reporting intent in South Korea.MethodsSelf-administered questionnaire was collected from a sex-, age-, and regionally stratified nationwide convenience sample of consumers using a commercial panel in December 2018. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to explore the factors contributing to the intent to report ADRs by consumers.ResultsA total of 1000 respondents were enrolled in the survey; 50.9% were males and the mean age was 44.4 (standard deviation, 13.3) years. While less than 15% of the respondents were aware of the SR system and even fewer (3.4%) had actual experience of SR, however, 59.2% expressed their intent to report ADRs. The positive attitude (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.972, p<0.001), awareness of the SR system (aOR 2.102, p<0.01), self-efficacy for SR (aOR 1.956, p<0.001), and experiences related to ADR counselling with healthcare professionals (OR 2.318, p<0.001) are the significant factors contributing to reporting intent.ConclusionsFindings of this study highlight the need for increasing the awareness of the SR system among consumers and empowering them to report ADRs by themselves, which would ultimately improve the drug-safety environment.

AB  - Rationale, aims and objectives To bridge the gap between theory and practice, methods are needed that promote a positive attitude to change among health care professionals and facilitate the incorporation of new research findings. In this context, communication plays a significant role. The aim of this study was to analyse primary care staff members' readiness to adopt new ways of thinking and willingness to change their work practices by means of strategic communication. Method An evaluative design was used to study a primary care staff cohort for 7 years. The study population comprised all primary care staff in a region of Sweden (n = 1206). The strategic communication encompassed managerial impact, planning and implementation of reflexive communication processes, in addition to activities in three established communication channels (oral, written and digital). A questionnaire was used, and bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were performed. Results A total of 846 individuals participated in the evaluation (70%). Strategic communication had a significant effect on staff members' new way of thinking (61%) and willingness to change daily work practices (33%). The communication channels had a significant synergy effect on the adoption of new ideas and willingness to change attitudes. Oral and digital communication had a significant impact on staff members' readiness to change. Conclusions Strategic communication plays an important role in the process of creating innovative attitudes and behaviour among primary care professionals. The willingness to change attitudes enhances primary care staff's readiness to change everyday practices, thus facilitating the implementation of evidence-based care.

AB  - Globalization does not only involve the spread of massive information technology throughout the world. In the early 2020s the world also experienced a global pandemic COVID-19 which plagues almost all countries in the world. COVID-19 forces learning activities di higher education level to be carried out with social distancing concepts. Online learning can be done using a number of popular information technology applications. The study involved college students from the faculty of computer science and engineering. They took courses on enterprise resource planning, human-computer interaction, and research methods. The results showed that COVID-19 did not impede learning activities. A number of social technologies such as Dropbox, Facebook, Google Forms, Moodle, WhatsApp, WordPress, YouTube, and Zoom have seen a surge in usage to support distance learning activities during the COVID-19 pandemic. With online distance learning mode, all learning activities can be done with the concept of work from home. This learning scheme can be used not only for science and technology fields but also Arabic learning.

AB  - Exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) status is far from the national target in China. To identify the modifiable factors associated with EBF of infants aged under 6 months in China. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 12 provinces/municipalities across China in 2017-2018. We used multistage stratified cluster sampling and collected data through face-to-face interviews with mothers using an electronic questionnaire. Totally, 5287 pairs of mother-infant aged <6 months were investigated. The EBF prevalence was 29.2% (1544/5287). Mothers with correct knowledge of colostrum (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]:1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07, 1.62), EBF (AOR: 1.39, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.81) and the highest scores of perceptions for breastfeeding benefits (AOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.61) were more likely to exclusively breastfeed. However, mothers with more frequent unwillingness of breastfeeding during the first month postpartum were less likely to practice EBF (AOR: 0.68, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.90). Infants having their first breast milk within 24 h of birth increased the odds of EBF (AOR: 2.41, 95% CI: 1.86, 3.13). Infants were less likely to be exclusively breastfed in the families in which the main caregiver was the grandmothers. Mothers without receiving infant formula feeding suggestions via the health facilities, media, or the Internet (AOR: 1.57, 95% CI: 1.33, 1.85) or without the experience of infant formula feeding in public (AOR: 1.45, 95% CI: 1.23, 1.72) might more likely to practice EBF. To acquire comprehensively correct knowledge and keep a positive attitude of breastfeeding for the mothers are crucial for improving the EBF prevalence. Family supports are potential interventions worth focusing on. Infant formula promotion remains a great barrier for EBF in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   This survey was done to evaluate awareness of various treatment modalities for replacing single missing tooth among the people of western Maharashtra. We wanted to assess gender wise awareness of patients regarding fixed dental prosthesis as a treatment modality for replacement of missing tooth.
   METHODS
   This cross-sectional study was done on 150 subjects visiting the dental college using a self-administered structured questionnaire. The questionnaire was pre-tested through a pilot survey. Data was evaluated using version 16.0 of the SPSS. Chi Square test and ANOVA were used as test of significance at p < 0.05.
   RESULTS
   Out of 150 subjects, 87 were males and 63 females. Around 64% of the subjects wanted to replace missing tooth due to difficulty in masticatory function; yet 14% knew the importance of aesthetic and speech as well. All subjects preferred fixed prosthesis for replacement of missing tooth, but higher cost of the procedure and fear of surgical trauma were the main factors for not undergoing implant treatment. Dental professionals were the main source of information about different treatment procedures followed by media.
   CONCLUSIONS
   There is a strong level of awareness among the subjects about the fixed treatment procedure, but more than half of the subjects did not have knowledge about the implants. It also revealed the need to provide the subjects with more knowledge about this treatment modality. Dental awareness is therefore necessary in order to cultivate a positive attitude towards dental implants amongst the community.

AB  - The year 2020 has marked the spread of a global pandemic, COVID-19, challenging many aspects of our daily lives. Different organizations have been involved in controlling this outbreak. The social distancing intervention is deemed to be the most effective policy in reducing face-to-face contact and slowing down the rate of infections. Stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders have been implemented in different states and cities, affecting daily traffic patterns. Social distancing interventions and fear of the disease resulted in a traffic decline in cities and counties. However, after stay-at-home orders ended and some public places reopened, traffic gradually started to revert to pre-pandemic levels. It can be shown that counties have diverse patterns in the decline and recovery phases. This study analyzes county-level mobility change after the pandemic, explores the contributing factors, and identifies possible spatial heterogeneity. To this end, 95 counties in Tennessee have been selected as the study area to perform geographically weighted regressions (GWR) models. The results show that density on non-freeway roads, median household income, percent of unemployment, population density, percent of people over age 65, percent of people under age 18, percent of work from home, and mean time to work are significantly correlated with vehicle miles traveled change magnitude in both decline and recovery phases. Also, the GWR estimation captures the spatial heterogeneity and local variation in coefficients among counties. Finally, the results imply that the recovery phase could be estimated depending on the identified spatial attributes. The proposed model can help agencies and researchers estimate and manage decline and recovery based on spatial factors in similar events in the future.

AB  - Background Patient safety is regarded as a global problem by which both developed and developing worlds are affected. It is defined as avoidance and prevention of patient injuries or adverse events, which could result during health care delivery. This study aimed to identify physicians' knowledge, influence, and attitude toward patient's safety in the faculty of medicine, Cairo university. Materials and methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 187 postgraduate physicians of different specialties working in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. Anonymous self-administered questionnaires were distributed. The questionnaire is one of a series of tools designed for evaluation of the pilot implementation of the World Health Organization patient safety curriculum for medical schools. Results Calculated attitude score was relatively higher than influence, then knowledge score (median scores were 4.25, 3.1, and 2.5 respectively). There was no difference in knowledge, attitude, and influence scores by different personal characteristics as gender, specialty, workplace, graduation year except for higher influence score among physician who received in patient safety (p = 0.016). There was a weak positive significant correlation between knowledge and influence scores and between influence and attitude scores (r = 0.25, p = 0.002; r = 0.27, p < 0.001 respectively). Conclusion Higher patient safety positive attitude than influence and knowledge is pinpointed in physicians of different specialties in the faculty of medicine, Cairo University. This raises the attention to the importance of implementation of continuing patient safety education programs.

AB  - The objectives of this investigation were to determine general background of farmers, their existing rice seed production condition, their perception of rice seed production standard, and constraints on farmers' rice seed production. The sample of 66 selected rice farmers in Thamai Sub-District, Chumsaeng District, Nakhon Sawan Province was estimated using the formula developed by Arkin (1974) through multistage sampling technique. Data was obtained by interview schedule under close observation and in-depth discussion with key persons in the research site. The results revealed that average age of respondent was 48.09 years. Average year of rice seed cultivation experience was 4.36 years. The average size of owned land for seed cultivation was 3.36 hectares. Total seed cultivation land, accounting for 74.88%, was farmers' owned land that they inherited from their parents. These can reduce the risk in farming because it is their own land. The results of assessment of farmers' perception indicated that most of respondents had the required knowledge in seed production standard. They could answer correctly questions regarding rice seed production technology. Most of them had positive attitude toward the proposed standard practice. Nearly 60% of the respondents followed the right production practices. Farmers' characteristics factors affecting seed yield were number of extension contact, farm media perception, and participation in community intervention program, respectively. The constraints in rice seed production improvement were high cost of inputs, high cost of fertilizer, low rice price, and climate variability, respectively.

AB  - Introduction: Smoking causes substantial preventable morbidity, mortality and financial burdens. It is the main risk factor for many diseases and a significant cause of death. Smoking prevalence is high internationally and in Malaysia, especially among males. Smoking cessation is essential to reduce tobacco-related morbidity and mortality.
   Aim: To evaluate knowledge, attitude towards and practice of smoking among pharmacy students in the International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM).
   Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted using a validated structured self-administered questionnaire among a sample of IIUM pharmacy students (n=251) from November 2012 to December 2012. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to summarise data and to examine the relationship between variables.
   Results: A total of 251 IIUM pharmacy students have participated in the survey. The median age of the participants was 21-23 years; 23.9% of them were males and 76.1% were females. The percentage of current smokers and ex-smokers was 0.4%, 0.8%, respectively. About 43% of the respondents had a good knowledge (score >16), more than half of them had a positive attitude (score >17), and about 38.4% had a good practice (score >11).
   Conclusion: Smoking prevalence among pharmacy students in IIUM is very low. However, conducting training and educational programs to improve knowledge, attitudes and practice of pharmacy students is highly recommended to assist their contribution to smoking cessation interventions in the future.

AB  - The ideal stage to learn about and foster positive attitudes toward entrepreneurship is believed to be during childhood and adolescence. However, most entrepreneurial studies examine college rather than secondary school students (SSS). Based on a modified theory of planned behavior (TPB), this study used stratified cluster sampling and a questionnaire to review current entrepreneurship education in secondary schools. In addition, the effects of entrepreneurship education, personal traits, and demographics on attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control (PBC), and entrepreneurial intentions (EI) on 1018 SSS in China were studied. Differences, correlations, and structural equation modeling analysis indicated the following. (1) Most SSS had never received entrepreneurship education, likely resulting in lowered entrepreneurial intention and perception of entrepreneurial behavioral performance as unrealistically easy. (2) Cognitive bias existed in SSS's perceptions of entrepreneurship, and entrepreneurial behaviors were regarded as external cause-oriented activities. (3) Gender and entrepreneurial experience of family member also influenced EI and related variables. (4) Entrepreneurship education and personal traits (locus of control and innovativeness) were significantly positive predictors of EI, and (5) their effects on EI were completely mediated by PBC. The findings supported the TPB predictions, and the results offered some implications for entrepreneurship education in Chinese secondary schools: (1) developing entrepreneurial personal traits while eliminating examination-oriented education, (2) enhancing SSS's entrepreneurial confidence so entrepreneurial behaviors are perceived as easier and more achievable, and (3) constructing systematic entrepreneurship courses to guarantee transition from secondary to higher education.

AB  - The authors combined the 2-step flow of communication model and the theory of planned behavior to create a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of a set of advertisements from the National Youth Anti-Drug Media Campaign promoting parent-child drug communication. The sample consisted of 1,349 pairs of parents and children who responded to the first and second annual rounds of the National Survey of Parents and Youth, and 1,276 pairs from Rounds 3 and 4. Parents' exposure to the campaign reported at Round 1 was indirectly associated with youth's lowered intentions to use marijuana at Round 2. Ad exposure was associated with positive changes in parental attitudes toward drug communication and perceived social approval of antidrug communications. These two beliefs, along with perceived behavioral control, predicted parents' intentions to discuss drugs with their children. Parental intentions to discuss drugs reported at Round 1 were associated with youth's report of actual drug communication with their parents at Round 2. Frequency and breadth of the topics in parent-child drug communication were associated with less positive attitudes toward marijuana use among youth who spoke with their parents. Together, the child's attitudes toward marijuana use and perceived ability to refuse marijuana use predicted youth's intentions to use marijuana. The proposed model fit well with the data and was replicated in a parallel analysis of the data from Rounds 3 and 4. Implications for future antidrug media campaign efforts are discussed.

AB  - While the selfie has come to symbolize notions of selfhood in the age of social media, the photograph that has become a visual trope across the Facebook accounts of lower-middle-class young men in the western Indian city of Pune offers a different reading of online selfhood. In this article, I discuss the creation of a localized selfie-the "professional selfie"-in which young men stage their masculinity by engaging in a mimetic economy of exchanging characteristics with film heroes. In contrast to Susan Sontag's (2003) theorization of the intimate photograph, the professional selfie is devoid of interiority. Far from unaware of the camera in the manner described by Sontag, young men in Pune utilize the services of photographers to capture them at a distance and conceal their surroundings, thereby creating relations of social distance and distinction with their peers on Facebook.

AB  - Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown potential to improve diagnostics of various diseases, especially for early detection of skin cancer. Studies have yet to investigate the clear application of AI technology in clinical practice or determine the added value for younger user groups. Translation of AI-based diagnostic tools can only be successful if they are accepted by potential users. Young adults as digital natives may offer the greatest potential for successful implementation of AI into clinical practice, while at the same time, representing the future generation of skin cancer screening participants.
   Objective: We conducted an anonymous online survey to examine how and to what extent individuals are willing to accept AI-based mobile apps for skin cancer diagnostics. We evaluated preferences and relative influences of concerns, with a focus on younger age groups.
   Methods: We recruited participants below 35 years of age using three social media channels-Facebook, LinkedIn, and Xing. Descriptive analysis and statistical tests were performed to evaluate participants' attitudes toward mobile apps for skin examination. We integrated an adaptive choice-based conjoint to assess participants' preferences. We evaluated potential concerns using maximum difference scaling.
   Results: We included 728 participants in the analysis. The majority of participants (66.5%, 484/728; 95% CI 0.631-0.699) expressed a positive attitude toward the use of AI-based apps. In particular, participants residing in big cities or small towns (P=.02) and individuals that were familiar with the use of health or fitness apps (P=.02) were significantly more open to mobile diagnostic systems. Hierarchical Bayes estimation of the preferences of participants with a positive attitude (n=484) revealed that the use of mobile apps as an assistance system was preferred. Participants ruled out app versions with an accuracy of <= 65%, apps using data storage without encryption, and systems that did not provide background information about the decision-making process. However, participants did not mind their data being used anonymously for research purposes, nor did they object to the inclusion of clinical patient information in the decision-making process. Maximum difference scaling analysis for the negative-minded participant group (n=244) showed that data security, insufficient trust in the app, and lack of personal interaction represented the dominant concerns with respect to app use.
   Conclusions: The majority of potential future users below 35 years of age were ready to accept AI-based diagnostic solutions for early detection of skin cancer. However, for translation into clinical practice, the participants'demands for increased transparency and explainability of AI-based tools seem to be critical. Altogether, digital natives between 18 and 24 years and between 25 and 34 years of age expressed similar preferences and concerns when compared both to each other and to results obtained by previous studies that included other age groups.

AB  - Although past work suggests that having a parasocial relationship with a celebrity can affect attitudes toward that celebrity, no work has yet examined if people are consciously aware that this is occurring and if this can explain the effects of Twitter on attitudes about Donald Trump. The current research examined the psychological mechanisms and attitudinal consequences of engaging with Donald Trump on Twitter and the degree to which people were consciously aware of the effects of their parasocial bond on their attitudes. Across an experiment (N = 243) and two correlational studies (N = 373; N = 384), we found that participants with preexisting political attitudes similar to Trump's showed increased liking of Trump with exposure to his Twitter feed. Those effects were mediated by a parasocial bond. In other words, when people with a political ideology similar to Trump's read his Twitter feed, they felt like they knew him personally (i.e., formed a parasocial relationship with him), which predicted them liking him even more. Conversely, people with political ideologies not similar to Trump's liked him less when exposed to his tweets. Importantly, individuals were unaware that engaging with Trump on Twitter was affecting their views of him. Implications for how the unconscious formation of parasocial relationships may affect attitude polarization and political processes in the modem world are discussed.

AB  - Digital technologies and social media platforms have been used in museum communication for over a decade now, and Holocaust museums have increasingly adopted them in their modes of commemoration and provision of educational content. Nevertheless, very limited research has been conducted into the potential of social media as new memory ecologies. In this exploratory study, we conceive social media platforms as socio-technicalecological systems whereby users develop and engage with memory practices of the Holocaust. We adopt a networked socio-ecological approach to analyse how a sample of Holocaust museums (N = 69) develop practices of digital Holocaust memory in social media. The institutions are analysed in terms of "size " (small, medium, or large), how they differ in their attitudes towards these practices, and to what extent they circulate Holocaust memory on social media. The study adopts multiple quantitative approaches and combines the results of a survey with a set of social media metrics analysing how museums engage on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube in terms of generated content, interactivity, popularity, and type of content. Results show that museums have an overall positive attitude towards social media although some concerns were expressed, mostly by smaller institutions; they tend to use mostly Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, and to share educational content and information about the museum's activities. However, despite a tendency to aggregate a large number of fans and followers, especially in the case of larger institutions, interaction with users remains limited. Prospects for more interactive participation and its implications are also discussed.

AB  - Objectives Handwashing is known as the most preventive method for various infectious diseases. Health authorities have conducted various campaigns and public relations targeting the general population but few evaluations of these long-term interventions. This study aimed to investigate the association between experience of educational events or public relations (EXEP), attitude towards the effectiveness of handwashing (AEHW) and handwashing practice (HWP). Setting Using a population-based cross-sectional study with a complex sample design, we explored the response outcomes of handwashing. Those outcomes were collected biennially using Community Health Survey among the years 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019. We applied multivariate logistic regression for the association among sociodemographic factors, health conditions, EXEP, AEHW and HWP. Participants Total participants residing in Seoul were 23 139 (men 44.2%), 23 004 (men 44.4%), 22 955 (men 44.8%) and 22 930 (men 43.9%), in 2013, 2015, 2017 and 2019, respectively. Results Overall, participants with EXEP are more likely to be women, aged between the 30s and 60s, and with a higher educational level. Particularly, participants with EXEP had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.21, 95% CI 1.19 to 1.33) and AEHW (OR 1.50, 95% CI 1.38 to 1.63). In addition, AEHW also had an increased association with HWP (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.53 to 1.81). The mediated effect of AEHW to HWP is not determined evidently. Conclusion The results showed that EXEP is positively associated with HWP and AEHW among community-dwelling people. Our results confirm that educational activity can lead to more pronounced behavioural changes only when it forms a positive attitude.

AB  - This study assessed factors that determine farm hygiene practices towards preventing and controlling poultry diseases among poultry entrepreneurs in Lagos State, Nigeria. Structured questionnaire was used to obtain data from 148 respondents selected using multistage sampling technique. Results show that respondents' mean age was 48.5years, majority (68.2%) were male, 95.3% were married, 59.5% had secondary education and mean years of farming experience was 18.8years. All the respondents sourced information on hygiene practices from extension agents, family, friends and cooperatives. Electronic media and prints were also used by 96.6%, 47.9%, respectively. The majority (81.8%) of the respondents operate on a government owned land while 10.1% operate on personal land. Majority (77%) periodically clean their poultry pen, 72.9% agreed that quarantine services is of necessity, 80.4% periodically administer vaccines and drugs to prevent diseases in their poultry farms. More so, 98.7% disinfect poultry kits/equipment after use and 91.9% agreed that raw/uncooked poultry products are not good for consumption. Test of significance indicated that respondents' farm hygiene practices was related to educational level (chi(2)=7.96, P <=.05), years of farming experience (beta=-0.87, P <=.05), sources of information (r=-0.21, P <=.05), land ownership type (r=-0.22, P <=.05). It was recommended that public enlightenment and campaign should be strengthened to generally enlighten the public and poultry entrepreneurs specifically towards positive attitudes and handling of poultry products through routine management like regular sanitation, periodic vaccination, poultry house entrance' dips, drug administration and quarantine services towards developing the poultry enterprise.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims at examining the impact that COVID-19 pandemic and its related work implications have on the relationship between lean implementation and service performance. Design/methodology/approach The author surveyed service organizations that have been implementing lean for at least two years and remotely maintained their activities during the COVID-19 outbreak. Multivariate data techniques were applied to analyze the dataset. This study was grounded on sociotechnical systems theory. Findings The findings indicate that organizations that have been implementing lean services more extensively are also more likely to benefit from the effects that the COVID-19 had on work environments, especially in the case of home office. Nevertheless, social distancing does not appear to mediate the effects of lean services on both quality and delivery performances. Originality/value Since the pandemic is a recent phenomenon with unprecedented effects, this research is an initial effort to determine the effect the pandemic has on lean implementation and services' performance, providing both theoretical and practical contributions to the field.

AB  - Introduction: Most children with haemophilia in Japan study in mainstream schools. However, many mothers have difficulty deciding whether to inform teachers of their child's haemophilia because of the accompanying potential discrimination and prejudice, particularly after the press coverage on the HIV scandal in the 1980s. Aims: We therefore aim to explore and describe disclosure strategies of mothers of children with haemophilia. Methods: A qualitative study was conducted using the modified grounded theory approach to explore disclosure strategies of mothers of children with haemophilia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 19 selected mothers (12 children were HIV positive and 7 were HIV-negative). Results: In the pre-HIV/AIDS crisis period, the kind of strategy employed -full disclosure, conditional full disclosure and partial disclosure - depended on the extent of mothers' fears about mainstream schools refusing admission because of their child's haemophilia. After the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s in Japan, the three categories of strategies employed by mothers of children with haemophilia were limited disclosure, non-disclosure and full disclosure. These depended on mothers' expectations of discrimination towards their child because of the social stigma around haemophilia and being HIV-positive. Conclusion: For children with haemophilia to feel safe attending school, public schools must establish care management and anti-discrimination systems for children with chronic diseases, thus assuring parents of their children's welfare at school.

AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n = 115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n = 74), Hispanic/Latina (n = 52), and African American (n = 42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.

AB  - Engineering and engineers are considered central to maintaining global competitiveness and the workforce needs of any nation. Media shapes public opinion, and the image of a profession can affect the way the public views that profession and professionals in the field. Very little research can be found which analyzes media portrayal of engineers and engineering to assess whether and how media influences people's view of engineers and engineering. Two foundational research questions are addressed in this paper: (1) to what extent are engineers or engineering portrayed in broadcast network television evening news media? and (2) do these news outlets miss opportunities to identify and discuss engineering subjects and, subsequently, exclude engineers as experts? The conclusions are derived from data culled from 24 unique, randomly selected, and full episodes of evening news of three television broadcast networks in the United States yielding 257 individual news stories over the course of a year (2015) and the coverage of two significant disasters (2014 Oso landslide and 2015 Flint water crisis) with high relevance to civil engineering. The data reveal a nearly complete absence of engineers as experts and links to engineering concepts, with only one story mentioning the word "engineer." The situation is further exacerbated as these evening news programs deemed it important to cover about 15% of the stories as they relate to topics and concepts within the purview of the field of engineering, but did not include voices of engineers or explicitly connect those topics to engineering, which the authors identified as the missed opportunities. The authors suggest investigating the reasons behind the near absence of engineering content and engineers as experts for future research studies, particularly in light of the observation that 19% of the analyzed news stories did feature speakers who were identified as an expert.

AB  - In early 2020, the unforeseen COVID-19 has brought the art world to its knees, particularly the contemporary art scene needs viewers and feedback to survive. Artists require new channels connecting them with their audiences, while artists' work needs to be seen and appreciated by the public to sustain its value. In the face of social distancing restrictions and limited visitors, however, many international exhibitions are forced to cancel or postponed. With less to no patronage, will the global pandemic bring the end of the art world? As the global pandemic has forced most social and cultural events moving online, the art biennials are no exception. This article examines the art biennial, the Olympics of the art world, to rediscover the meaning of 'art' before and after COVID-19. Integrating virtual presenta-tion and digital campaign between the Taipei Biennial and the Shanghai Biennale, the first running art biennials across the Taiwan Strait, this article analyses and presents the art world's potential shifts in the post-pandemic future.

AB  - Breastfeeding is the optimal source of infant nutrition, yet the motherModified Letter Turned Commas decision to breastfeed is complex and influenced by factors including social support and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes. This study employed a two-group pretest-posttest design to examine whether brief, online video presentations (<2.5 minutes in length) could improve breastfeeding knowledge and attitude among males and compare the outcomes between a knowledge-based and attitude-based intervention. Collegiate male participants (N = 213, 18-40 years of age) demonstrated high breastfeeding exposure (90.1% had friends/family breastfeed) and positive attitudes (89.2% accepted women could breastfeed and work outside home) yet knowledge deficits concerning breastfeeding health benefits were identified. Breastfeeding exposure was positively associated with baseline attitude (r(212)=.186, p = .006 and knowledge (r(212)=.229, p = .001. Both intervention groups reported similar gains in attitude scores; only the knowledge-based intervention reported significant gains in knowledge (M = 1.5, SD = 2.63 vs M = -.07, SD = 1.44, (t = -5.496, df = 211, p < .05). Brief online video presentations may constitute an additional exposure to or nudging toward breastfeeding, and breastfeeding knowledge and attitudes can be positively influenced in young adult males with similar interventions that are affordable and require a minimal time commitment.

AB  - Introduction: Sub-Saharan Africa has a high burden of breast cancer and very low rates of breast reconstruction. This study aimed to determine the awareness of and attitude to breast reconstruction among women with breast cancer who had mastectomy. Methods: A cross-sectional study of women with breast cancer who underwent mastectomy was done. Participants were recruited from September 2020 to January 2021 from the surgical oncology and radio-oncology outpatient clinics of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. A multivariate logistic regression was used to determine predictors of awareness and attitudes to breast reconstruction. P <= 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Fifty-one women participated in the study. The mean age was 54.76 (+9.94) years. Most, 30 (58.8%) of them had tertiary level of education, were working, 39 (76.5%) and were married, 41 (80%). Funding for the mastectomies was mainly out-of-pocket 34 (66.7%). Most 37 (72.5%) were not aware that the breast could be reconstructed before their surgery and only one (1.96%) of the women had breast reconstruction. The reason most proffered for declining breast reconstruction was not wanting another surgery 13 (33.3%). The age (odds ratio [OR] 0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.001-0.33), P = 0.006 of the participants and the educational status (OR 12.50, 95% CI 1.86-84.26), P = 0.009 were significant predictors of awareness of breast reconstruction. None of the variables were significant predictors of positive attitudes to breast reconstruction. Conclusion: There is a very low level of awareness of breast reconstruction. Younger age and tertiary education were significant predictors of awareness of breast reconstruction.

AB  - Background: Birth of a child is of great importance in a family. Child health depends upon the fulfillment of nutritional needs that includes breast feeding and weaning. Weaning is the beginning of semisolid food in infant's diet who is consuming milk to meet his nutritional needs. Breast milk is a good source of nutrition for the first six months of child's life, but then again weaning is also essential as the child is in the growing stage.
   Methods: Descriptive analytical design was used in this study. The study was conducted in the area of Mohnalwal Lahore. All mothers in the reproductive age group 18-49 year were the source population. Data was collected through the administration of self-administered close ended questionnaire. Regression analysis through SPSS was applied to find out the association between variables.
   Results: The Majority (85.7%) of the mother's of the community were educated and only 14.3% of mothers had no formal education. 81.9% of the husbands were educated whereas 18% had no formal education. The main source of this knowledge was friends and family with 27.8% and Health worker / Hospitals with 21.8% whereas, 16.5% of the mother's had knowledge of weaning from TV and media and only 7 mothers had the knowledge of weaning
   Conclusions: Majority of the mothers had knowledge about weaning and was practicing correct weaning practices. Majority of the mothers started weaning at the recommended age of 4 to 6 months and the commonly used weaning diet was rice, rusk / biscuits or mashed fruits / veg. most of the mothers of Mohnalwal show a positive attitude towards weaning.

AB  - One of the biggest barriers in treating adolescents with mental health problems is their refusing to seek psychological help. This study was designed to examine the relationships between two forms of perfectionism, self-concealment and attitudes toward seeking psychological help and to test the mediating role of self-concealment in the relationship between perfectionism and attitudes toward seeking psychological help among Malaysian high school students. The participants were 475 Malaysian high school students from four high schools in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Structural equation modelling results indicated that high school students with high levels of socially prescribed perfectionism, high levels of self-concealment, and low levels of self-oriented perfectionism reported negative attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Bootstrapping analysis showed that self-concealment emerged as a significant, full mediator in the link between socially prescribed perfectionism and attitudes toward seeking psychological help. Moderated mediation analysis also examined whether the results generalized across men and women. The results revealed that male students with socially prescribed perfectionism are more likely to engage in self-concealment, which in turn, leads to negative attitudes toward seeking psychological help more than their female counterparts. The results suggested that students high in socially prescribed perfectionism were more likely to engage in self-concealment and be less inclined to seek psychological help.

AB  - In pandemic crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, individuals' behavior has a strong impact on epidemiological processes. Compliance with prevention guidelines, such as social distancing, is critical to avoid further spreading an infectious disease or to slow down its spread. However, some individuals also or instead engage in panic behavior, such as hoarding. We investigate how education prepares individuals to respond adequately by modelling the path from seeking information about COVID-19 to eventual behavior. Based on a sample of N = 1182 adult Americans, gathered at the pandemic's onset (March 2020), we conclude that science knowledge helps individuals convert information into coronavirus knowledge. This knowledge then helps individuals avoid panic behavior. Individuals lacking coronavirus knowledge and science knowledge still comply with prevention guidelines when they have a general trust in medicine. Individuals lacking knowledge still follow prevention guidelines when they trust in medicine. Facilitating science knowledge and trust in science through education and targeted public health messaging are likely to be of fundamental importance for bringing crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic under control.

AB  - Oxytocin (OT) is known for facilitating interpersonal interactions in favorable conditions. Humor, on the other hand, is an interpersonal phenomenon that reduces social distance. In this study, we investigated whether OT would increase laughing and smiling in a favorable environment. Therefore, participants were asked to view a brief video clip of a comedy television program in the presence of an ingroup member after administration of either OT or a placebo. Results demonstrated that participants in the OT condition exhibited more laughing and smiling behavior over the course of viewing the video compared to participants in the placebo condition. OT, however, neither affected self-reported affect nor perceived funniness of the clip. These findings indicate that OT, a hormone that can bolster attachment, also has the power to facilitate implicit social interactions by promoting visible and audible social signals, but does not affect the socially irrelevant inner cheerfulness.

AB  - Fictional narratives can have strong effects on people's real world opinions, attitudes, and behavior. Given the far-reaching implications these effects may have, understanding when and how narratives can have such effects is important. One frequent claim about narrative impact is that stories can disable people's ability to critically evaluate the issue. In an experiment, optimal conditions were created to assess whether readers came up with issue-relevant thoughts and to what extent such thoughts influenced the participants' attitude. The impact of issue-relevant thoughts was compared to that of another mechanism of narrative persuasion: identification. Participants (N=138) read a story including a discussion scene on a personally relevant issue. The manipulation consisted of the main character being in favor of or against a certain issue. Participants identified more strongly with the main character than with the antagonist A mediation analysis revealed that identifying with the character being in favor of the issue yielded a more positive attitude toward the issue. A considerable number of participants generated issue-relevant thoughts that proved predictive of the attitude. The experiment provides further evidence for the identification mechanism while revealing insights into how integration of explicit argumentative content into a narrative can influence issue-relevant thinking.

AB  - The coronavirus pandemic, social distancing, and lockdown measures have had an impact on employee well-being. This study uses Latent Profile Analysis to examine subjective well-being among employees during the first lockdown based on a cross-national survey in UK and France (n = 652). We identify five distinct well-being profiles, namely Moderately positive (67%), Languishing (18%), Flourishing (8%), Mixed feelings (4%), and Apathetic (3%). The results showed that while some employees were suffering, others managed to thrive and cope with the stresses of the lockdown. We also found that the profiles could be distinguished by perceived changes in financial situation and physical health as well as experienced boredom. Our study complements prior studies that examine the relations between individual characteristics and well-being during the pandemic on a general level by showing that employee well-being under lockdown is not the same across the board.

AB  - Research Aims - This study proposes to fill the gap in entrepreneurship literature by focusing on the relationship between entrepreneurs' psychological capital and growth intention mediated by their work performance.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - This research used cross-sectional quantitative research and employed convenience sampling technique. A total of 275 Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) entrepreneurs participated and answered the survey questionnaires.
   Research Findings - The findings confirmed the direct relationships between psychological capital and work performance; and psychological capital and growth intention of entrepreneurs. However, this study found no mediating effect of work performance in the relationship between psychological capital and growth intention of the entrepreneurs.
   Theoretical Contribution/Originality - This study enhanced the understanding on the importance of psychological capital as influential psychological resource for entrepreneurs as it has positive effects on attitudes and their work performance. These findings advocate the inclusion of psychological capital in entrepreneurial studies as important resource for work performance improvement and positive attitudes.
   Managerial Implications in the Southeast Asian Context - The government and SMEs supporting agencies need to give attention to psychological capital in their entrepreneurship development policy and programmes. Further, universities and training providers should also focus on psychological capital resources in entrepreneurial education and training modules.
   Research Limitations and Implications - This study is confined to Malaysian SME entrepreneurs only and uses convenient sampling technique. Therefore, generalization of the findings is limited. Future research can investigate the related variables in different countries and contexts to examine the importance of psychological capital in entrepreneurial setting.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has become a world problem now. The pandemic has affeected a lot of core sectors including the education sector. Students are not able to go to school to study and have to do a social distancing by staying at home. What the government did so that students will still be able to study at home is by developing a long-distance learning media. In this research, we will get to know more about how students in China learn mathematics at home and their learning attitude towards the learning video. This research will use a qualitative and quantitative research method. The researchers gave out questionnaires to 408 students in Guangxi province, China. The researchers also did an interview on the parents and students to know the advantages and disadvantages of using the learning video during this covid-19 pandemic. The research result shows that there is a good student learning attidude towards the learning video. Students feel that the learning video is very interesting yet effective as they were able to understand the concept taught.

AB  - Background The frequency of self-reported food sensitivity (SFS) is increasing, and has a negative impact on the well-being and everyday functioning of the affected people. A considerable proportion of SFS cannot be medically explained. The lack of knowledge of its origin and treatment causes further stress in those affected.
   Purpose This study aims to get a better understanding of the psychological background of the condition.
   Methods A non-representative community sample (N=335; age: 35.1 +/- 13.18 yrs; 75.8% female) completed an English on-line questionnaire assessing somatosensory amplification, health anxiety, modern health worries (MHWs), beliefs concerning the scientific validity of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), holistic beliefs on health and illness.
   Results In multiple binary logistic regression analyses, SFS were associated with CAM related beliefs, somatosensory amplification, and health anxiety after controlling for age and gender. The connection between somatosensory amplification and SFS were completely mediated by health anxiety. No differences between the two groups were found with respect to MHWs, worries about the harmful effects of various artificial components in food, and holistic health beliefs. Discussion: More positive attitudes toward CAM might be based on the lack of conventional treatment, rather than on higher levels of MHWs or a more holistic worldview. Both the existence of symptoms and the presence of health anxiety might be needed for the development and maintenance of SFS.
   Conclusions The findings support the notion that somatosensory amplification and health anxiety might play a role in the development and maintenance of SFS.

AB  - Background Events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, such as physical distancing, closure of community services, postponement of health appointments, and loss of employment can lead to social isolation, financial uncertainty, and interruption of antiretroviral adherence, resulting in additional health-related challenges (disability) experienced among adults living with chronic illness such as HIV. 'Living strategies' is a concept derived from the perspectives of people living with HIV, defined as behaviors, attitudes and beliefs adopted by people living with HIV to help deal with disability associated with HIV and multi-morbidity. Our aim was to describe disability among adults living with HIV and self-care living strategies used during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods Adults living with HIV in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, including some with pre-pandemic HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ) data, completed a cross-sectional web-based survey between June-August 2020. The survey included the HDQ and questions about self-care living strategy use during the pandemic. We compared disability (HDQ) scores prior to versus during the pandemic using paired t-tests. We reported the proportion of participants who engaged in various living strategies at least 'a few times a week' or 'everyday' during the pandemic. Results Of the 63 respondents, 84% were men, median age 57 years, and 62% lived alone. During the pandemic the greatest disability severity was in the uncertainty [median 30; Interquartile range (IQR): 16, 43] and mental-emotional (25; IQR: 14, 41) domains. Among the 51 participants with pre-pandemic data, HDQ severity scores were significantly greater (worse) during the pandemic (vs prior) in all domains. Greatest change from prior to during the pandemic was in the mental-emotional domain for presence (17.7; p < 0.001), severity (11.4; p < 0.001), and episodic nature (9.3; p < 0.05) of disability. Most participants (> 60%) reported engaging a 'few times a week' or 'everyday' in self-care strategies associated with maintaining sense of control and adopting positive attitudes and beliefs. Conclusions People living with HIV reported high levels of uncertainty and mental-emotional health challenges during the pandemic. Disability increased across all HDQ dimensions, with the greatest worsening in the mental-emotional health domain. Results provide an understanding of disability and self-care strategy use during the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - Hungary takes the fourth place regarding the incidence and the fifth regarding the mortality of cervical cancer among the member countries of the European Union, with 500 deaths due to this preventable illness and nearly 1200 new cases diagnosed every year. Although the vaccines have been available for 3 years, the estimated rate of the female population vaccinated against HPV is approximately 10% in the 12-26-year-age cohort. The aim of this study was to determine factors and motivations affecting the uptake of HPV vaccination among Hungarian adolescents. Examining the effects of some possible sociodemographic predictors (age and gender) and the exposure to health information on HPV vaccine acceptability were also focused on, as well as assessing the most trusted sources of information about sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).
   A nationwide anonymous questionnaire survey with a sample of 1769 students attending public primary or secondary schools was organised by the authors in 16 Hungarian cities and towns. Data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS).
   Adolescents' awareness of HPV was relatively low. Only 35% of the participants reported they had heard about HPV prior to the survey. Almost 70% of the potentially affected study population had not heard about the vaccine previously. Every fourth student did not believe that vaccination against HPV can prevent cervical cancer. If the vaccination was available free of charge, almost 80% of respondents would request it, but in case they had to pay for it, this number would significantly decrease. Significantly better knowledge and also more positive attitudes towards HPV vaccination was found in relation to the number of information sources. The majority of respondents (62-83%) were open for further information about STDs. The main trusted mediators were school-health services (61.3%), education on health at school (49.2%), health professionals (42.2%) and electronic media (24.6%).
   Since Hungarian adolescent students expect guidance about STDs principally from school health education, an urgent need for well-designed, HPV-focused educational programmes, emerges. Launching such programmes would be especially important for the adolescent population to increase their awareness of the risks associated with HPV infection thus reducing the high incidence of cervical cancer in Hungary in the future.

AB  - Introduction: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. Methods: A total of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median and 25th (Q(25)) and 75th (Q(75)) percentiles. Results: The majority of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate their eyes for research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye donation, 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the category "addressable" (e.g., not enough awareness of the topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q(25) 1, Q(75) 1). Conclusion: Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given against postmortem eye donation were often related to misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research purposes.

AB  - Background Complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) is becoming increasingly popular in horses.
   Methods Online, cross-sectional survey in 1532 horse owners. Attitude towards CAVM, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control and intention for future CAVM use were measured based on the theory of planned behaviour. Structural equation modelling was performed to characterize factors influencing intention to use CAVM.
   Results Past use of CAVM, predominantly manual therapies and herbal supplements, was reported by 72.5% of all participants. Frequently reported indications were improving horse's well-being, illness which did not resolve after conventional treatment and chronic illness. The attitude towards CAVM was positive with a median (interquartile range) score of 6 of 7 (4.75-7.00). Predictors for past CAVM use were higher owner age, alternative medicine self-use and higher education (non-university). The strongest predictor of future CAVM usage was perceived behavioural control and perceived CAVM efficacy, as well as positive attitude towards and perceived knowledge about CAVM. The veterinarian was reported as a source of information about CAVM by 86.4% of all participants.
   Conclusions Horse owners showed a high intention to use CAVM with the owners' perceived behavioural control and perceived CAVM efficacy as the strongest predictor. Veterinarian-client communication is important to inform horse owners correctly.

AB  - Despite the rise of interest in nonprofit organizations' (NPOs) retention strategies and organizational behaviour micro-mechanisms, little research has specifically addressed volunteers' religiosity and attitude towards the organization, and their links to motivation and intention to stay with NPOs. The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of religiosity as an antecedent of volunteers' intention to stay with the organization, and the mediating role of both volunteers' motivation and attitude towards the organization in such a relationship. Building on motivational functions theory and the theory of planned behaviour, a conceptual model is proposed and empirically tested using bootstrapped multiple mediation analysis on a sample of 379 volunteers of NPOs located in Italy. The results support the role of religiosity as a significant predictor of volunteer intentions, and the mediating role of motivation and attitude on this relationship. Volunteers who are driven by their religious values are likely to develop a stronger motivation to volunteering and a positive attitude towards NPOs' activities, and consequently a stronger willingness to stay with the organization. The study contributes to the literature on NPOs by stressing the role of antecedents and underlying mechanisms affecting volunteers' motivation and, in turn, their intention to stay with the organization.

AB  - Mobile touch screen device (MTSDs) use is becoming widespread in children and has negative and positive consequences. Yet, factors associated with greater use remain unexplored, despite the importance of their identification for intervention purposes. It stands to reason that parents can influence child MTSD use, via their attitudes, beliefs, role-modelling, and style of parenting. Here, we examined the associations between these parental characteristics and child MTSD use and whether parenting styles specifically with regard to child MTSD use exist. Hungarian parents (N = 1283) were surveyed about their children's digital activities, their own attitudes and beliefs regarding the child's MTSD use, and their own attachment to- and use of mobile phones. Taking a data-driven approach, distinct "digital parenting styles" were identified and these resembled general parenting styles. Findings further suggested that children spent more time with MTSD use if their parents: were more permissive, more authoritative and less authoritarian; had a lower educational level; exhibited greater attachment to their mobile phones; and had more positive attitudes towards, and attributed less harm and more benefits to, early device use. These results are the first evidence for existence of digital parenting styles and suggest that parental characteristics are potential prevention and treatment targets.

AB  - Little is known about the extent to which evidence-based prevention topics are taught in medical school. All class of 2003 medical students (n = 2316) at 16 US schools were eligible to complete three questionnaires: at the beginning of first and third years and in their senior year, with 80.3% responding. We queried these students about 21 preventive medicine topics, concerning the extent of their training and their patient counseling frequency at some of these time points. At the beginning of the third year, self-reported extensive training was low for all preventive medicine topics (range 7-26%). USPSTF-recommended topics received more curricular time (median for topics: 36% if recommended versus 24.5% if not, P = 0.025), as did topics addressed through testing rather than through discussion (median for topics: 37% for testing and 25% for discussion, P = 0.005). Extensive training was always associated with higher counseling frequency, and intention to go into primary care, female gender, a positive attitude toward prevention and positive personal health habits were associated with higher counseling frequency. Although some bemoan the overall low levels of US medical students' prevention-related training and practice, we demonstrate that at least they are preferentially evidence-based, a novel and encouraging finding for preventionists.

AB  - (T)here is a paucity of research exploring patients' and their informal carers' experience of coping with and factors impacting on the lung cancer experience. This study aims to explore how patients and their informal carers cope with a diagnosis of lung cancer and describe the key factors that mediate distress in this population in order that they may be better supported in the future. This was a qualitative study employing semi-structured interviews and framework analysis to elicit the experience of 37 patients with lung cancer and 23 primary carers regarding their coping with and factors influencing patient/carer distress. The findings illustrate that participants used both emotional-and problem-focused coping strategies, including accepting the reality of lung cancer, adopting a positive attitude/fighting spirit, denial, avoidance and distraction and information seeking. Maintaining normality was also important. Key factors that mediate the lung cancer experience were also identified including hope, social network, prior experience of cancer and other chronic illnesses, the competing coping strategies of patients and their primary carers, the unpredictable nature of patients' behaviour, changing symptomatology, the perceived attitudes of health professionals and the impact of perceived delays in diagnosis. This study provides important insights into how patients with lung cancer and their primary carers might be better supported.

AB  - Background: People want to be well informed and ask for more information regarding their health. The public can use different sources (i.e. the Internet, health care providers, friends, family, television, radio, and newspapers) to access information about their health. Insight into the types and sources of vaccine related information that parents use, and reasons why they seek extra information is needed to improve the existing information supply about childhood vaccinations.
   Methods: Dutch parents with one or more children aged 0-4 years received an online questionnaire (N = 4000) measuring psychosocial determinants of information-seeking behaviour and self-reports of types and sources of vaccine information searched for (response rate 14.8%). We also tested two invitation approaches (i.e., reply card versus Internet link in invitation letter) to observe the difference in response rate.
   Results: Almost half of the parents (45.8%) searched for extra information. Of all the respondents, 13% indicated they had missed some information, particularly about side effects of vaccines (25%). Intention to search for vaccination information was influenced by positive attitude and perceived social norm towards information-seeking behaviour. There was no difference in the response rate between the two invitation approaches.
   Conclusions: The information provided by the National Immunization Programme (NIP) might be sufficient for most parents. However, some parents mentioned that they did not receive enough information about side effects of vaccinations, which was also the topic most searched for by parents. Public Health Institutes (PHIs) and child healthcare workers should therefore be aware of the importance to mention this aspect in their communication (materials) towards parents. The PHIs must ensure that their website is easy to find with different search strategies. Since the child healthcare worker is perceived as the most reliable information source, they should be aware of their role in educating parents about the NIP.

AB  - Background: Students need to practice their hands-on skills when they are young to develop confidence for their future careers. Nowadays, iSTEAM (integrated science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) contests provide opportunities for participants to experience meaningful and challenging hands-on tasks that may foster learning, and to generate positive attitudes that may enhance their self-confidence in their ability to make miniature models.
   Purpose: To understand the relations between mastery orientation of hands-on tasks, hands-on making interest, engagement, and self-confidence enhancement in an iSTEAM (integrated science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics) contest.
   Sample: The sample consisted of 212 junior high students including 131 males and 81 females who were preparing to join the iSTEAM contest.
   Design and Method: Data were collected from 212 questionnaires and subjected to confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling using AMOS 20.
   Results: The results indicated that mastery orientation of hands-on tasks was positively related to hands-on making interest and engagement. Engagement was positively related to hands-on making interest, and hands-on making interest and engagement were positively related to self-confidence enhancement.
   Conclusions: Students with high levels of mastery orientation might gain higher self-confidence, mediated by their interest and engagement in a science and technology hands-on making contest.

AB  - This study addresses, on the basis of ethnographic, folkloric, linguistic, and field data, the role of cattle in Buryat myths and rites, with reference to their economic significance. Buryat words relating to the exteriors of animals, sex differences, etc. are listed The bull image features in traditional Buryat systems of time calculation and in the tradition olgiving protective names homonymical to words denoting the bull are described Mythological beliefs concerning the cattle are analyzed. The Bulagats, a major Buryat subgroup, practiced the tribal cult ofBukha-noyon, to whom the bull alluded. This practice was connected with the idea of shape-shilling, whereby the bull symbolized the male principle. In terms of cosmogony, the bull was part of habitation spheres such as sky, earth, and water, and their elements such as celestial bodies and mountains, and fire. The positive attitude to the bull and the cow was mirrored by views regarding supernatural properties ofbull hair and urine, cow's milk and placenta, and devices used for managing draft bulls (the yoke and the hair rope zele). At the same time, the cattle were associated with the Lower World and its inhabitants; they functioned as mediators and could symbolize death. A detailed description of the bull image in traditional Buryat ritualism is provided.

AB  - Several studies have shed light on factors that contribute to radicalization. However, fewer studies have addressed the factors that contribute to deradicalization, especially with terrorist detainees as participants. The present study investigates the role of attitudes toward rehabilitation in deradicalization programs, and its role in predicting the outcome for these programs. We hypothesized that when terrorist detainees adopt alternative identities (identities alternative to their jihadist identity), their support for jihad as war will be lessened, even when they still hold jihadist ideology as their source of significance. To test this hypothesis, we obtained 89 interview profiles of actual terrorist detainees across 35 Indonesian prisons. We found that lesser support for jihad as war was predicted by a more positive attitude toward the deradicalization program, and this was mediated by the adoption of alternative identities. Further, the effect of the mediator on support for jihad as war was neither weakened nor strengthened by perceived significance of jihadist ideology. These findings suggest that even when a person possesses a strong ideological commitment to jihad, this may not manifest into violence when they adopt alternative identities and goals. These results were interpreted and discussed through goal systems theory and the multifinality account of radical behavior.

AB  - Background: Sexuality in later life may be compromised by restrictive attitudes, and lack of knowledge among professionals. This study examined social work students' attitudes and knowledge towards sexuality and sexual expression in later life and investigated associated factors.
   Method: Undergraduate social work students from Israel (n = 375) completed the Attitudes and Knowledge towards Older Adult's Sexuality Scale and questionnaires regarding contacts and exposure to older adults, prior sexual education and sociodemographic.
   Results: Attitudes and knowledge were correlated. First year students were the most conservative and demonstrated the least knowledge. No differences were found between men and women regarding attitude. However, men and married students had greater knowledge regarding older adults' sexuality than women or non-married students did. Increased religious observance predicted more conservative attitudes. Age predicted more permissive attitudes and greater knowledge about sexuality in later life. A mediating process examined, suggested knowledge is a mediator variable between age and attitudes towards older adults' sexuality.
   Conclusion: As the population in Israel and in Western countries ages, it is important to examine the knowledge and attitudes of social work students regarding older adults' sexuality and to develop educational and interventional programs aimed at increasing awareness, knowledge, and positive attitudes in this area.

AB  - In recent years, digital health care and social welfare services have been spreading rapidly and partly replacing face-to-face services, particularly in developed countries. This may lead to a pronounced digital inequality. This population-based study of Finnish adults (N = 4495) examined the associations of offline resources with perceived benefits from online services and the mediating effects of access, skills and attitudes in these associations. The results indicated that those with lower personal, economic and social offline resources perceived online services as less beneficial. This was largely explained by poor access to the services, poor digital skills and negative attitudes towards online services. To increase equality, it would be important to improve Internet access and digital skills and implement means to address negative attitudes, especially among vulnerable groups. Moreover, online health and social welfare services should be designed to be more inclusive.

AB  - Social media influencers are increasingly employed as product endorsers, and a growing body of academic research confirms that influencers are an effective advertising instrument. However, more research is needed on the specific influencer characteristics driving this success, and the processes responsible for these effects. In this study, we investigated to what extent product-influencer fit and number of followers interact in contributing to positive advertising outcomes and influencer evaluations. Moreover, we investigated to what extent perceived credibility of the influencer and identification with the influencer mediate these relationships. We conducted a 2 (poor vs. good product-influencer fit) X 2 (moderate vs. high number of followers) between-subjects experiment among 432 Dutch Instagram users. Participants were exposed to Instagram posts of health and fitness influencers who endorsed either a protein shake (good-fit) or ice cream (poor-fit). Results showed that fit and number of followers seem to work in tandem: although influencers with a high number of followers are liked more, and their endorsements result in a more positive attitude toward both the ad and product, and a greater likelihood to buy the advertised product as compared to influencers with a moderate number of followers, the endorsed product should fit the influencer's self-branded image for these positive effects to occur. Moreover, effects were all mediated by perceived credibility and identification, which appear to be important drivers of influencer endorsement effects. Together, our findings contribute to a growing body of knowledge on the processes driving audience responses to influencer marketing, and provide clear guidelines for practitioners.

AB  - Our study evaluates the role of exposure to COVID-19 messaging in negativity towards COVID-19 and the intentions to engage in protective behaviors. Building on the theory of planned behavior (TPB), we derive a mediation model and test it in a sample of 737 participants (556 Romanians and 181 Kazakhs). The exposure to general information concerning COVID-19 positively predicts negative attitudes, negative emotions and the emergence of subjective norms in relation to COVID-19, as well as the likelihood of engaging in protective behavioral intentions. The exposure to humoristic communication, however, diluted the positive association between exposure to general information and negative attitudes, as well as negative emotions. The results support the overall predictions of the TPB and report positive associations between negative attitudes towards COVID-19, subjective norms and behavioral control on the one hand, and protective behavioral intentions on the other. Negative emotions significantly predict the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors. Our results also show that older respondents tend to develop more negative attitudes towards COVID-19, yet they do not report stronger intentions to engage in protective behaviors than younger respondents. An important emergent result shows that time lapse seems to increase negativity towards COVID-19, yet it does not directly increase the likelihood of engaging in protective behaviors. Implications for public health communication related to COVID-19 are discussed.

AB  - The coronavirus disease Covid-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic is exacting a huge toll on individuals, families, communities, and societies across the world. The study of public communication is a key aspect for slowing the spread of the virus and therefore reducing the death rate. This article analyses political leaders' crisis communication during the Covid-19 pandemic of the most affected European countries, Boris Johnson (United Kingdom), Emmanuel Macron (France), Pedro Sanchez (Spain) and Giuseppe Conte (Italy), in addition to Tedros Adhanom as a representative of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and Ursula Von der Leyen President of the European Union (EU). The study focuses on the visual information (images and videos) published in their Twitter profiles, with the aim of highlighting the strategies of recommendations by health authorities during the first 40 days of the pandemic. After analysis of the visual content of 634 tweets, the results show significant differences amongst the preventative measures recommended (social distancing, use of masks, hand washing, etc.) and the public image projected by the leaders in their Twitter profiles.

AB  - Online media offer unprecedented access to digital public spheres, largely enhancing users' opportunities for participation and providing new means for strengthening democratic discourse. At the same time, the last decades have demonstrated that online discourses are often characterised by so-called 'dark participation' the spreading of lies and incivility. Using 'problematic behaviour theory' as framework and focusing on incivility as a specific form of dark participation, this article investigates the role of users' personal characteristics, media use, and online experiences in relation to offensive and hateful online behaviour. Using a random-quota survey of the German population, we explored how dark personality traits, political attitudes and emotions, the frequency and spaces of online-media use, and users' experiences with both civil and uncivil online discourses predicted participants own uncivil behaviour, such as posting, sharing, or liking uncivil content. We found that 46% of the participants who had witnessed incivility in the last three months also engaged in uncivil participation. A hierarchical logistic regression analysis showed that incivility was associated with manipulative personality traits as measured by the dark triad, right-wing populist voting intentions, and frequent social-media use. Experiences with both civil comments and hate speech predicted higher levels of uncivil participation. The strongest predictor was participants' personal experiences with online victimisation. Overall, the results confirmed that dark participation in the sense of uncivil engagement results from the interplay of personality traits, an online environment that allows for deviant engagement, and, most importantly, participants' experiences in said environment.

AB  - There is much discussion about the potential negative effects of social media use on people?s political attitudes. But, does social media use shape trust in government? We use evidence from the 2012 and 2016 ANES as well as the 2018 American Institutional Confidence Poll to test competing expectations regarding this question: that social media polarizes versus de-polarizes trust judgments across partisan lines. Our analyses provide greater support for the expectation of polarization. We then unpack the potential mechanisms behind these findings. We use the number of ?stealth? issue campaigns targeted to the respondent?s state in 2016 as a proxy for the amount of political conflict the respondent was likely to have experienced when using social media during the 2016 Presidential election. Notably, we find that polarization is substantially impacted by the nature of the voter?s broader political environment. These findings are consequential for our understanding of how social media influences public opinion and draws attention to the role of the broader political context for this relationship.

AB  - Introduction: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly utilised in medical imaging systems and processes, and radiographers must embrace this advancement. This study aimed to investigate perceptions, knowledge, and expectations towards integrating AI into medical imaging amongst a sample of radiographers and determine the current state of AI education within the community. Methods: A cross-sectional online quantitative study targeting radiographers based in Europe was conducted over ten weeks. Captured data included demographical information, participants' perceptions and understanding of AI, expectations of AI and AI-related educational backgrounds. Both descriptive and inferential statistical techniques were used to analyse the obtained data. Results: A total of 96 valid responses were collected. Of these, 64% correctly identified the true definition of AI from a range of options, but fewer (37%) fully understood the difference between AI, machine learning and deep learning. The majority of participants (83%) agreed they were excited about the advancement of AI, though a level of apprehensiveness remained amongst 29%. A severe lack of education on AI was noted, with only 8% of participants having received AI teachings in their pre-registration qualification. Conclusion: Overall positive attitudes towards AI implementation were observed. The slight apprehension may stem from the lack of technical understanding of AI technologies and AI training within the community. Greater educational programs focusing on AI principles are required to help increase European radiography workforce engagement and involvement in AI technologies. Implications for practice: This study offers insight into the current perspectives of European based radiographers on AI in radiography to help facilitate the embracement of AI technology and convey the need for AI-focused education within the profession.

AB  - Purpose Social media and sustainability are changing Chinese consumers' consumption behavior in notable ways. Few apparel industry sustainability efforts are enforced or well known in China. As China operates its own social media sites, it is necessary to study Chinese social media, rather than Western types, in order to understand its influence on Chinese consumer behavior with regard to sustainability. By extending the theory of reasoned action (TRA) and the prototype willingness model, the purpose of this paper is to investigate how Chinese consumers were taught their environmentally sustainable apparel (ESA) consumption behavior through social media, and also how the influence of peers affected their purchase intentions. Design/methodology/approach A total of 238 survey responses were collected and analyzed from a Chinese research firm in 2016. In accord with the study objectives, an exploratory factor analysis was first conducted, and then a two-step analysis of a structural equation model was employed for hypothesis testing. To test the significance of hypothesized mediated effects, a bootstrap procedure with 2,000 bootstrap samples from the original data was used to compute bias-corrected 95% CI for indirect effects. Moreover, hierarchical regressions were demonstrated to verify the unique contribution of social media influence. Findings The study findings support the previous literature that indicated positive attitudes toward environmentally sustainable purchasing behavior increased as Chinese consumers learned about social and environmental issues. Also, results of the analysis revealed that Chinese consumers' engagement with social media and their peers were important social influences that were directly tied to increasing sustainable apparel purchase intentions. Originality/value By extending two grand theories of the prototype willingness model theory and the TRA, this study underlines a novel link between the influence of social media and ESA purchase intentions among Chinese consumers. Results are valuable in a global context as it is one of only a few studies to explore Chinese consumers' purchase intentions of ESA through an exclusive social media platform - WeChat - in China.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine parental attitudes regarding engagement with video games by their children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and whether attitudes vary based on ASD symptom severity.
   Method: Online survey methodology was used to gather information from parents of children with ASD between the ages of 8 and 12 years. The finalized data set included 152 cases. Descriptive statistics and frequency analyses were used to examine participant demographics and video game play. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used to evaluate questions on the theory of planned behavior. Regression analyses determined the predictive ability of the theory of planned behavior constructs, and t tests provided additional descriptive information about between-group differences.
   Results: Children with ASD play video games. There are no significant differences in the time, intensity, or types of games played based on severity of ASD symptoms (mild vs. moderate). Parents of children with ASD had positive attitudes about video game play.
   Conclusions: Parents of children with ASD appear to support video game play. On average, parents indicated video game play was positive for their children with ASD, particularly if they believed the games were having a positive impact on their child's development.

AB  - Purpose: This study examined the need for public communication about nanotechnologies and nanoparticles by providing a comparative analysis of the differences in risk awareness of nanotechnologies and nanoparticles between consumers and experts.
   Methods: A total of 1,007 consumers and 150 experts participated in this study. A questionnaire was prepared examining their awareness of nanotechnologies and nanomaterials and their view of the necessity for information and education about the latest nanotechnologies and nanomaterials.
   Results: Our results indicated that the expert group recognized that they knew more than consumers about nanotechnology and that there was a need for relevant education in nanotechnology and nanomaterials among consumers. We found that the consumer group had a more positive attitude toward nanotechnology, even though they did not know much about it. Moreover, the consumer group was inconclusive about the type of information on nanotechnology deemed necessary for the public, as well as the suitable party to be responsible for education and for delivering the information.
   Conclusion: An education and promotion program targeting consumers should be established to overcome the differences between consumers and experts in their awareness of nanotechnology. Specifically, the establishment of concepts for nanomaterials or nanoproducts is required immediately. With clear standards on nanomaterials, consumers can make informed decisions in selecting nanoproducts in the market.

KW  - virtual activities
AB  - In early 2020, the world was taken aback with the spread of the Covid-19 disease by an unknown coronavirus. Months later, the World Health Organization characterised this outbreak as a pandemic, urging decision makers to take actions to slow down the infection rate. Science communicators had to adapt their activities in support of recommendations for social distancing. In this article, we describe the mobilisation of astronomy communicators in Brazil, one of the most affected countries, as a consequence of social inequality, cuts in science funding and science denialism by the government. Practitioners filled out a survey, and the results showed that the amount and diversity of online activities increased considerably. Initiatives such as virtual exhibitions, transmission of sky observations and collective planetary sessions engaged thousands of people. Discussions about the pandemic and how science works were also present in several activities. The pandemic forced the community of astronomy communicators in Brazil to adapt to the situation, and motivated many of them to offer online activities. The diversity of those who communicate astronomy is extensive and appears to be increasing.

AB  - Cultural diversity is increasing in the US, which is likely to have an impact on preferences toward future energy policy.
   This research investigates people's lived experience and preferences through a nationally representative survey (n = 3000) regarding the energy system, and how these relate to cultural group and other demographics.
   Our study highlights the influence of cultural background in the US, alongside educational achievement and income level on perceptions toward the energy system and energy policy.
   Through rigorous multivariate statistical evaluation of cultural groupings, income and education on energy system preferences and lived experience, we identified cultural groups that experience energy affordability differently, irrespective of income or educational achievement.
   For energy policy issue and factor importance, we identify a positive link with educational achievement and income, varying across cultural grouping.
   Overall, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islanders and American Indian and Native Alaskans had a muted response to energy policy issues and energy system factors compared to their peers.
   Our findings identified a need to enhance overall educational outcomes to engender more positive attitudes toward improving the environment, and the need for policy makers to be aware of cultural group preferences to enable development of energy policies which improve recognition justice outcomes.

AB  - Purpose - Entrepreneurial intention is regarded as a useful and practical approach to understanding actual entrepreneurial behavior. Planned behavior has been widely applied to examine entrepreneurial intention. Nevertheless, how risk aversion affects entrepreneurial intention using the model of planned behavior is not well understood. The purpose of this paper is to develop an integrated model based on planned behavior to examine the direct and indirect effect of risk aversion on entrepreneurial intention concurrently.
   Design/methodology/approach - The paper first uses factor analysis to study the latent constructs underlying determinants of planned behavior, risk aversion, and entrepreneurial intention. Then, it applies the technique of structural equation modeling to explore relationships among latent constructs. There are 306 survey responses collected from dental school students to run the analysis.
   Findings - The determinants of planned behavior are positively associated with entrepreneurial intention. There is no direct relationship between risk aversion and entrepreneurial intention. Risk aversion only indirectly reduces entrepreneurial intention through determinants of planned behavior.
   Research limitations/implications - The results of the integrated model may be constrained by the sample context of dental students. Replicating the model by using other samples with various educational backgrounds can strengthen the implication of the study. Another limitation is the weakness of the cross-sectional study design, leaving room for improvement by using longitudinal data in the future.
   Practical implications - Risk aversion only indirectly reduces entrepreneurial intention. To establish an environment with a strong entrepreneurial intention, a focus on developing a positive attitude and strengthening entrepreneurial skills are perhaps more fruitful than lowering risk aversion. This study also suggests that non-business students may need additional business education to improve the perception of self-efficacy.
   Originality/value - The integrated model of this paper is original. The development of the model draws support from planned behavior adjusted to the context of starting a business.

AB  - Public stigma associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) commonly stems from judgments surrounding sensory overload symptoms. As individuals try and make sense of observed disordered behaviors of those with ASD, they are quick to develop dispositional attributions instead of acknowledging situational instigators. Interventions aimed at educating the lay public that disordered actions are a result of a biological causes have been successful in lessening perceptions of responsibility, yet foster an out-group perspective allowing prejudice attitudes and discriminatory behaviors to persist. The present study examines the short-term effectiveness of engagement with a virtual simulation, Auti-Sim, to combat stigma by giving lay people a first-person experience of sensory overload. To assess Auti-Sim, a between-subject, in-laboratory experimental design was employed. A total of 123 undergraduate students were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 interventions (virtual simulation engagement, observation of simulation engagement, or reading text vignettes). Participants completed a brief pretest questionnaire, encountered the intervention, and then completed a post-test questionnaire. Engagement with the virtual simulation resulted in heightened perspective taking, which subsequently increased emotional concern, helping intentions, and willingness to volunteer compared with the observation only or text vignette intervention. Positive attitudes toward those with ASD did not differ across interventions. Fostering a different understanding of disordered action through a virtual simulation has the potential to elicit perspective taking and subsequent empathetic outcomes. Perspective taking seems to encourage perceptions of in-group belonging rather than out-group categorization and thus might be a desired outcome for stigma-reducing efforts.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) is currently spreading in all the areas of the world. This ongoing pandemic has clear impacts in terms of the relevance of psychological needs. Psychological needs such as self-esteem, self-actualization, and relatedness only become relevant once basic physiological needs and safety and survivor needs have been satisfied. Because psychological constructs are not objectively existing constituents of reality but rather efforts to represent it, they tend to become more or less relevant and salient as a function of prevailing conditions. Starting from this premise, the current paper focuses on the relevance that fears with an interpersonal basis (i.e. the fear of missing out and the fear of not mattering) have during a period in which physical distancing or "social distancing" has been implicated as a crucial important public health intervention that can help stop transmission of the coronavirus. We underscore how the current health crisis impacts the self and identity of people who are confronted with the discrepancy between their usual psychological needs and current realities.

AB  - This paper examines the compliance of Spanish crime reporting with the principles of the 2016 EU Directive on presumption of innocence, which aims at preventing the publication of information that might bias the public and the jurors against the suspect. A content analysis applied to a sample of 200 crime news stories published by eleven of the most popular print and online news platforms in 2018 reveals that the Spanish press coverage of crime is centered around the pre-trial and sentence stages, with little attention to the oral trial. The full name and the face portrait of the suspect appear in roughly one-third of the stories, but this overwhelmingly happens in news stories reporting on the court's decision, so that the presumption of innocence is generally protected. Interestingly, the legacy media are more likely to report on the victim's full name and the crime details that online digital media. One-fourth of the stories include accusations of guilt, as prosecutor attorneys and other officials are more frequently cited than defense lawyers. Although the Spanish press is largely compliant with the recommendations of the EU Directive, the lack of attention to the oral phase, where the arguments of both parts are deployed and contrasted, leads to a bias in the coverage against the suspect.

AB  - Dengue fever is a major public health problem in Malaysia. This study aimed to assess factors affecting knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue fever among a selected population in Malaysia. A descriptive, community-based, cross sectional study was conducted with 300 participants from three different geographical settings in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas within the states of Selangor and Kuala Lumpur. The questionnaire included questions on demographic data, knowledge, attitudes, and practices regarding dengue fever. Mean age of respondents was 34.4 (+/- 5.7) years, and the age ranged from 18 to 65 years. The majority of respondents were married (54.7%), Malays (72.7%) and heard about dengue fever (89.7%). Television was the common source of information about dengue fever (97.0%). Participants answered 4 out of 15 items of knowledge incorrectly There was no significant association between knowledge score and socio-demographic factors. About one-fifth of the respondents (24%) believed that immediate treatment is not necessary for dengue fever, and the majority of them were not afraid of the disease (96.0%). Attitudes toward dengue fever were significantly associated with the level of education and employment status (p<0.05). Practice was associated significantly with age, marital status, and geographic area (p<0.05) and knowledge on dengue fever (p=0.030). There is a need to increase health promotion activities through campaigns and social mobilization to increase knowledge regarding dengue fever. This would help to mold positive attitudes and cultivate better preventive practices among the public to eliminate dengue in the country

AB  - Background: Technology-enhanced learning (TEL) gives a view to improved education. However, there is a need to clarify how TEL can be used effectively. The study compared students' attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face course on theoretical radiological science and a TEL course where students could combine face-to-face lectures and e-learning modules at their best convenience.
   Methods: 42 third-year dental students were randomly assigned to the traditional face-to-face group and the TEL group. Both groups completed questionnaires before the beginning and after completion of the course on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning. After completion of the course both groups also filled in the validated German-language TRIL (Trierer Inventar zur Lehrevaluation) questionnaire for the evaluation of courses given at universities.
   Results: Both groups had a positive attitude towards e-learning that did not change over time. The TEL group attended significantly less face-to-face lectures than the traditional group. However, both groups stated that face-to-face lectures were the basis for education in a theoretical radiological science course.
   The members of the TEL group rated e-mail reminders significantly more important when they filled in the questionnaire on attitudes and opinions towards a traditional face-to-face lectures and technology-enhanced learning for the second time after completion of the course.
   The members of the technology-enhanced learning group were significantly less confident in passing the exam compared to the members of the traditional group. However, examination results did not differ significantly for traditional and the TEL group.
   Conclusions: It seems that technology-enhanced learning in a theoretical radiological science course has the potential to reduce the need for face-to-face lectures. At the same time examination results are not impaired. However, technology-enhanced learning cannot completely replace traditional face-to-face lectures, because students indicate that they consider traditional teaching as the basis of their education.

Overall, 389 students (52% male) aged between 13 and 19 years (mean = 16.56 year; SD = 1.26) participated to a media literacy intervention (i.e., "intervention group") while 103 students aged between 14 and 19 year (mean = 16.10 year; SD = 1.38) were considered as the control group (i.e., "control group"). In two separate occasions over the course of six consecutive months, students in both groups filled out a set of questionnaires which included measures of social-cognitive beliefs (i.e., attitudes, subjective norms, intentions) and a self-reported measure of retrospective use of doping (Yes/No) and supplements (Yes/No). Compared to students in the control group (Mean((time1)) = 1.96; SD(time1) = 0.85; and Mean((time2)) = 2.09; SD(time2) = 0.94), intervention students on average expressed relatively stronger attitudes against doping use over time (Mean((time1)) = 2.2; SD(time1) = 0.85; and Mean((time2)) = 2.05; SD(time2) = 0.82). Students in the latter group also showed a statistically significant decrease in self-reported supplement use (Use((time1)) = 6.7%; Use((time2)) = 3.8%; p = 0.05, McNemar Test). Interestingly, albeit marginally significant, students in the control group showed a relative increment in the self-reported use of supplements over time (Use((time1)) = 4.9%; Use((time2)) = 8.7%; p = 0.22, McNemar Test). Overall, the media literacy intervention investigated in the present study was effective in decreasing adolescent student's positive attitudes toward doping use and in reducing the use of legal PAES. These findings supported the generalizability and the usefulness of a media literacy approach in the specific field of PAES.

AB  - Purpose Mixed products, while presenting new business opportunities, raise considerable concerns among managers and researchers. However, whether mixed products (functionally vs culturally) trigger positive or negative consumer reactions is controversial. Hereby, the present research seeks to resolve the conflicting effects by examining the moderating role of service provider type (humanoid service robot vs human employee) in the impact of mixed products on consumer reactions. Design/methodology/approach Two studies were conducted to explore the effect of mixed products on consumer reactions. Specifically, study 1 was developed to examine the interplay of mixed products and service provider type in shaping consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions under an offline shopping scenario; study 2 further provided evidence for the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above processes under an online-shopping context. Findings The convergent findings of two studies conclude that, when served by a humanoid service robot (vs human employee), consumers exhibit more positive attitudes and higher purchase intentions toward functionally (vs culturally) mixed products. Furthermore, such effect is driven by the perceived usefulness (vs perceived enjoyment) when served by humanoid robot (vs human employee). Originality/value First, this is one of the first studies to conceptualize mixed products as the two-dimensional construct (i.e. functionally mixed and culturally mixed), and the findings sheds light on the mixed products literature. Second, this paper introduces service provider type as the boundary condition for the impact of mixed products on consumers' product attitudes and purchase intentions, which expands the match-up hypothesis and schema theory in service marketing. Third, the current research explores the mediating roles of perceived usefulness and perceived enjoyment in the above effects, which could make significant contribution to the motivation theory.

AB  - Introduction: Out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) is a major cause of sudden cardiac death which can be prevented by early cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). International bodies recommend that basic life support (BLS) skills be taught in schools in order to increase the rate of bystander CPR and reduce mortality from OHCA. We are not aware of any BLS education program for non-healthcare students in Nigeria. This study was to assess the awareness and attitude to acquiring BLS skills among university students.
   Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study among final year university undergraduates using a questionnaire that assessed students' sociodemographic characteristics, awareness of CPR, previous experiences, and attitude to basic life support (BLS). Counts and proportions were compared for the demographic characteristics using Chisquared and Fisher's exact tests.
   Results: Four hundred and seventy-five students from 15 faculties participated in this study, median age was 22.8 years (interquartile range: 21.2-24.5 years). Majority (82.5%) have heard of CPR, 29.7% have undergone CPR training; 77.3% of those who had been trained were confident that they could perform CPR. Previous CPR training was significantly associated with faculty, year of study and age. Eighty-nine (18.7%) students have witnessed someone die from a trauma. Four hundred and fifty (94.7%) respondents would like to get BLS training, 440 (92.6%) think that CPR training should be included in the school curriculum.
   Conclusion: There is good awareness and positive attitude to the acquisition and practice of cardiopulmonary resuscitation among university students in Nigeria. Few students however, have been trained to administer bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Therefore, there is a need to implement university wide BLS education in Nigeria.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to analyse whether a social exchange relationship between temporary workers and organizations is possible. The authors aim to consider whether, when training is perceived by an employee as an organizational practice that promotes his or her employability, this entails a social exchange relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach - Surveys from 240 call centre workers were analyzed using correlation and multiple regression to explore relationships between training to promote employability, perceived organizational support (PUS) and affective commitment.
   Findings - The data support the idea that social exchange theories are useful frameworks in explaining temporary workers' affective commitment towards organisations. Organisational investment in training was positively related to the affective commitment of these temporary workers. However, employees attributed greater importance to the fact that training increased their employability than to the number of training hours received. The relationship between this human resource management practice and affective commitment partly occurred through the perceived organisational support. Such perception partially mediates the relationship between training as a promoter of employability and this positive attitude.
   Research limitations/implications - The study is limited due to sample nature and the lack of longitudinal design. It does not provide implications for other types of commitment that may be relevant for temporary workers (continuance commitment, for example).
   Practical implications - An important implication from this research is that employers should not assume that training is an investment without return from temporary workers. Developmental opportunities, while important to all employees, did make temporary workers more committed to organizations.
   Originality/value - The paper is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to assess training as promoting employability with a specific measure. While the results are simple, they refute many stereotypes of temporary workers and add an important perspective to the human resource management literature.

AB  - Aim Media as a source of information can shape public opinion regarding the COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during the COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors-age, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic level-on sources of information. Subject and methods An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. Results The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less. Conclusion In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors. Researchers and policymakers can use a source of information to develop crisis-response strategies by considering variations in the demographic factors.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this study is to identify the structural processes that lead citizens to escape their common social circles when talking about politics and public affairs (e.g. "filter bubbles"). To do so, this study tests to what extent political attitudes, political behavior, news media consumption and discussion frequency affect discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. Design/methodology/approach Supported by the polling group Nielsen, this study uses a two-wave panel online survey to study the antecedents and mechanisms of discussion network heterogeneity among US citizens. To test the hypotheses and answer the research questions, ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions (cross-sectional, lagged and autoregressive) and mediation analyses were conducted. Findings The findings imply that political discussion frequency functions as the key element in explaining the mechanism that leads politically interested and participatory citizens (online) as well as news consumers of traditional and online media to seek a more heterogeneous discussion network, disrupting the so-called "filter bubbles." However, mediation analyses also showed that discussion frequency can lead to more homogenous discussion networks if people score high on political knowledge, possibly reflecting the formation of a close network of political-savvy individuals. Originality/value The survey data give important insights into the 2016 pre-election situation, trying to explain why US citizens were more likely to remain in homogenous discussion networks when talking about politics and public affairs. By using two-wave panel data, the analyses allow to draw tentative conclusions about the influential and inhibiting factors and mechanisms that lead individuals to seek/avoid a more heterogeneous discussion network.

AB  - Cultural diversity due to immigration has become a key topic in many societies today. The question of how the native population experiences these developments is of prime importance for intercultural relations and sets the base for acculturation of immigrants. Drawing on attachment and multiculturalism research, we supposed here that general and specific feelings of security might be related to more positive attitudes toward cultural diversity, whereas feelings of threat might be related to less openness. More precisely, the present study investigated how natives' general attachment (secure or fearful) as well as their specific feelings of (cultural or economic) security might be related to their expectations about acculturation of immigrants in the multicultural context of Luxembourg. The sample included N = 134 Luxembourg nationals with an average age of M = 45.02 (SD = 17.41) who filled out an online questionnaire. Results revealed that self-reported fearful general attachment was positively related to more unwelcoming acculturation orientations. Relations between general attachment and acculturation orientations were mediated by feelings of cultural security, which had strong effects on host nationals' (un) welcoming acculturation orientations over and above general attachment. Findings suggest that (un)welcoming orientations toward immigrants, entailing openness for cultural contact and exchange, are related to feelings of cultural and economic security which are partly biased by a general secure or fearful attachment. Feelings of security seem thus to provide a secure base for tolerance and openness to cultural diversity which are needed in order to deal successfully with the challenges of today's multicultural societies.

AB  - Weight stigma is pervasive and has profound negative consequences for obese individuals. The attribution-emotion approach of stigmatization holds that blame attributions relate to derogation stigmatized groups indirectly through anger and pity. Other research suggests that disgust is related to weight stigma. In the present studies, we investigate whether contempt is a reliable predictor of biases against obese individuals. Study 1 (N = 297) shows that contempt partially mediates the relation between blame and both prejudice and support for weight related discrimination policies. Studies 2 and 3 (total N = 406) added disgust and show that both contempt and disgust relate to social distance and prejudice. Contempt mediated the relation between blame and negative reactions toward obese individuals, even after controlling for other emotions, while disgust only mediated these relations in Study 2. Anger and pity did not show this mediating role, but pity was moderately associated with weight bias. Contempt is likely to play an important role in how people react to members of this stigmatized group.

AB  - Research on effects of message repetition suggested an inverted U-shaped relationship between the number of message repetitions and the attitude toward the message content. Furthermore, it was indicated that when people are processing persuasive health messages, they use source credibility as a cue for judgments about the message. Built on that, repetition of an antismoking advertisement should initially increase source credibility and negative attitudes toward smoking. But when repetition rises to an excessive level, source credibility decreases, what in turn should decrease negative attitudes toward smoking. This study (N=276) provided strong support for the hypothesized inverted U-shaped relationship. This effect was mediated by perceived source credibility and remained unaffected by smoking behavior. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the knowledge, attitude. and practice regarding evidence-based medicine (EBM) among hospital physicians in Qassim region of Saudi Arabia.
   Methods: It is a cross-sectional study. A self-administered questionnaire survey was done among 288 physicians working in secondary and tertiary care centers. The study was conducted between June and September 2015.
   Results: The overall response rate for the survey was 72%. Majority of the respondents had a positive attitude toward EBM and welcomed the concept. A total of 83% respondents stated that they used EBM in their daily practice and 93.5% agreed that practicing EBM improves patient care. There was a moderate level of awareness regarding extracting information from journals and clinical evidence databases. Although the respondents were aware and demonstrated familiarity with the process of knowledge extraction procedures to determine the best care, as many as 40% did not use them. The respondents had a poor overall understanding of the technical terms used in EBM. Among the respondents, 38.5% thought that the best way to move from opinion-based medicine to EBM was through learning the skills of EBM. The factors that positively affected physician awareness included: Academic qualification and professional title. Knowledge and attitude were affected by qualification, professional title and specialty.
   Conclusion: The attitude of most physician practitioners in this study is favorable toward EBM, but this was not correlated with knowledge and awareness. The inclusion of physician training courses in EBM concepts, technical terms and applied practice is highly recommended.

AB  - Simple Summary
   On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization declared coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak a global pandemic and an ongoing public health emergency. In the United Kingdom, quarantine and social distancing measures were implemented with immediate effect on 17 March 2020, resulting in a rapid change to the way owners managed and interacted with their horses. We surveyed 6259 horse owners to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on themselves and their horses. The majority of horse owners were visiting and riding their horses less, with increased restrictions experienced by owners who kept their horse at private livery yards. Whilst social distancing and visiting restrictions were in place at livery yards, nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for shared areas/equipment to prevent the spread of the virus between owners. Horse owners expressed concern that equine health and welfare would be negatively affected by the restrictions put in place and of financial consequences as a result of the pandemic. The majority of respondents also felt their own mental health and wellbeing was being adversely affected by not being able to visit/interact as they normally would with their horses. Equestrian influencers and national bodies should engage with increased communication and education to support horse owners through the pandemic in the short, medium, and long-term.
   COVID-19 was declared a global pandemic on 11 March 2020; the United Kingdom (UK) implemented quarantine measures shortly afterward, resulting in rapid changes in how owners managed and interacted with their horses. This study provides a rapid analysis of the initial impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on the management of UK leisure and competition horses. A 17 question online survey was distributed via equestrian social media sites to ascertain the impact of COVID-19 on horse and yard management and on human-horse interactions. Frequency analysis combined with Chi-squared and thematic analyses identified the impact of COVID-19 on UK horse owners. Major changes within horse management and horse-human interactions were reported for the majority of horse owners (>65%), regardless of the establishment type or region. Social distancing and visiting restrictions were implemented at most yards, but nearly half were not providing hand sanitization or disinfection protocols for the shared areas/equipment to prevent cross-contamination between users. The financial impact of the pandemic combined with restricted access to veterinary professionals resulted in owners expressing concerns that horse health and welfare may be compromised as a result. Horse owners also felt that the reduced opportunities for horse-human interactions were negatively affecting their mental health and wellbeing.

AB  - Chinese people's pornography use is increasing and condomless sex is prevalent in pornography. However, both the relationship between pornography and condom use among Chinese adults and the mechanisms underlying this relationship are underexplored. This study examined how perceptions of pornography were associated with attitudes toward condom use through the mediating effect of gratification of sexual pleasure and safer sex communication apprehension, and how shared pornography use with a partner during sex moderated these relationships. A total of 658 participants (391 women and 267 men) aged 18-65 years and involved in a romantic relationship completed an online survey assessing pornography consumption, condom use, gratification of sexual pleasure, and safer sex communication apprehension. Results showed that expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were associated with higher levels of gratification of sexual pleasure, which were, in turn, associated with more negative attitudes toward condom use. Expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography were also associated with lower levels of safer sex communication apprehension and lower levels of negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use with a partner during sex strengthened the direct positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and negative attitudes toward condom use. Higher levels of shared pornography use during sex also strengthened the positive relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and gratification of sexual pleasure, and the negative relationship between expressive/erotic perceptions of pornography and safer sex communication apprehension, which in turn, were significantly associated with attitudes toward condom use. Implications for sexual health education and limitations are discussed.

AB  - During the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, minimizing exposure risk for patients with cancer and health care personnel was of utmost importance. Here, we present steps taken to date to flatten the curve at the radiation oncology division of a tertiary cancer center with the goal of mitigating risk of exposure among patients and staff, and optimizing resource utilization. Response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in this large tertiary referral center included volume reduction, personal protective equipment recommendations, flexible clinic visit interaction types dictated by need and risk reduction, and numerous social distancing strategies. We hope these outlined considerations can assist the wider radiation oncology community as we collectively face this ongoing challenge. (C) 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
   Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.
   Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.

AB  - A layoff is a threatening yet common event which employees might face at some point in their working lives. In two scenario-based experiments (total N=344), we investigated which actions of a layoff agent (i.e., who delivers the layoff notice) during a dismissal notification meeting may contribute to laid-off employees' fairness judgments and negative attitudes toward the employer. In general, the extent to which layoff victims were treated with respect was consistently found to increase perceptions of interpersonal and procedural fairness and to mitigate negative attitudes toward the employer. Further results showed that layoff victims preferred to be given an adequate (vs. inadequate) explanation of the reasons for the layoff and to receive notice from the direct supervisor (vs. an external consultant). Relationships between the layoff agent's actions and layoff victims' negative attitudes toward the employer were mediated by perceptions of procedural fairness. In addition, delegating the layoff agent's task to an external consultant increased perceived psychological contract breach. Our findings have important implications for organizational justice research and for the managerial practice of implementing fair layoffs. In particular, small actions, such as treating employees with respect, might be of benefit both to humans and organizations.

AB  - This study examined the relationships between media salience of presidential candidate images, perceived candidate salience, and public attitude strength using media and public opinion data from six US presidential elections. The results indicate that media salience is positively related to both public salience and attitude strength. In addition, the findings offer modest evidence suggesting that the sequence of influence among these variables entails media salience leading to stronger attitudes, which subsequently results in increased public salience. The implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of imagined intergroup contact (Crisp & Turner, 2009) on elementary school children's explicit and implicit intergroup attitudes. Italian 5th-graders participated in a 3-week intervention involving imagining meeting an unknown immigrant peer in various situations. Approximately 1 week after the last session, they completed measures of self-disclosure and behavioral intentions toward immigrants. Furthermore, they were administered a measure of implicit prejudice. Results showed that those taking part in the intervention, compared to participants in a control condition, revealed more positive behavioral intentions and implicit attitudes toward immigrants. Moreover, self-disclosure mediated the effect of imagined contact on outgroup behavioral intentions. Theoretical and practical implications of findings are discussed.

AB  - As the use of digital technology becomes more widespread across the globe, older people remain among the group with the lowest access and usage. The digital divide may lead to double exclusion as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to limited physical social contact as experts' recommendation of continuous social distancing and lack of access and usage of internet communication will leave older people socially isolated. The aim of this study is to explore how older people in rural Nigeria may be digitally excluded and its impact during the COVID-19 pandemic. Qualitative data was obtained from 11 older people using interviews. The collected data was then transcribed and analyzed thematically. Findings show that older people in rural Nigeria were digitally excluded. However, the older people argued that the digital exclusion is not the reason for their social isolation and loneliness. The study concluded by suggesting how caregivers and social workers can assist rural older people through activity schedule and radio programs designed for older people.

AB  - Correctional facilities offer opportunities to provide comprehensive HIV services including education, testing, treatment, and coordination of post-release care. However, these services may be undermined by unaddressed HIV stigma. As part of a prison-based HIV testing study, we interviewed 76 incarcerated men and women from the North Carolina State prison system. The sample was 72% men, median age 31.5 years (range: 19 to 60). Thematic analysis revealed high levels of HIV-related fear and stigma, homophobia, incomplete HIV transmission knowledge, beliefs that HIV is highly contagious within prisons ("HIV miasma"), and the view of HIV testing as protective. Interviewees described social distancing behaviors and coping mechanisms they perceived to be protective, including knowing their HIV status and avoiding contact with others and shared objects. Interviewees endorsed universal testing, public HIV status disclosure, and segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Intensified education and counseling efforts are needed to ameliorate entrenched HIV-transmission fears and stigmatizing beliefs.

AB  - This paper aims to replicate previous findings regarding the differential impact of TV advertising and advergames on children's brand attitudes and pester intentions. Using a large data-set (N = 940, M-age = 9.8, SD = 2.4), with children ranging between 6 and 14years old, the influence of passive exposure to TV advertising is compared to active exposure to an advergame. In addition, the potential moderating effect of age is explored. In a between-participants experiment, Flemish children were randomly assigned to watch a TV ad, play an advergame, or a no marketing control condition. Results revealed that children who had played the advergame reported significantly more positive brand attitudes compared to children who had watched the TV ad and children in the no advertising exposure control group. Children's pester intent was significantly higher for the advergame compared to the TV ad, but not compared to the no advertising exposure control group. The findings further showed that children's attitudes towards the ad format mediate the impact of the advertising format on pester intent. The advergame was indirectly more persuasive than the TV ad since children reported more positive attitudes towards the advergame compared to the TV advertisement. Moreover, this mediation effect did not differ by children's age. Persuasion knowledge did not mediate the influence of the advertising format on pester intent since children's persuasion knowledge was not significantly related to pester intentions regardless of children's age.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance (ABR) is an emerging global threat to public health. Substantial evidence has indicated that community pharmacists (CPs) can play a critical role in managing the ever-increasing threat of antibiotic resistance. This study aimed to determine the knowledge, attitude, and practices of CPs (n = 180) towards antibiotics and antibiotic resistance as well as to improve the rational use of antibiotics. A two-phase mixed-methods (quantitative and qualitative) online study was conducted in Pakistan from August 2019 to March 2020 by using validated questionnaires and semi-structured interview data. Different statistical methods were used to tabulate the quantitative data, whereas inductive thematic analysis was conducted to categorize themes from the qualitative data and to draw conclusions. Approximately 64.4% of the CPs were male (mean: 29-33 years old). Overall, CPs had good knowledge of and were familiar with multidrug-resistant organisms and their roles in ABR (65.6%, median = 1, and IQR = 1), although their knowledge was poor in differentiating some antibiotic groups with their respective ABR patterns (31.1%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). Most CPs have a positive attitude towards antibiotics, with most (90.0%) identifying ABR as a critical issue in public health (median = 1 and IQR = 0). Overall, CPs' practices towards antibiotics were somewhat acceptable, where they leaned towards educating patients about the rational use of antibiotics (52.8%, median = 1, and IQR = 1). The two main themes discovered (antibiotics and counseling of patients) were related to self-medication, while educational intervention is the main subtheme. ABR is multifactorial, with subthemes related to budget, time constraints, incompetent staff, the absence of CPs, the lack of training, and the enforcement of laws and regulations being the needs of the hour in Pakistan. Effective antibiotic stewardship programs, patient education, and awareness campaigns about antibiotics and ABR along with training of the CPs are important factors that have to be addressed in a timely manner.

AB  - Background and purpose In multiple sclerosis (MS), disease-related factors and dysfunctional coping might favor the development of mental distress induced by COVID-19 containment measures. Aim of this study was exploring the relationship between disability, coping strategies, daily life reorganization and neuropsychiatric symptoms in an Italian MS population during the COVID-19 lockdown, in order to identify potentially modifiable factors that could inform clinical management of mental distress in people with MS.
   Methods We explored the relationship between mental distress, disability and coping strategies in the Italian MS population under lockdown. Structural equation modeling was applied to information collected via web survey to identify modifiable factors that could account for mental distress.
   Results A total of 845 participants (497 with MS and 348 controls) were included in the study. The MS group had higher scores than the control group for depression (P = 0.005), but not for anxiety, emotional dyscontrol or sleep disturbances. The structural equation modeling explained 74% of the variance observed in depression score. Within the model, three latent factors were characterized from measured variables: motor disability and cognitive dysfunction contributed to disability (beta = 0.509 and beta = 0.836; P < 0.001); positive attitude and exercise contributed to active attitude (beta = 0.386 and beta = 0.297; P < 0.001); and avoidance, social support and watching television contributed to passive attitude (beta = 0.301, beta = 0.243 and beta = 0.212; P < 0.001). With regard to the relationship between latent factors and their influence on depression, disability contributed to passive attitude (beta = 0.855; P < 0.001), while both passive and active attitude significantly influenced depression (beta = 0.729 and beta = -0.456; P < 0.001).
   Conclusion As a practical implication of our model, favoring exercise would enhance active attitude and its positive impact on mental well-being while, at the same time, reducing the negative impact of disability on depression, representing a valuable tool in facing COVID-19-related mental distress.

AB  - A growing body of research documents the crucial role played by moral concerns in the formation of attitudes and a wide range of political behaviors. Yet extant models of moral judgment portray a direct linkage between moral intuitions and policy attitudes, leaving little room for the influence of political context. In this article, we argue that political rhetoric plays an important role in facilitating the connection between moral intuitions and political attitudes. Using a unique combination of media content analysis of the stem cell debate and individual-level measures of the public's moral foundations, we examine the role of rhetoric in linking a person's moral foundations to his or her attitudes. Our results show that individuals who are the most likely to have been exposed to political rhetoric have the strongest connection between their moral foundations and their attitudes on the issue. We also find that rhetoric was persuasive on this moralized issue and present suggestive evidence that it was most persuasive among those who endorsed the relevant moral foundation.

AB  - Combating prejudice against social minorities is a challenging task in current multicultural societies. Mass media can decisively shape prejudice, because it often represents the main source of information about social minorities. In 3 studies in the Czech Republic (N = 445) and Switzerland (N = 362; N = 220), we investigated how prejudice against negatively and positively perceived minorities (the Roma in Study 1, Kosovo Albanians in Study 2, Italians in Study 3) is influenced by a single exposure to a print news report, by manipulating the valence of reports about minority members (positive vs. negative vs. mixed) and linguistic forms for minorities' ethnicity (nouns vs. adjectives). Positive and negative reports shaped prejudice in the respective directions; the effect of mixed reports mostly did not differ from positive reports. Labeling ethnicity with nouns (e.g., a male Roma) resulted in more prejudice than adjectives (e.g., a Roma man), independent of report valence. Report valence influenced the affective part of prejudice (i.e., feelings toward a minority), whereas language consistently shaped the behavioral part of prejudice (i.e., preferred social distance from a minority).

AB  - Background: Corona virus disease-2019 (COVID-19) is a recently emerged and rapidly growing public health emergency. Adequate knowledge, positive attitude, and good practice among different sections of the society, including health-care workers, are quintessential in prevention and control of this deadly disease. Hence, the present study was undertaken with the objective of determining the knowledge, attitude, and practice among health-care workers (HCWs) including ancillary support staff, their family members, and patients toward COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional 40-item survey was conducted among HCWs, family members, and patients in a dedicated tertiary care COVID-19 hospital during May 2020-June 2020.The responses were tabulated and regression analyses were performed to determine the significance of each parameter among different groups. Results: Of 596 participants, among health-care professionals, ancillary support staff, family members, and patients, most were graduates (72.9%, 74.6%, and 50.6%, respectively), while 50% of the patients were educated up to high school. Social media and Internet was the main source of information for health-care professionals, while it was news media for others. Younger age was significantly associated with knowledge and attitude among HCWs (P = 0.001, P= 0.006) and ancillary support staff (P = 0.01, P < 0.001), while younger age and education were positively associated with knowledge among family members (P = 0.007, P < 0.001). Among patients, only education related to better knowledge (P < 0.001) and younger age with better practice (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Overall, HCWs and ancillary support staff have better knowledge and attitude toward COVID-19. Education was associated with better practice among patients. Health education programs to improve the awareness and encourage appropriate practices toward this global hazard, especially among the general public, are required to conquer this virus and limit the spread of infection.

AB  - Background and Purpose: While there are many studies regarding the adoption of Radio Frequency Identification Devices (RFID), only a few of them deal with RFID subcutaneous microchip (RFID-SM) usage by individuals. After the first in vivo tests conducted on volunteers from 1998 to 2000, the use of RFID-SM in healthcare remains limited. This study examines the likelihood of adopting RFID-SM in healthcare from the end user's point of view.
   Design/Methodology/Approach: The aim of this paper is to develop and evaluate the model for analysing the acceptance of RFID-SM adoption. An extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) for RFID-SM adoption is proposed and empirically tested in a cross-sectional study. Online survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 531 respondents. In addition to the three original components of TAM (Perceived Usefulness, Perceived Ease of Use, and Behavioural Intentions to Use), three external variables (Health Concerns, Perceived Trust, and Age) were also included in the model. The model was validated with confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling techniques.
   Results: Perceived Usefulness has a significant impact on behavioural intentions to adopt RFID-SM in the future, while the influence of Perceived Ease of Use is not significant. The most influential external variable is Perceived Trust, indicating the lack of confidence in personal data security ensured by the state and other institutions. As expected, Health Concerns factor has a negative effect on the Perceived Trust and Perceived Usefulness of RFID-SM.
   Conclusion: The results of the empirical study prove that all external variables considered in the model significantly influence the RFID-SM adoption. The Perceived Ease of Use is irrelevant to the attitude towards the RFID-SM adoption. In addition to the proposed model, the analysis of gathered data shows that the positive attitude toward the use of RFID-SM in healthcare is rising.

AB  - Background Interventions in India to improve menstrual health and hygiene management (MHHM) have been implemented at the national, state, district and school level. However, evaluations of these interventions have been scarce. The objective of the study was to determine if a social and behavioral change communication (SBCC) intervention (GARIMA) had a relationship with knowledge, attitudes, interpersonal communication, restrictions and MHHM using a comparison group post-test only design among 2206 adolescent girls. Methods Intervention villages and adolescent girls were selected through stratified random sampling based on where GARIMA was implemented. Villages and adolescent girls in comparison villages were matched socio-demographically to intervention villages and adolescent girls. Multi-level logistic regressions assessed the relationship between the encoded exposure, mediators and MHHM. Results The results showed that the encoded exposure predicted all behaviors corresponding to MHHM. Additionally, adolescent girls in the high encoded exposure group had significantly higher knowledge about puberty and reproductive parts (AOR: 2.03 (95% CI: 1.31 - 3.15)), positive attitudes towards gender (AOR: 1.48 (95% CI: 1.02 - 2.16)) and higher levels of some discussion and dialogue (AOR: 1.41 (95% CI: 1.04 - 1.92)). Conclusions Future programs should use SBCC to improve MHHM behavior but involve families, peers and community members to a greater extent in order to improve attitudes towards menstruation, attitudes towards restrictions, attitudes towards absorbent use and reduce restrictions within the community.

AB  - Wildlife managers and researchers have suspected that urine-based lure products collected from captive cervids could be potential media contributing to the spread of chronic wasting disease (CWD) in deer (Odocoileus spp.). Although personnel in multiple wildlife agencies have taken the precautionary approach to prohibit the sales or use of urine-based lure products, it is not well understood whether hunters will accept and willingly cooperate with these policies. To address this gap in the literature, we examine hunters' attitudes and behavioral intentions toward a hypothetical policy proposing to ban urine-based products and how risk beliefs, trait psychological reactance, and hunting experience affect these responses. In May 2017, we recruited 739 members of an online advocacy group of deer hunters to complete a web-based survey with experimental elements. Overall, participants held positive attitudes toward the proposed policy to ban these products and high intentions to cooperate. Participants also characterized CWD as an increasing risk that was associated with dread, well known to science, and observable. These risk beliefs were positively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions to comply with the policy. In contrast, trait psychological reactance and prior experience using urine-based scents were negatively related to attitudes and behavioral intentions. Findings indicate that wildlife management agency personnel communicating with the public may find better acceptance of controversial CWD policies by first establishing a shared understanding of its risks through thorough risk communication.

AB  - Orientation: Compliance culture within the South African local government context is perceived to be critical to sustainable municipality service delivery. Improving compliance culture is therefore important.
   Research purpose: This article therefore developed a compliance framework based on deterrence theory (DT) and the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to identify human behavioural factors to be considered in the development and use of work procedures as a way to improve workers' compliance with work procedures.
   Motivation for the study: Reports (e.g. Auditor General reports) on municipality service delivery fall short of providing a clear assessment and study of work and human behavioural dynamics in relation to compliance with work procedures.
   Research approach/design and method: This article tested a conceptual model focused on the effect of deterrence initiatives on workplace compliance as mediated by the theory-planned behaviour. Data were collected from 119 workers in two municipalities of the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa through a structured questionnaire and analysed using structural equation model.
   Main findings: Findings show that a positive attitude towards compliance to work procedures cannot be achieved through intimidation; reinforcement has a positive effect on attitude, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control (PBC). However, only the PBC aspect of the TPB explains significant mediation between deterrence and compliance.
   Practical/managerial implications: The study demonstrates how compliance culture can be engendered by non-intimidating deterrent measures and PBC.
   Contributions/value-add: The negative effect of intimidation on compliance culture and the positive effect of PBC on compliance attitude of workers are critical contributions.

AB  - The Internet has become the main information and data provider since its appearance at the end of the 20(th) century. Currently, all over the world, universities, as the main generators and consumers of information, stand at the top of the privileged organizations that have access to the Internet. Hence, being a tertiary student means not only having easy, quick, and cheap, even in most places free, access, but also being bombarded with information. This led to a considerable body of research into the attitudes and habits of using the Internet by the university students in the world as well as Turkey and North Cyprus.
   The present study sets out to explore the attitudes of students, studying at the Faculty of Communication and Media Studies, Eastern Mediterranean University, towards the use of the Internet as a source/tool for obtaining information for their course work, communication and otherwise. Data have been collected through a questionnaire designed in two parts: the first part seeks to collect information about the participants' genders, ages, departments, the year of studies, and their practice related to the use of the Internet and the second part related to their attitudes towards the use of various aspects of the Internet. The results indicate that students hold a positive attitude towards the use of the Internet both for academic and communication purposes. The Internet is considered as the best and fastest information provider and is necessary for tertiary students. Both the lecturers and students should have web-sites. They are, however, undecided about the trustworthiness of the information they find on the web or printing everything they find on it before reading. Furthermore, they are undecided about the fact that the Internet makes them feel lonely. The students also stated that they are undecided about online shopping, online banking, playing games on the Internet rather than doing any other hobby.

AB  - Purpose
   Unconscious biases against certain groups aid in forming assumptions which may be promulgated in the USA via popular news media linking rare but memorable violent acts with specific groups. However, the relationship between marginalized group association, assumptions regarding the motive for violent acts and individual media consumption has never been directly examined. This study aims to directly examine this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In the present study, individuals read a vignette of a mass shooting in which the perpetrator's implied religion (i.e. Islam or unknown religion) was manipulated. Participants then indicated their assumptions regarding motive (i.e. terrorism or mental illness) and personal media consumption habits.
   Findings
   Contrary to hypotheses, differences in assumed motive based on implied religion were not found; participants were not more likely to associate an assumed Muslim perpetrator with terrorism as a motive or consider the assumed non-Muslim perpetrator to be mentally ill.
   Originality/value
   These unexpected findings are discussed in the context of the data-collection period, which coincidentally overlapped with a well-publicized act of domestic terrorism that led to a unique national debate regarding biased news coverage and associations between religion, ethnicity, terrorism and mental illness.

AB  - The growth of social media in recent years has contributed to an ever-increasing network of user data in every aspect of life. This volume of generated data is becoming a vital asset for the growth of companies and organizations as a powerful tool to gain insights and make crucial decisions. However, data is not always reliable, since primarily, it can be manipulated and disseminated from unreliable sources. In the field of social network analysis, this problem can be tackled by implementing machine learning models that can learn to classify between humans and bots, which are mostly harmful computer programs exploited to shape public opinions and circulate false information on social media. In this paper, we propose a novel topological feature extraction method for bot detection on social networks. We first create weighted ego networks of each user. We then encode the higher-order topological features of ego networks using persistent homology. Finally, we use these extracted features to train a machine learning model and use that model to classify users as bot vs. human. Our experimental results suggest that using the higher-order topological features coming from persistent homology is promising in bot detection and more effective than using classical graph-theoretic structural features.

AB  - Background: We aim to determine the level of general knowledge and attitudes among the population of Saudi Arabia regarding sexually transmitted illnesses (STI). In addition, we aim to educate participants about the most common STIs, and explore how this influences the participants' attitudes and perceptions. Methods: This study is a cross-sectional web-based survey of the general population of Saudi Arabia. The sample was enrolled randomly by distributing the survey through social media over a two-month period. 420 subjects between the ages of (15.-60) participated in the study. Results: Among the 420 total responses, 405 (96%) participants were included based on the absence of missing data in their answers. Most of the participants (77%) were females. More than half of the respondents were single (59%), 24 years old or more (57%), Saudi (52%), and had a bachelor's degree (65%). Forty-eight percent (48%) of the participants were related to the medical field. Only 11% knew someone previously diagnosed with STIs. The mean score of overall knowledge about STI was 8.79 +/- 3.17 (median - 9) out of a maximum score of 20. The scores ranged from 2-16. A higher percentage of the participants (48.6%) had a low level of knowledge. Two-hundred eighty-one participants showed interest in viewing the attached educational material and subsequently completed questions on attitude regarding STI education. The mean score for attitude was 5.89 +/- 1.52 out of a total of 7 (median - 6). Around 73% of all participants had a positive attitude towards ST1 education. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that targeting the younger population by incorporating STI-related educational material into school curricula would overcome the stigma associated with these illnesses by raising awareness and improving attitude towards them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing community awareness about the transmission and treatment of COVID-19 will stop the spread of the virus. Pharmacy students are the potential facilitator to give community education about COVID-19 treatment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacy students' knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information about COVID-19 treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted cross-sectional study, recruiting 429 pharmacy students from three schools of pharmacy in Indonesia. The questionnaire about the knowledge of COVID-19 treatment, behavior, and attitude of providing the information on COVID-19 treatment met the validity and reliability criteria. We defined the proportion of knowledge, behavior, and attitude of the students using SPSS (R) version 22. RESULTS: Most of the students are in the earlier years (46.63%), female (84.15%), find the information about COVID-19 from many sources of media (85.08%) including scientific articles and know information about COVID-19 transmission around their life area (76.46%). The students' knowledge about antiviral and plasma convalescent is good (>70%), the positive behaviors are related to the COVID-19 treatment information regarding to the antiviral and the provision of Vitamin C (>50%), and the positive attitude are related to giving information about the use of avigan (R), plasma convalescent, chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and immunomodulator (>50%). CONCLUSIONS: As a future pharmacist, the knowledge of pharmacy students about COVID-19 treatment needs to be improved since earlier years. Furthermore, using the good knowledge about COVID-19 treatment, the positive behavior and attitude of providing information of the students, the community behavior and attitude will be improved. The high year students have a tendency for the good knowledge and positive behavior and attitude of providing the information.

AB  - Aims and objectives
   To examine the impact of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours and to test the mediating effect of self-efficacy on the relationship between ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and health-promoting behaviours in older Korean people.
   Background
   Despite the growing attention given to ageing-related beliefs that can lead to better health outcomes in old age, little is known about the associations between ageing-related stereotypic beliefs, self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours.
   Design
   A cross-sectional, descriptive study.
   Methods
   A total of 123 community-dwelling older women were recruited from three cities in south-east Korea. Direct and indirect effects of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours were examined using path analyses.
   Results
   Ageing-related stereotypic beliefs significantly predicted self-efficacy and health-promoting behaviours. A significant indirect effect of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours through self-efficacy was detected, indicating that self-efficacy mediated the detrimental impact of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours.
   Conclusions
   Ageing-related stereotypic beliefs function as a factor lowering self-efficacy as well as decreasing health-promoting behaviours. Self-efficacy mediates the influence of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs on health-promoting behaviours, indicating that ageing-related stereotypic beliefs decrease self-efficacy which, in turn, could lead to fewer health-promoting behaviours. The findings demonstrate the significance of ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and self-efficacy in guiding the health-promoting behaviours of older people.
   Relevance to clinical practice
   Healthcare providers should play an active role in understanding ageing-related stereotypic beliefs and decreasing the perceptual barriers to health-promoting behaviours of older people. The development of nursing interventions to improve positive attitudes towards old age and self-efficacy is essential for enhancing health-promoting behaviours.

AB  - Background: The increasing development of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in medicine driven by researchers and entrepreneurs goes along with enormous expectations for medical care advancement. AI might change the clinical practice of physicians from almost all medical disciplines and in most areas of health care. While expectations for AI in medicine are high, practical implementations of AI for clinical practice are still scarce in Germany. Moreover, physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the usage of anonymized patient data for clinical and biomedical research have not been investigated widely in German university hospitals.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate physicians' requirements and expectations of AI in medicine and their opinion on the secondary usage of patient data for (bio)medical research (eg, for the development of machine learning algorithms) in university hospitals in Germany.
   Methods: A web-based survey was conducted addressing physicians of all medical disciplines in 8 German university hospitals. Answers were given using Likert scales and general demographic responses. Physicians were asked to participate locally via email in the respective hospitals.
   Results: The online survey was completed by 303 physicians (female: 121/303, 39.9%; male: 173/303, 57.1%; no response: 9/303, 3.0%) from a wide range of medical disciplines and work experience levels. Most respondents either had a positive (130/303, 42.9%) or a very positive attitude (82/303, 27.1%) towards AI in medicine. There was a significant association between the personal rating of AI in medicine and the self-reported technical affinity level (H-4=48.3, P<.001). A vast majority of physicians expected the future of medicine to be a mix of human and artificial intelligence (273/303, 90.1%) but also requested a scientific evaluation before the routine implementation of AI-based systems (276/303, 91.1%). Physicians were most optimistic that AI applications would identify drug interactions (280/303, 92.4%) to improve patient care substantially but were quite reserved regarding AI-supported diagnosis of psychiatric diseases (62/303, 20.5%). Of the respondents, 82.5% (250/303) agreed that there should be open access to anonymized patient databases for medical and biomedical research.
   Conclusions: Physicians in stationary patient care in German university hospitals show a generally positive attitude towards using most AI applications in medicine. Along with this optimism comes several expectations and hopes that AI will assist physicians in clinical decision making Especially in fields of medicine where huge amounts of data are processed (eg, imaging procedures in radiology and pathology) or data are collected continuously (eg, cardiology and intensive care medicine), physicians' expectations of AI to substantially improve future patient care are high. In the study, the greatest potential was seen in the application of AI for the identification of drug interactions, assumedly due to the rising complexity of drug administration to polymorbid, polypharmacy patients. However, for the practical usage of AI in health care, regulatory and organizational challenges still have to be mastered.

AB  - Objective To describe reported changes in sexual behaviours, including virtual sex (sexting and cybersex), and access to HIV/STI testing and care during COVID-19 measures in Panama. Methods We conducted an online cross-sectional survey from 8 August to 12 September 2020 among adults (>= 18 years) residing in Panama. Participants were recruited through social media. Questions included demographics, access to HIV/STI testing and HIV care, and sexual behaviours 3 months before COVID-19 social distancing measures and during social distancing measures (COVID-19 measures). Logistic regression was used to identify associations between variables and behavioural changes. Results We recruited 960 participants; 526 (54.8%) identified as cis-women, 366 (38.1%) cis-men and 68 (7.1%) non-binary or another gender. The median age was 28 years (IQR: 23-37 years), and 531 of 957 (55.5%) were of mixed ethnicity (mixed Indigenous/European/Afro-descendant ancestry). Before COVID-19 measures, virtual sex was reported by 38.5% (181 of 470) of cis-women, 58.4% (184 of 315) cis-men and 45.0% (27 of 60) non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, virtual sex increased among 17.2% of cis-women, 24.7% cis-men and 8.9% non-binary participants. During COVID-19 measures, 230 of 800 (28.8%) participants reported decreased casual sex compared with pre-COVID-19 measures. Compared with pre-COVID-19 measures, decreased casual sex was reported more frequently during COVID-19 measures by cis-men compared with cis-women (39.2% vs 22.9%, urban/rural adjusted OR (AOR)=2.17, 95% CI 1.57 to 3.01), and by Afro-descendant compared with participants of mixed ethnicity (40.0% vs 29.8%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.07 to 2.94). Compared with no change in virtual sex (16.8%), increased virtual sex (38.5%, AOR=1.78, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.88) and decreased virtual sex (86.7%, AOR=16.53, 95% CI 7.74 to 35.27) were associated with decreased casual sex encounters. During COVID-19 measures, HIV/STI testing could not be obtained by 58.0% (58 of 100) of the participants who needed a test, and interrupted HIV care was reported by 53.3% (8 of 15) of participants living with HIV. Conclusions COVID-19 measures in Panama were associated with a decrease in casual sex among cis-men and Afro-descendant people, while access to HIV/STI testing and care was seriously disrupted.

AB  - Anti-Roma prejudice is characterized as a unique form of prejudice because of its blatant nature. News about Roma has been overlooked as a key explanation for anti-Roma prejudice. This study aims to offer insight into news messages about Roma in a systematic and longitudinal way. To this end, I conducted a content analysis of 15 years of all television news stories (N = 181) about Roma in Flanders (2003-2017). Findings suggest a shift in patterns in news coverage of Roma. Although Roma are still underrepresented as a minority group on television and get a voice in only about one third of all news stories, uniformly negative news stories about Roma are on the decline in favor of more balanced news stories. Frames referring to blatant threats posed by Roma, such as criminal frames, are being replaced by more subtle frames. Journalists also more often portray Roma presence in society as a policy issue.

AB  - Purpose/objectives More and more creative applications are used in the field of dentistry for clinical practice, patient orientation, teaching, and learning, in order to awake the students' interest and to enable a deep learning and its retention. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the impact and the effectiveness of the current simulation laboratories on the practical dental education. For this purpose, a survey on a new developed "AR-Demonstrator-App" was conducted during the orthodontic technical courses in 2017, 2018, and 2020 in the Department of Orthodontics (C.G. Carus, TU Dresden, Germany). Methods With this application, the students had the opportunity to see every single step with instructions on how to manufacture a removable orthodontic device in a compulsory technical course. At the end of these courses, the students were asked to anonymously fill out a printed questionnaire with 12 questions regarding the learning progress related to the app. Results The yearly mean Likert scores and their bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals as well as the yearly median Likert scores suggest a very positive feedback about the use of the new application as an educational instrument. Despite the recognized predominant benefits of this app, the students concluded that they do not prefer the total replacement of the physical plaster casts and that a combination of conventional and computer-based education provided the optimum approach to acquisition of dental practical skills. Conclusions This survey indicates a generally positive attitude toward computer-assisted simulation systems, providing the facility for acquisition of knowledge and practical skills in a multimedia environment.

AB  - Rationale The gap between the nutrition education provided to medical students and the nutrition competences and attitudes needed for doctors to provide effective nutrition care is a global concern. The goal of this study was to investigate the curricular content on nutrition education in Latin American medical schools and to evaluate the self-perceived knowledge, attitudes, and barriers to nutrition practice of final-year medical students.
   Methods Eighty-five public and private medical schools from 17 Latin American countries were invited to participate in the study. Two close-ended online questionnaires consisting of 25 and 43 questions were sent to medical school directors. Quantitative variables were expressed as frequencies, percentages, mean +/- standard deviation, medians, and ranges.
   Results A total of 22 (26%) medical school directors responded, of which 11 schools (50%) offered stand-alone mandatory nutrition courses in preclinical and 8 (36%) in clinical years. The mean hours dedicated to nutrition education was 47 (range: 0-150). A total of 1530 of 1630 (94%) students from 12 countries responded. Students' average age was 25 +/- 3 years, and 59% were female. Most students agreed that improving patients' health through nutrition (91%) is important and that nutrition counseling and assessment should be part of routine care provided by all physicians (89%), but they lack the level of education and training required to address nutrition-related issues.
   Conclusions Positive attitude and interest in nutrition among final-year medical students is high, but nutrition education is not perceived as sufficient to adequately prepare doctors in the field of nutrition.

AB  - We investigate, through a fractional mathematical model, the effects of physical distance on the SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission. Two controls are considered in our model for eradication of the spread of COVID-19: media education, through campaigns explaining the importance of social distancing, use of face masks, etc., towards all population, while the second one is quarantine social isolation of the exposed individuals. A general fractional order optimal control problem, and associated optimality conditions of Pontryagin type, are discussed, with the goal to minimize the number of susceptible and infected while maximizing the number of recovered. The extremals are then numerically obtained. (C) 2021 THE AUTHORS. Published by Elsevier BV on behalf of Faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University.

AB  - High levels of economic inequality are widely viewed as a key challenge facing both advanced industrial and developing economies. Country-level studies have consistently shown a negative link between income inequality and trust in others. This is typically attributed to greater social distance within unequal societies. Do we observe similar relationships within organisations? This is an important question because employee trust is associated with important outcomes for workers and organisations. We answer it by investigating the relationship between pay inequality and employee trust in managers at the workplace level using large-scale nationally representative matched employer-employee data from Britain. The article uses innovative machine learning methods to demonstrate a curvilinear relationship between pay inequality and trust. When pay inequality is at low to moderate levels, increasing inequality is associated with increasing employee trust but when pay inequality passes a certain threshold the relationship turns negative. The relationship is mediated by employees' perceptions of manager fairness and moderated by employee collective voice. The implications of these findings for theory, research methodology, practice and future studies are discussed.

AB  - Human resources are frequently emphasized as being critical to the school social system's survival. This study examined the effects of teachers' negative attitudes toward the organization for which they work at the level of school effectiveness. The study sought to determine how negative attitudes of secondary school teachers toward their schools harmed school effectiveness in one of Turkey's eastern provinces. The analyses revealed that organizational cynicism may reduce perceived school effectiveness by reducing teachers' participation in school decision-making. In terms of understanding how the negative effects of organizational cynicism on school effectiveness occur, the findings of this study had a wide range of implications in research, practice, and policy.

AB  - High rates of mental health problems are a growing concern in Czech higher education, negatively impacting students' performance and wellbeing. Despite the serious nature of poor mental health, students often do not seek help because of negative attitudes and shame over mental health problems. Recent mental health research reports self-compassion is strongly associated with better mental health and reduced shame. However, relationships between those constructs remain to be evaluated among Czech students. This study aims to appraise the relationships between mental health problems, negative mental health attitudes, mental health shame, and self-compassion in this population. An opportunity sample of 119 psychology students from a Czech university completed questionnaires regarding these constructs. Correlation, regression, and path analyses were conducted. Mental health problems were positively associated with negative mental health attitudes and shame, and negatively associated with self-compassion. Self-compassion negatively predicted mental health problems, while negative attitudes and shame did not. Last, self-compassion fully mediated the negative attitudes-mental health problems relationship, and partially mediated the shame-mental health problems relationship. Findings suggest self-compassion is essential for mental health in Czech students and associated with negative mental health attitudes and mental health shame. Czech universities can benefit from incorporating self-compassion training into their curricula to protect students' mental health.

AB  - The power of social networking sites increases in direct proportion with their functionalities so that the popularity and sweep of these sites greatly affect the users' prejudice and thoughts towards them. It is clear that social networking and social media have a large influence on the way people think and behave. In particular, Facebook has a broad participation all over the Internet. Through the years, the interface and functionality of Facebook have changed and transformed from a university-only communication tool to one of the most well known websites online. Educational institutions are increasingly using Facebook to connect with registered students and to grasp the potential one. This paper aims to demonstrate how the use of Facebook has changed over a time. That is to say, the purpose is to examine how the university students' opinions and usage of Facebook in education changed from the year 2009 to 2013. This research involves 382 students from two different universities in North Cyprus. The "Facebook Usage Ouestionnaire" was used to collect data. The result of this research indicated that perceptions and usage of Facebook have changed and expanded over the years and also Facebook has become an important tool for education.

AB  - Communication scholars have conducted a significant amount of research to explore the conditions under which exposure to narrative messages affects individuals' attitudes and behaviors. Perceived character typicality, defined as the degree to which characteristics of a character are perceived to be present among the portrayal's real-world counterparts, as well as cued typicality, defined as statements about a population that indicate whether the character or the narrative is typical or not, have not been examined in understanding the effectiveness of health messages. The present research explored the effects of perceived character typicality and contextually-embedded typicality cues on persuasive outcomes. It also investigated the underlying mechanisms mediating the impact of narratives with character or cued typicality. A 2 (character typicality: typical vs. nontypical character) x 3 (typicality cues: typical cues vs. nontypical cues vs. no cues) between-subjects experiment was conducted, focusing on the risks of sun exposure without applying sunscreen. The findings showed that a narrative with a character perceived as typical led to higher perceived realism, more positive attitude toward sunscreen use, and less message novelty than a narrative with a character perceived as nontypical. Typical cues had more positive impact on issue attitude than nontypical cues.

AB  - Purpose Strategic goal achievement in every sector of a company relies fundamentally on the firm's employees. This study aims to disclose the factors that spur employees of major Information Technology (IT) companies in the United States (US). Design/methodology/approach In this paper, 15,000 reviews from the top 15 United States IT companies were collected from the social media platform Glassdoor to uncover the factors that satisfy IT employees. To learn the most meaningful features that influence the scores, positive and negative remarks, as well as advice to the management team, were analyzed through a support vector machine. Findings Results highlight a positive attitude of coworkers, contributing to a positive environment and job satisfaction. However, unsatisfied IT employees reveal that work exhaustion is the main reason for their job dissatisfaction. Practical implications - IT human resource departments can use these valuable insights to align their strategies in accordance with their employees' desires and expectations in order to thrive. Originality/value The study highlights the relevance of IT companies to understand the reasons behind their employees' satisfaction. Up until now, little is known concerning the variants of job satisfaction among IT employees, enriching the understanding in this particular professional area.

AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people's attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people's attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who 'just happen to be gay'. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs.

AB  - This study compares public attitudes toward nanotechnology in the United States and Singapore, using large-scale survey data in both countries. Results indicate that Singaporeans tend to be more knowledgeable about and familiar with nanotechnology than the U.S. public. Singaporeans tend to perceive greater benefits and fewer potential risks of nanotechnology, and to indicate greater support for government funding for nanotechnology than the U.S. public. Between the two countries, perceived familiarity with nanotechnology and the benefits and risks of the emerging technology tend to be interpreted differently through the lens of value predispositions (religiosity and deference to scientific authority) and therefore they indirectly affect public support. Specifically, the U.S. public tends to use religiosity to interpret benefits and Singaporeans are inclined to use religiosity to think about risks. Deference to scientific authority also moderates the impact of perceived familiarity with nanotechnology on funding support for the technology among the U.S. public.

KW  - role models
AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to determine residents' attitudes about the influence and characteristics of academic radiology role models.
   Method: A Web-based survey was sent to the 35 residents in the 2007 Siemens AUR Radiology Resident Academic Development (SARRAD) program and to all other residents at their institutions. The survey contained questions regarding experiences with and desirable characteristics of role models, as well as the influence of role models in career decisions. Chi-square, Fisher's exact, and Mann-Whitney tests were used to assess associations between responses and expressed career choice.
   Results: Thirty of 35 SARRAD participants (85%) plus 103 non-SARRAD participants responded. Only 46% felt that there were enough role models at their institutions and 56% that there were sufficient role models in academic radiology. More than two-thirds of residents surveyed stated that they would be more likely to stay in academic radiology if there were more role models. The most desired characteristics of role models included availability, enthusiasm, integrity, and a positive attitude toward residents. Residents stating that they would choose academic careers were more likely to be research track (P = .0001), have more publications (P = .01), be less concerned with salary (P = .003), and be less concerned about politics (P = .047). Level of debt was not different between residents planning to choose academic careers and those with other career plans (P = .80).
   Conclusion: Role models in academic radiology play an important role in influencing residents to stay in academic radiology. Increasing the number of role models in academic radiology with characteristics valued by residents will encourage residents to stay in academic medicine.

AB  - Introduction: A growing body of evidence indicates that exposure to tobacco advertising among adolescents increases the likelihood of subsequent tobacco use. It is important to understand the process by which this occurs, in order to appropriately target factors for intervention. The objective of this study was to test whether attitudes towards tobacco advertising mediates the impact of advertising exposure on tobacco use. Methods: From an ongoing prospective cohort study of male adolescents (aged 11-16 at baseline), we recruited a subset of tobacco users and non-users to participate in an additional ecological momentary assessment (EMA) project (N = 164). Adolescents completed smartphone-based surveys 2-3 times/day over a 10-day period with items assessing their exposures and attitudes towards tobacco-related advertising. If participants reported exposure to tobacco advertising, they were asked about their attitudes toward it (how much they enjoyed it, liked it, and found it appealing). Results: Adolescents who reported a greater amount of advertising exposure during the EMA period were more likely to report past-30-day tobacco use at their next cohort follow-up (6-12 months later). Moreover, the impact of advertising exposure on subsequent use was mediated by attitudes toward the tobacco advertisements, as reported during the EMA. This effect remained after controlling for baseline tobacco use. Conclusions: By pairing EMA with long-term follow-up, we identified attitudes as a mediator between adolescent advertising exposure and subsequent tobacco use. Interventions to lessen adolescents' positive attitudes toward tobacco advertisements may help disrupt this impact.

AB  - Low family income during childhood is associated with multiple enduring negative outcomes, including poorer cognitive functioning in adulthood. However, mechanisms linking low family income during adolescence to adulthood cognitive outcomes are relatively unclear, as mediators of income-cognition links have mostly been examined separately. To address this, we conducted a longitudinal multiple mediation analysis of associations between adolescent family income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory using a large, national dataset (N = 6337). The data were sociodemographically representative of the United States (48.1% male, Madult age=29.01). Potential mediators were education attainment, family education attitudes, stressful life experiences, inflammation, and perceived parental warmth. We found that education attainment mediated the associations between adolescent income and adulthood working memory and long-term memory. Additionally, stressful life events mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood long-term memory, whereas inflammation and family education attitudes mediated the association between adolescent income and adulthood working memory. These findings suggest that limited education, less positive attitudes toward education, more stress, and heightened inflammation in low-income families predict poorer cognition in adulthood, and that intervening on each of these factors may mitigate detrimental cognitive sequelae of low family income during adolescence.

AB  - In the United Arab Emirates (UAE), women's participation in breast cancer screening is low, and women are commonly diagnosed in advanced stages. This study investigated women's attitudes towards breast cancer screening, their use of health services in the UAE emirate of Ras Al Khaimah, and their preferred medium for breast cancer information. In this qualitative study, six focus groups were conducted with Emirati (n = 28) and non-Emirati (n = 26) women as Ras Al Khaimah is a highly multi-cultural region. Women were separated into different age groups (25-34, 30-44, 44+) so as to obtain perspectives of young (n = 16), middle (n = 19), and older women (n = 19). The focus group transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Women recognised that any breast change should be checked by a doctor, and that women with symptoms or those at higher risk may need to have breast screening earlier than the recommended starting age. However, participants wanted more information from doctors or other health personnel. Women had observed breast cancer information and campaigns advertisements in multiple media but recommended greater use of social media and WhatsApp to disseminate information. Overall, women had positive attitudes towards breast cancer screening but wanted more breast cancer awareness campaigns year-round and better access to screening.

AB  - Although many Veterans and active duty service members experience mental health problems, most do not seek out any sort of mental health help. Stigma (a significant predictor of treatment-seeking) has been documented among Veterans and active duty service members; however, previous research on stigma in these groups has primarily utilized correlational and qualitative designs. The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of stigma toward mental health problems in Veterans and active duty service members using an experimental design. One hundred sixty-five Veterans and active duty service members were randomized to read a vignette that described a Veteran who either did or did not experience a mental health problem and did or did not seek psychotherapy. Results indicated that the participants held more stigmatizing attitudes toward the Veteran who was described as having a mental health problem, but not toward the Veteran who was described as seeking psychotherapy. Additionally, participants held more positive attitudes toward the Veteran, compared to the attitudes that they believed other military members would hold. Last, with this sample of Veterans and active duty service members, self-stigma toward seeking psychotherapy was found to partially mediate the relationship between perceived public stigma and attitudes. Implications for addressing stigma in military service members and Veterans are discussed.

AB  - Interprofessional education (IPE) in health and human services educational and clinical settings has proliferated internationally. The use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in the facilitation of interprofessional learning is also growing, yet reviews of the effectiveness of ICTs in the delivery of pre- and/or post-licensure IPE have been limited. The current study's purpose was to review the evaluation outcomes of IPE initiatives delivered using ICTs. Relevant electronic databases and journals from 1996 to 2013 were searched. Studies which evaluated the effectiveness of an IPE intervention using ICTs were included and analyzed using the Barr etal. modified Kirkpatrick educational outcomes typology. Fifty-five studies were identified and a majority reported evaluation findings at the level 1 (reaction/satisfaction). Analysis revealed that learners react favorably to the use of ICTs in the delivery of IPE, and ICT-mediated IPE can lead to positive attitudinal and knowledge change. A majority of the studies reported positive evaluation outcomes at the learner satisfaction level, with the use of web-based learning modalities. The limited number of studies at other levels of the outcomes typology and deficiencies in study designs indicate the need for more rigorous evaluation of outcomes in ICT-mediated IPE.

AB  - We study the effects of consumer perceptions of four types of corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities on their behavioral loyalty toward retailers. The four activities are environmental friendliness, community support, selling locally produced products, and treating employees fairly. Behavioral loyalty is measured by share-of-wallet (SOW). We control for other retailer attributes that drive attitudes and SOW, and examine how the market is segmented in terms of consumer response. We partition the total effect of CSR on SOW into a direct effect and an indirect effect mediated through attitude towards the store. These effects differ by CSR activity and customer segment. The effects on attitude are positive and positive attitude enhances SOW, so the indirect effects on SOW are positive. While we generally find positive total effects, the total effect of one of the CSR activities, environmental friendliness, is significantly negative for one group of consumers. The magnitude of CSR's total impact on SOW is not only statistically significant but also managerially meaningful in an industry where every share point carries a substantial dollar amount We characterize the customer segments and conclude with implications for how best a retailer can manage its CSR initiatives.

AB  - Immigration attitudes are influenced by types of patriotism and the perceived threat that immigrants pose. Previous research indicated realistic and symbolic threat mediates the relationships between blind and constructive patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes in different ways. In two studies, the purpose was to replicate the mediating role of realistic and symbolic threat for the relationship between patriotism types and anti-immigration attitudes, and to determine if inducing threat in constructive patriots would result in immigration attitudes like that of blind patriots. In both studies, hypotheses were confirmed. Blind patriotism predicts realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti-immigration attitudes. Realistic and symbolic threats provided moderated mediation between blind patriotism and anti-immigration attitudes. Constructive patriotism negatively predicts anti-immigration attitudes, but realistic and symbolic threats provide complete mediation for this relationship. The introduction of threatening information on future demographic changes had no impact on the relationship between blind patriotism, realistic and symbolic threats, and anti-immigration attitude. However, the introduction of demographic threat modified the relationship for constructive patriots, leaving no predictive negative relationship with realistic threat, symbolic threat, or anti-immigration attitude. The findings are important for understanding ethnic threat and the motivations to oppose immigrants in a changing United States.

AB  - Nowadays, companies who want to engage environment-friendly consumers increasingly rely on green-economy oriented campaigns. Such categories of (ethical) consumers are numerically increasing, and expressions evoking environmental friendliness are becoming particularly trendy. In this vein, words such as 'sustainability' have been variously recontextualized/reframed and have become an 'ought to' for media-savvy companies 'with a vision' - Walmart, the American multinational retail corporation, being a relevant case in point. It is no accident that, on the first Google page for 'sustainability', 'Walmart' proudly surfaces: http://corporate.walmart.com/global-responsibility/sustainability. The company has made an explicit commitment not just to expand the business but also to improve communities and enhance the sustainability of the products they sell, by encouraging more responsible production practices, while at the same time making product choices more affordable for customers, as reported on its website. However, as the world's largest company, Walmart is an easy target for attack mainly by environmentalists. Sometimes, Walmart gives its critics grounds for some legitimate criticism in a variety of fields ranging from the supply chain emissions to renewable energy and preserving habitat. Such criticism resonates across the media, owing to their 'lack of closure' (Laclau and Mouffe 1985), finalized to offer an unbiased perspective. Against this 'complexified' (Macgilchrist 2007) background, our study aims to examine, from a broadly Multimodal and Positive Discourse Analysis perspective, the Walmart website 'sustainability' pages with their variety of communicative strategies, advertising 'responsible' Walmart positive attitudes to fundamental issues like Energy, Waste, Products and Responsible Sourcing.

AB  - During the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic, transmission chains were controlled through contact tracing, i.e., identification and follow-up of people exposed to Ebola cases. WHO recommendations for daily check-ups of physical symptoms with social distancing for 21 days were unevenly applied and sometimes interpreted as quarantine. Criticisms arose regarding the use of coercion and questioned contact tracing on ethical grounds. This article aims to analyze contact cases perceptions and acceptance of contact monitoring at the field level. In Senegal, an imported case of Ebola virus disease in September 2014 resulted in placing 74 contact cases in home containment with daily visits by volunteers. An ethnographic study based on in-depth interviews with all stakeholders performed in September-October 2014 showed four main perceptions of monitoring: a biosecurity preventive measure, suspension of professional activity, stigma attached to Ebola, and a social obligation. Contacts demonstrated diverse attitudes. Initially, most contacts agreed to comply because they feared being infected. They adhered to the national Ebola response measures and appreciated the empathy shown by volunteers. Later, acceptance was improved by the provision of moral, economic, and social support, and by the final lack of any new contamination. But it was limited by the socio-economic impact on fulfilling basic needs, the fear of being infected, how contacts' family members interpreted monitoring, conflation of contacts as Ebola cases, and challenging the rationale for containment. Acceptance was also related to individual aspects, such as the professional status of women and health workers who had been exposed, and contextual aspects, such as the media's role in the social production of stigma. Ethnographic results show that, even when contacts adhere rather than comply to containment through coercion, contact monitoring raises several ethical issues. These insights should contribute to the ethics debate about individual rights versus crisis public health measures. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rivers in urban areas have been associated with water quality problems because of the practice of discharging untreated domestic and industrial waste into the water bodies. However, to what extent the public can identify specific environmental problems and whether people are ready to cope with potential risks is to a great extent unknown. Public environmental awareness of factors underpinning the pollution of rivers and approaches for reducing it were studied in Rasht City of Guilan Province in northern Iran, with Zarjub and Goharrud rivers as a case study. Data were collected from residents on the banks of the studied rivers using a questionnaire. Industrial areas, hospitals, and poultry farms were perceived as the main factors deteriorating water pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers in Guilan Province. The discharge of urban sewage into the rivers was the second most important polluting factor. Most residents on the banks of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers showed high interest in the conservation of the environment. Overall, 62.7% of the residents had moderate, 20% had high, and 4% had very high environmental awareness. Families and mass media (TV and radio) were perceived of being the most important sources of information of family members concerning environmental awareness. According to the residents, the main approach for alleviating the pollution of Zarjub and Goharrud rivers were creating green spaces, dredging the rivers, establishing a water purifying system, and establishing a waste incinerator with a separation system (based on municipal planning). The public in the study area appeared well prepared to cope with the risks of water pollution, but further improving environmental awareness of the community can be a first step for preventing environmental degradation. The positive attitudes of the residents towards environmental conservation, the use of proper information sources, and practical training in the context of extension services can be effective in conserving water resources in urban areas.

AB  - Purpose This study investigates the use of gamification in promoting the silver generation's adoption of mobile payment technology through the gamified cultural practice of gifting red packets. It considers the effectiveness of using gamification in a cultural context to promote technology acceptance among older adults. This crossover between digital technology and cultural traditions brings unique gaming elements to the adoption of technology. Design/methodology/approach Drawing upon technology acceptance Model (TAM) and prospect theory, a research model is evaluated using structural equation modeling. Data were collected via survey from elderly consumers who are current users of WeChat but are yet to use its mobile payment functions. Findings The results reveal the perceived effectiveness of gamification is determined by the perceived enjoyment of the game and contributes to users' attitude development, directly and through its perceived usefulness. Perceived risks were identified as a barrier to converting positive attitude into adoption intention. Research limitations/implications The findings contribute to the conceptualization and understanding of the effectiveness of gamification in technology adoption, specifically among the silver generation. Originality/value In contrast with previous gamification studies on gamified experience, this study introduces a new conceptualization of the perceived effectiveness of gamification and its measurement. This study validates game engagement as being effective in encouraging seniors to adopt a technology. In an era of an aging population where digitization is a norm, improving the digital literacy and digital inclusion of elders by encouraging them to adopt technology is essential to developing a more accessible and inclusive social environment.

AB  - This paper studies the influence of entrepreneurial spirit on college students' entrepreneurial ability and entrepreneurial values. Firstly, the impact of entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit on entrepreneurial values is analyzed. Secondly, the role of entrepreneurial values in Innovation and Entrepreneurship Education (IEE) is analyzed and summarized under new media. Then, based on entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to investigate the entrepreneurial values of students in one university in Shaanxi Province, China. The QS analysis suggests that most respondents hold a positive attitude, and their attitude is on the rise. The QS results of "Reasons for entrepreneurial failure" show that 40.37, 31.9, 25.98, and 11.75% of respondents think they lack financial support, business skills, ability, and understanding of policies and laws, respectively. The QS results of "What factors influence entrepreneurial values?" reveal that 39.43% of the respondents chose the "Models of successful entrepreneurs," successful entrepreneur models can effectively encourage students to receive IEE, followed by 28.94% who choose "Achieve their own life goals.". In terms of "Solutions against entrepreneurial risks," nearly 70% of the students have chosen the negative options. In terms of "Which is the most important entrepreneurial quality?", more students choose entrepreneurial values rather than entrepreneurial quality, proving that students generally lack entrepreneurial values. Given these problems, corresponding countermeasures are put forward to strengthen entrepreneurial psychology and IEE, in an attempt to cultivate college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability under the new media. The results provide some data support for the impact of college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability.

AB  - By providing information on society at large, the media help to establish and maintain relations between various social groups, such as between younger and older people. They may also disturb the formation or maintenance of such relations, e.g. by stimulating the 'othering' of the out-group members. The aim of the present study was to trace how the different strategies of 'othering' are applied by Dutch news media in their portrayal of older and younger citizens. The analysis showed that the most notable discrepancies in the media coverage of the two age groups appear in (the nature of) their evaluation. While the negative descriptors of older characters relate more frequently to their (alleged) incompetence, the negative depictions of younger actors refer predominantly to their lack of benevolence. In the case of positive evaluations the reverse is true: older characters are more often presented as warm and younger people as competent. The results of the study are interpreted in the light of literature on social distance and (social) practices of 'othering'.

AB  - Direct training of selected individuals as disseminating farmers (DFs) can help to implement a farmer to farmer extension approach. This study systematically examines the relationship between social distance and the likelihood of information exchange, subsequently evaluating effects on awareness, knowledge, and adoption of drought-tolerant (DT) varieties of maize, disease-resistant varieties of groundnuts and conservation farming. Using a panel dataset from northern Uganda, the study combines matching techniques with difference-in-difference (DID) approach and employs two-stage least squares regression (2SLS) to identify causal effects. The study finds an increased likelihood of information exchange when the DF is female, regardless of the sex of the neighbour. The likelihood of information exchange increased when distance in farm size cultivated with maize was larger than the median in the sub-village. In terms of non-agricultural assets index, there was an increased likelihood of information exchange both when the distance was smaller and greater than the village median. Information exchange links improved awareness and knowledge for all of the technologies, but only increased adoption of maize varieties. Together, these findings suggest that social distance shapes the diffusion of agricultural knowledge even when DFs are selected by the community to be "representative" and reinforces that social learning can help to address informational constraints to adoption of agricultural technologies.

AB  - Digital tools facilitating everything from health to education have been introduced at a rapid pace to replace physical meetings and allow for social distancing measures as the Covid-19 pandemic has sped up the drive to large-scale digitalisation. This rapid digitalisation enhances the already ongoing process of datafication, namely turning ever-increasing aspects of our identities, practices, and societal structures into data. Through an analysis of empirical examples of datafication in three important areas of the welfare state - employment services, public service media, and the corrections sector - we draw attention to some of the inherent problems of datafication in the Nordic welfare states. The analysis throws critical light on automated decision-making processes and illustrates how the ideology of dataism has become increasingly entangled with welfare provision. We end the article with a call to develop specific measures and policies to enable the development of the data welfare state, with media and communication scholars playing a crucial role.

AB  - Numerous studies have shown that conflicts between local people and Protected Areas (PA) can undermine conservation goals. This study explores attitudes towards Vieques National Wildlife Refuge (VNWR), Puerto Rico, USA, a former military site with a controversial political history, high ecological values and a toxic legacy including unexploded ordnances as a results of the area's former use as a naval bombing range. Our objective is to evaluate how residents perceive VNWR and to elucidate conflicts associated with former and current uses of the area through semi-structured and key informant interviews. Socio-economic factors and misconceptions about management were among the variables influencing attitudes about the refuge. Overall, many residents did not express particularly strong attitudes, but there were many significant differences among demographic groups. Older and less educated individuals, and those living longer on Vieques Island, had poorer attitudes about the refuge and its management while younger, more educated, short-term residents, and those employed in the tourism sector, had more positive attitudes. The most common reasons for expressing discontent were restrictions on access and rules limiting resource extraction. Some negative concerns were false impressions of current restrictions (i.e. many resources can be legally removed from VNWR), while some others were issues not under the control of the Fish and Wildlife Service (i.e. fishing rules are set by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico). The results suggest that much more public outreach and education are urgently needed. We recommend that VNWR expand public uses where feasible and better-publicise formal regulations and the reasons for them.

AB  - The risk of COVID-19 transmission increases when an uninfected person is less than 6 ft from an infected person for longer than 15 minutes. Infectious disease experts working on the COVID-19 pandemic call this high-risk situation being Too Close for Too Long (TCTL). Consequently, the problem of detecting the TCTL situation in order to maintain appropriate social distance has attracted considerable attention recently. One of the most prominent TCTL detection ideas being explored involves utilizing the Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) to determine whether the owners of two smartphones are observing the acceptable social distance of 6 ft. However, using RSSI measurements to detect the TCTL situation is extremely challenging due to the significant signal variance caused by multipath fading in indoor radio channel, carrying the smartphone in different pockets or positions, and differences in smartphone manufacturer and type of the device. In this study we utilize the Mitre Range Angle Structured (MRAS) Private Automated Contact Tracing (PACT) dataset to extensively evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in comparison to classical estimation theory techniques to solve the TCTL problem. We provide a comparative performance evaluation of proximity classification accuracy and the corresponding confidence levels using classical estimation theory and a variety of ML algorithms. As the classical estimation method utilizes RSSI characteristics models, it is faster to compute, is more explainable, and drives an analytical solution for the precision bounds proximity estimation. The ML algorithms, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Machines (GBM) utilized thirteen spatial, time-domain, frequency-domain, and statistical features extracted from the BLE RSSI data to generate the same results as classical estimation algorithms. We show that ML algorithms can achieve 3.60%similar to 19.98% better precision, getting closer to achievable bounds for estimation.

AB  - In response to Covid-19, governments have imposed substantial restrictions on people's mobility. To encourage compliance, political actors have deployed direct communication strategies on social media. In this paper, we evaluate the legitimacy of the Swiss government's crisis communication on Twitter during the first wave of the pandemic. We examine and compare tweets regarding international and domestic travel, as well as social distancing. Using content and network analysis, we analyze the legitimacy of crisis communication by measuring its timeliness, consistency and congruence. We find that communication on domestic mobility restrictions has enjoyed a higher level of consistency and congruence, but has suffered from a disengagement of political parties, while the communication of international travel restrictions has become increasingly politicized.

TI  - Perceived Knowledge as [Protective] Power: Parents' Protective Efficacy, Information-Seeking, and Scrutiny during COVID-19
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, parents were issued numerous, sometimes changing, safeguarding directives including social distancing, mask use, hygiene, and stay-at-home orders. Enacting these behaviors for the parent presented challenges, but the responsibility for children to follow protocol properly was an even more daunting undertaking. Self-efficacy is one of the most power predictors of health behavior and has been adapted to a context-specific crisis self-efficacy scale conducted on March20, 2020, captures real-time perceptions of parents as coronavirus anxieties peaked. The study reveals a relationship between self- and protective efficacy that is mediated by parents' assessments of how informed they are about COVID-19. It also examines the role of perceived knowledge on information-seeking and scrutiny of pandemic information found online. Important directions for future research to develop the protective efficacy construct emerge as well as evidence of the rich applied and theoretical value of a deeper understanding of the perceived ability to perform recommended actions to protect another.

KW  - Conflict management
KW  - Burnout
AB  - Introduction: End-of-life care (EOLC) is necessary for patients who are not expected to live long. Nurses have positive attitudes toward EOLC, but they encounter difficulties in practice. That situation creates conflict, which can affect burnout. It is essential to manage nurses' conflict about their ability to practice EOLC by enhancing their individual strengths. Focusing on the role of self-compassion may help to prevent burnout related to the conflict about ability to practice EOLC.
   Objective: The study aim was to assess the mediating effect of self-compassion on the association between conflict about ability to practice EOLC and burnout.
   Methods: A correlational study was conducted with emergency department nurses who practiced EOLC. Selfreport measures of conflict about ability to practice EOLC, burnout, and self-compassion were obtained.
   Results: Negative aspects of self-compassion mediated the relationship among conflict, emotional exhaustion, and depersonalization (burnout). Self-compassion did not mediate the association between conflict and reduced personal accomplishment (burnout).
   Conclusions: Negative aspects of self-compassion mediated the relationship between conflict and burnout (excluding reduced personal accomplishment). To prevent burnout, it is necessary to screen for nurses with low selfcompassion and to provide opportunities to change their cognitive recognition and disclose their conflicts.

AB  - Introduction: Radiographers' engagement in research is important for the development of evidence-based practice in radiography; however, radiographers' interest in research has rarely been reported. This study sought to ascertain radiographers' opinions about radiography research and investigate their involvement in research activities in four Nordic countries.
   Methods: This study was conducted in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden. A study-specific questionnaire was developed in English and adapted to each language of the study sample, and the content and face validity of the adaptations were evaluated. An online tool was used to collect the study data. The questionnaire link was distributed in September 2019 to radiographers working in clinical settings in four Nordic countries (n = 4572).
   Results: The overall response rate was 14% (n = 662/4572). Research involvement was reported by 33% of the respondents; data collection was the main type of contribution. Radiographers who contributed to research were more likely to be male, have longer work experience, hold a master's or doctoral degree, work as managers and be employed in university hospitals. Nearly all agreed that radiography research is needed to promote the radiography profession and provide the evidence base for radiographic practice. However, only 14% were aware of the current research evidence regarding their professional field of specialisation, and 19% indicated that they developed current practices based on research evidence.
   Conclusion: The findings indicate that, although radiographers had positive attitudes towards radiography research, their involvement in research and utilisation of research evidence in practice is low.
   Implications for practice: Strategies should be developed to improve knowledge and skills related to evidence-based practice and stimulate radiographers' engagement in research. (C) 2021 The College of Radiographers. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess whether children's attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women differ in relation to their ethnic backgrounds and whether ethnic differences are a result of perceived differential gender socialization practices. Data were collected from children in eight Dutch elementary schools by means of a paper-and-pencil questionnaire administered in the classroom. All children (mean age 11.47; N = 229) lived in the Netherlands; 50.2% had non-Western and 49.8% Western ethnic backgrounds. Children with non-Western ethnic backgrounds reported more negative attitudes toward gays and lesbians. These children perceived more parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender and showed more negative attitudes toward gender-nonconforming behavior by peers. Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that cultural differences in attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women are partly mediated by differentially perceived parental pressure to behave in accordance with their gender.

AB  - Background: Ethiopia is the second most populous country in Africa with a total fertility rate (TFR) of 4.8 children per a woman and contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) of 29 %. The overall prevalence of modern family planning in a pastoralist community, like Afar region, is low (9.1 %). This study aimed to assess family planning utilization and associated factors among married women of Afar region, Eastern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 10-28, 2013 among 602 women. Multistage sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Descriptive and multiple variable logistic regression analyses were done to isolate independent predictors on utilization of family planning using SPSS 20.
   Results: The overall prevalence of family planning utilization in Afar region was 8.5 % (6.2-10.7). Majority of the women (92.2 %) had used injectable. The most common reasons mentioned in the non-use of family planning methods were religion-related (85.3 %), desire to have more children (75.3 %), and husband's objection (70.1 %). Women who had a positive attitude towards family planning utilization (AOR = 4.7, 95 % CI: 2.1, 10.3), owning radio (AOR = 1.8, 95 % CI: 1.02, 4.18), and literate (AOR = 4.4, 95 % CI: 1.80, 11.08) were more likely to use family planning methods as compared to their counterparts. The increase of monthly income was also associated with the likelihood of family planning methods utilization. The odds of using family planning methods were higher among those with monthly income of $27-$55.5 (AOR = 2.0, 95 % CI: 1.9, 4.7) and > $55 (AOR = 4.6, 95 % CI: 1.23-17.19) as compared to women with the lowest category of monthly income ($27 and less).
   Conclusion: The low coverage of family planning in the region could be due to the influence of husband, religious and clan leader. Attitude of women towards family planning methods, possession of radio, monthly income, and educational status could influence family planning utilization.

T2  - TRANSPLANTATION PROCEEDINGS
LA  - English
KW  - ANTIBODY-MEDIATED REJECTION
AB  - Background. Kidney allograft biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis of rejection. Under the current extraordinary circumstances of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), in which social distancing is key to limiting the spread of the virus, the model used to provide care to transplant recipients has undergone a very rapid transformation. In the spirit of medical distancing, we have been using the donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) test for screening for rejection.
   Methods. This article describes our experience with this approach between March 15th and May 20th, 2020.
   Results. This test was obtained for-cause in 23 patients and for monitoring in 9 patients. Normal results aided in forgoing biopsy in 63% of the patients for whom the test was obtained in the outpatient setting. The test is neither 100% sensitive nor specific for rejection; however, when used in combination with the available clinical information, it can be used for determining whether bringing in a transplant recipient into a medical facility is necessary.
   Conclusions. In the event COVID-19 becomes a long-term challenge for our community, noninvasive biomarkers such as the dd-cfDNA may become more relevant than ever in enhancing our ability to care for our transplant patients while maximizing the distancing measures.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media.Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups.Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively.Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6-2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35-0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59).Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users.

AB  - This study investigated parental involvement in five Korean American families where there was evidence of successful heritage language (HL) maintenance in the second generation. The data in the current study were drawn from interviews of five Korean women who were first-generation immigrants to the U.S. and their daughters who were raised in the U.S. for most or all of their lives and were able to successfully acquire a high degree of competence in their HL. The data were analyzed for evidence of parental involvement in the children's HL education, which was categorised according to Grolnick and Slowiaczek's (1994, Parents' involvement in children's schooling: A multidimensional conceptualization and motivational model' Child Development 65: 237-252. doi:10.1111/j.1467-8624.1994.tb00747.x.) framework. The findings demonstrate that parental involvement in HL education was wide-ranging, taking the form of behavioural involvement (for example, speaking Korean at the home, teaching Korean to their children, watching Korean television shows with their children), cognitive-intellectual involvement (for example, exposing their children to formal Korean language instruction), and personal involvement (for example, explicitly expressing positive attitudes toward the Korean language and culture, expressing high expectations for their children's Korean language competence).

AB  - According to the theory of planned behavior (TPB), intentions to perform a specific behavior are the result of attitudes, norms, and perceived control, and in turn, intentions and perceived control are the main predictors of the behavior. This study aimed to test the applicability of TPB in predicting alcohol use in normative pre-adolescents. The sample was composed of 755 Spanish adolescents aged 11 to 15 (M = 12.24; SD = 0.56), 47.1% females, from 12 state secondary schools in Spain. The results of path analysis indicate that positive attitudes towards alcohol, favorable norms towards alcohol, and offer vulnerability (perceived control) are significantly positively related to intentions to use alcohol as well as negatively related to actual behavioral control (i.e., actual strategies to avoid alcohol use). In turn, intentions to use and actual control predict higher alcohol frequency and heavy drinking. Significant indirect effects of these antecedents were found on alcohol outcomes through the mediation of intentions and actual control. The findings suggest that the validity and applicability of the TPB in normative pre-adolescents depend on the severity of alcohol use and point to a need to consider negative social influence in decision making processes in early adolescence.

AB  - Objective Inappropriate use of antibiotics is one of the main causes of antibiotic resistance around the globe. The present study was aimed to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward antibiotics and antibiotic resistance among consumers. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted from April 2019 to September 2019. The participants visiting community pharmacies to buy the antibiotics were approached by data collectors. The descriptive analysis, Kruskal Wallis, and Mann-Whitney statistical tests were used for data analysis through SPSS. Results 399 participants at three pharmacies with male (n = 352, 88.2%), age (years) group between 34 to 41(n = 138, 34.6%), uneducated (n = 128, 32.1%), and higher education (n = 76, 19.0%) level of the participants were noted. Poor to moderate knowledge were observed; participants were unaware of the risk and misuse of antibiotics at all three pharmacies. By some means, a positive attitude noted, but the storage of antibiotics at home (Median = 2, IQR = 2) was preferred to use when needed. Most of the respondents didn't follow the actual dosage regimen as prescribed (n = 266, 66.7%, p < 0.05). Conclusion A lack of knowledge and malpractices toward antibiotics use among consumers were observed. Education and awareness of the public about antibiotic resistance is the need of the hour.

AB  - Introduction. Information literacy skills are crucial in today's world. But teaching these skills is challenging and calls for new pedagogical approaches. This paper reports the results of a teaching intervention designed by practicing teachers in a lower secondary school.
   Method. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test design was used to investigate the effect of the intervention. Students' learning outcomes were measured in four component skills of online research: search planning and query formulation, Web searching, critical evaluation, and argumentative use of Web information.
   Analysis. A mixed between-within subjects ANOVA (analysis of variance) was conducted to investigate the impact of the intervention on students' online research skills.
   Results. The intervention group outperformed the control group in an online research performance test. The intervention effect was most powerful among the students who were less active Web searchers or social media users or among those with lower self-efficacy in online research. Surprisingly, the students who had a positive attitude towards traditional teacher-centred learning improved their skills, but the attitude towards independent online learning did not make a difference in learning outcomes.
   Conclusions. Even individual teachers may draw inspiration and ideas from research-based pedagogies, develop their professional practice effectively, and create effects in students.

AB  - Introduction Clinical audit is an important component of safe and ethical practice but many clinicians cite barriers to engagement in audit. Methodology A total of 81 basic specialist trainees in psychiatry were surveyed in terms of their basic demographic details and their knowledge, direct experience and attitudes in relation to clinical audit. Results Among the 49 (60.5%) who responded, 57.1% had received formal training in audit, but only 20.4% had received more than four hours of training in their whole career. The medianpositivity scorewas 30 out of a possible 54 (range 12-40), suggesting that participating trainees were barely more than 'undecided' overall when it comes to positive attitudes to clinical audit. Age, nationality and specific training did not predict attitudes to clinical audit. Gender, years of clinical experience and direct experience of clinical audit did not significantly predict attitudes to clinical audit, but these findings are at odds with some previous research. Discussion Much work is needed in improving postgraduate trainees' attitudes to clinical audit, given that clinical audit is essential for good medical practice. Ours is an initial study of this area of training limited by sample size and the narrowness of the group tested. Further study of other specialities, higher trainees and consultant trainers would further enhance our understanding.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: As interprofessional education opportunities become more prevalent within family medicine residency clinics, the benefit of the integration of pharmacy students is unclear in the current literature. Our study objective was to determine the impact of pharmacy student integration into a family medicine residency clinic on family medicine residents' attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration and satisfaction.
   METHODS: Twenty-two pharmacy students on clinical rotation were individually paired with family medicine residents for approximately 4-5 half days per week over a 10-month period. Residents and students were given a pre/post-validated survey on attitudes toward interprofessional collaboration. Satisfaction surveys were also administered to the residents at the end of the study period. Written components of satisfaction surveys were evaluated for commonly occurring themes.
   RESULTS: Matched survey responses were available for over 80% of the residents. Both pre- and post-survey responses showed positive attitudes toward physician-pharmacist collaboration. A statistically significant positive change was seen for one item in the family medicine resident surveys. Favorable written comments revealed positive themes toward pharmacy students providing mediation reviews, therapeutic recommendations, and patient education.
   CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacy students can be integrated into family medicine residency clinics while maintaining positive levels of interprofessional collaboration and providing a perceived benefit to the family medicine residents.

AB  - Snakes are controversial animals, therefore a better understanding of public attitudes is critical for their effective protection and future survival. The attitudes towards snakes of 951 adults in Greecewere investigated in personal interviews. Factor analysis revealed a dualmode of attitudes: respondentswere highly intolerant of snakes, while they supported their conservation at the same time. Respondents had high knowledge about the behavior of snakes, medium knowledge of their biology and were strongly affected by folklore. Structural models revealed that tolerance was a positive mediator of conservation. Knowledge about snake behavior and biology was positively correlated with attitudes towards snakes. Moralistic and naturalistic attitudes were positively, and dominionistic attitudes negatively, correlated with snake tolerance and conservation attitudes. Younger, more educated people were more snake-tolerant than older, less educated people. Females were less snake-tolerant and more conservation-oriented than males. These findings increased the understanding of human attitudes towards snakes and helped identify factors critical for their conservation. As such they could be used to design environmental education programs incorporating both information-based and experiential activities that will improve attitudes, behaviors and, eventually, the chances for the survival of these uncharismatic animals.

AB  - UNICEF's new Millennium Development Goals and Beyond (2015. http://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/) focus on the needs of the largest marginalised minority, individuals with disabilities, challenging us to examine issues related to exclusion and develop strategies for making an authentic sense of belonging and high-quality early childhood education a reality for over 93 million children with disabilities (United Nations Children's Fund. 2006. Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. http://www.un.org/disabilities/default.asp?id=150). A first step in addressing stigma and the exclusion of individuals with disabilities is to examine materials in environments, given that positive representation in books and media contributes to a sense of belonging, increased self-esteem, and greater understanding of and attitudes towards others. Historically, the portrayal of individuals with disabilities in the literature and media has been absent or negative while the number of children with disabilities in early childhood classes has steadily increased. In this study, the representation of individuals with disabilities in school materials was examined in 32 kindergarten classes using the Inventory of Disability Representation (Favazza, P. C., and S. L. Odom. 1997. Promoting Positive Attitudes of Kindergarten-Age Children Toward People with Disabilities. Exceptional Children 63: 405-418). Two classrooms (6%) had moderate representation, 22 classrooms (69%) had low representation, and 8 classrooms (25%) had no representation of disabilities. Implications for practice and research are presented in light of the current focus on disability rights and becoming a more inclusive society.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic presents a serious global health challenge to humanity in recent times. It has caused fundamental disruptions to the global transportation system, supply chains, and trade. The impact on the transport sector resulting from lockdowns has led to huge losses in revenue. At the moment there are limited studies of the road transport sector response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper fills this gap using Nigeria as a case study area. A mixed method involving both qualitative and quantitative research was employed. Principal Component Analysis and Multiple Criteria Analysis were used to analyze the data. The results suggest that road transport operators strongly (90.7%) believe that 51 adopted new technologies/innovations, processes, and procedures will keep them and passengers safe from the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria. A breakdown shows that observing the lockdown directive is perceived by road transport operators as the most effective response to the pandemic. The breakdown continues in descending order thus: COVID-19 safety protocols, environmental sanitation, and promotion of hygiene, information technology, facemask, and social distancing. Others are public enlightenment, palliative, inclusion, and mass media. This indicates that non-pharmaceutical measures are very effective in the fight against the pandemic. This finding leverages support for the application of non-pharmaceutical guidelines in containing the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria.

AB  - Millions of people have been impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide. High infection rates and death tolls, combined with social distancing measures, may have unintended psychological consequences on individuals. The goal of this study was to examine the interrelations between COVID-19 exposure, fear of COVID-19, and depression among a community-based sample of adult twins. We further explored whether fear of COVID-19 mediated the association between COVID-19 exposure and depression. 732 same-sex adult twin pairs (78.1% MZ, 21.9% DZ) completed an online survey examining their feelings in May 2020. About one-fifth of the participants reported having any COVID-19 exposure. Most participants (>80%) were somewhat concerned about themselves or their household members being infected by COVID-19. The average depression level was relatively low (M = 0.9 out of 6). We found that COVID-19 exposure was related to increased fears of COVID-19 and depression, and that depressive feelings increased with fear of COVID-19. The correlation between COVID-19 exposure and depression was partially mediated by fear of COVID-19. However, these associations were confounded by familial influences. As society navigates through the pandemic, it is essential to implement public health strategies to help individuals cope with the concerns and fears about COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Attitudes to aging have not previously been assessed in people with dementia. The possession of positive life attitudes into older age has the potential to induce resilience to health changes and may explain the discrepancy between self-reported and proxy ratings of quality of life (QoL). The aim of this study was to explore the attitudes of people with dementia to determine the main factors that predict these attitudes and any relationship that exists with self-reported QoL.
   Methods: Fifty-six participants with dementia were recruited from a memory clinic setting. The Bath Assessment of Subjective Quality of Life in Dementia, Attitudes to Aging Questionnaire (AAQ), Memory Functioning Scale, Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory, and Mini-Mental State Examination were administered. The AAQ was also completed by 86 community-dwelling older adults without dementia.
   Results: Participants with dementia displayed a significantly stronger endorsement of the negative attitude that aging is a time of psychosocial loss than those without dementia. Regression analyses suggest this negative attitude acts as a partial mediator in the relationship between the person's level of insight and self-reported QoL.
   Conclusions: Negative attitudes to aging had a direct impact on the self-reported QoL ratings of people with dementia. The view of aging as a time of psychosocial loss was most significant for people with dementia and suggests that negative stereotypes of dementia need to be challenged. In order to promote QoL, care should focus on abilities that the person retains rather than what has been lost.

AB  - Introduction: The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic has led governments to implement some containment measures to flatten the curve of the diffusion of the virus. The current study aims to investigate individual differences in compliance with these restrictive behaviors. In a sample of Italian individuals (N = 300), we examined whether sociodemographic factors, personality traits, fatalism, and fear could be considered as possible predictors.
   Methods: We performed a series of standard multiple regression analyses and proposed a mediation analysis to test the associations among variables.
   Results: Overall, our results suggested that men are less likely to engage in preventive behaviors, younger individuals are more reluctant to adhere to social distancing mandates, and fear has a functional role in predicting positive outcomes.
   Conclusion: The results of our analyses are discussed and suggestions for future research are provided.

AB  - This article explains how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) partnered with African American minister Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux to discredit and neutralize Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The Elder, the nation's first minister (black or white) to have his own weekly television show, colluded with the Bureau to shape public opinion against King and cast doubt upon King's religious commitments and activities. Michaux was, what I call, a Bureau Clergyman: a minister who was an FBI "Special Service Contact" or on the Bureau's "Special Correspondents Lists." Far from secret informants, black and white male clergy in these official Bureau programs enjoyed very public and cooperative relationships with the FBI and were occasionally "called into service" to work in concert with the FBI. The FBI called upon Michaux and he willingly used his status, popular media ministry, and cold war spirituality to publically scandalize King as a communist and defend the Bureau against King's criticisms. In the end, the Elder demonized King, contested calls for black equality under the law, and lionized the FBI as the keeper of Christian America. The story moves the field beyond the very well known narratives of the FBI's hostility towards religion and reveals how the Bureau publicly embraced religion and commissioned their clergymen to help maintain prevailing social arrangements. Michaux's relationship with the FBI also offers a window into the overlooked religious dimensions of the FBI's opposition to King, even as it highlights how black clergy articulated and followed competing ideologies of black liberation during the civil rights movement.

AB  - Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which infects the immune cells CD4, leading to its destruction. The disease develops in people with HIV to AIDS when the number of CD4 cells in the blood is less than 200. About 230,000 people are diagnosed with AIDS in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, including about 10000 cases in Saudi Arabia. AIDS stigma is the social link between AIDS and negative perceptions and attitudes towards an individual or a group in a specific community. The collective evidence on the prevalence of the HIV stigma in the MENA region remains insufficient. Hence, this review aimed to evaluate the published evidence on the extent of AIDS stigma in the MENA region and the related outcomes. Searching of Google Scholar, Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases was done up to June 2020. The majority of retrieved studies reported low levels of knowledge, as well as negative attitudes towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Some studies noted an inverse correlation between the level of knowledge and the negative attitudes of the participants. This stigma leads to denial, self-blame, self-isolation, failure to disclose HIV status, violence, and even suicide. Educational interventions are needed to raise knowledge and change attitudes in the media, schools, and healthcare professionals' communications. More studies are also needed to assess the prevalence and impact of AIDS-related stigma at the patient and society levels.

AB  - Menopause is an inevitable developmental event that women encounter at an age of 42-54 years. The drop of estrogen levels that accompanies cessation of menstruation is associated with multiple vasomotor, physical, neuropsychological, and sexual symptoms, which may hamper quality of life. This study aimed to examine the severity of psychological symptoms and their correlates among peri- and postmenopausal Emirati women (N = 60, mean age = 54.88 +/- 6 years). Participants were interviewed using the Menopause-Specific Quality of Life (MENQOL) and attitudes toward menopause scale (ATMS). In four path analysis models, vasomotor symptoms, weight gain, and fatigue had significant direct effects on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only weight gain and fatigue), and psychological distress. Fatigue significantly mediated the effects of vasomotor symptoms and weight gain on symptoms of anxiety, depression (only vasomotor symptoms), psychological distress, and memory problems. These models explained 47.6%, 44.5%, 56.6%, and 29.1% of the variances in anxiety, depression, psychological distress, and memory problems, respectively. Participants with more severe menopausal symptoms expressed more negative attitudes toward menopause though regression analysis revealed that only vasomotor symptoms could significantly contribute to ATMS scores. In conclusion, psychological distress is widespread among menopausal women, and it is associated with vasomotor symptoms, fatigue, and change of body composition (obesity). Psychological symptoms, along with vasomotor symptoms, express a key link to negative attitudes toward menopause. Therefore, interventional strategies that target psychological distress may promote coping with midlife transition and improve mental health among menopausal women.

AB  - Globally, the use of biopesticides is growing annually while the use of traditional pesticides is on the decline. North America uses the largest percentage of the biopesticide market share at 44%, followed by the EU and Oceania with 20% each, South and Latin American countries with 10%, about 6% in Asia and India. Although biopesticide growth is projected at 10% annually, it is highly variable among the regions constrained by factors such as regulatory hurdles, public and political attitudes, and limitations for market expansion. Microbial biopesticides have been registered in Canada for 35 years, but the number of registrations for commercial, restricted-industry and domestic uses has significantly increased over the past 10 years. The early Canadian biopesticides registered by pest control category were Bacillus thuringiensis in 1972 as the first bioinsecticide, Agrobacterium radiobacter in 1989 as the first biobacteriocide, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f.sp. malvae in 1992 as the first bioherbicide, and Streptomyces griseoviridis in 1999 as the first biofungicide. Between 1972 and 2008, the Pest Management Regulatory Agency approved registration of 24 microbially active substances with 83 formulations. The majority of the registrations (55/83) occurred since 2000 and at the beginning of 2008 there were 10 new products (a combination of new active substances, strains, formulations, and uses) under regulatory evaluation. This paper examines the evolution of microbial biopesticides in Canada illustrating how the actions of the government, the people, and the industry have led to changes in legislation, policy, and programming that spurred momentum for new microbial pest control products in recent years and created a model system for future microbial biopesticide discovery, development, and implementation that could be adopted throughout the world.

AB  - In the last decade, there has been a major increase in the technology that enables representatives and voters to connect with one another. Representatives can use email, their political party's website, personal websites, Facebook, e-newsletters, weblogs and Twitter simultaneously to bypass the traditional political media. The author asks, what are the usage patterns of these web applications? What are the characteristics of the representatives who use these technologies? What are their attitudes about their use? Most previous studies have concentrated on one perspective (representatives or voters) or used one research method (questionnaires, interviews, hard data). This article is unique in that it combines several research methods: interviews with representatives regarding their attitudes toward the new technology and hard data from the Israeli Knesset's website regarding the MKs' use of web applications. The findings demonstrate that the Israeli representatives are no different than their colleagues in other parliaments. Young MKs and junior MKs are more likely to use web applications than older MKs and those with more seniority. However, coalition MKs use web applications differently than opposition MKs. Furthermore, the representatives have positive attitudes toward the use of web applications and consider them useful for communicating with the voters.

AB  - Background: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a major burden to individuals, impacting their physical, mental and social wellbeing. While PU prevention is traditionally regarded as a nursing issue, an interprofessional approach has been promoted as best practice. However, little is known about current practice or the knowledge and attitudes of the wider interprofessional team (IPT).
   Purpose: Pre-designed questionnaires were used to explore knowledge and attitudes with healthcare staff in the community.
   Methods: Questionnaires were disseminated to all healthcare staff within a community healthcare Trust predominantly via an online tool. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics.
   Results: The median values of all professional groups demonstrated satisfactory attitudes (>75%) and levels of knowledge (>60%) to PU prevention. However, there were differences within and between groups. Management staff demonstrated the most positive attitude to PU prevention (89%), followed by occupational therapists (OTs) and healthcare assistants (HCAs) (87%, IQR: 75%-> 89%). OTs demonstrated the highest scores for knowledge (69%, IQR: 62%-> 73%), while healthcare and rehabilitation assistants scored the lowest (58%, IQR: 58%-64%).
   Conclusion: This study has demonstrated that the majority of healthcare staff in a UK community setting have satisfactory levels of knowledge and attitudes in relation to PU prevention overall. Nevertheless, there were some differences between groups, albeit non-significant. There were also differences between sub-themes of the questionnaires, indicating a greater focus of pressure ulcer treatment over prevention. While PU prevention is widely regarded to be a nursing issue, these findings provide some indication of the potential for an interprofessional approach.

AB  - Annual vaccination is effective in reducing the harms associated with seasonal influenza. However, the uptake of influenza vaccine has historically been low in children. This paper reports a descriptive survey that sought to explore the beliefs, attitudes, and knowledge of general practitioners (GPs) and general practice nurses (GPNs) towards influenza vaccination in young children. Both GPs and GPNs working in the Illawarra Shoalhaven Local Health District (ISLHD) in NSW, Australia, were invited via email, fax and social media to participate in the study. A total of 121 participants completed the survey. Most participants had a high level of support and knowledge of influenza immunisation in young children. Barriers to influenza immunisation in young children included perceived hesitancy in parents and competing clinical demands. The participants strongly supported funding of the vaccine, with 90.9% feeling that parents would be less likely to vaccinate their children if the vaccine were no longer free. Both GPs and GPNs differed in the use of influenza vaccination resources. The participants had a positive attitude to influenza immunisation in young children and strongly supported continued funding of the vaccine. Dedicated young children's influenza vaccination clinics run by general practices or in the community could reduce the impact of competing clinical demands.

AB  - The main purpose of this study was to examine the multi-functional relationship among pre-service teachers' art appreciation, attitude toward science, technology acceptance, creative convergence competency, and teaching competency in STEAM education. Data were collected from 238 pre-service teachers in Korea and were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that pre-service teachers' art appreciation, attitude toward science, and technology acceptance had a significant effect on their creative convergence competency. In particular, their attitude toward science had the greatest effect on the creative convergence competency, which had a significant effect on the teaching competency in STEAM education. In addition, individual characteristics (i.e., art appreciation, attitude toward science) had indirect effects on the teaching competency in STEAM education mediated by the creative convergence competency. Overall, the results of this study show the criticality of supporting pre-service teachers to develop positive attitudes toward art appreciation and science to foster creative convergence skills. In conclusion, we suggest that the current fragmented approach with strict disciplinary boundaries at teaching education institutions does not adequately prepare pre-service teachers to be competent in teaching STEAM education. More holistic and systemic approaches are necessary to support the trajectory of pre-service teachers' development of STEAM teaching competency.

AB  - Background: Common factors are important for the therapy outcome and also mediate the specific factors of therapy. As one of the common factors, client's expectations towards treatment have been understudied. Aims: The aim was to examine the pre-treatment expectations of outpatient substance abuse treatment clients (N = 327, 111 females, 216 males) and its impact on retention, effectiveness and satisfaction at 6-month follow-up. Method: Dependent variables included the clients' attitudes towards the twelve-step principles and participation, medical treatment and therapists' role. Results: An emphasis on the importance of medical treatment at baseline predicted dropping out. Similarly, it predicted a lower percent days abstinent (PDA(6)) at 6 months follow-up in comparison to those who did not consider medical treatment important for recovery. Percent days abstinent increased with a more positive attitude to mutual support. At follow-up, those who had assessed the therapist's role in recovery to be most important at the baseline were most satisfied with the treatment. Conclusions: The client's pre-treatment expectations have an impact on treatment retention and effectiveness. Further effort should be made to study how clients' image of treatment could be improved and also how the commitment of the clients with multiple problems could be improved.

AB  - BackgroundIt has been argued that interpersonal contact is the best intervention for reducing negative attitudes and discrimination toward individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID). In Israel, the Equal in Uniform project makes it possible for individuals with ID to serve alongside soldiers without ID in ordinary military units in the Israeli Defense Forces. The project provided the opportunity to examine the effect of contact on the attitudes of soldiers without ID.
   MethodsData analyses are based on data collected from 220 soldiers without ID via a self-administered questionnaire based on the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale. Of these, 138 were in contact with soldiers with ID as part of the project.
   ResultsA mediation model showed that the impact of contact with a soldier with ID on withdrawal behaviour was mediated by cognitive attributions and negative affect. Contact was directly associated with prosocial behaviour.
   DiscussionResults support the importance of contact between soldiers with and without ID to bring about improved attitudes toward the former.

AB  - Purpose - Cause-related marketing - linking product sales with donations to a cause - are popular with consumers because they produce warm-glow feelings (the positive route). But when they involve large donations, they may trigger consumer scepticism, reducing the warm glow (the negative route). Drawing on the elaboration likelihood model, the purpose of this paper is to examine whether large donations in cause-related marketing can produce consumer scepticism and reduce the warm-glow effect and positive attitude towards the retailer.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment varying the donation size (large, medium, small) in a cause-related marketing offer run by an office equipment retailer is set up. Hypotheses are tested using bootstrapping regression analyses.
   Findings - The negative route has the greater effect: scepticism towards the offer mediates the relationship between donation size and the warm glow. Furthermore, scepticism towards a large donation is higher (lower) for respondents scoring low (high) on altruism and high (low) on familiarity with cause-related marketing.
   Practical implications - When using cause-related marketing, retailers should choose their features and target audience carefully in order to reduce scepticism, e.g., small donations should be offered in promotions targeting consumers who are familiar with cause-related marketing and show low altruism.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the recent research examining the negative effects of cause-related marketing by explicitly conceptualising and measuring scepticism towards cause-related marketing. The findings are also valuable because they indicate the importance of a shift in focus, away from the conventional question of cause-related marketing effectiveness to the more specific and under-investigated problem of the appropriate core target consumers.

AB  - Introduction: Understanding the importance of factors influencing the choice of active transportation modes (i.e. walking/cycling) may be misleading if we only concentrate on the direct and independent impacts of background variables (i.e. demographic, social environment and built environment factors). We hypothesised that background variables not only have a direct effect but also indirectly (through mediating roles of satisfaction with active travel and attitudes) associate with the choice of active mode. Previous studies have overlooked such indirect effects. Our contribution to the literature is to investigate direct and indirect effects of background variables on active commuting in university trips through developing an integrated structural model.
   Method: The data were collected through a questionnaire and in-person interviews with 682 students of Isfahan University, Iran. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was applied to test the hypothesised model.
   Results: The results of SEM showed that the important psychological aspects of travel (satisfaction and attitudes) mediated the link between background variables and active commuting. SEManalysis highlighted that students who reported more positive attitudes and were satisfied with walking and cycling were more likely to commute by active modes. Female and working students were more stressed and hurried when commute by active modes, and demonstrated unfavourable attitudes towards walking and cycling, which was associated with diminished choice of active modes. Besides, students who travelled long distances or owned a private car were less likely to walk and ride bicycles.
   Conclusions: Policymakers could promote the culture of active travel in the university campus through training and advertising in the mass media or launching attitude campaigns at the university scale to mitigate the current restrictions. Policymakers could also strengthen infrastructure for cycling and walking to improve student satisfaction and attitudes towards active travel modes in the study area.

AB  - Undergraduate research (UR) is a high-impact practice (HIP) to engage undergraduate student in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), especially from underrepresented groups. UR experiences (UREs) can be integrated into the classroom, making authentic research experiences inclusive and available to all students. However, developing UR pedagogy can be challenging for faculty in resource-limited labs, such as community colleges and small liberal arts colleges. Often molecular biology research methods are expensive, time-consuming and need equipment not readily available or affordable in small schools. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is one of the most commonly used techniques in research labs and many UREs. We have investigated loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as an inexpensive, accessible alternative to PCR for DNA amplification enabling the identification of microorganisms in the context of UREs. LAMP does not require expensive instrumentation or reagents and uses equipment commonly found in teaching labs. By performing the technique, students learn several key scientific skills that will be useful in their undergraduate or graduate STEM careers. We designed guided independent research experiences for several undergraduates that included the use of LAMP. Students successfully applied the technique to culture samples of common environmental bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus, and were in addition, able to detect both Salmonella and Enterococcus in directly sampled environmental waters. To highlight the accessibility and affordability of this URE, a simple boiling method was used for DNA preparation from environmental samples. Student response data show positive attitudes toward UR when LAMP is utilized as a research tool to tackle relevant biological questions. The feasibility of using simplified LAMP in UREs points to a potential, more expanded application to public engagement with science and broader and more inclusive interactions with the research community.

AB  - Perceptual mechanisms have been proposed for the categorization of racial faces. Social cognitive mechanisms involved in the categorization of racial faces, however, remain unclear. The present study investigated whether and how attitudes influence racial face categorization by measuring reaction times to judge orientations of own-race or other-race faces. Study 1 showed that, in a task of judging orientations of Caucasian and Asian faces, European Americans responded faster to own-race (Caucasian) faces than to other-race (Asian) faces. Study 2 showed that Han Chinese responded faster to own-race (Han Chinese) faces than to other-race (Uigur Chinese) faces. In addition, we found that, in both experiments, own-race advantage in reaction times was eliminated by inducing negative attitudes toward own-race faces using a negative association priming procedure. Moreover, the mediation analysis in Study 2 showed that the priming effect was mediated by attitude bias toward own-race faces. Our findings provide evidence for categorization of racial faces in a perceptual, race-irrelevant task, which, however, is strongly modulated by attitudes toward target faces.

AB  - We used a nationwide demographic survey to study the relation between television exposure and women's empowerment in India. Ordinary least squares (OLS) results suggested that TV exposure improved Indian women's status. We used the propensity score matching (PSM) method to mitigate the potential threat of endogeneity. The results indicate that TV exposure is correlated with greater awareness of autonomy, greater financial independence, less unwanted pregnancy (birth control), negative attitude toward beating, a lower tendency of giving birth, a smaller family, and a lower preference level for sons.

AB  - Background Glycogen storage disease type I (GSD I) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of carbohydate metabolism characterized by recurrent hypoglycaemia and hepatomegaly. Management of GSD I is demanding and comprises a diet with defined carbohydrate intake and the use of complex carbohydrates, nocturnal tube feeding or night-time uncooked cornstarch intake, regular blood glucose monitoring and the handling of emergency situations. With improved treatment, most patients nowadays survive into adulthood. Little research has been performed on the impact of GSD I on daily life, especially in adult patients. Results In this multi-centre study we assessed the impact of GSD I on adult daily life in 34 GSD I patients (27 GSD Ia, 7 GSD Ib) between 17 and 54 years (median 26 years) using a self-designed questionnaire that specifically focused on different aspects of daily life, such as job situation, social life, sports, travelling, composition of the household, night-time and day-time dietary management and disease monitoring as well as the patient's attitude towards the disease. At the time of investigation, the majority of patients either attended school or university or were employed, while 3 patients (9%) were out of work. Most patients ranked GSD I as a disease with moderate severity and disease burden. Dietary treatment was considered challenging by many, but the vast majority of patients considered life with GSD I as well-manageable. Conclusions Although the management of GSD I poses a significant burden on daily life, most patients live an independent adult life, have a positive attitude towards their disease and seem to cope well with their situation.

AB  - Background: News media coverage of antimask protests, COVID-19 conspiracies, and pandemic politicization has overemphasized extreme views but has done little to represent views of the general public. Investigating the public's response to various pandemic restrictions can provide a more balanced assessment of current views, allowing policy makers to craft better public health messages in anticipation of poor reactions to controversial restrictions.
   Objective: Using data from social media, this infoveillance study aims to understand the changes in public opinion associated with the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions (eg, business and school closures, regional lockdown differences, and additional public health restrictions, such as social distancing and masking).
   Methods: COVID-19-related tweets in Ontario (n=1,150,362) were collected based on keywords between March 12 and October 31, 2020. Sentiment scores were calculated using the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) algorithm for each tweet to represent its negative to positive emotion. Public health restrictions were identified using government and news media websites. Dynamic regression models with autoregressive integrated moving average errors were used to examine the association between public health restrictions and changes in public opinion over time (ie, collective attention, aggregate positive sentiment, and level of disagreement), controlling for the effects of confounders (ie, daily COVID-19 case counts, holidays, and COVID-19-related official updates).
   Results: In addition to expected direct effects (eg, business closures led to decreased positive sentiment and increased disagreements), the impact of restrictions on public opinion was contextually driven. For example, the negative sentiment associated with business closures was reduced with higher COVID-19 case counts. While school closures and other restrictions (eg, masking, social distancing, and travel restrictions) generated increased collective attention, they did not have an effect on aggregate sentiment or the level of disagreement (ie, sentiment polarization). Partial (ie, region-targeted) lockdowns were associated with better public response (ie, higher number of tweets with net positive sentiment and lower levels of disagreement) compared to province-wide lockdowns.
   Conclusions: Our study demonstrates the feasibility of a rapid and flexible method of evaluating the public response to pandemic restrictions using near real-time social media data. This information can help public health practitioners and policy makers anticipate public response to future pandemic restrictions and ensure adequate resources are dedicated to addressing increases in negative sentiment and levels of disagreement in the face of scientifically informed, but controversial, restrictions.

AB  - How does Eastern Europe contribute to the debate over EU's democratic deficit from an electoral perspective? Does Eastern Europe challenge our theoretical understanding of what motivates European citizens to participate and express their opinions in European Parliamentary elections? While there is no overarching consensus in the academic community regarding these questions, this essay aims to illustrate how a deeper understanding of one post-communist case and a bottom-up perspective on attitudes and political behavior in one locale, Romania, allowed the researcher to delve deeper into the taken-for-granted dynamics that European citizens from the South, East, and West engage in when voting in European Parliamentary elections. The approach of ethnographic sensibility mentioned in the workshop's discussions and illustrated in several contributions to this volume (see e.g. Kubik 2013; Knott 2015) constitutes then a useful starting point in deconstructing conventional knowledge. Moreover, during the process of moving up the ladder of generality and building inferences from one case study to a region, Eastern Europe still shares enough characteristics to deserve its own dummy variable, so to speak, in large-N continent-wide analyses covering the 2004 and 2009 European Parliamentary (EP) elections. Yet, as Joshua Tucker (2015) mentions in his contribution, it is unclear whether the historical legacies discussed at the workshop and further elaborated on by Grigore Pop-Eleches (2015) will continue to play a role in a priori distinguishing Eastern Europeans' political attitudes and behaviors from other EU citizens in the South or West in future EP elections.

AB  - The global outbreak of COVID-19 has led to governments and local authorities implementing nationwide lockdowns in an attempt to encourage social distancing and minimize the spread of the virus. Only essential businesses have been able to remain open, with non-essential businesses and activities either closing or restricting services. With no group training sessions allowed, canceled matches, an inability to work and the closure of eating establishments, Rugby Union players have experienced disruption to their daily lives. Two surveys were distributed among Rugby Union athletes to explore (1) the influence of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions on Rugby Union players' nutrition and training habits and (2) how nutrition habits in New Zealand Rugby Union players change after lockdown restrictions were lifted. In total, 258 respondents completed Survey 1 (84.1% male, 26.4% professional/semi-professional). Of the respondents, 58% indicated they lived with family during lockdown. Total food intake was reported to be higher in 36% of respondents. Fruit and vegetable intake was lower (17%) and packaged/convenience food intake higher (26%) in a minority of respondents. In total, 106 respondents completed Survey 2 (84.9% male, 34.0% professional/semi-professional). Of the respondents, 72% prepared and 67% purchased their own food. Less than half of respondents consumed high-protein food more than twice daily either during or following lockdown. Compared to during lockdown, motivation to train and exercise was greater in 58% of respondents following lockdown. Dieticians and nutritionists within clubs provided most of the nutrition knowledge to athletes however other unreliable sources were identified, such as social media and family members. The ongoing pandemic has presented significant challenges for athletes concerning training and nutrition habits and the current study provides some insight into these. Coaches and performance staff should ensure athletes receive appropriate nutritional and training support whilst being aware of the unique demands the individuals' may face.

AB  - Background and Objective: The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has exerted great efforts to prevent the spread of COVID-19. This research aims to scrutinize the outlook, awareness, and customs of Saudi undergraduate students regarding COVID-19.
   Methods: The current cross-sectional study comprises 178 undergraduate students in the Faculty of Applied Medical Sciences. The data were collected from online Google form questionnaires. The differences were picked out of the questionnaires, and the mean scores of the differences were duly assessed. The variables associated with knowledge, attitude, and practice toward COVID-19 were evaluated; moreover, a comparative study was conducted on these variables in different faculty departments. ANOVA, Student's t-test, and binary logistic regression analysis were used to assess the data on knowledge, attitude, and practice.
   Results: Most of the undergraduate students were well acquainted with COVID-19. We obtained the mean knowledge score for COVID-19 to be 3.08 +/- .82 (range: 1-5), indicating good knowledge. The attitude means the score was 3.02 +/- .61 (range: 0-4), implying good positive attitudes. On assessing the mean score of practices, it was found 5 +/- .47 (range: 0-7), pointing towards perfect practices. There were no significant differences between males and females regarding knowledge, attitudes, and practice toward COVID-19 (p-value < 0.05).
   Conclusion: Students of Applied Medical Sciences are knowledgeable about COVID-19. Health education programs should be focused on protection and safety from COVID-19 for Applied Medical Sciences students, especially Medical Rehabilitation Sciences and Radiology. Hand hygiene awareness programs must be conducted for undergraduate students. Infection control should be part of the undergraduate applied for medical sciences curriculum program.

AB  - Background A gap between the attitude towards evidence-based medicine (EBM), knowledge and awareness has been reported among physicians from different parts of the world. However, no investigation on Romanian physicians is available in the scientific literature. Our study aimed, firstly, to assess EBM awareness and the knowledge used by Romanian physicians, and, secondly, to compare resident trainees with specialists. Methods Romanian trainee and specialist physicians were invited to participate in this cross-sectional study. The study tool was an online questionnaire designed to explore their awareness, knowledge, usefulness, the attitude in medical documentation, and the use of professional EBM resources. Data were collected by Google Form from January 1st to April 30th, 2017, respecting the responders' anonymity. Two groups of physicians were investigated as trainees and specialists, respectively. Descriptive statistics (number, percentage, median and interquartile range) was used to describe the survey-related variables. Statistical significance on qualitative data was calculated with the Chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, or the Z-test for proportions. Results Two hundred and 50 physicians participated in this study (68% trainees vs. 32% specialists). In both groups, a significantly high percentage was represented by women as compared to men (trainees 72.4%, specialists 70%). The correct definition of EBM was identified by most respondents (75.6%). Affirmatively, both trainees and specialists always looked at levels of evidence when reading scientific literature, but a small percentage (6.5% trainees and 3% specialists) adequately identified the uppermost types of evidence in the hierarchy. Almost a quarter of the respondents shared the name of mobile EBM resources that they used to support the daily practice. Only six out of the 49 listed mobile resources met the EBM criteria. Conclusions The participants proved to have limited knowledge of EBM and a positive attitude towards the concept. They made use of mobile medical resources without understanding which of these were evidence-based.

AB  - Objectives Positive attitudes towards end-of-life care are essential among nursing students to adequately support terminally ill patients and enable students to feel confident about providing end-of-life care. This study aimed to determine nursing students' attitudes towards caring for terminally ill patients, as well as the associations between these attitudes and year of study, exposure to terminally ill people, self-perceived nursing skills and subjective impact of instruction. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting A health sciences school in Switzerland. Participants All preparatory students, first-year nursing students and third-year nursing students were invited to participate; 178 agreed to participate. Primary outcome measure Attitudes towards terminally ill patients were assessed using the Frommelt Attitudes Toward Care of the Dying Scale, Form B (FATCOD, Form B), as the primary outcome. Secondary measures were gender, age, year of study, number of terminally ill persons encountered, self-perceived palliative care nursing skills and subjective impact of instruction. Results Mean FATCOD, Form B score was 117.7 (SD: 9.8, median: 118.0). Better attitudes towards terminally ill patients were significantly associated with being aged 24-26 years (beta=6.97, 95% CI 2.00 to 11.95, p=0.006), year of study (beta=3.47, 95% CI 1.69 to 5.25, p<0.001), professional encounters with terminally ill patients (beta=3.59, 95% CI 2.23 to 4.95, p<0.001) and self-perceived palliative care nursing competence (beta=1.23, 95% CI 0.41 to 2.04; p=0.003). In the multivariate analysis, professionally encountering terminally ill patients remained significant (beta=3.00; 95% CI 1.43 to 4.57; p<0.001). Conclusions Nursing students' attitudes towards caring for terminally ill patients were positive and improved as their year of study progressed. Professional exposure to terminally ill patients was the strongest factor, followed by private encounters, self-perceived palliative care nursing skills, year of study and age.

AB  - The Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) The Real Cost campaign advertisements (ads) have targeted U.S. youth with messages designed to prevent and reduce tobacco use. This study examined exposure to The Real Cost campaign, including ad and slogan recall, and associations with attitudes and risk perceptions among U.S. adolescents. We analyzed data from a nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 13 to 17 years (n = 1125) surveyed by phone from October 2014 to June 2015. We assessed aided recall of and attitudes toward four campaign ads and the one slogan. Logistic regression models assessed whether aided recall of The Real Cost ads or slogan was associated with perceived likelihood of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking. Most (88%) adolescents reported seeing or hearing at least one of four ads for The Real Cost, and 54% recalled The Real Cost slogan. The majority of adolescents reported more negative attitudes toward tobacco products after seeing or hearing the ads. Recall of any The Real Cost ad was significantly associated with greater perceptions of serious health consequences of cigarette smoking (Adjusted Odd Ratios (AOR) = 5.58, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) = 1.20-25.90). The FDA's The Real Cost campaign has achieved very high reach and is associated with more negative attitudes toward tobacco products and greater risk perceptions of cigarette smoking among U.S. adolescents.

AB  - Introduction This study examined how health warning labels (HWL) on a waterpipe venue menu captured and held the attention of consumers and influenced waterpipe tobacco smoking (WTS) attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. Aims and Methods A randomized experiment (N = 96) of young adult waterpipe smokers was conducted in an immersive virtual reality laboratory. Participants viewed one of two virtual reality scenarios, a menu with an HWL and nicotine concentration or menu without an HWL and nicotine concentration. Eye-tracking metrics were collected, and participants completed posttest questionnaires on demographics, tobacco use history, and WTS attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors. T-tests were used to assess group differences, and a mediation analysis conducted to examine the relationship between the HWL and intention to quit WTS. Results Participants in the HWL group demonstrated greater visual attention to the warning and nicotine areas and less visual attention to the flavor and ingredients areas of the menu compared to the control group. The HWL group demonstrated greater negative attitudes toward WTS (p = .002), greater perceived risk of decreased lung function (p = .026), and greater intention to quit WTS (p = 0.003). The mediation model indicated the relationship between the HWL on a menu and intention to quit WTS was mediated by an increase in negative attitudes toward WTS. Conclusions The HWLs on a menu captured and held the attention of consumers and increased negative attitudes, perceptions of health risk, and intention to quit WTS indicating potential benefit of including a warning label or nicotine concentration on menus to correct misperceptions of WTS. Implications The study contributes to the broader literature on communicating the harms and risks of WTS. The findings suggest that HWL and nicotine concentration on waterpipe venue menus attract attention from consumers in environments comparable to the real world and the strategy warrants further exploration as a targeted policy intervention to educate the public and reduce the health burden of WTS.

AB  - This study investigated the interplay of consumer involvement, NFC, and emotional reactions when exposed to fake news on social media, and subsequently to an organizational rebuttal. In doing so, a 2 (rebuttal evidence type: story vs. informational) x 2 (involvement: low vs. high) x 2 (need for cognition, NFC: low vs. high) experiment was conducted. Results showed that individuals high in involvement and NFC perceived favorably the rebuttal message as well as exhibited positive attitudes and higher donation intentions toward the affected organization when it responded to the rumors. A significant two-way interaction between rebuttal evidence type and involvement indicated that highinvolved consumers reacted positively toward the informational evidence, whereas low-involved ones preferred storytelling evidence and this increased their donation intentions. Following an organizational refutation, it was demonstrated that the effects of negative emotions (e.g., anger, fear, sadness, disgust, anxiety) were mitigated while those of positive emotions (e.g., hope, happiness, empathy, contentment, interest) increased, leading to favorable attitudinal, donation, and social media engagement reactions. Also, individuals high in involvement and NFC displayed more positive affective reactions after receiving a rebuttal message than their low-involved and low-NFC counterparts. The mediation analyses revealed that positive emotions were significant mediators of the effects of the storybased refutation, high-involved, and high-NFC consumers on the latter's evaluations of the targeted organization.

AB  - Online news is often associated with high interactivity but low credibility. The increase in online news consumption suggests that people turn to the Internet for news because of the attractiveness of digital media even though some content is less than credible. Does web interactivity outweigh news credibility? This study aims to uncover which factor has a greater effect on how people consume online news in Malaysia; a country known for its media control. Using purposive sampling to recruit Malaysian news audience, we conducted an online survey on 520 respondents and later used Partial Least Squares-Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to analyse the data. The findings show that both interactivity and credibility were significant predictors to people's positive attitude towards online news and its consumption. The strength of the relationship linking credibility and news consumption was higher than the relationship between interactivity and news consumption. We also found that attitude towards online news was a significant mediator for both relationships; suggesting its influence on the increasing use of the Internet for news. Our data confirmed the importance of web interactivity and news credibility. However, news credibility is of greater importance than interactivity in predicting online news consumption among Malaysians. Finally, implications of the study are discussed in relation to the practice of media control and the threat of fake news dissemination on social media in Malaysia.

AB  - The global impact of dementia is a key healthcare priority, and although it is possible to live well with dementia, public perception is often negative. Serious digital games are becoming a credible delivery method to educate/train individuals in the business and health sectors and to challenge perceptions. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital game prototype on individual attitudes towards dementia. A digital game to improve public knowledge and understanding about dementia (www.dementiagame.com) was co-designed with people living with dementia and student nurses. The Game was evaluated using a pretest-posttest design. Participants for the evaluation were recruited via social media in one UK university and completed the Approaches to Dementia Questionnaire (ADQ) before and after playing the game. Overall, 457 individuals completed both pre and post test questionnaires. The total ADQ score demonstrated a significant improvement in positive attitudes (p < 0.001), and both subscales of Hope and Recognition of Personhood also saw significant improvements (p < 0.001). The use of a serious digital game has demonstrated a significant effect on the respondents' perceptions of dementia. Overall, there was a more positive view of the abilities of people with dementia and what their capabilities were. They were also more likely to be recognised as unique individuals with the same values as any other person. The benefit of using digital gaming to improve perceptions of dementia has been demonstrated, nonetheless further research is required to reach a more diverse population and test as a Randomised Control Trial to provide definitive evidence for use in policy and practice.

AB  - Imparting a positive attitude toward social determinants of health among medical students has remained a challenge in medical education. 'ibis pedagogical exercise attempted to use a toxic tour with participant photography technique to impart environmental health education as part of the community medicine curriculum for medical students. In collaboration with a local environmental health nongovernmental organization, faculty from two medical colleges took a set of 13 medical students to Elmore thermal power plants as a part of a toxic tour to view the air and water pollution caused due to the operation of the power plants. The students were instructed to capture photographs of the environmental hazards using their mobile phone cameras and share them on a social media platform. Immediately after the tour, the students discussed their experiences with the faculty: Two weeks after the toxic tour, the students engaged in a focus group discussion in which they discussed their experiences, advantages, and disadvantages of the toxic tour and participant photography method and their attitudes toward environmental health. This pedagogical exercise led to the active engagement of the students with the environmental hazards in the area. 'lhey shared 70 photographs on the social media platform. In reflection, students described that they found the method very useful to actively engage with the environment, look for and find the hazards, revisit, and reflect on the photos, and use the photos to share the knowledge and experience. They also demonstrated a positive social determinants and public health attitude during the discussions. Participant photography technique during a toxic tour can impart affective domain of learning related to environmental health among medical students.

AB  - Attitudes directed at people with disabilities by people without disabilities are formed through encounters with people with disabilities and are mediated by the characteristics of each person and what occurs during their interactions. Disability simulation activities are used to help positively affect people's attitudes and levels of empathy. The purpose of this study was to examine 10 participants' changes in attitudes toward people with disabilities that occurred as a result of participating in disability simulation activities held during an inclusive recreation services study abroad program. A three-phase mixed-methods research design that included the use of transformative procedures was used. The social model of disability served as the theoretical lens for this study. The quantitative component involved the administration of two scales pre-and post-test: The Attitudes Toward Disabled Persons (ATDP) scale and the Multidimensional Attitudes Scale Toward Persons with Disabilities (MAS) scale. Quantitative results indicated that participants' experienced positive attitude changes in 12 of the 16 emotions as measured on the MAS and four emotions as measured on the ATDP. Statistical significance was not found for the other examined emotions. Qualitative data were collected using an in-depth thematic analysis of verbal and behavioral responses to participants' responses to participation in extensive disability simulation activities. Qualitative results showed that the participants transitioned from a sympathetic response to an empathetic response, and then to an advocacy response. This transition demonstrated the potential for the emergence of a model specific to guiding participants through disability simulation activities. Suggestions for research and for facilitating effective disability simulation activities within or outside of recreational therapy practice are presented.

AB  - Background: An emerging model for sexuality education is the rights-based approach, which unifies discussions of sexuality, gender norms, and sexual rights to promote the healthy sexual development of adolescents. A rigorous evaluation of a rights-based intervention for a broad population of adolescents in the U.S. has not previously been published. This paper evaluates the immediate effects of the Sexuality Education Initiative (SEI) on hypothesized psychosocial determinants of sexual behavior.
   Methods: A cluster-randomized trial was conducted with ninth-grade students at 10 high schools in Los Angeles. Classrooms at each school were randomized to receive either a rights-based curriculum or basic sex education (control) curriculum. Surveys were completed by 1,750 students (N = 934 intervention, N = 816 control) at pretest and immediate posttest. Multilevel regression models examined the short-term effects of the intervention on nine psychosocial outcomes, which were hypothesized to be mediators of students' sexual behaviors.
   Results: Compared with students who received the control curriculum, students receiving the rights-based curriculum demonstrated significantly greater knowledge about sexual health and sexual health services, more positive attitudes about sexual relationship rights, greater communication about sex and relationships with parents, and greater self-efficacy to manage risky situations at immediate posttest. There were no significant differences between the two groups for two outcomes, communication with sexual partners and intentions to use condoms.
   Conclusions: Participation in the rights-based classroom curriculum resulted in positive, statistically significant effects on seven of nine psychosocial outcomes, relative to a basic sex education curriculum. Longer-term effects on students' sexual behaviors will be tested in subsequent analyses.

TI  - Association of Public Health Interventions With the Epidemiology of the COVID-19 Outbreak in Wuhan, China
T2  - JAMA-JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION
LA  - English
AB  - Question Was there an association of public health interventions with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China? Findings In this cohort study that included 32 & x202f;583 patients with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 in Wuhan from December 8, 2019, through March 8, 2020, the institution of interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home quarantine, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey was temporally associated with reduced effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (secondary transmission) and the number of confirmed cases per day across age groups, sex, and geographic regions. Meaning A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan and may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
   Importance Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a pandemic, and it is unknown whether a combination of public health interventions can improve control of the outbreak. Objective To evaluate the association of public health interventions with the epidemiological features of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan by 5 periods according to key events and interventions. Design, Setting, and Participants In this cohort study, individual-level data on 32 & x202f;583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases reported between December 8, 2019, and March 8, 2020, were extracted from the municipal Notifiable Disease Report System, including patients' age, sex, residential location, occupation, and severity classification. Exposures Nonpharmaceutical public health interventions including cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction, social distancing, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and universal symptom survey. Main Outcomes and Measures Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections (defined as the number of cases per day per million people), across age, sex, and geographic locations were calculated across 5 periods: December 8 to January 9 (no intervention), January 10 to 22 (massive human movement due to the Chinese New Year holiday), January 23 to February 1 (cordons sanitaire, traffic restriction and home quarantine), February 2 to 16 (centralized quarantine and treatment), and February 17 to March 8 (universal symptom survey). The effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 (an indicator of secondary transmission) was also calculated over the periods. Results Among 32 583 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, the median patient age was 56.7 years (range, 0-103; interquartile range, 43.4-66.8) and 16 817 (51.6%) were women. The daily confirmed case rate peaked in the third period and declined afterward across geographic regions and sex and age groups, except for children and adolescents, whose rate of confirmed cases continued to increase. The daily confirmed case rate over the whole period in local health care workers (130.5 per million people [95% CI, 123.9-137.2]) was higher than that in the general population (41.5 per million people [95% CI, 41.0-41.9]). The proportion of severe and critical cases decreased from 53.1% to 10.3% over the 5 periods. The severity risk increased with age: compared with those aged 20 to 39 years (proportion of severe and critical cases, 12.1%), elderly people (>= 80 years) had a higher risk of having severe or critical disease (proportion, 41.3%; risk ratio, 3.61 [95% CI, 3.31-3.95]) while younger people (<20 years) had a lower risk (proportion, 4.1%; risk ratio, 0.47 [95% CI, 0.31-0.70]). The effective reproduction number fluctuated above 3.0 before January 26, decreased to below 1.0 after February 6, and decreased further to less than 0.3 after March 1. Conclusions and Relevance A series of multifaceted public health interventions was temporally associated with improved control of the COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan, China. These findings may inform public health policy in other countries and regions.
   This population epidemiology study examines associations between phases of nonpharmaceutical public health interventions (social distancing, centralized quarantine, home confinement, and others) and rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection in Wuhan, China, between December 2019 and early March 2020.

AB  - Previous research indicated that negative attitudes about the body and appearance are common among men and demonstrated that negative body attitudes are associated with negative sexual experiences. The present study investigated the association between body attitudes and sexual dissatisfaction and the mediating role of body self-consciousness during physical intimacy. In a cross-sectional design, 201 Dutch men completed an online survey regarding body attitudes toward muscularity, body fat, height, and genitals, body self-consciousness during physical intimacy, and sexual dissatisfaction. Hypotheses were tested using correlation analyses and a mediation analysis with body attitudes as predictors, body self-consciousness as mediator, and sexual dissatisfaction as outcome. Correlation analyses showed that negative body attitudes and body self-consciousness during physical intimacy were significantly related to sexual dissatisfaction. The mediation analysis revealed that negative attitudes toward muscularity, body fat, and genitals had indirect effects on sexual dissatisfaction through body self-consciousness during physical intimacy. Negative attitudes toward genitals additionally had a direct effect on sexual dissatisfaction. These findings indicate that body image interventions focused on male body attitudes may be beneficial in improving men's body image, which may ultimately increase sexual satisfaction.

AB  - Aim: To study nurse managers' perceptions and experiences of staff nurse structural empowerment and its impact on the nurse manager leadership role and style.
   Background: Nurse managers' leadership roles may be viewed as challenging given the complex needs of patients and staff nurses' involvement in both clinical and organizational decision making processes in interdisciplinary care settings.
   Design: Qualitative phenomenological study.
   Methods: Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted with 8 medical or surgical nurse managers in a 600-bed Belgian university hospital between December 2013 and June 2014. This hospital was undergoing conversion from a classical hierarchical, departmental structure to a flat, interdisciplinary model.
   Results: Nurse managers were found to be familiar with the structural empowerment of clinical nurses in the hospital and to hold positive attitudes toward it. They confirmed the positive impact of empowerment on their staff nurses, as evidenced by increased responsibility, autonomy, critical reflection and enhanced communication skills that in turn improved the quality and safety of patient care. Structural empowerment was being supported by several change initiatives at both the unit and hospital levels. Nurse managers' experiences with these initiatives were mixed, however, because of the changing demands with regard to their manager role and leadership style. In addition, pressure was being experienced by both staff nurses and nurse managers as a result of direct patient care priorities, tightly scheduled projects and miscommunication.
   Conclusion: Nurse managers reported that structural empowerment was having a favorable impact on staff nurses' professional attitudes and the safety and quality of care in their units. However, they also reported that the empowerment process had led to changes in the managers' roles as well as daily practice dilemmas related to the leadership styles needed. Clear organizational goals and dedicated support for both clinical nurses and nursing unit managers are imperative to maintaining an empowering practice environment which can ensure the best care and healthy, engaged staff.

AB  - Purpose - This study aims to gain insight into factors that impact employee readiness to change and organisational change management. Therefore, an integrative research model is developed with the combination of perceived competence, perceived relatedness, perceived autonomy, codification strategy and personalization strategy to investigate employee readiness to change. The research model tests the mediating role of employee readiness to change between factors underpinned self-determination theory, knowledge management strategy and organizational change management. In addition to the moderating role of self-efficacy is examined between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation.
   Design/methodology/approach - This research is conducted under a positive paradigm, and therefore, a quantitative research approach is incorporated to design a research strategy. The research model is empirically tested with a sample size of 361 employees working in commercial banks of Pakistan. For data analysis, the structural equation modelling approach is applied.
   Findings - Empirical findings indicate that altogether perceived competence, perceived autonomy, perceived relatedness, codification and personalization strategies had explained 76.8% variance in employee readiness to change. The effect size analysis shows that codification strategy has the largest impact in determining employee readiness to change. Therefore, the relatedness of employee tasks stands at the second stage in determining employee readiness to change. The predictive relevance of the research model is computed through blindfolding procedure and revealed substantial predictive relevance in measuring employee readiness to change. The findings of the research confirmed that the relationship between employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation will be stronger when self-efficacy is higher.
   Practical implications - The current research has several contributions to theory and practice. Theoretically, this research extends the self-determination theory with knowledge management strategy and enriches literature in employee readiness to change and organizational change management context. Practically, this research suggests that policymakers should focus on factors underpinned by self-determination theory and knowledge management model to develop a positive attitude among employees towards readiness to change. Similarly, self-efficacy is another important factor that moderates the relationship between readiness to change and change implementation and should be considered for managerial implication.
   Originality/value - This research is significant as it integrates two unique models, namely, the self-determination framework and the knowledge management model to investigate employee readiness to change. In addition to that, the research model is extended with the moderating effect of self-efficacy between the relationship of employee readiness to change and organizational change implementation.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of the current study is to advance understanding of sponsorship effectiveness by investigating the impact of the quality of the relationship between a consumer and a sport property on sponsorship effectiveness.
   Design/methodology/approach - A model was developed to examine linkages among relationship quality, sincerity, attitude toward sponsor and intention to purchase a sponsor's product. The measurement model was tested using confirmatory factory analysis. The relationships in the hypothesized model were tested using simultaneous equations.
   Findings - The results indicate that positive attitude toward a sponsor and intention to purchase said sponsor's product(s) are more likely to occur among the customers who perceive a higher degree of relationship quality with the sport property and believe the sponsor motives are sincere.
   Research limitations/implications - A conceptual model of sponsorship effectiveness was developed and empirically tested. The tested model provides an expanded view of relationship quality and its impact on key variables of sponsorship effectiveness.
   Practical implications - Provided in this study is a framework for both sponsors and sport teams that can be used to understand some of the ways in which sponsorship works. The findings suggest that sponsors should leverage their activities to communicate sincere motives, not just "doing business". For the sport property, the implication is developing quality relationships with consumers, and being able to promote such relationships to prospective sponsors.
   Originality/value - Relationship quality has been previously shown to influence various behavioral aspects related to partners in business-to-business relationships. This study extends the literature by examining the effect of business-to-consumer relationship quality on the expected outcomes associated with a business-to-business relationship.

AB  - Understanding how newspapers depict fatal shootings of minority men by police, and how this affects implicit biases, may offer insight into why such shootings continue to occur. Through an analysis of national newspaper articles immediately following the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, we investigate how these events are framed regarding the use of victim-supporting, social justice frames or law enforcement-supporting, law and order frames. We then theorize how this might contribute to the perpetuation of implicit biases. We find social justice frames appear more frequently than law and order frames during this period. This shift in the presentation of information might affect the reinforcement of implicit biases that the news media is often accused of causing.

AB  - Public health responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as business restrictions, social distancing and lockdowns, had social and economic impacts on individuals and communities. Caremongering Facebook groups spread across Canada to support vulnerable individuals by providing a forum for sharing information and offering assistance. We sought to understand the specific impacts of Caremongering groups on individuals 1 year after the pandemic began. We used a convergent parallel mixed-methods approach that included semi-structured interviews with group moderators from 16 Caremongering groups and survey data from 165 group members. We used a constant comparative approach for thematic analysis of interview transcripts and open-ended text responses to the survey. We used source theme tables as joint displays to integrate interview and survey findings. Our results revealed five major themes: providing food, sharing information, supporting health and wellness, acquiring goods and services (non-food), and connecting communities. Respondents of our survey tended to be 35-65 years of age range, but reported helping adults of all ages. Our findings illustrate the potential of using a social media platform to connect with others and provide and access support. The Caremongering initiative demonstrates a community-driven, social media solution to issues such as isolation, loneliness and community health promotion.

TI  - Findings and Implications From an Evaluation of the Gold Star Campaign in Post-Ebola Guinea: The Role of Gender and Education
T2  - GLOBAL HEALTH-SCIENCE AND PRACTICE
LA  - English
KW  - OUTBREAK
AB  - In post-Ebola Guinea, the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative (HC3) project worked to rebuild trust in the health system and increase the utilization of reproductive, maternal, neonatal, and child health services. Core to HC3 Guinea was the promotion of quality local health centers through the Gold Star campaign (2016-2017). The current study aimed to determine the relationship between campaign exposure and attitudes/intentions regarding local health centers, to inform communication efforts in future epidemics. Between June-July 2017, HC3 Guinea conducted a telephone survey with men (n=1,000) and women (n=2,000) aged 18-49 years. Multivariate regression analyses estimated the association between campaign exposure and attitudinal/intention outcomes for the overall sample as well as for gender- and education-stratified samples.
   Survey results indicated that more than 30% of the sample recalled either the campaign (32.5%) or logo (37.6%). Statistically significant associations existed between exposure and various attitudinal outcomes. For example, regardless of gender/level of education, campaign recall was strongly associated with agreeing that the local health center improved in the last 6 months. Given that the campaign itself was short in duration, it is encouraging that attitudes changed with campaign exposure. Although a greater percentage of women than men held positive attitudes about health facilities, men seemed more influenced by campaign exposure.
   The current study provides evidence that mass media campaigns can help rebuild trust in health care facilities after an epidemic. Study findings also stress the value of conducting stratified analyses by important demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, education). Stratified analyses can help identify meaningful differences and better tailor health promotion activities and achieve greater success. The recent recurrence of Ebola in Guinea has resulted in renewed discussions about ways to incorporate these evaluation findings into current programming, including exploring ways to address gender considerations in message design and overall program strategy.

AB  - Objective: Disparities in U.S. breastfeeding rates persist among Black mothers according to birth country and between Black and White mothers, necessitating further investigation of modifiable mediating factors to inform interventions. This study seeks to examine the extent that social, maternal, infant factors and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) domains (attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms) mediate the association of maternal race/birth country and breastfeeding continuation.
   Methods: A national cohort of 2,050 mothers self-identifying as U.S.-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 689), foreign-born non-Hispanic Black (n = 139), and U.S.-born non-Hispanic White (n = 1,222) was analyzed. Using logistic regression, associations of race/birth country and any/exclusive breastfeeding at 2-6 months were examined. Structural equation modeling was used to determine whether social, maternal, and infant factors and TPB domains mediate these relationships.
   Results: 40.0% of U.S.-born Black, 82.2% of foreign-born Black, and 57.3% of U.S.-born White mothers reported any breastfeeding at 2-6 months. Compared with U.S.-born Black mothers, odds of any breastfeeding were sevenfold higher among foreign-born Black mothers (odds ratio [OR] = 7.04 95% confidence interval [CI] = 4.80-10.31), which was explained partly by social/maternal/infant factors and TPB domains. Compared with U.S.-born White mothers, any breastfeeding was lower (OR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.40-0.73) among U.S.-born Black mothers and higher (OR = 3.81, 95% CI = 2.48-5.87) among foreign-born Black mothers; these differences were also mediated by the aforementioned factors.
   Conclusions: Among Black mothers in the United States, breastfeeding continuation varied substantially by birth country. Promotion of interventions targeting positive attitudes, perceived control, and subjective norms may reduce disparities among Black and between Black and White mothers.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of transformational leadership (TL) on organizational commitment (OC) with the mediating role of organizational justice (OJ) in the higher education (HE) sector in Syria. Design/methodology/approach The data were collected from 502 employees from six HE institutions. Two measures of organizational outcomes were selected for this study, namely, job satisfaction (JS) and OC. Using structural equation modelling (SEM), the authors tested four alternative models to indicate the relationship between leadership and organizational outcomes. Findings TL has both direct and indirect effects on OC through interactional justice (IJ). TL has an impact on JS through procedural justice (PJ) and IJ as intermediate variables, while transactional leadership (TrL) has an impact on JS through distributive justice (DJ). The three types of OJ have an impact on OC through JS. The authors found that the national culture may not influence the impact of the leader in the current globalization context, as the results were similar to the Western studies. Practical implications - The findings of the study provide managers of the HE sector with insights into the formations of employees' fairness perceptions, and with some guidelines for managing employees by documenting OJ to draw positive attitudinal and behavioral responses from employees. Originality/value While most previous research has focused on exploring the relationship between leadership and OJ or between OJ and JS in the business sector, the study, however, seeks in addition, to pinpoint the effect of OJ as a mediate variable between the leadership and JS and OC in HE.

KW  - IMMUNIZATION
AB  - Background: More and more countries are discussing the introduction of mandatory vaccination policies. Yet, little is known about individuals' actual preferences for voluntary vs. mandatory vaccination policies, and the psychological processes underlying such preferences. Objective of the present research was to investigate the development of individual preferences for voluntary and mandatory vaccination policies. Methods: We conducted a controlled laboratory study (N = 168) using a repeated interactive vaccination game with decision-contingent monetary incentives. In each round, participants decided in favour of either a voluntary or a mandatory vaccination policy, followed by the vaccination decision (voluntary policy) or vaccination (mandatory policy) which both resulted in actual (financial) consequences. Results: We observe large heterogeneity in participants' preferences for the voluntary vs. mandatory policy. Under voluntary vaccination, the preference for the mandatory policy increased with decreasing vaccination rates (and increasing risk of infection). In contrast, experiencing vaccine-adverse events under mandatory vaccination increased the preference for the voluntary policy. The latter effect was larger for individuals with a negative (vs. positive) attitude toward vaccination. Overall, as individuals gathered experiences under both the voluntary and the mandatory policy, the preference for voluntary vaccination policy increased over time. Conclusions: Individuals are more willing to accept mandatory vaccination policies when vaccination rates are low. In the long run, the occurrence of vaccine-adverse events may spark opposition to mandatory vaccination.

AB  - BACKGROUND
   The frontline workers including nurses need to be focused in creating awareness and reducing the cultural and emotional barrier about breast screening among the female patients and community they come across. The objective of the study is to determine the knowledge and attitude regarding risk factors, symptoms and screening of breast cancer among nursing students and staff of a tertiary care centre.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS
   A cross sectional survey was conducted among 300 nursing students and staff of Dr. Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Kangra at Tanda, Himachal Pradesh in 2016. A semi-structured predesigned study tool was introduced to assess the demographic profile and knowledge and attitude regarding risk factor and symptoms pertaining to breast cancer.
   RESULTS
   The adequate knowledge about all risk factors was observed among 15.3% nurses. Around 40% of nurses had correct knowledge about ways of preventing BC and even higher proportion about techniques of early BC detection (63.3%). The age and year of practice duration did show a difference; with younger age and students being more knowledgeable but this distribution was not significant. The serious and positive attitude towards seeking medical help of BC was higher among married and higher age group nurses.
   CONCLUSION
   Along with increasing knowledge we have to strengthen emotional status of women in our country. The frontline workers can prove to be a great asset in creating community awareness.

AB  - Objective: Examining factors influencing food label use among Singapore's supermarket shoppers using the Theory of Planned Behavior.
   Design: A point-of-purchase survey among general shoppers in 2 supermarkets.
   Setting: Singapore, a country whose population is exposed to a wide range of food labeling formats because of the import-dependent nature of the food industry.
   Participants: A total of 200 shoppers (Chinese [75.5%], Malays [8.5%], and Indians [7.0%]) participated in the survey.
   Main Outcome Measures: Independent variables composed of attitudes and subjective norms (both 5-point Likert); perceived behavioral control and diet-health concern (both 5-point semantic differential); and knowledge (18-item index). Dependent variables were intention to use food labels (5-point differential scale) and actual use of food labels (19-item index).
   Analysis: Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, mean analysis, and multivariate linear regression.
   Results: Low levels of knowledge and health literacy were found. Attitudes, subjective norms, and behavioral control differed significantly by age and ethnicity. Subjective norms and diet-health concern were significant predictors of intention to use food labels.
   Conclusions and Implications: Lack of knowledge but positive attitudes toward food labels make Singapore's consumers vulnerable to misusing or being misled by food label information. Demographic differences demonstrate the need to develop targeted educational interventions and enhance awareness of and ability to use food labels.

AB  - Internal customer of hospital information system(HIS) are typically called the users. These customers using this system every day, also evaluate the quality of the system. Users' understanding of the information system is important for acceptance and evaluation of the information system. Their satisfaction of the practical aspects of the system is very essential. This study evaluated nurses' attitudes of clinical departments towards hospital information system to introduce the effect of mechanized information system in nursing care. This study was conducted in teaching hospitals affiliated with Semnan university of medical sciences in Semnan, Iran. A questionnaire was developed to measure attitudes of nurses toward the effect of HIS on nursing care. Data analysis was performed by descriptive and Inferential statistics. Results showed notwithstanding most nurses had positive attitude to the information system. But some believed that the information system has had less effect on some nursing activities. Significant relationship was observed between attitude and participation status of nurses in information system development. According to the results obtained should be noted that the main element of an information system is the user. His satisfaction affects on the growth and survival of the information system. On the other hand, It seems that the understanding of the usefulness of an information system is related to users' knowledge and awareness about Information systems.

AB  - This study assessed the effects of social media on researchers' work attitude at IITA, Ibadan, Oyo state, Nigeria. Proportionate sampling technique was used to select 82 respondents for the study through the use of questionnaire. Data collected were analysed using percentage, Chi-square and Pearson Product Moment Correlation (PPMC). Results showed that the frequently used media on a daily basis, were emails (87.7%), Facebook (76.6%) and WhatsApp (71.6%) while Skype (24.7%) and Twitter (21.0%) were used on weekly basis. Researchers used social media to source for journals (14.8%), collaborative research (38.2%) and connection with families and friends (41.9%) as well as for online dating (7.4%). Furthermore, 38.0% of the respondents accessed social media from their departmental office, personal office (29.7%) and their individual homes (13.6%). Researchers agreed that social media were essential office tools (37.0%), retarded their work (3.7%) as well as wasted their time (1.2%). Chi- square analysis showed that there was significant relationship between the usage of social media and religion (chi(2)=8.336, p <= 0.05), marital status (chi(2)=14.81, p <= 0.05) and rank/cadre of respondents (chi(2) =23.03, p <= 0.05) while PPMC analysis results showed a significant relationship between social media usage and age (R = 0.245, p=0.05) as well as work experience (R= -0.33, p <= 0.005). Social media has both positive and negative effects on researchers' attitude to work. Social media usage should be controlled during working hours to improve the positive attitude of researchers towards work at IITA.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to examine the knowledge and attitude of Indonesian community nurses regarding Pressure Injury (PI) prevention. A cross-sectional design was used and included the community nurses permanently working in the Public Health Center (Puskemas) in Bandung, West Java Indonesia. Knowledge was measured using the Pressure Ulcer Knowledge Assessment Tool (PUKAT 2.0). Attitudes were measured using a predesigned instrument which included 11 statements on a five point Likert scale. All data were collected using paper-based questionnaires. The response rate was 100%. Respondents (n = 235) consisted of 80 community nursing program coordinators (34.0%) and 155 community nurses (66.0%). Regarding knowledge, the percentage of correct answers in the total group of community nurses on the PUKAT 2.0 was 30.7%. The theme "Prevention" had the lowest percentage of correct answers (20.8%). Community nurses who had additional PI or wound care training had a higher knowledge score compared with community nurses who did not have additional PI training (33.7% vs 30.3%; Z = -1.995; P = 0.046). The median attitude score was 44 (maximum score 55; range 28-55), demonstrating a positive attitude among participants towards PI prevention. Further, the higher the education status of participants, the more positive the attitudes (H = 11.773; P = 0.003). This study shows that community nurses need to improve their basic knowledge of PI prevention. Furthermore, research should be performed to explore what community nurses need to strengthen their role in PI prevention.

AB  - Organically-certified wild plant foods are rarely addressed in scientific or public discourses on organic food even though 30% of the world's organically-certified land is dedicated to wild plant gathering. This oversight may leave organic consumers unaware of the market relevance of wild plant foods. The aim of this study was therefore to understand organic consumers' attitudes, knowledge and purchasing and gathering practices with respect to wild plant foods, and how sociodemographic variables and attitudes can predict knowledge and practices. A purposive sample was drawn from 22 urban and rural food markets across Austria and 497 organic consumers were interviewed using successive freelists and four-point Likert scale questions on attitudes. Data were analysed using exploratory factor analysis and multiple linear regressions. Organic consumers knew a median of nine wild food plants, and reported five as being gathered and one as being purchased. They valued food quality and the responsible harvest of wild food plants, but assigned them a low economic relevance, with some respondents sceptical about their suitability as food. Rural residence, a higher share of organic consumption and a greater emphasis on responsible harvesting predicted knowledge and gathering of a larger number of plant species. These results confirm that organic consumers know, gather and have positive attitudes with respect to wild plant foods, although they are hardly aware about their market relevance. We argue that consumers need to be better informed about the wild origin of food ingredients and the added value of organic certification of wild plant foods.

AB  - A 3D ultrasound image reconstruction technique, named probe sector matching (PSM), is proposed in this paper for a freehand linear array ultrasound probe equipped with multiple sensors, providing the position and attitude of the transducer and the pressure between the transducer and the target surface. The proposed PSM method includes three main steps. First, the imaging target and the working range of the probe are set to be the center and the radius of the imaging field of view, respectively. To reconstruct a 3D volume, the positions of all necessary probe sectors are pre-calculated inversely to form a sector database. Second, 2D cross-section probe sectors with the corresponding optical positioning, attitude and pressure information are collected when the ultrasound probe is moving around the imaging target. Last, an improved 3D Hough transform is used to match the plane of the current probe sector to the existing sector images in the sector database. After all pre-calculated probe sectors are acquired and matched into the 3D space defined by the sector database, a 3D ultrasound reconstruction is completed. The PSM is validated through two experiments: a virtual simulation using a numerical model and a lab experiment using a real physical model. The experimental results show that the PSM effectively reduces the errors caused by changes in the target position due to the uneven surface pressure or the inhomogeneity of the transmission media. We conclude that the PSM proposed in this study may help to design a lightweight, inexpensive and flexible ultrasound device with accurate 3D imaging capacity.

AB  - Young adulthood is a major and significant stage in life encompassing various life transitions which may increase the risk of developing emotional crises. Receiving mental health treatment and turning to nonprofessional resources for support can ease such emotional burdens. However, many of those in need of such help do not turn to professional services and, rather, tend to rely on themselves. The aim of this study was to examine the contribution of attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma, anticipated risk, anticipated utility, and social support to the intention to seek professional and nonprofessional emotional help among Jewish young adults in Israel. Participants included 282 Jewish Israeli young adults aged 18-30, recruited in person or online. They filled out a self-report questionnaire, between March and June 2017, regarding intention to seek professional and non-professional emotional help, attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help, self-stigma towards seeking professional emotional help, anticipated risk and anticipated utility of self-disclosure when seeking professional help, perceived social support and sociodemographic questions. A path analysis model was used to analyse the data. Intention to seek professional help was positively associated with positive attitudes towards seeking professional emotional help and anticipated utility and negatively with self-stigma and social support. Intention to seek nonprofessional help was positively associated with anticipated utility and social support and negatively with anticipated risk. In addition, indirect effects were found between religious affiliation and previous mental health treatment, and intention to seek professional help, through the mediating effects of attitudes and anticipated utility. Interventions for increasing intention to seek professional and nonprofessional support are important and should include reference to attitudes, anticipated utility, anticipated risk and self-stigma, and should promote mutual support and highlight the importance of support from close ones. In addition, a model for predicting intention to seek non-professional help should be developed.

AB  - Objectives: Critical illness can have a significant psychological impact on patients and their families. To inform the design of a larger trial, we assessed feasibility of ICU diaries and psychoeducation to prevent posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety following ICU stays.
   Design: Four-arm pilot randomized controlled trial.
   Setting: A 10-bed tertiary ICU in Winnipeg, MB, Canada.
   Patients: Critically ill patients greater than 17 years old with predicted ICU stays greater than 72 hours and mechanical ventilation duration greater than 24 hours.
   Interventions: Patients were randomized to usual care, ICU diary, psychoeducation, or both ICU diary and psychoeducation.
   Measurements and Main Results: Our primary objective was to determine feasibility measured by enrollment/mo. Secondary outcomes included acceptability of the ICU diary intervention and psychological distress, including patients' memories 1 week post ICU using the ICU Memory Tool, posttraumatic stress disorder (Impact of Events Scale-Revised), depression, and anxiety symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) 30 and 90 days post ICU. Over 3.5 years, we enrolled 58 patients, an average of 1.9 participants/mo. Families and healthcare providers wrote a mean of 3.2 diary entries/d (sd, 2.9) and indicated positive attitudes and low perceived burden toward ICU diary participation. A majority of patients reported distressing memories of their ICU stay. Those who received the diary intervention had significantly lower median Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety (3.0 [interquartile range, 2-6.25] vs 8.0 [interquartile range, 7-10]; p = 0.01) and depression (3.0 [interquartile range, 1.75-5.25] vs 5.0 [interquartile range, 4-9]; p = 0.04) symptom scores at 90 days than patients who did not receive a diary.
   Conclusions: ICU diaries are a feasible intervention in a tertiary Canadian ICU context. Preliminary evidence supports the efficacy of ICU diaries to reduce psychological morbidity following discharge.

AB  - Background. Although transplantation has gained more support and acceptance, there are still many ethical, moral, and legal barriers associated with this form of treatment. The demand for organs is higher than what can be accommodated. Current medical students are forming their views about transplantation.
   Methods. The aim of this study was to investigate the perspectives of 569 students from the Faculty of Medicine, Medical University of Bialystok, Poland, with regard to their beliefs about organ donation.
   Results. Respondents included in this study were 21.77 +/- 2.03 years of age (73.6% female, 80.1% living in an urban setting). Organ procurement and transplantation from living donors was found to be acceptable by 97.54% of respondents, and 98.77% found deceased donor procurement to be acceptable. More than 90% of respondents agreed with organ donation from family members after death, and agreed to donation after their own death. However, only 54.77% indicated an agreement to donate in their lifetime for nonrelatives. It was found that 70.74% believe the final decision on cadaveric organ donation should be made by the family. A positive attitude toward organ transplantation was expressed by 96.47% of respondents, but 2% submitted an objection to placement on a central registry. Refusals for organ donation included emotions associated with death (88%), religious beliefs (42%), and lack of knowledge of medical terminology (24.78%). According to respondents, the concept of transplantation should be managed by patients and donors (65.38%), universities (49.56%), or the media (44.64%).
   Conclusion. Medical students generally agree on procurement of organs from deceased and living donors. However, their enthusiasm for organ donation after death diminished with regard to their family members. An educational campaign promoting organ transplantation should be considered.

KW  - PHYSICIANS
AB  - Background. Unless effective tobacco control is in place, most tobacco-related deaths in the coming decades are likely to be seen in low- and middle-income countries. Tobacco surveillance among medical students offers an opportunity to assess the preparedness for tobacco control among future healthcare professionals in India.
   Methods. We did a cross-sectional survey in two cities (Bangalore and Coimbatore) of India. The participants were third year undergraduate students from 7 medical colleges and 6 nursing colleges. A self-administered questionnaire was used to elicit information on tobacco use, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, knowledge on disease burden and attitudes towards tobacco control.
   Results. Overall, 829 of 985 eligible students (84.1%) participated in the survey. About 14.5% (95% CI 12.0-17.0) of students had ever used tobacco. Current tobacco use was reported by 1.6% (95% CI 0.8-2.4) of students; 1.5% (95% CI 0.7-2.3) were current smokers and 0.4% (95% CI 0.1-0.7) were current chewers. The rates of smoking among male medical, female medical and female nursing students were 4.0%, 0.3% and 0%, respectively (p < 0.001). About 1 in 6 students reported frequent exposure to environmental tobacco smoke within their homes and over 1 in 4 reported frequent exposure outside the home environment. Median knowledge score on tobacco-related burden was 5/10. More than 80% favoured ban on tobacco sales to adolescents, tobacco advertising and tobacco use in public places. Over 90% reported interest in further training in tobacco control.
   Conclusion. This scenario of comparatively low levels of tobacco use, positive attitudes towards tobacco control and suboptimal levels of knowledge coupled with a high interest in having further knowledge on tobacco control points to the need for a comprehensive curriculum for training in tobacco control that meets national requirements.

AB  - Background: Mental health disorders have identified as being one of the public health issues throughout the world. Recent evidence reveals that more than 21 million people diagnosed with schizophrenia. However, there is little information about community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia in Ethiopia.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the community perception and attitude towards people with Schizophrenia among residents of Arba Minch Zuria Districts, Southern Ethiopia.
   Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly selected adults. Interviewer-administered standard tool was used to collect the data. Descriptive statistics like frequency, mean, and median computed. A binary logistic regression model used to identify factors affecting community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia.
   Results: Of the study population, 469 (76%) of respondents had good perception and 390 (63.2%) had positive attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. The study participants identified talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors as the most common manifestations of schizophrenia. Besides, this study identified substance misuse and head injury as the perceived cause and spiritual or traditional methods as a preferred treatment for people with schizophrenia. Moreover, the study participants preferred spiritual or traditional methods for the treatment of schizophrenia. Young age [AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.21, 3.40], females [AOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.58, 3.41], good perception towards people with schizophrenia [AOR=4.95, 95% CI: 3.25, 7.54] and no formal educational status [AOR=2.75, 95% CI: 1.33, 5.70], and primary education [AOR=3.72, 95% CI: 1.87, 7.39] were significantly associated with the attitude towards people with schizophrenia.
   Conclusion: The findings of this study indicate that approximately one-third of the residents had unfavorable attitudes towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to male, elders and those who were educated, and individuals who have poor perceptions of people with schizophrenia is crucial.

AB  - This paper explores individuals' motives for using social media when living under 'social distancing' conditions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, where they were instructed to physically distance from other people. Adopting a 'uses and gratifications' approach, and using a previously established five-factor scale, we examine the relationship between individuals' motives for using social media and their personality traits. Hundred and eighty-nine social media users living in the United Kingdom completed surveys assessing their motives for using social media and their personality. Our findings demonstrate that participants were generally motivated to use social media to 'pass time' and to 'maintain relationships.' Further, we find that those high in extraversion in particular use social media to 'maintain relationships.' By comparing our findings to previous studies where face-to-face interaction was not restricted, our findings indicate that individuals' motives for using social media change when they are placed under physical distancing restrictions. We reflect on the potential application of our findings for others experiencing similar conditions, such as those working in remote locations, as well as the potential implications for living in a post-pandemic world with increased virtual 'meetings' using social media.

AB  - Dominating headlines in the last few months, global attention has been fixed on the coronavirus pandemic given its rampaging impact on social events and human affairs. More than any other groups, older adults have been disproportionately affected by the deadly contagion. This situation poses legitimate concerns to the social work profession, whose mandate is to liberate vulnerable people and promote social development. Although the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to take a devastating toll on older adults in the short-term, its long-term consequences may be far more profound unless urgent attention is directed to mitigate this situation. Given the promulgation of social distancing and shutdowns among a number of African countries, many social workers have found it increasingly difficult to address the difficulties faced by older adults. This article canvasses for the utilization of the mass media in initiating policy response to the challenges of older adults throughout the continent.

AB  - In 1992, when vice president of the United States Dan Quayle lashed out against fictional television personality Murphy Brown for glamorizing single motherhood and mocking the importance of fathers, many observers found the public dialogue surrounding this incident absurd. After all, Quayle was criticizing the actions of a fictional character in a weekly sitcom, not a real person (see, e.g., "Dan Quayle," 1992). Likewise, in 2005 when a vice president of the National District Attorneys Association railed against the drama In Justice on the editorial pages of the New York Times, he was complaining about a fictional television drama, not about events that had actually happened (Marquis, 2006). Political leaders and the general public often express concerns about the influence of fictional programming on public attitudes toward real-world political issues (Montgomery, 1990). Nonetheless, purely dramatic fictional television has been largely ignored by scholars interested in the political impact of mass media; studies of media and politics focus almost exclusively on news and public affairs programming.
   There is a variety of explanations for what might be considered an oversight, but foremost among them is an assumption that fiction is processed differently from nonfictional content. In other words, people store information about the world that is implied by fictional programming in a way that compartmentalizes it from information about the world that comes from nonfiction sources (see a critical discussion of explanations that suggest a "toggle" between fiction and nonfiction, in Gerrig, 1993, pp. 201-207). When forming political attitudes, viewers presumably discount what is known to be dramatic fiction and rely strictly on information about the real world, using only the latter in forming perceptions and policy preferences.
   Although this assumption seems plausible at one level, scholars also pointed out a contrary expectation. People "often search for the real-world point" of works of fiction (Gerrig, 1993, p. 201), and spontaneously draw on television imagery and fictional television characters in conversations about current events (Delli Carpini & Williams, 1994, 1996). There are other theoretical arguments predicting that fictional television content should have as much, if not more, influence on the formation of political preferences as nonfiction television. The sheer amount of fictional content viewers consume makes it a likely source of information that affects political and social views. Americans spend more than one third of their free time each week watching television-much more than they spend socializing, reading, or participating in religious activities (Robinson & Godbey, 1999, chap. 9). What is less often noted is that the time is overwhelmingly spent watching entertainment programming: sitcoms, game shows, reality shows, and dramas, but not the evening news, political talk shows, or public affairs programming (Nielsen Media Research, 2008). Although we do not address the relative amounts of influence from these kinds of content in this study, we ask whether fictional content can have consequences for politically relevant attitudes and beliefs. Does it matter what kinds of fictional content Americans watch regularly on television? Or does such content function purely as a diversionary enjoyment, without any consequences?

AB  - This study aims to examine how covid-19 affect consumer behaviors within gastronomy tourism and the mediating role of destination satisfaction in this relationship. The research data was collected from 812 con -sumers through questionnaires. The collected data was analyzed through IBM SPSS 25 (Hayes, 2009) and PROCESS v3.4 macro. The study found that the perception of gastronomy tourism has a positive and significant effect on destination satisfaction and consumer behavior and that destination satisfaction has a positive and significant effect on consumer behavior. It was also found that destination satisfaction has a partial mediating role between the perception of gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior. Due to social distancing, the pandemic has greatly affected the interest in gastronomy tourism. The fact that people avoid eating in crowded places has led to a decrease in the interest in gastronomy tourism. As destination satisfaction has a mediating effect between gastronomy tourism and consumer behavior, more emphasis should be put on destination satisfaction in the field of gastronomy tourism. This study answers the critical question of how gastronomy tourism affects consumer behavior and reveals the role of destination satisfaction in this relationship.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to investigate occurrences of confirmation bias existing for sponsors whose brand is congruent to a sport. More specifically, this research investigates: if confirmation biases for congruent brands occur in the absence of exposure, the impact audience segmentation has on sponsorship evaluations by comparing highly identified fans to non-fans, and if congruent sponsors are recalled more often than incongruent sponsors after exposure.
   Design/methodology/approach - An experiment was conducted to measure how exposure, type of sponsor, and fan identification impacts recognition, attitude, and purchase intention.
   Findings - The results confirm sport-congruent brands are more likely to be falsely recognized as a sponsor than non-congruent sponsors in the absence of sponsorship participation. Sport consumers' confirmation biases yield positive attitudes and purchase intentions for congruent brands even in the absence of immediate exposure. Lastly, exposure has no impact on recall or sponsor outcomes, suggesting the need for articulating the brand's connection prior to the event to build stronger memory traces.
   Practical implications - Congruent brands should carefully consider investment costs and expected return on investment, noting benefits of participation might be marginal as a result of confirmation biases. Potential sponsors should also understand cognitive benefits begin before exposure to the sponsorship occurs, and therefore need to articulate a connection to the event prior to exposure by consumers.
   Originality/value - The findings suggest the importance of confirmation biases when attempting to reach sport consumers. Some brands may be able to increase recall and recognition even in the absence of exposure, thus helping decision makers when managing budgets.

AB  - Background The impact of social media, with its speed, reach and accessibility, in interventions aimed to improve adherence to guidelines such as assessment of Pain, Agitation/Sedation and Delirium (PAD) in intensive care is not described. Therefore, the primary objective of this quality improvement study was to evaluate the impact of a multifaceted intervention including audit and feedback of quality indicators (QI) via Facebook-groups, educational events and engagement of opinion leaders on adherence to PAD-guidelines in four ICUs. Methods A quasi-experimental interrupted time series study with eight monthly data points in the two phases Before and Intervention was designed. Proportion of nursing shifts with documented PAD-assessment (PAD-QIs) were retrieved from the electronical medical chart from included adult ICU patient-stays in four participating ICUs. Difference between the two time periods was assessed using generalised mixed model for repeated measures with unstructured covariance matrix, and presented as Beta (B) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Results Finally, 1049 ICU patient-stays were analysed; 534 in Before and 515 in Intervention. All three PAD-QIs significantly increased in Intervention by 31% (B = 30.7, 95%CI [25.7 to 35.8]), 26% (B = 25.8, 95%CI [19.4 to 32.2]) and 34% (B = 33.9, 95%CI [28.4 to 39.4]) in pain, agitation/sedation and delirium, respectively. Conclusion A multifaceted intervention including use of Facebook-groups was associated with improved guideline-adherence in four ICUs, as measured with process PAD-QIs of PAD assessment. Further research on use of social media to improve guideline adherence is warranted, particularly as social distancing impacts clinical education and training and new approaches are needed.

AB  - Background: Despite the advanced development of evidence-based psychological treatment services, help-seeking persons with mental health problems often fail to receive appropriate professional help. Internet-delivered psychotherapy has thus been suggested as an efficient strategy to overcome barriers to access mental health care on a large scale. However, previous research indicated poor public acceptability as an issue for the dissemination of Internet-delivered therapies. Currently, little is known about the expectations and attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies in the general population. This is especially the case for countries such as Germany where electronic mental health (e-mental health) treatment services are planned to be implemented in routine care.
   Objective: This pilot study aimed to determine the expectations and attitudes toward Internet-based psychotherapy in the general population in Germany. Furthermore, it aimed to explore the associations between attitudes toward Internet-based therapies and perceived stress.
   Methods: To assess public attitudes toward Internet-based psychotherapy, we conducted both Web-based and paper-and-pencil surveys using a self-developed 14-item questionnaire (Cronbach alpha=.89). Psychological distress was measured by employing a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the 20-item German version of the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ). In addition, we conducted explorative factor analysis (principal axis factor analysis with promax rotation). Spearman's rank correlations were used to determine the associations between attitudes toward Internet-based therapies and perceived stress.
   Results: Descriptive analyses revealed that most respondents (N=1558; female: 78.95%, 1230/1558) indicated being not aware of the existence of Internet-delivered therapies (83.46%, 1141/1367). The average age was 32 years (standard deviation, SD 10.9; range 16-76). Through exploratory factor analysis, we identified 3 dimensions of public attitudes toward Internet-based therapies, which we labeled "usefulness or helpfulness," "relative advantage or comparability," and "accessibility or access to health care." Analyses revealed negative views about Internet-based therapies on most domains, such as perceived helpfulness. The study findings further indicated ambivalent attitudes: Although most respondents agreed to statements on expected improvements in health care (eg, expanded access), we observed low intentions to future use of Internet-delivered therapies in case of mental health problems.
   Conclusions: This pilot study showed deficient "e-awareness" and rather negative or ambivalent attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies in the German-speaking general population. However, research targeting determinants of the large-scale adoption of Internet-based psychotherapy is still in its infancy. Thus, further research is required to explore the "black box" of public attitudes toward Internet-delivered therapies with representative samples, validated measures, and longitudinal survey designs.

AB  - Background: Depression is a common mental disorder that is widely seen among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. While it is well known that both positive emtions in adolescents wiotions and social support can have a positive impact by helping individuals to maintain a positive attitude, the correlation between positive emotions, social support, and depression among these adolescents remains to be investigated. This study examined the mediator effects of positive emotions on the relationship between social support and depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction.
   Subjects and methods: For this study, conducted in 2016, we selected 1,346 adolescent students from three middle schools (ranging from Junior Grade One to Senior Grade Three) in Hunan Province of China, to participate in the survey. Participants were selected using the stratified cluster random sampling method, and all participants remained anonymous throughout the study. Each participant completed the Self-made General Situation Questionnaire, the Social Support Rating Scale, the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule, the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale, and the Mobile Phone Addiction Tendency Scale.
   Results: There was significant positive correlation between positive emotions and social support. Both positive emotions and social support demonstrated significant negative correlation with depression. Positive emotions had partial mediator effects on the relationship between social support and depression (P<0.01).
   Conclusions: Both social support and positive emotions can lower levels of depression among adolescents suffering from mobile phone addiction. Social support contributes to positive emoth mobile phone addiction, thereby reducing their levels of depression. These findings suggest that more support and care should be given to this particular adolescent population.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic caused major societal changes worldwide, with the most notable being lockdowns and restrictions on social contact. We conducted a longitudinal study (total n = 1907) in Germany with two time points to (1) identify demographic risk factors of impaired social contact during the pandemic, as well as investigate potential consequences of (2) impaired social contact and (3) different modes of communication on individuals' well-being during the first lockdown in spring 2020. Results indicate that particularly individuals living alone and being unable to work reported a lower frequency of (face-to-face) contact in comparison with participants living with others or working. Impaired social contact was indirectly associated with a negative development in well-being (life satisfaction, anxiety and depression) over time, and this relation was mediated via relatedness. Moreover, the frequency of face-to-face and phone communication during lockdown was positively associated with relatedness and well-being; however, digital communication was not. The findings stress the importance of maintaining social contact in times of social distancing and of fostering reconnection between individuals once the pandemic is over.

AB  - Maintaining high-quality care for urological patients is a challenge during and after the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. We observe an increasing volume of postponed elective visits at our tertiary care hospital, holding the risk for deterioration of non-emergency disease conditions. As it is unclear for how long the pandemic will last, we propose to implement telehealth as a solution to provide regular symptom monitoring compatible with social distancing guidelines during the pandemic and beyond. Telemedical assessment and prioritizing of high-risk patients for individual consults at outpatient services will have to be aligned with available outpatient capacity and local outbreak severity.

AB  - Identity fusion with the community has been previously found to mediate altruism in post-disaster settings. However, whether this altruistic response is specifically triggered by ingroup threat, or whether it can also be triggered by global threats remains unclear. We evaluated willingness to sacrifice in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic across three survey waves. Against expectations, participants fused with the nation (vs. non-fused) did not differentially respond to a national versus global threat condition. Conversely, social norms decisively influenced willingness to sacrifice in this sample, with fused individuals with stronger norms about social distancing reporting the highest altruistic response during the first weeks of the pandemic. Longitudinally, after an initial peak in the altruistic response, deteriorating social norms mediated decreases in willingness to sacrifice in individuals fused with the nation (vs. non-fused). Implications of these results for the development of interventions aimed to address global challenges are discussed.

AB  - In this essay I intend to tell a story of media studies and mass communication research as a field, based on the work of the late Denis McQuail - and that of editing the new edition of his seminal handbook McQuail's Media and Mass Communication Theory (McQuail & Deuze, 2020). Using McQuail's historical storytelling method, I specifically look at the challenge for the field in the context of a global pandemic alongside an infodemic, at a time when the whole world faces the consequences of recurrent lockdowns, social distancing measures, and institutional pressures to stay at home. Media studies and (mass) communication research, while having a distinct narrative, as a field has only just begun to articulate its relevance to society - we have only just started to tell our story. Using developments in understanding the self as a research tool, the implementation of integrative research designs, and calls for engaged and public scholarship, the paper outlines challenges and opportunities for what we can do with our field.

AB  - During 2015, New South Wales (N.S.W), Australia experienced an unprecedented spike in human-shark interactions. These interactions saw the escalation of public anxieties surrounding water safety and the implementation of the state's $16 m Shark Management Strategy. Of the 14 human-shark interactions that occurred in N.S.W, eight were recorded on the state's North Coast. The interactions ignited considerable public debate, which sought to explain the spike in interactions and how to best manage the risk of human-shark interaction. This controversy was documented by the media. This study takes its lead from McCagh et. al (2015) to examine the media's reporting of public and political response to human-shark interactions in N.S.W. Discourse analysis was used to investigate two newspaper's reportage of human-shark interactions on the North Coast. This paper outlines that the discourse used by the media examined was not fear-laden, sensationalized or emotive, which previous studies have emphasized. It highlights the importance of investigating local media as means of investigating public and political response to environmental issues. The W.A shark cull seems to be a turning point in public and political attitudes towards shark management. The N.S.W government did not offer lethal or seemingly knee-jerk policy, but insisted on the investigation of non-lethal, scientifically and conservationally focused management. The N.S.W government appeared to be successful in consulting the local community and delivering policy that reflects the values and interests of the North Coast public. Our research reflects Neff & Wynter's (2018a) suggestion that the 'save the sharks' movement has indeed arrived.

AB  - Purpose
   Purpose of this study is to investigate the role of learner readiness in enhancing transfer of training by empirically testing a moderated mediation mechanism in which learner readiness influences transfer through motivation to transfer, and this indirect impact is moderated by supervisor support.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The perception of trainees about the constructs considered has been captured through a survey of 250 employees of a unit of a manufacturing organization in India. For hypotheses testing, PROCESS macro developed by Hayes (2013) has been used.
   Findings
   Results have confirmed the significant role played by learner readiness in predicting transfer. This apart, supervisor support has been proved to moderate the indirect impact of learner readiness on transfer.
   Practical implications
   Trainees need to have pre-requisite knowledge to learn the content of a training programme, which would enable them to grasp such content and transfer the same subsequently to work. It is also essential that trainees are willing to attend any training voluntarily. Specific interventions may be designed for supervisors to bolster their catalytic role in training transfer.
   Originality/value
   An interactionist approach has been adopted by focussing on learner readiness as a less-studied trainee characteristic and supervisor support as a situational factor of transfer. This is construed as a significant contribution of this study to training literature. The potential overlap between learner readiness and motivation to transfer as trainee characteristics is seen to be neutralized by the presence of supervisor support as a moderator. Findings help in understanding how a trainee's readiness and motivation, together with supervisor's positive attitude, can enhance transfer.

AB  - Although language attitudes are frequently investigated, how these attitudes change over time is studied less frequently, despite providing an interesting window into the link between attitudes and ideologies. Conducted some twenty years since the first studies on this topic, the current study provides an updated perspective into language attitudes toward the use of Roman-alphabeted Greek (henceforth, Greeklish) in emails and SMS messages exchanged between Greek native speakers. Adapting the matched guise methodology commonly used in language attitude research to visual stimuli, we collected data from 6o participants of different ages and genders. Overall, their attitudes toward Greeklish were markedly negative, confirming negative attitudes already expressed twenty years prior but also extending them. We propose that technological and demographic but also ideological factors underlie the negative attitudes toward Greeklish expressed by Greek native speakers today.

AB  - Many people had to stay at home with their families during the pandemic because of social distancing guidelines and lockdowns. This study aims to explore the content of 'sharenting' of parents during the early COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine periods in Turkey. In total, 401 posts were collected from public Instagram accounts of parents who shared their own children's photos or videos between 18th30th April 2020, via the most commonly used hashtags of #korona (#corona) and #evdekal (# stayhome). Descriptive content analysis was conducted within identified categories. Results revealed that the popular hashtag #stayathome is particularly important for its optimistic representation of the lockdown process in society. Content analysis results show that with the inclusion of social media shares, family members spent more time together, which can be seen as one of the positive consequences of this period. In the results of continued sharenting during the early pandemic, children's faces were mainly kept visible, which might concern children's privacy. Additionally, mothers shared more during this period. Consequently, education to increase awareness of such concepts gains importance, especially for the well-being and privacy of children and any future implications.

AB  - The lack of knowledge of current public attitudes towards basic research into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a serious problem when considering appropriate ways of governance regarding research and its clinical applications. We therefore conducted an internet-based survey to determine public opinion regarding the research and development of iPSCs and regenerative medicine (RM). A total of 14,908 valid responses were collected, which revealed that the Japanese public were familiar with the terms iPSCs and RM, and many of them had received information about iPSCs and RM through the television and newspapers. They also generally accepted the need for extra funding for research into iPSCs, but also decided to adopt a "wait and see" approach and thought that research and development of iPSCs and RM should be conducted under proper governance in accordance with an international regulatory framework. It will be necessary to discuss an internationally consistent regulatory system and effective mechanisms for information flow.

AB  - Given the profound role that media play in public opinion, there exists an ongoing necessity to understand the portrayal of mental illness by journalists. There is a plethora of studies that have examined how mental illness is portrayed in the media, but few studies have sought to understand what journalist opinions about mental illness are, and none could be found regarding journalism students' opinions. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining journalism student's attitudes towards mental illness using the Social Distance Scale (SDS). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate journalism students (n = 172) completed the SDS with findings suggesting that students had moderate stigmatizing attitudes, with varying degrees of stigma present depending on the social context. Positively framed reporting and constructive media coverage surrounding mental illness may be improved by shared communication and education with health professionals who specialize in mental health: mental health nurses.

AB  - This study examined core belief violation and meaning making as mechanisms mediating the relationship between adherence to social isolation policies for mitigating coronavirus transmission and reduced coronavirus anxiety (CA). Adherence to social isolation policies (social distancing, sheltering in place, and cessation of long-distance travel), use of nonsocial precautionary measures (handwashing, wearing a mask), core belief violation, meaning made of the COVID pandemic, and CA were assessed in a sample of 408 North Americans. Process analysis revealed that adhering to social isolation policies predicted lower levels of CA and that this effect was largely mediated by conservation of core beliefs (e.g., in predictability, control, and self-agency) and ability to make meaning of the pandemic. In contrast, exclusive reliance on nonsocial protections such as handwashing and mask wearing was associated with high levels of CA. These results suggest that social isolation policies support the integrity of adherents' meaning systems, thereby mitigating distress, which carries useful implications for both policy and psychological intervention.

AB  - Vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 is postulated as the most effective measure to control the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the use of other protection measures is necessary to efficiently combat the spread of the virus. The aim of the present study was to determine the attitudes and intentions toward COVID-19 vaccination among non-regular social media users in Spain and to analyze how these factors could condition the acceptance of other personal protective measures once an individual has received the COVID-19 vaccine. A cross-sectional design was used in this work. In total, 719 subjects, >= 18 years old and of both sexes, were recruited from primary public healthcare centers to self-complete a questionnaire between March and April 2021. The majority of participants had a positive attitude toward vaccination and showed high levels of intention to be vaccinated. Likewise, except those participants who considered the vaccine to be the most effective measure to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the rest of the participants highlighted the importance of continuing to limit social interactions and/or wearing masks even after being vaccinated. Since vaccination can create a perception of total immunity against SARS-CoV-2, it is necessary that healthcare staff organize effective awareness campaigns on the importance of maintaining personal protective measures until vaccination coverage is greater.

AB  - This research examines the implications of COVID-19 on the relationship between organisational learning and operational performance in service organisations. By using social learning theory and transactive memory system theory, we developed competing hypotheses on how organisational learning and COVID-19 outbreak interact with each other to explain 10 their impact on operational performance. To test our hypotheses, we surveyed 106 employees of service organisations who have been remotely working during COVID-19 outbreak. The collected data were analysed through multivariate data techniques. We specifically measured operational performance to assess the organisation's performance as they were the ones immediately affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, which then is expected to have a lagged 15 impact on financial performance. Through exploratory factor analysis, we identified two bundles of COVID-19 work implications, namely home office work environment and social distancing. Results confirmed that home office work environment positively mediates the relationship between organisational learning and operational performance of service organisations. Our research adds to theory, since we evidenced that individuals' behaviours and work environment reciprocally influence each other, even when individuals are actually apart from the usual work environment, asobserved during the pandemic.

TI  - Let food be the medicine, but not for coronavirus: Nutrition and food science, telling myths from facts
T2  - JOURNAL OF POPULATION THERAPEUTICS AND CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
LA  - English
AB  - The entire globe is facing a dangerous pandemic due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The medical and scientific community is trying to figure out and adopt effective strategies that can lead to (i) preventing virus expansion; (ii) identifying medications for the management of critical care and reducing rates of mortality; and (iii) finally discovering the highly anticipated vaccine. Nutritional interventions have attained considerable scientific evidence in disease prevention and treatment. The main question, "What is the role of nutrition and food science in this scenario?" requires urgent answer as many theories suggesting that specific food or dietary supplements can fight coronavirus infection have received extensive coverage in most popular social media platforms. In this editorial, we focus on some frequent statements on the role of nutrition and food science in the battle against COVID-19, distinguishing between myths and facts. We highlight that social distancing and hygiene precautions are the best practices for reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We further underline the importance of nutrition in its wholistic concept, pointing out the risk of unproven dietary options that could lead individuals to weaken effective precautionary measures.

AB  - This article studies the stereotypes of co-ethnic versus other-ethnic foreign immigrant groups based on the stereotype content model. An online survey (N = 424) was conducted to examine Singaporean citizens' perceptions of two prominent migrant groups (co-ethnic Chinese nationals and other-ethnic Caucasians) and the influence of social media on stereotype formation. Results showed that status is associated with competence for both groups, while competition was related to warmth only for Chinese nationals. The cross-constructs of status warmth were found for co-ethnic immigrants only, and a competition-competence correlation was found for other-ethnic. Chinese nationals were perceived as moderate regarding competence and warmth, indicating that being co-ethnic immigrants may not result in in-group inclusivity. Caucasians were viewed as an in-group with high competence and warmth. Social media consumption and heterogeneous discussion were significantly associated with stereotypes for co-ethnic immigrants. For other-ethnic immigrants, social media consumption was associated with competence. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

AB  - This article addresses how mainstream media are conceptualised as a site for mediated recognition in the city of Sydney, Australia. Utilising the notion of political listening, the analysis investigates how participants position certain media outlets as misrecognising the value of diverse voices. Through in-depth interviews, the article explores how audiences discuss perceived issues of significance to society in their recall of news coverage spanning politics, migration, international conflict and local crime. First, the article clarifies how participants construct specific racialised notions of Otherness by situating their use of mainstream media discourses in the context of their everyday communicative interactions. Second, it examines how racialised frameworks are mobilised by participants to evaluate certain news media as spaces of exclusion. This article posits that the participants' discussions of these media spaces as being integral in fostering inclusion endows the media outlets with a capacity for enhancing everyday mechanisms of mediated recognition.

AB  - Background: The measurement of nurse perception on safety, and the factors associated to safety climate, direct the development of effective strategies in reducing adverse events, and patient safety improvement.
   Design and Method: This research was quantified, using the teamwork and safety climate domains of an Indonesian translated version of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ-INA). The teamwork and safety climate domain scores were calculated, using the published SAQ-INA scoring algorithm. The univariate and multivariate median regression models were performed to examine the association between potential predictors and safety climate.
   Result: The results showed that 279 nurses responded to the survey (82% response rate). While most of them had a positive attitude towards teamwork (n=170, 61%), fewer possessed the same mentality towards safety climate (n=109, 39%). The lowest level of teamwork was perceived by nurses working in the emergency department (median 71, interquartile range 12.5), and safety climate (median 64, interquartile range 14.2). Furthermore, those that worked in the private hospitals, also reported lower levels of safety climate, compared to nurses in the public health centres (median difference=-3.571, p=0.009).
   Conclusion: Ward and hospital type were associated with the level of safety climate, perceived by nurses. Understanding the key areas, the intervention is best directed to target hospital wards with poor safety climate, in a bid to reduce adverse events, and improve patient safety.

AB  - This study takes place from the idea that the personal usage of mobile technologies can bring positive outcomes to the user and to their society in an indirect way. Technologies studied in this work are defined as persuasive technologies (Fogg, 1997) because they are intentionally designed to modify the users' attitude or behavior. This research is aimed to evaluate if the intention to use the application can be influenced by positive attitudes toward technology, by the persuasive power of the application and by the perceived fun. Participants (N = 118; M = 55; F = 63; mean age = 27.4; range age = 1569) filled in an online questionnaire that was partly based on the Media and Technology Usage and Attitude Scale (MTUAS - Rosen et al., 2013). An additional eight items were added to the scale, aimed at evaluating participants' technophobia, technophilia, perceived technology pervasiveness and perceived persuasive power of technology. By using linear regression analysis, it was found that the application's informational power and the perceived entertainment positively influenced the usage intention. Another interesting result, obtained through ANOVA, concerns a generational difference: baby boomers tended to trust more the fact that the single individual action through the application can have an effective impact on the environment. These results represent a basis for future in-depth investigations about socially relevant use of the ICT.

AB  - Several factors affect the use of maternal health care services in developing countries. The aim was to describe the knowledge and attitudes of women in a rural area of the Moroccan High Atlas regarding aspects of maternal health, and to identify the determinants of use of maternal health care services. A cross-sectional study of 87 participants was conducted in a mountainous area near Marrakech utilizing two sampling methods (a door-to-door approach, and a mobile health caravan). Fisher test was used to compare two proportions, and the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test to compare two means (p value was 0.05). Median participants' age was 24 years old [15-60]. Findings indicated that husband's education (p=0.005), woman's age (p=0.011), awareness of warning signs during pregnancy (p=0.01) and use of health center for other purposes other than pregnancy (p=0.007) were important influencing factors for use of prenatal consultation services. Factors that influenced supervised birth outcomes were the age of the woman (p=0.013), her education (p=0.027) and a positive attitude towards monitoring her pregnancy by a health professional (p=0.006). To improve utilization rates for maternal health services, these factors must be considered when designing interventions that aim to improve the quality of these services in the community.

AB  - In order to explore the impact of potential new technologies in the area of prenatal screening, we conducted a baseline study using qualitative interviews to explore women's attitudes and knowledge regarding current and future prenatal screening technology and methods. Three cohorts were interviewed, including healthy women without children, healthy women with healthy children, and healthy women with children who have de novo genetic disorders. This study aimed to assess the baseline understanding and attitudes of women in Western Australia. Women from each cohort demonstrated adequate knowledge of the differences between screening and diagnostic tests, but were mostly unaware of the conditions for which screening is currently available except Down syndrome. Women who had children with de novo genetic conditions were generally aware of more genetic conditions than women with or without healthy children. Most women recognised the genetic basis for the conditions mentioned. Two thirds of women understood that Down syndrome is a chromosomal condition; just one third recognised that the phenotype is variable. Most women expressed a positive attitude towards Down syndrome. Social acceptance of children with Down syndrome was commonly mentioned as a concern. While the majority of women with children supported screening for Down syndrome, they emphasised that it must be an autonomous choice. General knowledge of genetic conditions illustrated that women are exposed to diverse conditions from lived experience as well as the media.

AB  - BackgroundBurnout among nurses is a worldwide public health epidemic that adversely affects nurses' quality of life as well as the patient's outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of stress on nurses' burnout and to identify the mediating effects of secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction among clinical nurses in South Korea.MethodsA quantitative, cross-sectional study evaluated the survey data from 10,305 female registered hospital nurses who participated in the Korea Nurses' Health Study (KNHS) Module 5. The survey included a demographic questionnaire and the Professional Quality of Life version 5 (ProQOL 5). Bootstrap analyses (using the PROCESS macro) were employed to evaluate the mediating effect between variables.ResultsStress was significantly associated with burnout and mediated by secondary traumatic stress and compassion satisfaction (beta (indirect 1)=0.185, Bootstrap confidence interval (BS CI) [0.175, 0.194]; beta (indirect 2)=0.226, BS CI [0.212, 0.241], respectively). In addition, the magnitude of the indirect effects of compassion satisfaction was significantly greater than the magnitude of the indirect effects of secondary traumatic stress (beta (indirect 1)-beta (indirect 2)=-0.042, BS CI [-0.058, -0.026]). The findings of this study indicate that the positive aspect (compassion satisfaction) of work experiences can offset the negative aspects (secondary traumatic stress), consequently reducing burnout level.ConclusionsOur study findings suggest that a multidimensional approach to assessing nurse burnout and implementation of proper management will improve quality of life for nurses and help maintain positive attitudes and quality of patient care.

AB  - Purpose Despite the importance of sustainability, some conservative religious groups do not believe and support climate change. There is a continuous debate on the role of religion on people's attitudes toward the environment. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to (1) explore the impact of consumers' religious orientation on motivation and commitment toward recycling; (2) examine the impact of economic motivation, commitment and love for nature toward intention to recycle; (3) investigate the mediating effect of motivation, commitment and love for nature on the relationship between consumer religiosity and their intention to recycle; and (4) examine the impact of consumers' intention toward its subsequent behavior. Design/methodology/approach Using convenience sampling methods, participants were recruited through an online survey platform (MTurk). The total completed respondents are 827 participants. Findings The results show consumers' religiousness influence their motivation, commitment and love for nature. This study shows that consumers with high intrinsic and extrinsic religiousness are more likely to be motivated by economic motivation. Being religious does not make consumers more environmentally friendly. Research limitations/implications This study did not separate religion and between religious and non-religious consumers. Each religion may perceive environments differently. Future research may investigate each religion separately. Originality/value This paper has several contributions: (1) it contributes to the debate on the impact of religiousness on consumers' attitudes toward sustainable-related behavior such as recycling. Does it matter? (2) the results show the most effective way to increase people's intention to recycle; and (3) the results of this study will have implications for government, religious institutions on how to increase positive attitude toward the environment especially among religious consumers.

AB  - No previous studies have examined how negative brand placements influence consumer behavior. According to this study's theoretical framework and empirical results, the effectiveness of these placements varies with the type of negativitythat is, either intrinsically or extrinsically connected to the brand. Based on the elaboration likelihood model, an intrinsically (extrinsically) negative placement will be very (barely) relevant to the viewers who, having (lacking) enough motivation, will process the information through the central (peripheral) route of persuasion. Under the central route, a careful consideration of the intrinsically negative information will discourage the viewers from consuming the brand, especially when they perceive the movie content as being realistic. Under the peripheral route, the extrinsically negative information will not be strong enough to discourage the brand users from consuming the product but will stimulate the brand nonusers to consume it, especially when these people like the movie and have a positive attitude to advertising. The hypothesized effects were confirmed in an experiment with 1103 moviegoers that viewed the film Good Bye, Lenin! under natural conditions in Santiago, Chile. To isolate the influence of two brand placements (Burger King with intrinsic negativity and Coca-Cola with extrinsic negativity), the participants were randomly assigned to two groups, each one of which viewed the movie with only one of the two placements (the other had been removed).

AB  - The present study examined the effects of sexual objectification of female artists in music videos on male undergraduates' sexual beliefs. Findings showed that participants who viewed music videos of highly objectified female artists reported more adversarial sexual beliefs, more acceptance of interpersonal violence, and, at a level of marginal significance, more negative attitudes about sexual harassment than participants assigned to low-sexual objectifying music videos by the same female artists. Path models indicated that adversarial sexual beliefs mediated the relationship between condition, and (1) acceptance of interpersonal violence and (2) negative attitudes regarding sexual harassment.

AB  - This study measured the impacts of failure in Crisis and Emergency Risk Communication (CERC) during the outbreak of a contagious Corona viral disease. The study measured the impacts by the number of individuals and hospitals exposed to the virus. The 2015 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreak in South Korea was used to investigate the consequences of CERC failure, where the names of hospitals exposed to MERS-CoV were withheld from the public during the early stage of virus diffusion. Empirical data analyses and simulated model tests were conducted. The findings of analyses and tests show that an early announcement of the hospital names and publicizing the necessary preventive measures could have reduced the rate of infection by approximately 85% and the number of contaminated healthcare facilities by 39% at maximum. This level of reduction is comparable to that of vaccination and of social distancing.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic and the resultant social distancing measures offer a compelling context through which to understand the changing relationship between journalism and place. Through an ethnography of news making at a major Indonesian news broadcaster, this study explored the material settings of news making during the pandemic and the consequences of the place-based realignments on journalistic practice, professionalism, and authority. Four main findings emerged. First, we found that as far as broadcast journalists are concerned there are no alternatives to the newsroom; making news in the newsroom was synonymous with their professional journalistic identity. A second finding is to highlight the key role of place in shaping press-source relations. In our case, the loss of physical proximity to government sources had major consequences for power relations between journalists and authorities. Third, certain news objects held particular meaning for journalists, and that when disrupted, can have deleterious consequences for their professional identity. Finally, our study witnessed an important shift in journalistic routines that favoured the live field report over pre-recorded packages or in-depth analysis. Findings are discussed in the context of ongoing debates about journalistic routines, identities, and the "material turn" in journalism studies.

TI  - Men's Response to Obulamu Campaign Messages about Male Involvement in Maternal Health: Mukono District, Uganda
T2  - HEALTH COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - Men?s involvement makes a difference in maternal health. Well-informed and supportive men may encourage their wives to get more complete and regular antenatal care. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, however, men?s involvement with their wives? health during pregnancy is minimal. This study investigated men?s response to Obulamu: How?s Your Pregnancy radio campaign messages about attending antenatal care with their wives, delivering at a health facility, being tested for HIV, maintaining maternal nutrition, and using malaria prevention. We conducted eight focus group discussions ranging from six to ten participants each: two groups of men from a rural area, two groups of men from a peri-urban area, and two groups each of expectant or recent mothers from the same rural and peri-urban areas. We also conducted six key informant interviews of midwives and other healthcare providers. Findings revealed that participants were highly exposed to the Obulamu campaign and knowledgeable about campaign messages. Most men expressed positive attitudes toward behaviors promoted by the campaign and voiced an intention to change their behaviors. Key informant interviews confirmed that since the start of the campaign an increase in male involvement with maternity visits had taken place. However, a sizeable minority of men, mostly rural residents, resisted involvement in their wives? antenatal visits because of poverty, gender and cultural stereotypes, fear of HIV testing, and incongruity between messages and the realities of antenatal clinical practice. An interaction between individual and institutional-level factors as posited by the social ecological model was clearly evident; there was an incongruity between encouraging Obulamu messages about men?s involvement and the discouraging realities of antenatal clinical practice.

AB  - Objective: To examine women's experiences with sexual assault screening by health care professionals and identify factors that influence women to disclose their sexual assault history to providers.
   Design: Cross-sectional descriptive survey with correlational analysis.
   Setting: On-line survey distributed nationally.
   Participants: One hundred forty-three women.
   Methods: Participants were recruited through social media; the authors e-mailed organizations across the nation and asked them to share links to a Facebook page connected to the survey. Descriptive statistics, Spearman's rho, and contingency tables were calculated, and qualitative content analysis was performed by thematic analysis. Results: Most (n = 103, 72.5%) participants reported that they felt comfortable with being asked about sexual assault, but only 41 (28.7%) participants were screened for sexual assault by health care professionals. Positive attitude and increased comfort level with screening were associated with increased intention to disclose past assault (p < .05). A total of 113 (82.5%) women reported intentions to disclose sexual assault to a provider if asked, whereas only 35 (24.6%) women would voluntarily disclose. Women identified prevention of medical and physical consequences as main facilitators to disclosure, and provider attitude and demeanor as the main barriers. Sixty-nine (48.9%) participants were victims of sexual assault. Women with a history of sexual assault were no more likely than women not victimized to have been screened for sexual assault.
   Conclusion: Study findings suggest that women are often not screened for sexual assault despite being receptive to inquiry. Health care professionals often do not identify those who have been sexually assaulted because they do not ask. Thus, many victims do not receive needed sexual assault resources and support.

AB  - Objectives: The present study aims to determine the attitudes of care providers including obstetricians, paediatricians and midwives working in perinatal, obstetric and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) wards of the selected teaching hospitals in Tehran in 2019. In addition, the challenges of providing palliative care from the perspective of these individuals have been examined.
   Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, the research population was selected through convenience sampling based on the inclusion criteria. To assess care providers' attitude toward the perinatal palliative care and the challenges of its implementation, in addition to the questionnaire of demographic characteristics, a researcher-made questionnaire was also used.
   Results: Most of the care providers (90.5%) believed that parents should be involved in decision-making to select the treatment type. Most of the care providers (90%) believed that the lack of prepared infrastructures is one of the major challenges in providing these types of care.
   Conclusion: Care providers have almost positive attitudes toward the various dimensions of providing perinatal palliative care, but it has not been properly implemented yet due to the insufficient knowledge of this type of care, the lack of required infrastructures (appropriate conditions in NICUs to provide this type of care, the sufficient number of staff and experts in this field), as well as the health authorities' neglecting this type of care.

AB  - Purpose Corporate scandals involving senior executives plague many businesses. Although customers and noncustomers may be exposed to news of the same scandal, they may appraise dimensions of the transgression differently, thereby affecting post-scandal patronage intentions. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether and how consumer-firm affiliation affects future patronage intentions by examining nuances in customers' vs noncustomers' reactions toward the transgressor's professional performance and immoral behavior. Design/methodology/approach Four between-subjects experimental studies were used to test whether performance-relevant and/or immorality-relevant pathways drive customers' vs noncustomers' post-scandal patronage intentions. The results were analyzed using analysis of variance, parallel mediation and serial mediation. Findings The results demonstrate that performance judgment, and not immorality judgment, drive the relationship between consumer-firm affiliation and post-scandal patronage intentions (Study 1a), regardless of the order of information presented (Study 1b). Customers form more positive performance judgments because they give more weight to performance-related information (Study 2), demonstrating a sequential effect of consumer-firm affiliation on post-scandal patronage intentions only through the performance-relevant, and not immorality-relevant, pathway (Study 3). Research limitations/implications This research contributes to the literature on social distance and moral judgments. Future research should examine other deleterious outcomes such as brand sabotage and negative word-of-mouth, as well as potential moderators including repeated transgressions and prevalence of the infraction in other firms. Practical implications This research offers important nuances for understanding how performance and immorality judgments differentially operate and affect post-scandal patronage intentions. The findings highlight the strategic value of communicating the leader's performance (e.g. professional contributions) as a buffer against potential declining patronage. Originality/value Offering new insights into the extant literature and lay beliefs which contend that harsh moral judgment reduces patronage intentions, this research uncovers why and how exposure to the same scandal can result in varying moral judgments that subsequently influence patronage intentions. Importantly, this research shows that the performance-relevant pathway can explain why customers have higher post-scandal patronage intentions compared to noncustomers.

AB  - The Iowa Infant Feeding Attitude Scale (IIFAS) has been shown to have good psychometric properties for English-speaking populations, but it has not been validated among low-risk pregnant women in Spain. The aim of this study was to assess the reliability and validity of the translated version of the IIFAS in order to examine infant feeding attitudes in Spanish women with an uncomplicated pregnancy. Low-risk expectant women (n = 297) were recruited from eight primary public health care centres in Galicia (Spain). Questionnaires including both socio-demographic and breastfeeding characteristics and items about infant feeding were administered during the third trimester. Participants were contacted by telephone during the postpartum period to obtain information regarding their infant feeding status. Prediction validity and internal consistency were assessed. The translated IIFAS (69.76 +/- 7.75), which had good psychometric properties (Cronbach's alpha = 0.785; area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve = 0.841, CI95% = 0.735-0.948), showed more positive attitudes towards breastfeeding than towards formula feeding, especially among mothers who intended to exclusively breastfeed. This scale was also useful for inferring the intent to breastfeed and duration of breastfeeding. This study provides evidence that the IIFAS is a reliable and valid tool for assessing infant feeding attitudes in Spanish women with an uncomplicated pregnancy.

AB  - Mental health stigma can be detrimental not only for the recipient, but also for the stigmatizer. As mental health stigma is often conceptualized as a multidimensional construct. Study 1 first examined the factor structure of mental health stigma as assessed by the Stigmatizing Attitudes-Believability (SAB: Masuda, Price, Anderson, Schmertz, & Calamaras, 2009). Study 2 investigated differential relations between the factor-analytically derived components of mental health stigma and psychological distress and psychological flexibility. Results of Study 1 revealed that mental health stigma consisted of two related, yet separable components: Exclusion and Course/Origin. The Exclusion component was characterized by negative emotions and cognitions associated with an increased desire for social distance. Course/Origin was marked by pessimistic views toward treatment prognosis and recovery. Results of Study 2 suggested that these two components have differential associations with psychological distress and flexibility. The Course/Origin component of stigma, but not Exclusion, was associated with psychological distress of the stigmatizer. Furthermore, this association was fully mediated by lower levels of psychological flexibility. These findings suggest the importance of conceptualizing mental health stigma multidimensionally.

AB  - Robotization of work is progressing fast globally, and the process has accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic. Utilizing integrated threat theory as a theoretical framework, this study investigated affective attitudes toward introducing robots at work using a four timepoint data (n = 830) from a Finnish working population longitudinal study. We used hybrid multilevel linear regression modelling to study within and between participant effects over time. Participants were more positive toward introducing robots at work during the COVID-19 pandemic than before it. Increased cynicism toward individuals' own work, robot-use self-efficacy, and prior user experiences with robots predicted positivity toward introducing robots at work over time. Workers with higher perceived professional efficacy were less and those with higher perceived technology-use productivity, robot-use self-efficacy, and prior user experiences with robots were more positive toward introducing robots at work. In addition, the affective attitudes of men, introverts, critical personalities, workers in science and technology fields, and high-income earners were more positive. Robotization of work life is influenced by workers' psychological well-being factors and perceived as a welcomed change in the social distancing reality of the pandemic.

AB  - Sharing the stories of people whose lives are impacted by Opioid Use Disorders (OUDs) can be a promising strategy to reduce stigma and increase support for beneficial public policies. Since a story can be told from a first-person or third-person point of view (POV), this study sought to (1) determine the relative persuasive effects of narrative POV and (2) identify the underlying psychological mechanisms, including character identification and psychological reactance, of such narratives. A one-way between-subjects experiment was conducted among a college student sample (N = 276). Narrative POV was manipulated by describing a college student's OUD experience from either the first- or third-person POV. Findings demonstrated that POV did not influence identification but had a significant effect on reactance. Specifically, the first-person (vs. third-person) POV narrative led to lower reactance, which was associated with participants' decreased desire to socially distance themselves from people with OUDs and stronger support for public health-oriented policies regarding OUDs. This study sheds light on the mixed findings revealed in the literature and has practical importance in health message design in the current opioid epidemic.

AB  - COVID-19 affects the paediatric population less frequently than adults. A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Mexico City in children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Included in the study were 86 patients with a median age of 10 years old (IQR 2.6-14.3 years), who were classified in three groups: previously healthy, with chronic disease and immunosuppressed patients. The principal signs and symptoms were fever (81%), cough (51%) and headache (35%). A total of 20 patients (23%) required management in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and 17% needed mechanical ventilation for an average of 12.7 days (IQR 2-29 days). There was no statistically significant difference between the three clinical classification groups in those patients admitted to the PICU, most of which were previously healthy patients. The mortality rate was 5% (four patients). Given that the paediatric population is susceptible to infection, potential transmitters and to clinical presentations with variable degrees of severity, it is important to continue reinforcing social distancing measures.

AB  - Objective This pre-registered study was designed to test whether reminders of death and coronavirus would have similar or different effects on health behavior intentions concerning COVID-19 (e.g., mask wearing, social distancing) and whether the type of framing of these behaviors would moderate these effects. Design The study utilized a 3 (threat: mortality salience vs. coronavirus reminder vs. control topic) x 3 (framing: autonomy-supportive vs. controlled vs. neutral) design. Measures of perceived threat of COVID-19, reactance proneness, and political orientation were included as individual differences. Results Although the interaction between threat and framing conditions was not significant, the data revealed that (1) lower perceived threat of COVID-19 was associated with lower health behavior intentions to reduce the spread of the virus; (2) after an induction to express their thoughts and feelings about COVID-19, participants with low perceived threat of COVID-19 significantly increased their health intentions; (3) perceived threat of COVID-19 moderated the relationship between reactance proneness and health intentions, such that those high in reactance proneness reported lower intentions unless they had high perceptions of threat; and (4) politically conservative participants reported lower intentions to engage in healthy behaviors, and this relationship was mediated by their lower perceived threat of COVID-19.

AB  - Recognizing that powerholders operate in dynamic relational and interdependent work contexts, we posit that the effects of psychological power on powerholders are more complex than currently depicted in the literature. Although psychological power prompts behaviors and perceptions that harm the powerless, these reactions are not without consequence for the actor. We integrate the social distance theory of power with consent-based theories of power to posit that, although psychological power elicits negative behaviors and perceptions, these same reactions hurt leaders' subsequent well-being. To explore this possibility, we conducted an experimental experience sampling study with a sample of managerial employees whom we surveyed for 10 consecutive workdays. We find that leaders enact more abusive behavior and perceive more incivility from others on days when they are exposed to psychological power compared to days when they are not. Leaders higher in agreeableness are less affected by psychological power. In turn, abusive behavior and perceived incivility harm leaders' subsequent well-being as indicated by their reduced need fulfillment and ability to relax at home. We discuss theoretical implications for research on psychological power, abusive leadership, perceived incivility, and leader well-being, as well as practical implications for employees and their organizations.

AB  - This article studies the influence of entrepreneurial spirit on college students' entrepreneurial ability and entrepreneurial values. Firstly, the impact of entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit on entrepreneurial values is analyzed. Secondly, the role of entrepreneurial values in innovation and entrepreneurship education is analyzed and summarized under new media. Then, based on entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurial spirit, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) is designed to investigate the entrepreneurial values of students in one university in Shaanxi Province, China. The QS analysis suggests that most respondents hold a positive attitude, and their attitude is on the rise. The QS results of "Reasons for entrepreneurial failure" show that 40.37, 31.9, 25.98, and 11.75% of respondents think they lack financial support, business skills, ability, and understanding of policies and laws, respectively. The QS results of "What factors influence entrepreneurial values?" reveal that 39.43% of the respondents chose the "Models of successful entrepreneurs," successful entrepreneur models can effectively encourage students to receive entrepreneurship education, followed by 28.94% who choose "Achieve their own life goals." In terms of "Solutions against entrepreneurial risks," nearly 70% of the students have chosen the negative options. In terms of "Which is the most important entrepreneurial quality?" more students choose entrepreneurial values rather than entrepreneurial quality, proving that students generally lack entrepreneurial values. Given these problems, corresponding countermeasures are put forward to strengthen entrepreneurial psychology and entrepreneurship education, in an attempt to cultivate college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability under the new media. The results provide some data support for the impact of college students' entrepreneurial values and entrepreneurial ability.

AB  - Studying in-group affiliation preferences can be a valuable tool for understanding race relations in the contemporary United States. We draw on theories of social dominance and social identity to analyze racial attitudes, as measured by the Social Distance Scale, for a subset of black and white students at the University of Mississippi. While both black and white students expressed strong in-group preference, this preference was stronger for whites than for blacks, especially for white women presently affiliated or planning to affiliate with campus Greek organizations. Social dominance orientation, a measure describing whether social inequalities are accepted and justified, mediated the greater in-group preference of many whites, especially for intimate or high-power relationships. We discuss possible individual and institutional causes for the differences we observe, and we draw implications for understanding continued self-segregation both on-and off-campus in a society that implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, espouses "color-blind" ideals.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic continues to pose an unprecedented challenge for the world as people strive to cope with this significant threat to their well-being. This intensive longitudinal study of the first 94 days of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea (Phase 1: initial outbreak, Phase 2: intense social distancing) examined individuals' changes in well-being, in relation to their use of coping strategies and fear of infection. A sample of 10,464 South Koreans participated in surveys during Phase 1 and Phase 2, resulting in 35,846 observations. Multilevel growth models revealed a decrease in well-being while different coping strategies moderated the individual rate of change in well-being. Although preventive measures were associated with a greater decrease in well-being, cognitive appraisal and behavioral strategies predicted stable well-being during the pandemic. Coping strategies further mediated the association between fear of infection and deterioration of well-being.

AB  - Why have the effects of COVID-19 been so unevenly geographically distributed in the United States? This paper investigates the role of social capital as a mediating factor for the spread of the virus. Because social capital is associated with greater trust and relationships within a community, it could endow individuals with a greater concern for others, thereby leading to more hygienic practices and social distancing. Using data for over 2,700 US counties, we investigate how social capital explains the level and growth rate of infections. We find that moving a county from the 25(th) to the 75(th) percentile of the distribution of social capital would lead to a 18% and 5.7% decline in the cumulative number of infections and deaths, as well as suggestive evidence of a lower spread of the virus. Our results are robust to many demographic characteristics, controls, and alternative measures of social capital.

In a between-subjects design, participants were exposed to (a) a media story in which a murderer was labelled with autism spectrum disorder (media exposure condition) or not labelled with any disorder (control) and (b) an autism spectrum disorder-education condition attacking the myth that people diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder are likely to be violent criminals or a no-autism spectrum disorder-education condition. Participants attitudes towards three different crime perpetrators (one with autism spectrum disorder) described in separate vignettes were probed. The media exposure linking crime and autism spectrum disorder promoted more negative attitudes towards individuals with autism spectrum disorder, whereas the positive autism spectrum disorder-related educational message had the opposite effect.

AB  - Objective. To measure the impact of a depression training day for pharmacists that included a 75-minute session with a consumer educator.
   Design. The training day included interactive lectures on depression; the effects and side effects of and indications for the use of antidepressants; adherence issues; non-drug treatment options for depression; and basic skills in communication. Pharmacists also participated in a session with a consumer educator and in counseling exercises that included role playing.
   Assessment. The study used a randomized, clustered, comparative design to measure pharmacists' stigma, attitudes, and current practice related to the provision of pharmaceutical care to people with depression. Mean scores for depression-care practice after the training session were significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group. Analysis of the changes between baseline and postintervention measures in both the control and intervention groups confirmed a significant difference in the change in both social distance and practice but no significant difference in the change in attitude between the 2 groups of pharmacists.
   Conclusion. A continuing-education depression training day for pharmacists that involve consumer educators may improve the care delivered in the community pharmacy to people with depression.

AB  - Patriotism and threat have been shown to predict immigration attitudes. We suggest that patriotism is influential in producing threat, and such threat drives anti-immigration attitudes, but this relationship is different for Whites and Latinos. All participants completed a patriotism scale (blind and constructive patriotism measures), a threat scale (realistic and symbolic threat), and anti-immigration attitude scale. Latinos showed lower blind patriotism, realistic threat, symbolic threat, and anti-immigration attitudes compared to Whites, with no differences in constructive patriotism. Threat partially mediated the relationship between blind patriotism and anti-immigration attitudes for Whites and fully mediated the relationship for Latinos. Threat partially mediated the relationship for cultural patriotism and anti-immigration attitude for Whites but not for Latinos. Implications for public policy and education concerning immigrant attitudes are discussed.

AB  - With the rapid growth and popularity of Social Streaming Apps (SSAs) worldwide, it is valuable for scholars to understand the links between immersive experience provided by SSA, users' attitudes towards SSA, and the resultant SSA dependency. Although unexplored in the SSA context, previous research has indicated the significance of immersive experience and its influence on user's specific behavior through user attitude. The present study employs Structural Equation Modelling, by using 459 samples from a survey, to explore how the intensity of immersive experience can influence the degree of user dependency on SSA. Results indicate that immersive experience is positively associated with users' positive attitudes towards SSA, which would lead to SSA dependency. In addition, this study also found out that users' favorable attitude partially mediates the relationship between immersive experience and solitary play dependency. Whereas, attitude fully mediated the relationship between five out of six dimensions of SSA dependency. Furthermore, to better comprehend the intervening relationships between immersive experiences, user attitude, SSA dependency, the study also conducted a moderation analysis taking frequency of use as a moderating variable. The results illustrate that a high frequency of use is a strong psychological indicator for SSA dependency. This supports the importance of considering actual behavior along with their psychological states when examining users' immersive experience and their SSA dependency.

AB  - Immigration is a highly polarized issue in the United States, and negative attitudes toward immigrants are common. Yet, almost all Americans are descended from people who originated outside the country, a narrative often evoked by the media and taught in school curricula. Can this narrative increase inclusionary attitudes toward migrants? We draw from scholarship showing that perspective-taking decreases prejudice toward out-groups to investigate whether reminding Americans about their own immigration history increases support for immigrants and immigration. We propose that priming family experiences can indirectly stimulate perspective-taking and induce empathy toward the out-group, which we test with three separate survey experiments conducted over two years. Our findings show that priming family history generates small but consistent inclusionary effects. These effects occur even among partisan subgroups and Americans who approve of President Trump. We provide evidence that increased empathy for immigrants constitutes one mechanism driving these effects.

AB  - Objectives: The present study examined Australian ED nurses' practices in asking patients about alcohol and assisting them to manage their alcohol consumption. It also investigated strategies to support ED nurses in these interventions.
   Methods: A two-stage survey was administered to ED nurses. The first questionnaire measured theoretical and organizational predictors of behaviour, and underlying beliefs, and the subsequent questionnaire explored rates of asking and assisting patients.
   Results: A total of 125 nurses returned the first questionnaire. Participants held generally positive attitudes, perceived norms, feelings of legitimacy and perceived ability to ask about and intervene for alcohol, but lower role adequacy. The 71 ED nurses who completed the second questionnaire had intervened with almost 500 patients concerning alcohol in the previous week. Participants asked approximately one in four patients about alcohol (median = 26.3% of patients, 1095/4279 total patients asked). The Theory of Planned Behaviour did not predict rates of asking or assisting patients. Several strategies were identified that might increase rates: identify environmental factors that prevent nurses acting on their intentions to ask and intervene, raise confidence and skills, make asking about alcohol part of routine assessment, make supports such as drug and alcohol units or nurses available, and implement organizational policies on alcohol.
   Conclusions: Nurses appear positively disposed to engage with patients in regard to alcohol. However, greater support is needed to achieve the considerable significant public health benefits from this engagement. The findings point to several practical strategies that could be pursued to provide this support.

AB  - This article argues that institutional apologies are rituals that can be conceived from a neo-Durkheimian viewpoint as external social tools of collective emotion, which allow people to assume collective guilt and shame, increase agreement with reparatory behaviors, and reinforce social cohesion. The review of studies presented in this monograph shows that an apology reactivates and intensifies collective emotions, mainly of shame and guilt, above and beyond merely reminding people of past misdeeds, and increases support for reparation. Shame and sorrow fuel and support reparative tendencies. Finally, salience of past collective violence together with an apology improves social climate to some extent, enhances intergroup reconciliation by decreasing prejudice and improving intergroup contact, and helps to reconstruct in-group collective memory in a more critical way. Changes in collective emotions and representations of the past mediate the positive effects of apologies on reparation and social cohesion.

AB  - Background: Dengue fever has been a major health threat to Malaysia over one century since 1902. This situation is getting worse every year so that the government has taken an affirmative action to tackle this particular issue. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of government support, climate changes, public attitude, population growth, and environment on dengue infection. Also, this study considered the environment as a mediator construct as the past literature revealed its role in dengue infection model.
   Methods: In order to identify the relationship between exogenous and endogenous constructs, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used. Also, in order to identify the factors affecting dengue infection, measurement and structural model evaluation were applied. Using stratified sampling method, 670 questionnaires were distributed among prospective respondents from eastern region, but in turn, only 505 cases could be used after data cleaning process.
   Results: Considering environment factor as a mediator, the results show that public attitude and population growth have a significant impact on the environment, while government support, public attitude, and environment factors have a significant impact on dengue infection. Population growth was the most important factor affecting dengue fever.
   Conclusion: According to the results, dengue fever that emanating from four exogenous and one mediator constructs are adequate to discuss on respondent perception of dengue fever in Malaysia.

AB  - We tested a cross-race friendship picture book intervention under two conditions that aimed to facilitate the reduction of racial prejudice that children of two age groups ascribe to adults reading the book (communicators) and their own prejudice. White majority children, 113 kindergarteners (M = 5.97 years) and 103 second graders (M = 7.93 years) were randomly assigned to an ingroup (White) or outgroup (Black) communicator and skill training. They were pretested on racial attitudes they ascribed to their photographed communicator and then trained in reconciliation or classification. They heard four cross-race friend stories; then were retested on communicator attitudes, own attitudes and cognitive elaboration. Results indicated only second graders, and those able to reconcile differences in perspectives, predicted on the basis of their photo alone that outgroup communicators would hold positive attitudes toward Blacks. After communicators read the stories and explicitly stated their antibias attitude, reports changed among second graders who now rated both communicators as holding more positive Black attitudes. Second graders also held more positive Black attitudes themselves. Kindergarteners consistently assumed both ingroup and outgroup communicators were pro-White. Children elaborated more about the Black story characters when read to by an outgroup (Black) communicator. In conclusion, cross-race friend storybooks are a promising way to expose children to other racial groups and to antibias attitudes, under certain conditions. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Twenty-five years after George Gerbner and colleagues' seminal report on television and science attitudes, there is a need to update the data on television's portrayals of science and to revisit the cultivation question. We address this need by analyzing 21st-century television depictions of science and examining the relationships between exposure to television and attitudes toward science with an analysis of 2006 General Social Survey data. Content results show that scientists appear infrequently in prime-time dramatic programs, are typically White males, and are frequently cast in good or mixed roles rather than as evil scientists. Regarding the cultivation effect, we do not find a significant direct relationship between television viewing and negative attitudes toward science after relevant controls are taken into account. Additional results, however, indicate a displacement effect of television viewing on science attitudes and show significant interaction effects consistent with mainstreaming.

AB  - Vascularized composite allograft (VCA) transplantation has emerged as a groundbreaking surgical intervention to return identity and function following traumatic injury, congenital deformity, or disfigurement. While public attitudes toward traditional organ/tissue donation are favorable, little is known about attitudes toward VCA donation and transplantation. A survey was conducted of 1485 U.S. residents in August 2016 to assess VCA donation attitudes. Participants also completed the Revised Health Care System Distrust Scale. Most respondents were willing to donate hands/forearms (67.4%) and legs (66.8%), and almost half (48.0%) were willing to donate the face. Three-quarters (74.4%) of women were willing to donate the uterus; 54.4% of men were willing to donate the penis. VCA donation willingness was more likely among whites and Hispanics (p < 0.001), registered organ/tissue donors (p < 0.001), and those with less health care system distrust (p < 0.001) and media exposure to VCA transplantation (p = 0.003). Many who opposed VCA donation expressed concerns about psychological discomfort, mutilation, identity loss, and the reaction of others to seeing familiar body parts on a stranger. Attitudes toward VCA donation are favorable overall, despite limited exposure to VCA messaging and confusion about how VCA donation occurs. These findings may help guide the development and implementation of VCA public education campaigns.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the multifaceted socio-cultural functions of Australian children's television. As social distancing measures forced school students to study from home, local children's TV producers and distributors contributed to home-based learning. Yet, in response to the pandemic, the Federal Government has indefinitely suspended Australian children's television quotas, the regulatory framework that sets minimum hours of local children's content for commercial television broadcasters. In response to government imposed budgetary restraints, public broadcaster, the ABC, has also made redundances in its children's content department. Such changes have occurred at a critical juncture in which the sector's long-standing contributions to the education of Australian children and pedagogy of local teachers, caregivers and parents have been brought to the fore. We argue that this pedagogical function is a core but often overlooked element of the socio-cultural value of the sector that has been highlighted during the pandemic.

AB  - This paper analyzes the relation between gender role beliefs and prejudice toward gay men and lesbians in Chile. Participants were Chilean university students (N = 283). Results indicate that men are more prejudiced than women and religious people are more prejudiced than non-religious people. On the other hand, gender role beliefs mediate sex differences in prejudice. The participants' more traditional gender role beliefs hold more negative attitudes toward gay men and lesbians. Men are more prejudiced than women, particularly in their attitudes toward gay men. In addition, sex differences in attitudes toward lesbians and gay men are mediated by gender role beliefs.

AB  - Background: Condomless anal intercourse (CAI) is the major risk factor for HIV transmission among men who have sex with men (MSM). MSM who are heavier cannabis users engage in CAI more frequently. However, little is known about the processes that may underlie this association. This study sought to understand the potential role of condom attitudes and condom-related planning in the association between cannabis use and CAI.
   Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of a study on alcohol use and sexual decision-making among MSM. Two hundred and fifty-eight MSM with moderate to heavy drinking were enrolled. Measures included CAI, cannabis use, attitudes about the influence of condoms on sexual pleasure, condom use planning, age, heavy episodic drinking, and use of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).
   Results: We conducted a negative binomial regression analysis controlling for age, PrEP, and heavy episodic drinking. Cannabis use frequency was a significant predictor of CAI (b =.333, p <.001). Indirect effects showed that while heavier cannabis users exhibited less condom-related planning (b = 0.106, p = 0.015) and more negative attitudes toward the impact of condom use on pleasure (b= -0.177, p = 0.004), cannabis use had a significant indirect effect on CAI only through attitude ratings.
   Conclusions: MSM who are heavier cannabis users engage in more frequent CAI and exhibit an indirect effect on CAI through negative attitudes toward the impact of condoms on pleasure. These findings suggest the potential importance of addressing these condom attitudes in HIV-prevention interventions among MSM who use cannabis.

AB  - Contact tracing applications have been deployed at a fast pace around the world to stop the spread of COVID-19 and may be key to containing future pandemics. This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell phone contact tracing using a survey experiment. We build upon a theory in evolutionary psychology-disease avoidance-to predict how media coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps. And third, while a majority of respondents approve of the reliance on cell phone contact tracing, concerns for rights and freedoms remain a salient preoccupation.

AB  - Nonprofit soccer clubs are currently facing many ethical challenges, such as abuse, doping and match fixing. While research suggests that organizational (board) ethical leadership may be effective to tackle these ethical issues, empirical support in the context of sport remains limited. Drawing on the perceptions of a sample of nonprofit soccer players (n=438) and coaches (n=106), we indicate that the coaches play an important mediating role regarding the associations between board ethical leadership and ethical climate. The theoretical underpinnings of ethical leadershipformed by social learning theory and social exchange theoryand the social distance between the board and the players in nonprofit soccer clubs provide support in this regard. In sum, our results demonstrate that the influence of board ethical leadership in nonprofit soccer clubs partly trickles down to the players via coach ethical leadership. Finally, practical implications for nonprofit soccer club management are discussed.

AB  - Due to a sex ratio imbalance and marriage squeeze in China, many males of marriageable ages cannot find wives. To meet their sexual needs, those bachelors tend to use the internet to find sexual partners in recent years. However, studies on the psychosocial mechanisms underlying having sex with partners met online are scarce. This study examined the relationship between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and having sex with online partners based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). The data were obtained from a cross-sectional survey of bachelors (with rural household registration, at least 28 years old and never married) (N = 735) in several regions of China. Logistic regression models show that attitudes and subjective norms were significantly associated with having sex with online partners. The mediation analysis further indicated that the intention of seeking sex partners online partially mediated the relationships across attitudes, subjective norms, and having sex with partners online. This study provides a better understanding of factors associated with having sex with partners met online. It also extends research concerning a population that is understudied. Additionally, it shows the applicability of the TBP model in explaining the factors associated with having sex with partners.
   LAY SUMMARY This study explores the psychosocial mechanism of having sex with partners met online among Chinese bachelors, guided by the Theory of Planned Behavior. We found that bachelors who hold more positive attitudes and subjective norms are more likely to have sex with partners met online. The findings extend knowledge from the studies of MSM and adolescents in western societies to bachelors in China.

AB  - Background: Palliative care is predominantly accessed late in the course of an illness, despite evidence to suggest the benefits of early engagement. Strategies are required to reduce the barriers to the delivery of palliative care. Aim: To describe community understandings of and attitudes to palliative care and explore characteristics significantly associated with favourable attitudes towards palliative care. Design: Cross-sectional survey data were collected including several sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge of palliative care and attitudes to palliative care. Correlational analyses identified factors related to positive attitudes to palliative care. Those of significance (p <= 0.01) were examined using a multiple regression model to determine their predictive value. Setting/participants: A community-based sample of consecutive English-speaking adults who volunteered their participation in response to a study advertisement distributed online through established community groups. Results: A total of 421 participants (75% female, mean age: 51 +/- 15.1) reported a median of at least three misperceptions of palliative care. Older age, previously undertaking a caregiving role, knowing someone who had received palliative care and reporting more accurate knowledge of palliative care significantly predicted favourable attitudes to palliative care (adjusted R-2 = 0.24, F(8, 333) = 13.2, p < 0.001). Other factors typically associated with health literacy such as tertiary education, working at a medical facility and speaking a language other than English at home were not predictive. Conclusion: Gaps in knowledge about palliative care exist in community, which may limit citizen's potential access to quality care in the event of serious illness. These results point to a role for public education programmes, which may, in turn, also shift attitudes to palliative care.

AB  - This study investigates the antecedents and outcomes of consumer engagement through AR apps and suggests a new conceptual model. The purpose of the paper is to examine how consumer engagement is shaped via AR apps, which eventually leads to a positive attitude towards brand and brand usage intent. To this end, a face-to-face survey instrument was administered to 350 participants in Turkey, where participants tried an AR app and then answered a questionnaire. The structural equation modeling (SEM) and Hayes' Process analyses were applied to test the hypotheses and moderated mediation relationships. Findings showed that interactivity and inspiration are two major antecedents of consumers' flow experience. The flow experience with AR can generate favorable attitudes towards AR apps and more trust in AR apps, which trigger consumer engagement with AR apps and then improve brand attitude and brand usage intent. The outcomes of flow experience with AR (i.e., attitude and trust) mediate the relationship between flow and engagement. Although perceived usefulness increases the effect of consumers' attitudes towards AR on engagement, it has no moderating effect on the relationship between trust in AR and engagement. Furthermore, the results of Hayes' Process revealed that the indirect effect of flow on consumers' engagement with AR through attitude towards AR is moderated by perceived usefulness. So that, if AR marketers aim to strengthen the link between consumer flow experience and engagement via attitudes towards AR, they should therefore consider enhancing the perceived usefulness of AR. Surprisingly, perceived usefulness had no moderating effect on the indirect relationship between flow and engagement via trust. Finally, this paper discusses both the theoretical and managerial implications.

AB  - This study analyses the moderating role of Mobile Health (MHealth) in influencing the indirect relationship of health literacy on prescribed self-care through attitude among Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) patients in Malaysia. Through a user-experience research with concept testing, data were collected from 300 CHD patients in a tertiary hospital using a survey. Findings show a partial mediation of attitude in the relationship between health literacy and prescribed self-care. The results reveal that the perceived usefulness of MHealth significantly and positively moderates the direct effect of health literacy on attitude towards prescribed self-care. Further, the perceived risk of MHealth significantly moderates the direct effect of health literacy on prescribed self-care negatively. Lastly, the perceived risk of MHealth positively moderates the moderated mediation of perceived usefulness of MHealth on the indirect effect of health literacy on prescribed self-care. These findings suggest a new framework for the effects of MHealth on prescribed self-care that explains the importance of perceived usefulness of MHealth to create a positive attitude towards prescribed self-care; in other words, the perception of usefulness outweighs the patient's perceived risk of MHealth in practising prescribed self-care. To integrate MHealth in the CHD medication regimen, requires (1) relevant disease management functions, (2) regulations (3) audit and revisions, and (4) education, as well as the involvement of healthcare providers, policymakers, and developers.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed at estimating the pre-pandemic and pandemic prevalence of loneliness and investigating the association of loneliness with social disconnectedness during social distancing strategies in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic period. Methods: We used data from the ELSI COVID-19 initiative with participants from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Aging (ELSI-Brazil), which comprised 4,431 participants aged 50 years and over. Loneliness (hardly ever/some of the time/often) was assessed by the question "In the past 30 days, how often did you feel alone/lonely?". Social disconnectedness included information on social contacts through virtual talking (i.e. telephone, Skype, WhatsApp, or social media) and outside-home meetings with people living in another household. Covariates included sociodemographic and health related characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence interval (CI). Results: The overall prevalence of loneliness during the pandemic was 23.9% (95% CI 20.7-27.5); lower than in the pre-pandemic period (32.8%; 95% CI 28.6-37.4). In the pandemic period, 20.1% (95% CI 16.9-23.6) reported some of the time feeling lonely and 3.9% (95% CI 3.1-4.8) reported often feeling lonely. In the fully adjusted model, virtual talking disconnectedness (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.09-2.56) was positively associated with some of the time feeling lonely and outside-home disconnectedness (OR=0.33; 95% CI 0.18-0.60) was negatively associated with often feeling lonely. Conclusion: Individuals with virtual talking disconnectedness and without outside-home disconnectedness are at higher risk of loneliness during the time of COVID-19 pandemic. Stimulating virtual talking connectedness might have the potential to diminish loneliness despite steep outside-home disconnectedness.

AB  - Background: The rate of home birth in Iceland increased from 0.1% in the 90's, to 2.2% in 2012. As the media contributes to the development and public perceptions, engagement and use of health care, it is of interest to explore the media representation of planned home birth in Iceland.
   Objectives: The aim of this study was to explore the way in which the constructions of planned home birth are represented in the Icelandic media; the frequency with which planned home birth was discussed and by whom it was discussed; whether the discourse was congruent with practice development in the country; and if so, how such congruency was effected.
   Methods: Data from the main newspapers in Iceland published from the beginning of 1990 until the end of 2011 were explored using content analysis.
   Results: In total, 127 items were summarized and we identified five themes: approach to safety, having a choice, the medicalization of childbirth, the relationship between women and midwives, and the reaction of the pregnant woman's local community. Central in the analysis were the importance of being able to choose a safe place of birth and the need for woman-centred care.
   Conclusion: Overall planned home birth was not discussed with much intensity or frequency, but in general the discussion was shaped by a positive attitude. There was a distinction in the public media discourse among midwives and physicians or obstetricians who do not argue against planned home birth but who nevertheless speak with caution. The pregnant women who chose home birth found their own home to be safe and similar views were identified among women and midwives. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: This cross-sectional study assessed the attitudes of Canadian ophthalmology residents (PGY1-5) and pre-clerkship medical students (year 1 and 2) at the University of Toronto towards individuals experiencing homelessness.
   Methods: Residents and students were invited to complete the Health Professionals' Attitudes Towards the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) tool to assess attitudes, interests and confidence in working with the homeless population on a 5-point Likert scale. Comparisons were made between residents and pre-clerkship learners and between junior and senior residents using the Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.
   Results: Responses were received from 114 of 220 ophthalmology residents (52%) and 315 of 534 (59%) pre-clerkship medical students. Ophthalmology residents had significantly more negative overall attitudes (pre-clerk median = 4.4, resident median = 4.1, both still indicating positive attitudes) and interests (pre-clerk median = 4.0, resident median = 3.3, residents with more neutral interests) towards working with the homeless population compared to pre-clerkship medical students. Using both statistical methods, beliefs were significantly more negative in 7 of 9 'Attitude' items, 5 of 5 'Interest' items and 1 of 4 'Confidence' items. Ophthalmology residents were only more positive in 1 of 4 of the 'Confidence' items. Attitudes were similar across PGY1-5 training years, except PGY4 and PGY5 residents were more negative than PGY1-3 residents on 1 of 5 'Interest' items.
   Conclusions: Ophthalmology residents have an at least neutral perception of individuals experiencing homelessness, while medical students have a more positive opinion. Studies exploring optimal ways to advocate for this population are needed for Canada's eye-care trainees.

AB  - Introduction Improvement of women's knowledge and attitude toward vaginal birth is recognized as an important strategy to control caesarean sections (CS) on maternal request. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a mass-media campaign in improving knowledge, attitude and intention of women for vaginal birth. Methods This was a population-based study carried out in Tehran, Iran. A national 'No to unnecessary caesarean sections' campaign was launched in April 2016 and was televised for ten days. A random sample of pregnant women from all defined geographical areas of Tehran were recruited and assessed for knowledge about the benefits of vaginal birth and the risk of CS, attitude and intention toward mode of delivery at two points in time: before and after the campaign. A comparison was made to evaluate outcome measures among those who had seen the campaign and those who had not. Results In all, 37 public and private maternity care centers were selected randomly and 702 eligible pregnant women attending these centers were entered in the study. Pre- and post-intervention data for 466 women were available for analysis. Of these, 194 women indicated that they had seen the campaign and the remaining 272 women said that they had not. A comparison of the outcome measures between the two study groups showed that there were significant differences between those who had seen the campaign and those who had not. Those who had seen the campaign reported increased knowledge, had a more positive attitude and indicated increased behavioral intention toward vaginal birth. Conclusions In general, the findings indicated that the mass-media campaign improved pregnant women's knowledge, attitude and intention towards vaginal birth. However, the long-term effects of such campaigns need further investigation.

AB  - Studies show that increased knowledge of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is achieved through exposure to mass media, which then contributes to positive attitudes and behaviours towards people living with HIV and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). This study examined the relationship between the frequency of exposure to the media and the level of HIV-related knowledge and stigmatising attitudes towards HIV and AIDS among adults in Ghana. A weighted sample of 13 484 men and women 15 to 59 years old took part in the study. The main outcome variable was the HIV-related knowledge score, calculated based on responses to eight questions about general HIV concepts and HIV transmission modes. The frequency of exposure to the media was the primary explanatory variable. The relationship between the frequency of media exposure and the level of HIV-related knowledge was investigated using Poisson regression methods in Stata 13.0. Of the 13 484 respondents analysed, 25%, 88.2% and 79.7% reported reading print media, listening to the radio and watching TV at least once a week respectively. The average HIV-related knowledge score was 4.9 (SD 1.6), with 22.9% of respondents correctly answering five questions and about 2.0% correctly answering all eight questions. The frequency of exposure to the media, particularly print media and television, was associated with an increase in the level of HIV-related knowledge. When compared to having a low level of HIV-related knowledge, having a moderate and high level of HIV-related knowledge reduced the score of stigmatising attitude by 0.065 and 0.277 points, respectively. The adult population in Ghana has a very low level of HIV or AIDS knowledge, as well as a significant level of stigma associated with HIV or AIDS, which could stymie HIV prevention efforts. The media, on the other hand, provide a platform for these issues to be addressed.

AB  - Green housing is a new type of building that advocates energy saving and environmental protection. How to stimulate buyers to buy green housing under the background of high cost is the key problem to guide green consumption. First of all, based on the existing literature, the comment of homebuyers was divided into comment quantity, comment quality, comment titer and evaluator credibility. The psychological distance mediation variable was introduced, and three dimensions of time distance, social distance, and space distance were selected to construct the influence model of homebuyer comment on green housing purchase intention. Meanwhile, the concept model was built, and questionnaires were adopted for empirical analysis. On this basis, considering the long-term purchase behavior of buyers, the influence model of homebuyers' second comment on green housing purchase intention with the Hotelling model was established. The results show that comment quality, comment titer, and the credit rating of the evaluator have a positive effect on green housing purchase intention while comment quantity has no significant effect. Psychological distance plays a mediation role between comment quality, comment titer, the credit rating of the evaluator, and green housing purchase intention while having a mediation effect between comment quantity and green housing purchase intention. In the long-term purchase behavior of green housing, psychological distance plays a greater role than price. At last, some suggestions were proposed.

AB  - The way in which television news-readers look to their audience is the realization of a particular mode of visual direct address that has been identified more generally as characteristic of television as a medium. This mode of address, however, is not uniform across institutions, or unchanging over time, but is a distinctive kind of practical accomplishment, dependent - in part at least - on the technological developments around the autocue or teleprompter. This article explores how the introduction of the autocue altered practices of television news-reading, and - by enabling a greater degree of expressive release by newsreaders - fostered a stronger sense of para-social interaction between newsreader and audience. These developments, however, are not simply driven by technology but interact with cultural and institutional pressures which we illustrate by comparisons between British (BBC), U.S. (CBS) and Chinese (CCTV) news presenters. Indeed, the adoption of and development of direct visual address in news reading, with accompanying forms of expressive release, may ultimately be seen as fulfilling a general communicative principle: "for mediated communication at a distance, favour directness over indirectness, informality over formality, and social solidarity over social distance."

AB  - Human distance estimation is essential in many vital applications, specifically, in human localisation-based systems, such as independent living for older adults applications, and making places safe through preventing the transmission of contagious diseases through social distancing alert systems. Previous approaches to estimate the distance between a reference sensing device and human subject relied on visual or high-resolution thermal cameras. However, regular visual cameras have serious concerns about people's privacy in indoor environments, and high-resolution thermal cameras are costly. This paper proposes a novel approach to estimate the distance for indoor human-centred applications using a low-resolution thermal sensor array. The proposed system presents a discrete and adaptive sensor placement continuous distance estimators using classification techniques and artificial neural network, respectively. It also proposes a real-time distance-based field of view classification through a novel image-based feature. Besides, the paper proposes a transfer application to the proposed continuous distance estimator to measure human height. The proposed approach is evaluated in different indoor environments, sensor placements with different participants. This paper shows a median overall error of +/- 0.2 m in continuous-based estimation and 96.8% achieved-accuracy in discrete distance estimation.

AB  - The stay-at-home orders of the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted U.S. adolescents' lives in numerous ways during the spring of 2020, including substantial changes to in-person routines and increased reliance on digital media. For adolescent girls, stay-at-home practices may have implications for body image concerns. In this research brief, we examine adolescent girls' pandemic-related body image concerns and longitudinal associations with depressive symptoms. The sample included 93 U.S. adolescent girls (M-age = 15.01; 68.8% White), with approximately 2/3 at temperamental risk for depression. Participants self-reported their depressive symptoms and pandemic-related body image concerns via online surveys at three assessments: Time 1 occurred in April/May 2020, approximately one month into stay-at-home orders, followed by two-week and seven-month follow-up assessments. Two pandemic-related body image concerns were assessed: (1) concerns about disrupted appearance-management routines and (2) evaluating one's appearance on video-chat. Both forms of pandemic-related body image concerns predicted depressive symptoms two weeks later, and concerns about disrupted routines also predicted depressive symptoms seven months later. In an era of social distancing, frequent technology-based interactions, and disrupted routines, future work should continue to investigate adolescents' body image concerns and the implications for longer-term mental health outcomes.

AB  - (1) Background: It is important to improve vaccination strategies and immunization programs to achieve herd immunity to infectious diseases. (2) Methods: To assess the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination, we conducted face-to-face surveys and online surveys in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Qinghai provinces. A fixed-effect model and a random effects model were used to analyze factors associated with the acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. (3) Findings: We initially recruited 3173 participants, 3172 participants completed the full questionnaire (the response rate was nearly 100%), of which 2169 were valid questionnaires, with an effective rate of 87.3%. The results indicated that 82.6% of participants were willing to receive vaccination when it was available in the community, and 57.2% of deliverymen, 43.3% of medical workers, 78.2% of parents of primary and secondary school children, and 72.2% of parents of preschool children were willing to receive vaccination. The models showed that participants who were male (female vs. male: OR = 1.49, 95% CI (1.12, 1.98)), 60 to 69 years-old (60-69 vs. <30: OR = 0.52, 95% CI (0.29, 0.92)), had less education (medium vs. low: OR = 1.50, 95% CI (1.05, 2.23)), had good health status (good vs. low: OR = 0.36, 95% CI (0.15, 0.88)), and had positive attitudes and trust (OR = 0.14, 95% CI (0.10, 0.20)) in vaccines approved by the National Health Commission were more likely to accept vaccination. Participants also had an increased vaccination acceptance if it was recommended by government sources, doctors, relatives, or friends. Most participants learned about COVID-19 vaccination from television, radio, and newspapers, followed by community or hospital campaigns and the internet. (4) Conclusions: Government sources and doctors could increase the acceptance of vaccination by promoting the efficacy and safety of COVID-19 vaccination by the use of mass media and emphasizing the necessity of vaccination for everyone.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to spread rapidly worldwide, forcing countries to enact lockdowns and strict social-distancing measures that affect individual and population health. This study investigates the changes in dietary habits and lifestyle behaviors among Saudi residents during the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional survey was conducted on 786 participants, with a mean age of 30 years. The questionnaire was administered online and sent via social media applications. Dietary habits, physical activity, TV-watching time, sleep patterns, stressors, and socio-demographic data were evaluated. Among the survey respondents, there was an increase in weight gain, food consumption, and decreased physical activity. Respondents who gained weight consumed more snacks, ate larger food portions, and engaged in less physical activity. Furthermore, a high fish, water, and supplements intake was noticed. Although respondents' intake of fruits and vegetables was low, most individuals reported a negatively changed intake. However, most respondents reported increased consumption of lean meat and sweet foods. Observing changes in dietary and lifestyle habits during the lockdown period may help elaborate on the pandemic's consequences for population health and assist in formulating and implementing policies for future closures, while supporting vulnerable groups.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic exposed the field of psychotherapy to the need to provide treatment remotely. We discuss the question of whether remote therapy can be curative and if the electronic device used to manage these sessions unites or separates the therapist and the patient. We term the electronic device as 'the inanimate third' in the therapeutic process and discuss the objectivity of the device as opposed to the subjective emotional processes involved. We deal with emotional themes relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic and associated social distancing practices, such as longing, loneliness, the perception of the future and the lost past, and the efficacy of the therapeutic stimulation of fantasy and hope. We also evaluate the possibility of existing transference and countertransference processes while working remotely. We suggest the term 'social paradox' to describe the situation in which an objective entity such as the digital media symbolizes both distance and intimacy as well as separation and unity. We conclude by stating that containment of the social paradox by the therapeutic dialogue is possible as the existence of the dialogue eliminates elements of the paradox.

AB  - COVID-19 affects the paediatric population less frequently than adults. A retrospective study was performed in a tertiary paediatric hospital in Mexico City in children <18 years of age who were hospitalized with a positive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2. Included in the study were 86 patients with a median age of 10 years old (IQR 2.6-14.3 years), who were classified in three groups: previously healthy, with chronic disease and immunosuppressed patients. The principal signs and symptoms were fever (81%), cough (51%) and headache (35%). A total of 20 patients (23%) required management in the paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and 17% needed mechanical ventilation for an average of 12.7 days (IQR 2-29 days). There was no statistically significant difference between the three clinical classification groups in those patients admitted to the PICU, most of which were previously healthy patients. The mortality rate was 5% (four patients). Given that the paediatric population is susceptible to infection, potential transmitters and to clinical presentations with variable degrees of severity, it is important to continue reinforcing social distancing measures.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic redefines how we think about the body, physiologically and socially. But what does it mean to have and to be a body in the COVID-19 pandemic? The COVID-19 pandemic offers data scholars the unique opportunity, and perhaps obligation, to revisit and reinvent the fundamental concepts of our mediated experiences. The article critiques the data double, a longstanding concept in critical data and media studies, as incompatible with the current public health and social distancing imperative. The data double, instead, is now the presupposition of a new data entity, which will emerge out of a current data shimmer: a long-sustaining transition that blurs the older boundaries of bodies and the social, and establishes new ethical boundaries around the (in)activity and (im)mobility of doing nothing to do something. The data double faces a unique dynamic in the COVID-19 pandemic between boredom and exhaustion. Following the currently simple rule to stay home presents data scholars the opportunity to revisit the meaning of data as something given, a shimmering embodied relationship with data that contributes to the common good in a global health crisis.

AB  - Background
   The UP4FUN intervention is a family-involved school-based intervention aiming at reducing and breaking up sitting time at home (with special emphasis on screen time), and breaking up sitting time in school among 10-12 year olds in Europe. The purpose of the present paper was to evaluate its short term effects.
   Methodology/Principal Findings
   A total of 3147 pupils from Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary and Norway participated in a school-randomized controlled trial. The intervention included 1-2 school lessons per week for a period of six weeks, along with assignments for the children and their parents. Screen time and breaking up sitting time were registered by self-report and total sedentary time and breaking up sitting time by accelerometry. The effect of the intervention on these behaviors was evaluated by multilevel regression analyses. All analyses were adjusted for baseline values and gender. Significance level was p <= 0.01. No significant intervention effects were observed, neither for self-reported TV/DVD or computer/game console time, nor for accelerometer-assessed total sedentary time and number of breaks in sitting time. The intervention group, however, reported more positive attitudes towards (beta = 0.25 (95% CI 0.11, 0.38)) and preferences/liking for (beta = 0.20 (95% CI 0.08, 0.32)) breaking up sitting time than the control group.
   Conclusions/Significance
   No significant intervention effect on self-reported screen time or accelerometer-assessed sedentary time or breaks in sitting time was observed, but positive effects on beliefs regarding breaking up sitting time were found in favor of the intervention group. Overall, these results do not warrant wider dissemination of the present UP4FUN intervention.

AB  - Throughout its history, the Supreme Court of the United States has allowed members of the press access to oral arguments and decision releases in its courtroom. However, it took nearly eighty years to formally codify a process by which members of the press were officially credentialed to cover the Court, a pass giving them access to the courtroom beyond the bar, access to walk the halls freely, to work in dedicated space in the building, and access to the justices themselves. This article traces the history of the press credentialing from the day the justices moved into the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., in 1935 to the unprecedented public access granted to oral arguments due to the social distancing required by the COVID19 virus in the spring of 2020. It is meant to fortify the historical record to ensure that the Court remains as open and accessible as possible to reporters because they act as emissaries of the public. The Court's decisions affect all aspects of life for citizens, and therefore public knowledge of the Court's work is essential to a strong democracy. Press access is key to that understanding.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of talent management (TM) practices on employee performance (EP) and to explore the mediating role of employee engagement (EE) on the relationship between TM practices and EP in Malaysian private universities (MPUs). Design/methodology/approach The paper used both descriptive and quantitative approaches, and the unit of analysis of this research consists of MPUs academic staff. The research sample consists of 314 MPUs academic staff, and a questionnaire was used to collect data from the target respondents, while partial least squares-structural equation modelling was used to evaluate the study hypotheses through bootstrapping approach. Findings The research outcome revealed that TM practices that comprise of talent recruitment practice (TRP), training and development practice (T&DP), compensation practice (CP) have a significant effect on EP. Furthermore, EE partially mediates the relationship between T&DP, CP and EP, while EE does not mediate the relationship between TRP and EP in MPUs. Practical implications The research suggests that universities management should focus on TM practices as a tool to achieve and maintain EE and positive attitudes (EP) in relation to work. Originality/value The research makes substantial contributions to the literature by investigating the effect of TM practices on EP through the role of EE as mediation in MPUs. The research is one of the very few studies undertaken in MPUs. Therefore, the results of this research serve as a guide for the universities management to develop their institutional strategies and policies in a manner in which their employees' success can be achieved and encouraged.International Journal of Business and Society.

AB  - The past decade has witnessed an explosion of interest in the partisan polarization of the American electorate. Scholarly investigation of this topic has coincided with the media's portrayal of a polity deeply divided along partisan lines. Yet little research so far has considered the consequences of the media's coverage of political polarization. We show that media coverage of polarization increases citizens' beliefs that the electorate is polarized. Furthermore, the media's depiction of a polarized electorate causes voters to moderate their own issue positions but increases their dislike of the opposing party. These empirical patterns are consistent with our theoretical argument that polarized exemplars in journalistic coverage serve as anti-cues to media consumers. Our findings have important implications for understanding current and future trends in political polarization.

AB  - It has been well documented that Asian Americans have experienced increased social stigmatization related to COVID-19 since Donald Trump began referring to the virus as the "Chinese virus" and "kung flu" in March 2020. Stigma has negative social and health impacts on minority communities, such as labeling, avoiding, shame, disgust, and social exclusion. The health impacts include both physical and mental illness, and the acceleration of health disparities. This study seeks to understand these lived experiences and subsequent coping strategies. Using focus groups, 17 Asian American participants were interviewed to understand their experiences with stigmatization during the pandemic. The findings reveal that stigmatized behavior and attitudes of others did not deter Asian Americans from following the COVID-19 related health guidelines, likely because perceived health threats were high. Consumer behaviors of Asian Americans also changed dramatically toward buying almost everything online (due to both the pandemic and personal safety). This behavioral decisioning provides insights into the complex motivations for adopting health behaviors, and, in this case, social distancing can double as a means by which to avoid people, for fear of becoming victims of stigmatization in public areas.

Design/methodology/approach Experiment 1 (N = 294) examined effects of organization (brand vs nonprofit) and message types (egoistic vs altruistic) on consumer responses to Instagram-based pro-veganism content. Experiment 2 (N = 288) examined effects of source type (celebrity vs noncelebrity) and message valence (positive vs negative) on consumer responses to Instagram-based pro-veganism content. Findings Results demonstrated significant main effects of organization type, with consumers indicating more positive attitudes and higher credibility toward the brand. Significant main effects of message type were also found, with altruistic messages eliciting higher perceived information value than egoistic messages. Subjective norms had moderating effects on attitude toward the organization, while attitude toward veganism had moderating effects on perceived information value. Results also indicated significant main effects of message valence on perceived information value of pro-veganism Instagram posts and significant interaction effects of the two manipulated factors on intention to spread electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM) about pro-veganism. Originality/value Implications for use of Instagram-based health marketing communication about veganism were discussed. Specifically, organizations looking to use social media to influence attitudes and behavioral intentions toward health issues should seek to reach their target audiences through selecting endorsers and messages that will optimally present the health issue in a relatable and engaging way.

KW  - AWARENESS
AB  - Objective
   The objective of this study was to assess the attitude and behaviour of Dutch ENT surgeons and ENT residents towards Evidence Based Medicine.
   Introduction
   Evidence Based Medicine is the cornerstone of modern clinical care. It is considered of crucial importance for optimal patient care and health care quality. Practicing it requires positive attitude and behaviour. Little is known about the attitude and behaviour towards Evidence Based Medicine in otorhinolaryngology.
   Methods
   We performed a web-based questionnaire among 607 Dutch Ear- Nose & Throat surgeons of whom 106 residents (cross-sectional study). The questionnaire consisted of 3 parts; (1) personal characteristics, (2) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine attitude (McColl questionnaire, scale 0-100%) and (3) questions regarding Evidence Based Medicine behaviour (barriers and information seeking behaviour). Data were collected between March 26th 2018 and June 1st 2018.
   Results
   The median score on the overall McColl questionnaire was 50 (IQR 35). The main barriers respondents experienced were time related. Limited time in the outpatient clinic was considered a more important barrier for residents to practice EBM compared to ENT surgeons. Respondents gut feeling and their own preference were identified as the main contributing factors in clinical decision making.
   Conclusion
   In conclusion Dutch ENT surgeons have a moderate attitude on the McColl questionnaire. The main barriers to practice Evidence Based Medicine they experience are time related.

AB  - Contemporary discourse on domestic immigration policy varies widely based on political affiliation, linguistics, and regional differences. This experimental study aimed to concurrently investigate three social psychological bases of attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants in the USA: political ideology, social labels, and social context. Participants were 744 adults, recruited from "New York Community College" ("NYCC"/urban) and "New Jersey Community College" ("NJCC"/suburban), who were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: "illegal" vs. "undocumented." Participants completed a scale measuring their attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants with the embedded label manipulation, followed by the General System Justification scale, and culminating with demographic items. Results demonstrated that whereas social context and political ideology both contributed significantly to the regression model, the social labels did not. Both high system justification and political conservatism predicted negative attitudes, but the latter effect was stronger for suburban students. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between suburban and urban students in the frequency of the social labels "illegal" and "undocumented" heard and seen among family members, friends, and the media. Implications are discussed with a focus on system justification as an explanatory theory for immigration attitudes, as well as contextual effects for it.

AB  - Instant messaging (IM) is increasingly used for family communication amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. However, evidence remains scarce on how family e-chat groups were used and their associations with family and individual wellbeing amidst the pandemic. The numbers of family e-chat groups, functions used, and messages sent and received daily in groups were reported by 4890 adults in May 2020, and their associations with family wellbeing and personal happiness and the mediation effect of family communication quality were examined. Results showed that sending/receiving text messages was most commonly used, followed by receiving/sending photos/pictures, making voice calls, receiving/sending short videos and voice messages, and making video calls. Women and older people used more non-text functions. Higher levels of family wellbeing and personal happiness were associated with having more groups, receiving/sending photos/pictures, video calls, more IM functions used, and more IM messages received/sent daily. Forty-six point two to seventy-five point five percent of their associations with more groups and more functions used were mediated by family communication quality. People having more family e-chat groups and using more IM functions may be more resilient amidst the pandemic, while those without or with low use of family e-chat groups amidst the pandemic would need more attention and assistance in the presence of social distancing.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the education sector of most countries. One of the basic CDC prevention guidelines is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the health of students and staff members to curve the spread of COVID-19. The current study aimed to examine the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of students at the Namibia University of Technology toward the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted using a closed-ended questionnaire. Data were collected from full-time students who were on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic between 29 January to 14 February 2021. The average knowledge about the modes of transmission, protective measures, and clinical symptoms ranged from 78% to 96%. About 31% of student respondents believed the virus was created in a laboratory, and 47% believed the vaccine has negative side effects and therefore, refused to take it. The three main sources of information about COVID-19 were social media (75%), television (63%), and friends and family (50%). The students had an overall positive attitude towards the implementation of NPIs. However, the importance of vaccine safety must be emphasized. Lockdowns should be lifted gradually to reduce the amount of time students are spending on online content. Reopening of classrooms for face-to-face study will bring unquestionable benefits to students and the wider economy.

AB  - Online social platforms or social platforms such as Twitter, Facebook and Instagram have become popular platforms for a public discussion about social topics. Recent studies show that there is a growing tendency for people to talk about COVID-19 pandemic in these online channels. The rapid growth of the infected cases by COVID-19 pandemic makes a lots of anxiety and fear among people. With the recent released of Pfizer vaccine, people start posting a lot of rumors regarding the safety concerns of the vaccine, especially among the elderly people. The aim of this study is to bring out the fact that tweets containing all pertinent details about the COVID-19 vaccine and provides an analysis and understanding of users emotions regarding the recent release of COVID-19 vaccine. This study starts with the collection of tweets related to COVID-19 vaccine and then cleaning the dataset from redundant tweets. In this study, we use Twitter API and Web Scraping techniques to obtain a sample of 50,000 tweets talking about COVID-19 vaccine.Further, The analysis of users emotions is achieved by manually labeling and classifying the tweets to either positive or negative. Then, a deep learning based model is used to train the data and classify the people opinion about COVID-19 vaccine. The experimental results illustrate that high percentage of people have shown a positive attitude towards COVID1-19 vaccine. The proposed method is validated over Twitter datasets and the results also demonstrate that use of deep learning classifier can successfully improve the accuracy of people emotions analysis with an accuracy up to 98% for training set and the accuracy for testing set is 73%.

AB  - The antecedents of immigration attitudes have been extensively examined in academic research, in particular, with respect to media use and personal contact with immigrants. Research on the role of interpersonal discussions about the issue of immigration has been scarce, however. Results from a two-wave panel survey show that individuals holding unfavorable attitudes towards immigration engaged more often in interpersonal communication about immigration, which colored the overall effect of engaging in such discussions. The implications of these results are discussed in the concluding section.

AB  - Purpose An increasing number of brands are using algorithms to embed brand-related content to targeted consumers' social media pages. This paper aims to analyze how do consumers' motives of using social media in general influence their potential brand-consumer interactions and the following branding outcomes. To examine this, this study selected Facebook as the social media platform and Nike as the brand to conduct an online survey experiment to examine the effects of social media usage motives on consumers' interactions with the brand in social media. Design/methodology/approach An online survey experiment using Nike's Facebook page as the stimuli was conducted to analyze the interactions between consumers and a specific brand's social media page in a natural setting. Data were collected in the USA via Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). Findings This study demonstrated that brand-consumer interactions, both content-consumption and content-contribution intentions, can be fostered by certain motives of using social media: information-seeking and self-identity. This study also suggested that content-consumption behavior has significant associations with consumers' positive attitudes toward the brand's social media pages, while content-contribution behavior does not show significant effects. Originality/value This study provides new insights about how consumers' general motives of social media usage influence their intentions to interact with the brand in social media from two levels (i.e. content-consumption and content-contribution).

AB  - Many North American cities are building bicycling infrastructure. Lively discussions on social media, where people passionately support or reject bicycling infrastructure projects, provide a unique data set on attitudes towards bicycling infrastructure. Our goal is to analyse social media posts in Edmonton and Victoria, Canada as new bike infrastructure was implemented to understand the thematic and social elements of the conversation and how these changed over time. We collected Twitter messages (n= 13,121: 7640 in Edmonton; 5481 in Victoria) and compared three timeframes: before lanes opened (January 2015 to lane opening); the first riding season (opening to April 2017); and the second riding season (May 2017 to November 2018). For each timeframe, we evaluated word-combination frequencies (to understand the use of language) and social network structures (to understand which accounts were influential and how they interacted). We observed a change in the three time periods. Before the bicycling infrastructure was built, Twitter activity was focused on advocacy, which was especially strong in Victoria. The first riding season had the most social media activity, the most diverse perspectives and the most controversy. The second riding season held more support. Based on the Twitter activity, we found that Edmonton had more support from local businesses and traditional media, launching a connected network of infrastructure with less social media opposition. Our results suggest that attitudes associated with change in bicycling infrastructure may have a cycle, with initial negative responses to change, followed by an uptick in positive attitudes.

KW  - Socio-economic ranking

AB  - The COVID19 pandemic motivated an interesting debate, which is related directly to core issues in urban economics, namely, the advantages and disadvantages of dense cities. On the one hand, compact areas facilitate more intensive human interaction and could lead to higher exposure to the infection, which make them the potential epicenter of the pandemic crisis. On the other hand, dense areas tend to provide superior health and educational systems, which are better prepared to handle pandemics, leading to higher recovery rates and lower mortality rates. The objective of the current study is to test the relationship between COVID19 infection rates (cases & DIVIDE;population) as the dependent variable, and two explanatory variables, population density and socioeconomic measures, within two timeframes: May 11, 2020 and January 19, 2021. We use a different methodology to address the relationship between COVID19 spread and population density by fitting a parabolic, instead of a linear, model, while controlling socio-economic indices. We thus apply a better examination of the factors that shape the COVID19 spread across time and space by permitting a non-monotonic relationship. Israel provides an interesting case study based on a highly non-uniform distribution of urban population, and diversified populations. Results of the analyses demonstrate two patterns of change: 1) a significant rise in the median and average infection-population ratio for each level of population density; and 2) a moderate (a steep) rise in infection rates with increased population density on May 11, 2020 (January 19, 2021) for population densities of 4000 to 20,000 persons per square kilometer. The significant rise in the average and median infection-population ratios might be as attributed to the outcome of new COVID19 variants (i.e., the British and the South African mutants), which, in turn, intensify the virus spread. The steeper slope of infection rates and the rise in the standard deviation of the infection-population ratio may be explained by non-uniform spatial distribution of: dissemination of information in a variety of language; different levels of medical infrastructure in different parts of the country; varying levels of compliance to social distancing rules; and strict (limited) compliance to social distancing rules. The last factor of limited compliance might be the outcome of premature optimism due to extensive scope of the vaccination campaign in Israel, which is located in first place globally.

AB  - Background: Public health responses to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) including lockdowns may negatively impact physical and mental functioning in clinical populations. People living with multiple sclerosis (MS) may be more susceptible to physical function deterioration while practicing social distancing. Recent reports have suggested that about 50% of people with MS (pwMS) decreased their leisure physical activity during COVID-19, and upwards of 30% reported decreased physical fitness levels. However, the impact of social distancing on adverse health-related outcomes such as falls has not received much scrutiny. Therefore, we explored the frequency and characteristics of falls experienced by people living with and without MS during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: Two-hundred and thirty-nine individuals, including 106 pwMS (median age: 59 years) and 133 people living without MS (median age: 66 years) were recruited for this cross-sectional study. A snowball sampling strategy was used for online recruitment. Participants completed a customized falls questionnaire and the number of falls experienced (if any) during COVID-19 was recorded. Fall-related characteristics such as the timing, locations, activities undertaken before falling and consequences, as well as self-reported physical activity were also recorded.
   Results: Overall, participants reported 232 falls (1.67 falls/person in pwMS and 0.41 falls/person in non-MS participants). People living with MS (pwMS) had a significantly higher frequency of falls (58.5% vs 21.8%; p< 0.001) and recurrent falls (45.3% vs 9.8%; p<0.001) compared to non-MS participants. Additionally, pwMS reported a significantly higher proportion of in-home falls (83.9% vs 54.2%; p = 0.004), as well as a higher proportion of overall injuries (44.3% vs 12.5%, p<0.001), fractures (5.7% vs 0.8%, p = 0.048), and healthcare utilization (9.4% vs 1.6%, p = 0.007) compared to non-MS participants. A similar proportion of pwMS (49.1%) and non-MS participants (52.2%) reported lower physical activity levels during COVID-19.
   Conclusion: This cross-sectional study revealed that pwMS remain at high risk of falls and fall-related outcomes during COVID-19. The high number of falls experienced by pwMS is of clinical concern considering the current strain on the healthcare system. Findings from this study highlight the importance of monitoring falls and the potential for telerehabilitation in persons with MS during COVID-19.

AB  - Researchers using directed network data to estimate peer effects must somehow handle unreciprocated nominations. To better understand how peer effects operate and how best to estimate their effects, this paper investigates how the reciprocation of friendship mediates peer effects. We begin by characterizing how reciprocated and unreciprocated friendships compare in terms of the amount of interaction and social distance. We then use a higher order spatial autoregressive (SAR) model to investigate the differential effects of reciprocated friends, unreciprocated friends, and unchosen friends (i.e. an incoming friendship nomination that is not reciprocated) on adolescents' behaviors and outcomes using data from the Add Health study. We find that adolescents experience heterogenous influences from friends, with the greatest effect from reciprocated friends, intermediate effects from unreciprocated friends, and the smallest, but positive effects from unchosen friends. Our results indicate that it is misleading to assign equal weight to all friends or to impose symmetry on unreciprocated friendship nominations, as is often done. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background. Organ transplantation is the optimal treatment for end-stage organ diseases. The demand for organs has exceeded the available supply, which becomes a major obstacle worldwide. Identifying the factors affecting this gap will help in overcoming this obstacle. The purpose of the work was to study the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of organ donation and to determine the knowledge of brain death among social media users.
   Methods. A cross-sectional study was conducted among social media users living in Saudi Arabia. A pre-designed self-administrated questionnaire was distributed online randomly on social media networks in 2015. Of the total 1368 participants, only 913 met the criteria.
   Results. Most respondents were between 18 and 29 years of age (61.2%) and living in the central region of Saudi Arabia (64.5%). The majority of respondents received their information from television (57%) and social media (50%) networks; 46.4% of respondents knew that the religious fatwa allowed organ donation; 51% of respondents were willing to donate their organs; 46.5% considered the brain-dead to be deceased, whereas 37.7% considered it a coma; 33.3% did not know if someone who was brain dead would ever wake up; on the other hand, 323 (35.4%) said yes.
   Conclusions. Our study showed that the vast majority of our sample had enough information about organ donation. On the contrary, they had minimal knowledge about brain death. Moreover, a fair percentage of the participants had positive attitudes toward organ donation. Also, the media had a significant effect on the information about organ donation and brain death.

We also conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the associations between human mobility (i.e., subway ridership) on the week of April 11, 2020, sociodemographic factors, and coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence as of April 26, 2020. Areas with lower median income, a greater percentage of individuals who identify as non-White and/or Hispanic/Latino, a greater percentage of essential workers, and a greater percentage of health-care essential workers had more mobility during the pandemic. When adjusted for the percentage of essential workers, these associations did not remain, suggesting essential work drives human movement in these areas. Increased mobility and all sociodemographic variables (except percentage of people older than 75 years old and percentage of health-care essential workers) were associated with a higher rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people, when adjusted for testing effort. Our study demonstrates that the most socially disadvantaged not only are at an increased risk for COVID-19 infection, they lack the privilege to fully engage in social distancing interventions.

AB  - Purpose
   This paper aims to examine tweet posts regarding Typhoon Washi to contend the usefulness of social media and big data as an aid of post-disaster management. Through topic modelling and content analysis, this study examines the priorities of the victims expressed in Twitter and how the priorities changed over a year.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Social media, particularly Twitter, was where the data gathered. Using big data technology, the gathered data were processed and analysed according to the objectives of the study. Topic modelling was used in clustering words from different topics. Clustered words were then used for content analysis in determining the needs of the victims. Word frequency count was also used in determining what words were repeatedly used during the course period. To validate the gathered data online, government documents were requested and concerned government agencies were also interviewed.
   Finding
   Findings of this study argue that housing and relief goods have been the top priorities of the victims. Victims are seeking relief goods, especially when they are in evacuation centres. Also, the lack of legal basis hinders government officials from integrating social media information unto policymaking.
   Research limitation
   This study only reports Twitter posts containing keywords either, Sendong, SendongPH, Washi or TyphoonWashi. The keywords were determined based on the words that trended after Typhoon Washi struck.
   Practical implication
   For social media and big data to be adoptable and efficacious, supporting and facilitating conditions are necessary. Structural, technical and financial support, as well as legal framework, should be in place. Maintaining and sustaining positive attitude towards it should be taken care of.
   Originality/value
   Although many studies have been conducted on the usefulness of social media in times of disaster, many of these focused on the use of social media as medium that can efficiently spread information, and little has been done on how the government can use both social media and big data in collecting and analysing the needs of the victims. This study fills those gaps in social big data literature.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this study is to explore undergraduate accounting students' perceptions and understanding of the concept of sustainable development. Moreover, this study aims to explore students' perceptions of the integration of sustainable development issues in accounting education in Saudi Arabia as an emerging country.
   Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was administered to a sample of accounting students from four Saudi universities. The questionnaire contained five groups of questions aimed at exploring the extent of students' awareness and understanding of the concept of sustainable development, their perceptions of the importance of sustainable development for society, their perceptions of the important role of accounting in sustainable development, their satisfaction with the level of integrating sustainable development issues in accounting education at the present time and their opinions about the appropriate approach to integrate sustainable development issues in accounting education.
   Findings - The findings of the study revealed that although most of the students have heard about the concept of sustainable development from the media and perceive the importance of sustainable development for society, they have a low level of understanding of this concept due to the apparent weakness in integrating sustainable development issues in accounting education in Saudi universities. Students were unsatisfied with the sustainable development learning offered by Saudi universities. They also showed a positive attitude toward integrating sustainable development issues in their accounting education. They suggested that the appropriate approach to integrate sustainable development issues in accounting education is to treat these issues in the relevant courses included in their current accounting curricula.
   Practical implications - The results of this study provide indications to the administrators of Saudi universities to start developing accounting curriculum to integrate sustainable development issues into accounting education. This will result in an increase in the effectiveness of the role of these universities in achieving the goals of the Saudi Vision 2030.
   Originality/value - This study contributes to the existing literature concerning how students perceive sustainable development education by focusing on the accounting students in Saudi Arabia as context that has not previously examined.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the viral strain that has caused the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, has presented healthcare systems around the world with an unprecedented challenge. In locations with significant rates of viral transmission, social distancing measures and enforced 'lockdowns' are the new 'norm' as governments try to prevent healthcare services from being overwhelmed. However, with these measures have come important challenges for the delivery of existing services for other diseases and conditions. The clinical care of patients with pituitary disorders typically involves a multidisciplinary team, working in concert to deliver timely, often complex, disease investigation and management, including pituitary surgery. COVID-19 has brought about major disruption to such services, limiting access to care and opportunities for testing (both laboratory and radiological), and dramatically reducing the ability to safely undertake transsphenoidal surgery. In the absence of clinical trials to guide management of patients with pituitary disease during the COVID-19 pandemic, herein the Professional Education Committee of the Pituitary Society proposes guidance for continued safe management and care of this population.

AB  - Radio broadcasting played a critical role in the 'cultural' Cold War waged by the Western and Eastern bloc powers. Nowhere was this clearer than in divided Berlin, where stations on both sides of the Iron Curtain vied with one another to define the political narrative and shape public opinion. The American-funded broadcaster RIAS Berlin quickly became one of the most important elements of the United States propaganda offensive against the German Democratic Republic. Founded in 1946, RIAS was reportedly one of the most popular sources for news and information in the German Democratic Republic throughout the 1950s. Listeners in East Germany saw RIAS as an objective alternative to East Germany's state-run, overtly propagandistic media organs, despite the fact that RIAS was a propaganda broadcaster itself. Using RIAS's news broadcasts as a case study, this essay examines the nature and impact of American propaganda on East Germany and the Soviet Bloc during the early Cold War. Drawing on surveys, letters, and polls of East German listening habits conducted by American and West German agencies, this essay argues that RIAS's popularity stemmed from its staff's decision to present news programming that balanced anti-communism with an 'objective' tone and style of presentation. For RIAS's staff, 'objective' reporting entailed broadcasts that presented accurate information that also undermined the legitimacy of the East German state. In doing this, RIAS was able to find a substantial audience willing to embrace the station's anti-communist programming and its attacks on the ruling Socialist Unity Party (SED).

AB  - Background Telemedicine has become an integral part of health care delivery in recent years. One of the leading applications for this use is WhatsApp - a free smartphone application that allows instant messaging with pictures and videos. This study analyzed the emerging role of WhatsApp on reducing the need for referrals to medical specialists and to compare the views of physicians regarding WhatsApp consultations. Methods A cross-sectional study based on an anonymous web-survey was conducted among PCPs and medical specialists working in the Israel Defense Forces Medical-Corps during September and October, 2019. Results Of 201 participants, 153 were PCPs and 48 were medical specialists. 86.9 % of PCPs and 86.5 % of specialists used WhatsApp every day in professional settings. Added workload, potential breaching of patient confidentiality and lack of full documentation of consultations were the main concerns among physicians using the application. 60.7 % of PCPs and 95.7 % of specialists stated that these consultations have reduced the need for in-person appointments at least once a week. Conclusions In times of COVID-19 that require social distancing, WhatsApp provides a simple, readily available platform for consultations between healthcare providers, even to the extent of rendering some in-person appointments unnecessary. Healthcare organizations should address the matters troubling healthcare providers, mainly patient confidentiality and lack of documentation in patients' medical records, while providing adequate compensation for those providing the service during and after work hours.

AB  - This study examined the association between core job components (i.e. teaching, research, and student assessment), physical activity (PA), and mental health in a post-COVID-19 context. An online questionnaire administered via Google Forms was used to gather data from 1064 African academics in four countries. A sensitivity analysis was applied to adjust for covariates. Data were analyzed with the hierarchical linear regression analysis. The average age of participants was 44 years. The study found that PA was positively associated with research but negatively associated with student assessment. Mental health was positively associated with onsite teaching but negatively associated with online teaching and research. PA did not predict mental health and mediate the relationship between the job components and mental health. It is concluded that PA may not increase mental health in African academics in a post-COVID-19 situation that required the resumption of work while observing social distancing protocols.

AB  - Background: Identifying the factors that affect adolescents' participation in physical activity is considered as an important topic concerning public health.
   Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to test the effects of the constructs of the planned behavior theory on the physical activity behaviors of beginner Volleyball adolescent students.
   Methods: We used a descriptive-correlational approach in the present study. The participants comprised 112 middle school students from Urmia, Iran, 2020. The Research was conducted on the basis of the Theory of Planned Behavior, and the physical activity behaviors were objectively measured by the use of an accelerometer. To analyze the data, we used the structural equation method.
   Results: Results showed that attitude and perceived behavioral control had significant impacts on the intention to physical activity (both T>1.96). However, no significant effect was observed for the subjective norm on intention to physical activity (T=0.152). Moreover, intention to physical activity significantly affected the moderate-to-vigorous physical activities (T>1.96). Finally, attitude and perceived behavioral control had significant effects on moderate-to-vigorous physical activities through a mediation by intention to physical activity (all P<0.001). The daily MVPA was 45.48 minutes, which is below the WHO-guideline.
   Conclusions: Findings indicate that those participants with more positive attitudes and higher perceived behavioral control had greater intentions to engage in physical activities.

AB  - Background Research has shown that ethnic minority groups are less likely to participate in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening than the majority population and hence less likely to be diagnosed at an early stage when treatment is potentially more successful.
   Objective To explore knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding CRC and CRC screening among ethnic minority groups in the Netherlands.
   Design We conducted qualitative interviews with 30 first-generation immigrants born in Turkey, Morocco and Surinam. We based the topic guide on the health belief model. Framework analysis was used to analyse our data.
   Results Although knowledge of CRC and CRC screening was limited, all respondents felt susceptible to CRC. CRC screening was perceived to mainly benefit those individuals with poor health and symptoms. Although most respondents had a positive attitude towards CRC screening, knowledge about its potential harms was limited and self-efficacy to participate was low. Adult children acted as important mediators in providing access to information. The language barrier and low literacy formed serious barriers to informed participation in CRC screening.
   Conclusion To ensure that all eligible individuals, including ethnic minority groups, have equal opportunities to informed participation in screening, targeted communication strategies should be developed, such as oral and visual channels, and face-to-face communication in the mother tongue. This will help ethnic minority groups to make an informed decision about participation in CRC screening.

AB  - Objective This study investigated the efficacy of an internet-based personalized decision support (PDS) tool designed to aid in the decision to screen for colorectal cancer (CRC) using a fecal occult blood test. We tested whether the efficacy of the tool in influencing attitudes to screening was mediated by perceived usability and acceptability, and considered the role of computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety in these relationships.
   Methods Eighty-one participants aged 50-76 years worked through the on-line PDS tool and completed questionnaires on computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, attitudes to and beliefs about CRC screening before and after exposure to the PDS, and perceived usability and acceptability of the tool.
   Results Repeated measures ANOVA found that PDS exposure led to a significant increase in knowledge about CRC and screening, and more positive attitudes to CRC screening as measured by factors from the Preventive Health Model. Perceived usability and acceptability of the PDS mediated changes in attitudes toward CRC screening (but not CRC knowledge), and computer self-efficacy and computer anxiety were significant predictors of individuals' perceptions of the tool.
   Conclusion Interventions designed to decrease computer anxiety, such as computer courses and internet training, may improve the acceptability of new health information technologies including internet-based decision support tools, increasing their impact on behavior change.

AB  - Use of educational games is an approach that has potential to change the existing educational method. This is due to games popularity among younger generation as well as engagement and fun features of games compared to conventional learning method. In addition, games are among the most widespread media amongst younger generation or so-called "digital natives" apart from movie, music and internet technology. Game play activities is an important issue to be thoroughly understood due to the facts that many of them are addicted to game play activity. In contrast, conventional learning approaches are not interesting enough to the younger generation. Thus, integration of games technology into education is potentially believed to increase student interest and motivation to learn. This study developed and evaluates an online educational game for learning Programming Introductory course at a university in Malaysia. A total of 180 undergraduate students from computer and engineering background participate in the study. Findings shows that about 80% of students have positive attitude towards the games with around 84% of them find that the games is a fun way to learn, at the same time, an average of 80% agreed that the game provide them with opportunity to learn. Furthermore, about 75% of the students agreed that the game make them able to do self-assessment for Programming course. It was interesting to find that almost 85% of the student said that they will want to use educational games as their future learning approach. Despite many more evidence will be needed especially in Malaysia context, this study is important to rationalize that games can be one of the new learning approaches in the future.

AB  - Background: Despite consistent evidence showing the importance of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF) for six months, it remains a sub-optimal practice in The Gambia. This study aimed at investigating the determinants of EBF knowledge and intention to or practice of EBF.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 334 women receiving care at the Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital (EFSTH) from December 2015 to February 2016. Using a structured interviewer-administered questionnaire, knowledge on EBF was determined and scored. Participants scoring above or equal to the median were determined to have sufficient EBF knowledge. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of EBF knowledge and intention to or practice of exclusive breastfeeding.
   Results: The proportion of women with sufficient exclusive breastfeeding knowledge and intended to or practice EBF were 60.2% and 38.6% respectively, while only 34.4% received EBF counseling. Earning >= 1500 GMD monthly (Adjusted Odds Ratio [aOR] 1.98; 95% Confidence Interval [Cl] 1.24, 3.16), having positive attitude (aOR 2.40; 95% Cl 1.40, 4.10) and partner supporting EBF (aOR 2.18; 95% Cl 1.23, 3.87) predicted sufficient EBF knowledge. Mothers aged 26-34 years (aOR 0.50; 9 5% Cl 0.31, 0.82) and EBF counseling (aOR 2.68; 95% Cl 1.68, 4.29) significantly associated with intention to or practice of exclusive breastfeeding.
   Conclusion: In conclusion, improving EBF rates will, therefore, require improved access to information on EBF targeting low socio-economically disadvantaged and older mothers. In addition, emphasis on strengthening the ongoing EBF counseling already within the health system is required.

AB  - Vicarious experience gained through seeing women breastfeed may influence infant feeding decisions and self-efficacy. Our aim was to measure the attributes of seeing breastfeeding and to investigate how these relate to feeding intention (primary outcome) and behaviour (secondary outcome). First, we developed a Seeing Breastfeeding Scale (SBS), which consisted of five attitudes (Cronbach's alpha of 0.86) to most recently observed breastfeeding: 'I felt embarrassed'; 'I felt uncomfortable'; 'I did not know where to look'; and 'It was lovely' and 'It didn't bother me'. Test-retest reliability showed agreement (with one exception, kappas ranged from 0.36 to 0.71). Second, we conducted a longitudinal survey of 418 consecutive pregnant women in rural Scotland. We selected the 259 women who had never breastfed before for further analysis. Following multiple adjustments, women who agreed that 'It was lovely to see her breastfeed' were more than six times more likely to intend to breastfeed compared with women who disagreed with the statement [odds ratio (OR) 6.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.85-15.82]. Women who completed their full-time education aged 17 (OR 3.09, 95% CI 1.41-6.77) or aged 19 (OR 7.41 95% CI 2.51-21.94) were more likely to initiate breastfeeding. Women who reported seeing breastfeeding within the preceding 12 months were significantly more likely to agree with the statement 'It was lovely to see her breastfeed' (P = 0.02). Positive attitudes to recently seen breastfeeding are more important determinants of feeding intention than age of first seeing breastfeeding, the relationship to the person seen and seeing breastfeeding in the media.

AB  - Introduction: Obesity, body image and eating disorders are particularly common among adolescent girls and young women. While negative body image is the major focus of research, it is also important from the aspect of prevention to explore the factors that influence positive attitudes towards our bodies and body appreciation. Objective: Our aim was to analyze the determinants of body appreciation in young women, including different types of eating disorders, physical activity, body mass index, various psychological characteristics, and whether there is a family history of eating disorders or obesity. Method: Participants were a sample of female university students (n = 262; mean age: 22.0 +/- 2.2 years). Data were collected via an online questionnaire. Body appreciation was measured using the Body Appreciation Scale (BAS-2), supplemented by the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R), and the "Internalization - General" subscale of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Ques-tionnaire-3 (SATAQ-3) to measure psychological characteristics. Results: Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that self-esteem has the strongest relationship with young women's body appreciation; sporting and optimism are also significant but to a lesser extent, while body mass index and dieting are negative predictors. Likewise, a strong susceptibility to the internalization of media content is also detrimental to body appreciation. Oral control, which can be found among the symptoms of anorexia nervosa, is a mild positive predictor of body appreciation. Conclusion: Our data highlight the importance of body appreciation in the treatment and prevention of body image and eating disorders. There is a great need for fostering positive body image and body appreciation, as the lack of acceptance of our bodies and the extreme adherence towards an overemphasized skinny body ideal can easily lead to pathological dieting.

KW  - BENEFITS
AB  - Green care, an alternative healthcare system that involves the use of nature, is proven to be useful in the management of organic and psychological disorders worldwide. There are various forms of Green care including Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT), a type where animals play pivotal roles in the healing process and is widely used in many developed countries. We assessed the level of awareness and attitude towards Green care among medical students of Ghana. Using a cross-sectional study design and a semistructured questionnaire designed on Google Forms, data were collected from randomly selected 4(th)-, 5(th)-, and 6(th)-year medical students of the University for Development Studies, Tamale, Ghana. The data submitted by 206 of the students were analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences, Version 25, and the results were presented as frequencies, percentages, and charts. The association between sociodemographic characteristics of respondents and awareness about Animal-Assisted Therapy (AAT) was considered significant at p<0.05. The study found that only 7 (3.4%) of the medical students had ever heard of Green care while a higher number of 36 (17.5%) were aware of AAT mostly through movies and television. However, the majority, 122 (59.3%), had a positive attitude towards the introduction of AAT, into their medical training curriculum. Up to 146 (70.9%) of the respondents suggested lectures and practical sessions as their preferred way of acquiring knowledge and skills on AAT. Only the sex of the respondents was significantly associated with awareness of AAT, with females having a better awareness of AAT (28.6% vs. 11.0%, p=0.003). We conclude that awareness of Green care practices among medical students in Ghana was highly inadequate, but the desire of the majority of them to acquire knowledge and skills in this proven alternative therapy makes its future use in Ghana promising.

AB  - Aims and objectives To identify the intention of nurses to dual practice (DP) and inform policymaking in centralised government settings. Background DP is pervasive worldwide but was not permitted in China until 2009, with a primary goal of encouraging nurses from over-staffed health services to work additional shifts in understaffed settings. Design A descriptive cross-sectional survey. Methods A DP questionnaire based on the theory of planned behaviour was developed and issued to nurses from three comprehensive public hospitals in 24 units selected by stratified random cluster sampling (n = 526). This study was reported based on STROBE checklist. Results The mean for intention was 3.47 with strongly disagree as one point, neutral as three point and strongly agree as five point in scaling. Nurses with any of these characteristics: female, aged between 40 and 49, married, working more than 15 years, and managers were significantly reluctant to undertake DP. The structural equation model showed that the level of positive attitude, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control could positively predict intention, and attitude had highest effect value. Perceived behavioural control and attitude acted as sequential mediators between subjective norm and intention. Nurses preferred large or private hospitals if conducting DP without restriction from the government. Conclusions Nurses' intention to undertake DP was not strong, which was impacted by attitude, subjective norm, time and energy. Nurses preferred large or private hospitals; therefore, the goal of improving equity by DP in developing countries might be undermined. Relevance to clinical practice To encourage DP, attitude and subjective norm are important paths, the latter being the initial step. Reasonable incentives or restrictions, such as specifying regulations on practice place and time limitation, qualifications and legal liability and remuneration are recommended to ensure successful DP implementation from over-staffed health services to understaffed settings.

KW  - Osteoporosis
AB  - Background: As silent and preventable in nature, postmenopausal osteoporosis awareness should be raised among young women prior to an irreversible period of declining bone mass. We therefore decided to assess the inter-correlation of knowledge, attitude and osteoporosis preventive behaviors in women around the age of peak bone mass.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 430 women aged 20-35 years. The participants' knowledge, attitude and behaviors concerning osteoporosis prevention were assessed along with demographic data using a four-part questionnaire. The items in this questionnaire were established by extensive literature review, including the Guideline for Management of Osteoporosis of the Thai Osteoporosis Foundation (TOPF) 2010. The content was validated by experts in osteoporosis and reliability was obtained with a Cronbach's alpha score of 0.83.
   Results: The mean age of women in this study was 29.4 +/- 4.6 years. Half of the participants (49.5%) had heard about osteoporosis, mostly from television (95.3%, n = 203/213) and the internet (72.8%, n = 155/213). Most women had certain knowledge (85.2%) and positive attitude towards osteoporosis (53.3%). Nevertheless, 80% of the studied population did not have appropriate osteoporosis behaviors. We found significant correlation between the level of attitudes and osteoporosis behaviors (adjusted odd ratio = 3.3 with 95% confidence interval of 1.9-5.7); attitude and educational level (adjusted odd ratio = 2.2 with 95% confidence interval of 1.4-3.4); and attitude and knowledge (adjusted odd ratio = 3.5 with 95% confidence interval of 1.8-6.8).
   Conclusion: Despite having certain knowledge about osteoporosis, the young women did not seem to have appropriate osteoporosis preventive behaviors. Developing a right attitude towards osteoporosis may be a key determinant to improving health practices in order to prevent osteoporosis.

AB  - Background. While the current literature provides valuable insight into how school climate perceptions and student motivation impact academic achievement, research examining the mediating effects of motivation in the linking of an innovative educational system, school climate, and achievement is limited. This study considers the potential of the El'konin-Davydov system of developmental education as a basis for educational innovation. Self-determination theory is applied as a useful theoretical framework that allows for consideration of both the intensity and the quality of academic motivation.
   Objective. The study examines a model that illustrates the role of intrinsic and different types of extrinsic motivation in linking the El'konin-Davydov system of developmental education (DE) and school climate to the academic achievement of elementary schoolchildren.
   Design. Participants were 345 third and fourth graders drawn from four public schools in Moscow, with some (N = 192, 2 schools) educated in the traditional system and others (N = 153, 2 schools) in one that follows the DE system. A cross-sectional design was implemented.
   Results. Students in the DE system showed significantly lower external motivation for all three subscales (Parents, Teachers, General) and perceived school climate more favorably. Structural equation modeling showed that the hypothesized model fit the data well, supporting the hypothesis that student external motivation plays a mediating role in linking educational system (innovative vs. traditional) with academic achievement. Students' autonomous motivation was shown to play a mediating role in linking positive perceptions of school climate with academic achievement.
   Conclusion. The elementary school students from developmental education classes compared to their peers from traditional education classes demonstrate more positive profile of academic motivation including lower external motivation, more positive attitude towards school and study; however, the two groups do not differ in the level of intrinsic, identified, and introjected motivations.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the practices of strategic crisis communication of most successful Croatian companies and the perception of these practices from the perspective of media. A framework of reactive strategies is applied to determine how Croatian companies from five major industries would communicate during crisis situations and how their communication is interpreted within the media as a group that conveys and presents their behavior and communication to the broader public.
   Design/methodology/approach - A quantitative survey among 60 individuals in charge of communications in Croatian companies was conducted to identify which strategies they are likely to use when in crisis situations. In-depth interviews with 20 journalists regularly reporting on these companies were undertaken to determine their perception and experiences regarding how these companies would communicate during crisis situations.
   Findings - Croatian companies are likely to communicate un-strategically, passively and without any risk. Journalists see the communication of the companies even more passive and reactive which seriously influences the manner they report about these companies during crisis situations.
   Research limitations/implications - Although 60 companies and 20 journalists both represent a significantly representative sample in Croatian terms, the study provides an insight into only Croatian corporate environment. Conducting the research in different surroundings and other countries could provide additional insight. Nevertheless, the analyzed variables that influenced the selection of strategies provide notable insight for drawing conclusions on this subject.
   Originality/value - Besides showing how analyzed companies are likely to communicate during crises, this paper provides an insight into the media's perception of this communication. The research has shown that the media sees their communication as more passive and reactive than it actually is, which implicates a serious need of shift in communication patterns if these companies want to strive to gain mutual understanding and remotely positive attitude from the media during crisis situations.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the influences of psychological capital (PsyCap) on work engagement. It also investigated the role of work empowerment as a mediator and authentic leadership as a moderator.
   Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 599 knowledge workers in a Korean conglomerate. For statistical analysis, the authors conducted the confirmatory factor analysis, reliability and correlation analysis, and hierarchical multiple regression analyses.
   Findings - The results suggest that employees were highly engaged when they had higher PsyCap. Work empowerment partially mediated the relationship between PsyCap and work engagement. While authentic leadership was found to moderate the relationship between PsyCap and work empowerment, the proposed moderation effect of authentic leadership on the relationship between PsyCap and work engagement turned out to be non- significant.
   Research limitations/implications - The sample of this study was focused on knowledge workers in the Korean private sector who are mostly male junior or middle managers. This empirical study relied on a cross- sectional survey method. As the results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, however, common method variance was found not to be of great concern.
   Practical implications - HR and OD practitioners can help employees develop more positive attitudes about their work. It is also important to improve employees' empowerment and engagement level not only by helping employees enhance the level of PsyCap, but also by job enrichment and by developing authentic and supportive leadership.
   Originality/value - The contributions of this study to theory lie in the fact that it: took an integrative approach encompassing both personal and contextual factors; introduced relatively new constructs in empowerment and engagement research: PsyCap and authentic leadership; was an international study, based on Korean cultural context.

AB  - Issues related to ethnic-cultural diversity often make the news headlines in popular media and have attracted extensive attention in the political arena, as well as in academic research in psychology, political sciences, and sociology. Political scientist Robert Putnam reported that increased diversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including less trust, a decreased sense of community, more prejudice, and more cynicism and mistrust toward politics and politicians. Yet given that follow-up studies have often revealed mixed results, a novel approach to understanding the effects of diversity is needed. Here, we address the impact of diversity from a Person x Context interaction perspective, demonstrating that diversity aggravates the negative attitudes that already exist among certain individuals. Specifically, we review the accumulated evidence showing that people high in authoritarian attitudes are particularly sensitive to diversity and prone to react with increased negativity to out-groups, politicians, the political system, and democracy.

AB  - This study examines how the governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania influence public attitudes to legitimise their regimes through the media. It is based on a survey of 1 395 citizens in 15 provinces of East Africa, who were selected using a stratified multistage cluster sampling. Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) estimated whether government influence on public attitudes towards regime legitimacy vary between users of state-owned and privately owned media, while accounting for education levels. Government influence on public attitudes towards regime legitimacy had a negative influence within provinces and had no significant positive influence across provinces when education levels were high. But the data show that those governments build their political influence by taking advantage of citizens who are less educated and lack a basic understanding of their political rights.

AB  - Social distancing plays a leading role in controlling the spread of coronavirus. However, prolonged lockdown can lead to negative consequences in terms of mental health. The goal of the research is to examine the relationship between anxiety and general psychosomatic functioning during the COVID-19 pandemic; the impact of psychological flexibility and mindfulness is also considered. Variables were measured with self-report questionnaires and symptom checklists. The sample included 170 people (M = 27.79, SD = 8.16). Pearson's correlation, stepwise regression, and path analysis were conducted. The results showed a significant positive relationship between state anxiety and somatic and psychological responses to the pandemic. Path analysis revealed that mindfulness had a direct negative impact on and decreased the level of state anxiety (b = -0.22, p = 0.002), whereas psychological flexibility influenced the variable indirectly (b = 0.23, p = 0.002) by enhancing psychosomatic functioning (b = -0.64, p < 0.001). Psychological flexibility and mindfulness may mediate the development of mental disorders and facilitate achieving overall wellbeing. The study points to the usefulness of mindfulness practice as a form of self-help with anxiety symptoms; this is crucial during the pandemic because contact with clients is restricted.

AB  - The motivations for spontaneous phonetic convergence have implications for theories of memory, speech production and perception, social cognition, contact-induced language change, and any number of other phenomena. Thus, this paper examines two distinct but related theoretical positions commonly taken on the motivations for spontaneous phonetic convergence: the Automatist stance and the Interventionist stance. Automatists argue that phonetic convergence is the automatic result of the unmediated action of a perception-production link; of the action of general psychological processes such as priming and simulation effects on linguistic representations in the brain. Interventionists, on the other hand, argue that convergence is the product of the very mediation of the perception-production link, be it linguistic or social mediation, typically for the purpose of managing the social distance between interlocutors. I argue that these seemingly diametrically opposed stances are in fact complementary, not contra-dictory-having been developed to describe data at various points along a continuum of sociality-and that it is most productive to understand one's own position on the issue from this standpoint. Topics such as exemplar theory, gestural drift, entrainment, and communication accommodation theory are discussed for their relevance to the question at hand.

AB  - Social distancing and public safety measures enacted in response to COVID-19 created a surge in methodological "advice" for researchers facing disruption to fieldwork. Resources and publications frequently encouraged changes vis-a-vis digitally enhanced methods or employment of digital ethnography. For ethnographers, the establishment and maintenance of ethnographic relationships in pandemic contexts restricted to virtual interactions has not been thoroughly explored, leaving those trained in recruitment, rapport-building, and field engagement with fewer resources to navigate this integral topic. Here, we provide insights into how ethnographic relationships may be developed when there is limited access to the field and traditional relationship building is not possible. We argue that as ethnographic methods change and adapt, so too must perspectives on ethnographic relationship development. By closely examining ethnographic relationships confined to digital spaces in the context of the Tennessee tornado recovery amid the COVID-19 pandemic, this project sheds light on how to overcome this challenge.

AB  - The paper is a critical discourse analysis of political discourse. It relies on van Dijk's socio- cognitive approach which employs miscellaneous linguistic methodologies as input to support the interdisciplinarity of the socio-cognitive base. The paper adopts an eclectic model that combines pragmatic and semantic concepts as a methodology for the socio- cognitive approach. The pragma- semantic interface has always produced better holistic, integrated, and objective linguistic inference. The eclectic model combines Sabet & Zhang's (2015) pragmatic functions of vague expressions (on the pragmatic level) and the semantic macrostructures and the semantic microstructures (on the semantic level). Wodak (2007) emphasises the vitality of the pragmatics in any critical discussion that analyses indirect and inferred linguistic techniques and biased utterances in order to identify and evaluate political discourse. Since vague expressions overlap sometimes in performing pragmatic functions, the pragmatic component of the eclectic model is further supported by the semantic concepts of semantic macrostructure and semantic microstructure. The data is collected from the White House Press Releases (issued in 2014 when ISIS took hold of major Iraqi cities) on Iraq. Such discourse is globally interesting and can shape public opinion about the critical events and realities in Iraq at that time. The analysis has proved the workability of the pragmatic- semantic integration and the paper has come up with a set of concluding remarks.

AB  - Background: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) can cause chronic HBV infection, which may lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver cancer. Healthcare workers (HCWs) are at risk HBV infection as an occupational hazard. Hepatitis B vaccination of HCWs is recommended by WHO, but the status of hepatitis B vaccination among HCWs in China is seldom reported.
   Methodology: We conducted a cross-sectional study in 22 hospitals of 3 developed cities in China. We interviewed managers in infectious diseases and occupational health departments, and at least 40 HCWs per hospital.
   Results: We interviewed 929 HCWs; 80.8% were vaccinated against hepatitis B and 96.7% were willing to be vaccinated; 38.2% of HCWs reported having at least one needle stick or sharps injury. Three hospitals provide free hepatitis B vaccination for HCWs; hospitals with a hepatitis B vaccination policy, more HCWs reported being vaccinated (91.7% vs 79.0%, P < 0.001). HCWs in high risk departments (P = 0.011), with more knowledge of hepatitis B vaccine (P < 0.001), and with fewer working years (P = 0.002) were more likely to be vaccinated against HBV. Infectious diseases and occupational health managers had positive attitudes towards hepatitis B vaccination.
   Conclusions: Hepatitis B vaccination was well accepted among HCWs. Hospital provision of free vaccine, greater HCW knowledge of HBV, and working in higher-risk settings were associated with being vaccinated. A national policy of offering hepatitis B vaccine to HCWs should be considered in China. Provision of free hepatitis B vaccine for HBsAb negative HCWs may be acceptable. Education about HBV and hepatitis B vaccine may help promote policy implementation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The pandemic of COVID-19 quickly led to the closure of universities and colleges around the world, hoping that the guidance of social distancing from public health authorities will help flatten the curve of infection and minimize the overall fatalities from the epidemic. The e-learning framework, however, is the best solution to enable students to learn about the quality of education. The aim of this research was to examine variables reflecting the actual use of the e-learning system during the COVID-19 pandemic among university students. The perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are positively correlated with facilitating condition, perceived control, and self-efficacy, which in turn influences students' attitude toward use, which in turn affects the actual use of the e-learning system during the COVID-19 pandemic. To exam the model on the basis of user data from the e-learning system used collected through an online survey, structural equation modeling (SEM) and path analysis were used. The findings showed that the mindset of students to use had positive effects on the learning of students during the COVID-19 pandemic through the actual use of the e-learning system. In the context of e-learning programs in developing countries, previous studies have seldom explored an integrated model. In addition, this article aims to include a literature review of recently published research on the actual use of the e-learning system during the pandemic of COVID-19.

AB  - Background: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second most common cancer in Saudi Arabia, ranking first among men and third among women. Colorectal cancer can be easily prevented through CRC screening which can detect the disease during its early stages when the survival rates are high. The aim of this study was todetermine the level of knowledge, awareness and attitudes about colorectal cancer among Saudi people. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among general population of different regions of Saudi Arabia from 1st of January 2018 to 28th of February 2018. The study questionnaire, containing 25 items, was adapted from surveys identified in the relevant literature. The CRC awareness questionnaire consisted of an awareness section, knowledge section and attitude of participants toward colorectal cancer screening. The data were analyzed by descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 521 general populations answered the questionnaire. Majority of participants (82%) were bachelor's degree holders and females represent (60%). Symptoms such as change in bowel habit, blood in the stool, weight loss and abdominal pain were recognized by only 54%, 41%, 45% and 52% of the respondents, respectively. Common risk factors such as positive family history, obesity and old age were acknowledged only by less than 34%, 29% and 33% of the respondents. More than one-third of the participants (45%) had received information material regarding CRC from their curriculum and by social media and nearly 30% from other sources such as TV, hospital and mass media. Attitude regarding colorectal screening was positive for 71%, Almost 71% of the respondents willing to have a screening test for the bowel cancer, even without any symptom. Conclusion: Although majority of the respondents had positive attitude toward concept of cancer screening but their knowledge and awareness about colorectal cancer was low which indicate the need for promotion of cancer education among public.

AB  - Aim The objective of this study was to elucidate the effects of a sense of attachment to the community (attachment) and participation in community activities (participation) on motivation to participate in dementia prevention and support activities (motivation). Methods We conducted a nationwide Web-based questionnaire survey of 1693 men and women aged >= 20 years. The questionnaire items used in the analysis asked about the following: (i) demographic characteristics (i.e. gender, age, marital status, household income (monitor-registered data), elderly family members, number of years of residency); (ii) attachment; (iii) participation; (iv) self-assessment of dementia knowledge; (v) nursing care experience; (vi) contact with individuals with dementia; (vii) attitudes towards dementia and people with dementia; and (viii) motivation. Results Positivity towards dementia and negativity towards dementia were extracted as factors in exploratory factor analysis of attitudes towards dementia and people with dementia. Multiple regression analysis with extracted factors as dependent variables showed that attachment and participation exerted positive effects on attitudes towards dementia (both P < 0.001). The direct effects of attachment and participation on motivation were significant in hierarchical multiple regression analysis (both P < 0.001), and path analysis demonstrated the paths of the effects of attachment and participation on motivation (both P < 0.001). The bias-corrected bootstrap method showed that both attachment and participation exerted direct and indirect (via the mediation of attitudes towards dementia) effects on motivation to participate in the community (all P < 0.001). Conclusion The results showed that attachment and participation were both determinants of positive attitudes towards dementia and, thus, exerted effects on motivation, both directly and indirectly. These findings suggested that the enhancement of attachment and promotion of participation could lead to the promotion of dementia prevention and support activities in communities and increase dementia awareness.

AB  - Stigmatization against HIV/AIDS greatly hinders efforts to increase the accessibility and utilization of HIV/AIDS services to meet the 90-90-90 goal. This study assessed the stigmatization and discrimination experienced by people living with HIV (PLWH) across multiple social settings such as family, community, and healthcare facilities in Vietnam. A total of 1,016 patients (63.8% males, mean age = 35.4) participated in a cross-sectional study using a culturally tailored HIV stigma measure in three HIV-epidemic-concentrated cities in Vietnam. Zero-inflated Poisson models were used to examine factors associated with the number of types of stigma that patients experienced. 86.2% PLWH reported experiencing stigma against HIV/AIDS, more frequently from their community (62.8%) and family (30.2%) than from health care facilities (8%). The level of stigma from community reported by PLWH is associated with socioeconomic status (e.g., income, occupation). The poor and middle economic classes and unemployed patients reported more stigmatization and discrimination from the community. Across all settings, PLWH experienced fewer stigmatization over the course of ART indicating the benefits of rapidly expanded ART programs. PLWH reported more stigmatization and discrimination at the provincial level of the health administration. Those with the history of drug injection reported significantly less stigmatization from healthcare setting. More culturally tailored interventions to reduce stigmatization overall to improve the quality of life and health outcomes of PLWH should be warranted to achieve the 90-90-90 goal. Improving HIV-related knowledge of the general population and providing opportunities for PLWH to be reintegrated into should be considered. Using mass media with positive messages and images would also foster positive attitudes towards HIV/AIDS among the population and could potentially change social values. Continuous training of health staffs' attitude could minimize the occurrence of stigmatization and discrimination at healthcare facilities.

AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to investigate the process of internal brand management that makes employees identify with the corporate brand and produce positive attitudes and behaviors, thus contributing to customer satisfaction. Three constructs, brand-centered FIRM, brand psychological ownership, and brand citizenship behaviors, are utilized to examine the process of internal brand management. The first construct, brand-centered human resource management (FIRM, represents managerial practices that improve brand cognitions and brand attitude of employees. The second construct, brand psychological ownership, explains the psychological experiences that make employees feel brand ownership and then express altruistic spirit of the brand. The third construct, brand citizenship behaviors, shows that employees live the brand.
   Design/methodology/approach - This multilevel research of collecting data from 453 employees, 172 supervisors, and 933 customers from 26 hotels demonstrates the results of different levels. Hierarchical linear modeling is utilized to investigate the relationships among these constructs.
   Findings - Results at the individual level show that brand psychological ownership of employees has positive effects on brand citizenship behaviors, and all factors of these two constructs are also correlated positively. Results at the cross level demonstrate that brand-centered HRM has positive effects on brand psychological ownership and brand citizenship behaviors. Organizational-level brand citizenship behaviors positively affect customer satisfaction. Furthermore, brand psychological ownership partially mediates the relationship between brand-centered HRM and brand citizenship behaviors.
   Practical implications - An organization can adopt brand-centered HR practices to make employees produce brand psychological ownership and brand citizenship behaviors, thus contributing to customer satisfaction. HR managers can strengthen employees' brand citizenship behaviors' by fostering their brand psychological ownership feelings.
   Originality/value - This paper explores the conception, measurement, and explanatory power of the new research construct (i.e. brand psychological ownership) on the effectiveness of internal brand management.

AB  - Migration elicits mixed reactions from the host-society. Negative responses towards migrants seem to emerge when migrants are perceived as culturally different. We investigated when and why perceived cultural distance (PCD) is associated with negative migrant attitudes by focussing on differences in cultural values. We expected that PCD in social values (focus on relationships and society) should be more strongly associated with attitudes towards migrants than personal values (individual needs and gains) and should be mediated by symbolic threat. In two quasi-experimental studies (N = 200, N = 668) with Dutch participants (host-society), we simultaneously tested effects of respondents' perception of Dutch values, their perceptions of migrant values (of Moroccan, Syrian, Polish ethnic origin), and PCD between Dutch-migrant value on attitudes. For all migrant groups, PCD in social values was associated with more negative attitudes, less tolerance, and less policy support regarding migrants; this was mediated by symbolic threat. These links were weaker for personal values.

AB  - There is empirical evidence that business commitment to the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) principles has a direct positive impact on customer loyalty, employees' performance, and, as a result, on the company's value. The goal of the current paper is to evaluate the perceived importance of the company's CSR-related practices from the viewpoint of employees. One hundred nineteen representatives of Latvian companies were surveyed, using the authors' developed questionnaire consisted of 35 statements. Survey data was processed applying the frequency analysis and the logistic regression method. Most of the respondents (84%) perceive the company's commitment to CSR principles as necessary. The base on the frequency analysis results, the most important CSR elements from the viewpoint of Latvian employees are paid leaves, consumer interests, and salary. Logistic regression yielded the elements, which contribute the most to the positive perception of CSR: 'flexible work', 'support staff relaxation' and 'claims submission system' within the group' staff matters'. The measurement scale was tested for reliability and, based on Cronbach alpha results, was accepted as appropriate for use in a cross-country survey.
   Implications for Central European audience: Despite the high interest in CSR-related issues in academia, the number of published works in Baltic countries is limited. In this particular study, the authors tried to identify - what exactly affects employees' positive attitude to CSR commitment - the company's participation in charity programmes or its environmental responsibility, for example? This survey contributed to the theoretical knowledge base about CSR perception among the staff of Latvian companies. In turn, the future survey is planned to be extended, involving respondents from Central and Eastern European countries. This, in turn, will allow making conclusions about the differences in attitude to CSR practices expressed by employees from different countries.

AB  - Introduction
   Conducting rigorous scientific inquiry within the bounds of research regulation and acceptable practice requires a principal investigator to lead and manage research processes and personnel. This study explores the practices used by investigators nominated as exemplars of research excellence and integrity to produce rigorous, reproducible research and comply with research regulations.
   Methods
   Using a qualitative research design, we interviewed 52 principal investigators working in the United States at top research universities and the National Institutes of Health Intramural Research Program. We solicited nominations of researchers meeting two criteria: (1) they are federally-funded researchers doing high-quality, high-impact research, and (2) have reputations for professionalism and integrity. Each investigator received an initial nomination addressing both criteria and at least one additional endorsement corroborating criteria 2. A panel of researchers and our research team reviewed the nominations to select finalists who were invited to participate. The cohort of "Research Exemplars" includes highly accomplished researchers in diverse scientific disciplines. The semi-structured interview questions asked them to describe the routine practices they employ to foster rigor and regulatory compliance. We used inductive thematic analysis to identify common practices.
   Results
   The exemplars identified a core set of 8 practices and provided strategies for employing them. The practices included holding regular team meetings, encouraging shared ownership, providing supervision, ensuring adequate training, fostering positive attitudes about compliance, scrutinizing data and findings, and following standard operating procedures. Above all, the use of these practices aim to create a psychologically safe work environment in which lab members openly collaborate to scrutinize their work and share in accountability for rigorous, compliant research.
   Conclusions
   Researchers typically receive limited systematic training in how to lead and manage their research teams. Training and education for principal investigators should include essential leadership and management practices and strategies that support doing high-quality research with integrity.

TI  - Public knowledge, attitudes and practices towards COVID-19: A cross-sectional study in Malaysia
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
AB  - In an effort to mitigate the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries have imposed drastic lockdown, movement control or shelter in place orders on their residents. The effectiveness of these mitigation measures is highly dependent on cooperation and compliance of all members of society. The knowledge, attitudes and practices people hold toward the disease play an integral role in determining a society's readiness to accept behavioural change measures from health authorities. The aim of this study was to determine the knowledge levels, attitudes and practices toward COVID-19 among the Malaysian public. A cross-sectional online survey of 4,850 Malaysian residents was conducted between 27th March and 3rd April 2020. The survey instrument consisted of demographic characteristics, 13 items on knowledge, 3 items on attitudes and 3 items on practices, modified from a previously published questionnaire on COVID-19. Descriptive statistics, chi-square tests, t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were conducted. The overall correct rate of the knowledge questionnaire was 80.5%. Most participants held positive attitudes toward the successful control of COVID-19 (83.1%), the ability of Malaysia to conquer the disease (95.9%) and the way the Malaysian government was handling the crisis (89.9%). Most participants were also taking precautions such as avoiding crowds (83.4%) and practising proper hand hygiene (87.8%) in the week before the movement control order started. However, the wearing of face masks was less common (51.2%). This survey is among the first to assess knowledge, attitudes and practice in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. The results highlight the importance of consistent messaging from health authorities and the government as well as the need for tailored health education programs to improve levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices.

AB  - Population adoption of social distancing measures during the COVID-19 pandemic is at times deficient, increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Healthcare workers and those living in areas of intense transmission may benefit from implementing biosafety measures in their daily lives. A mixed-methods approach, combining components of single negotiation text and the Delphi method, was used to create a COVID-19 biosafety-at-home protocol. A consensus building coordinator liaised with 12 experts to develop the protocol over 11 iterations. Experts had more than 200 years of combined experience in epidemiology, virology, infectious disease prevention, and public health. A flyer, created from the final protocol, was professionally designed and initially distributed via social media and institutional websites/emails in Ecuador beginning on May 2, 2020. Since then, it has been distributed in other countries, reaching similar to 7,000 people. Translating research laboratory biosafety measures for the home/street environment might be challenging. The biosafety-at-home flyer addresses this challenge in a user-friendly format.

AB  - Purpose - The aim of this study is to contribute to previous research by investigating the principle of regulatory congruence in two-sided advertising messages. Additionally, it addresses the underlying mechanisms of the congruence effect.
   Design/methodology/approach - The study encompasses two experiments: a two-level between-subjects design, manipulating the message's frame (prevention vs promotion), while measuring respondents' chronic self-regulatory focus (prevention vs promotion), and a 2 x 2 between-subjects design, manipulating processing depth (central vs peripheral) and message frame (prevention-vs promotion-oriented), while measuring individuals' chronic self-regulatory focus (prevention vs promotion).
   Findings - Study 1 shows that in two-sided messages, the effect of regulatory congruence on attitudes toward the message depends on individuals' self-regulatory focus: a congruence effect was only found in promotion-focused individuals. This congruence effect was driven by processing fluency. The second study builds on the first one by exploring the absence of a congruence effect found in prevention-focused individuals. Its results show that in prevention-focused individuals, processing depth influences regulatory congruence effects in two-sided messages. Under peripheral processing, prevention-focused individuals have more positive attitudes toward the issue when two-sided messages are congruent with their self-regulatory focus. Under central processing, on the other hand, a regulatory incongruence effect on attitudes occurs.
   Originality/value - This study complements prior research by examining the validity of the regulatory congruence principle in the context of two-sided messages. Moreover, it addresses the underlying mechanisms driving regulatory (in) congruence effects. As such, our study contributes both to the existing research on two-sided messages and that on regulatory focus.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate the mediating role of organizational identification in the relationship between emotional exhaustion and turnover intention. It also examines the moderating roles of worker cooperatives in the relationships of emotional exhaustion with organizational identification and turnover intention.
   Design/methodology/approach Surveys of worker cooperatives and capitalist firms in the Seoul metropolitan area were conducted in 2016. The hypotheses of this study were tested through multilevel moderated mediation analyses.
   Findings This study revealed that organizational identification partially mediated the relationship between emotional exhaustion and turnover intention. The findings of the study provided evidence that worker cooperatives alleviated the adverse relationships of emotional exhaustion with organizational identification and turnover intention.
   Research limitations/implications Since it was conducted with a cross-sectional data set, this study is not free from the issue of causality. However, the findings provide insights into how emotional exhaustion may be associated with organizational identification and turnover intention, and how worker cooperatives may alter these relationships.
   Practical implications Capitalist firms should provide their employees with more autonomy and more opportunities to participate in organizational decision-making, as in worker cooperatives, to induce their employees to hold more positive attitudes.
   Originality/value There is no extant research on the mechanism through which emotional exhaustion is associated with turnover intention via organizational identification, and on the moderating roles of worker cooperatives in this mechanism.

AB  - This research evaluates how reward and punishment behaviors are related to employee satisfaction, and how perceptions of justice mediate the effects of these behaviors. This study also seeks to examine the connection between some boundary conditions and the efficacy of reward and punishment behaviors.
   Data were collected using questionnaires, and hypotheses were tested using a sample of 3,065 managers from 41 business units.
   We found that contingent financial and social rewards were positively related to fairness and satisfaction, whereas punishment behaviors exert a negative influence. Findings reveal that high-trust propensity and low-pay level strengthen the positive influence of rewards on distributive justice, whereas high role ambiguity increases the positive effect of reward behaviors and the negative influence of non-contingent punishment (NCP) on superior satisfaction.
   This study provided evidence that using contingent rewards is more effective in promoting positive attitudes at work than using contingent punishments. Our findings add to the evidence that organizations would benefit from encouraging their managers to use financial and social rewards and reducing the administration of NCP among performing employees.
   This study represents a first attempt to examine an integrated model of the effects of reward and punishment behaviors. It also contributes to this field by empirically evaluating the impact of individual and situational boundary conditions in the efficacy of these leader behaviors.

AB  - Introduction: It is increasingly becoming a requirement for radiographers to use the concept of Evidence Based Practice (EBP) to inform their clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices towards the use of EBP as well as to establish factors that influence the use of EBP amongst radiographers in Uganda.
   Methods: A total of 83 respondents participated in a cross-sectional survey conducted amongst qualified radiographers licensed to practice in Uganda. Data was collected using a self-reporting questionnaire that was accessed through the Bristol Online Survey Software. Using SPSS version 21, descriptive and inferential statistics were generated.
   Results: The study revealed that 47 (57%) and 36 (43%) respondents scored themselves as having high and low knowledge of EBP respectively. However, 52 (63%) respondents scored themselves as having a negative attitude towards EBP. As regards use of EBP, 49 (59%) out of 83 respondents reported use of EBP in clinical practice. Using binary logistic regression, a significant association was found between a high knowledge level and the use of EBP (Adjusted OR, 95% CI: 9.89: 3.54-27.64).
   Conclusion: Overall, majority of the respondents had high knowledge levels about EBP. However, a high proportion of them were found to have a negative attitude towards EBP. High knowledge levels of EBP were strongly associated with use of EBP in practice. This finding provides helpful insights for policy makers to consider a holistic approach towards improving the use of EBP among radiographers through devising interventions that strengthen both knowledge and attitude towards EBP.

AB  - Background Managing school nonattendance is a priority worldwide. Frequent school nonattendance in early school years has immediate and long-term negative effects. Although strategies to address nonattendance are being developed and implemented, the number of students with school nonattendance issues is increasing. In this study, we explored students' feelings and perceptions about attending school and the potential determinants of a positive attitude towards attending school. Methods We hypothesized that a positive perception towards attending school was influenced by relationships, perceptions of current circumstances, subjective health, and having someone to share experiences and thoughts with. For examining the hypothesized model, an original questionnaire with 14 items was developed, including perceptions towards school attendance (an item), relationships with friends and school teachers (5 items), current circumstances (4 items), subjective health (3 items), and the individuals available to share experiences and thoughts with (1 item). In total, 6860 children submitted the questionnaire (85.3% response rate) and 6841 responses were included to examine the model. Children were 10 or 11 years old, and selected from 111 state-run schools in 8 randomly selected school districts. Results The final model demonstrated good fit and showed that the latent variable of relationships with friends and school teachers directly impacted on how children felt about attending school. The latent variable of subjective health also directly impacted on how children felt about attending school but not strongly. Other latent variables were not significant. Conclusions The importance of positive relationships with friends and teachers in overcoming school nonattendance has been emphasized in previous studies. This study has provided evidence that these relationships impacted children's positive perception about attending school in a large sample of students aged 10-11 years. The latent variable of subjective health may require more items to capture mental health.

AB  - Background: Processing Web-based health information can be difficult, especially for people with low health literacy. Presenting health information in an audiovisual format, such as animation, is expected to improve understanding among low health literate audiences.
   Objective: The aim of this paper is to investigate what features of spoken health animations improve information recall and attitudes and whether there are differences between health literacy groups.
   Methods: We conducted an online experiment among 231 participants aged 55 years or older with either low or high health literacy. A 2 (spoken vs written text) x 2 (illustration vs animation) design was used. Participants were randomly exposed to one of the four experimental messages, all providing the same information on colorectal cancer screening.
   Results: The results showed that, among people with low health literacy, spoken messages about colorectal cancer screening improved recall (P=.03) and attitudes (P=.02) compared to written messages. Animations alone did not improve recall, but when combined with spoken text, they significantly improved recall in this group (P=.02). When exposed to spoken animations, people with low health literacy recalled the same amount of information as their high health literate counterparts (P=.12), whereas in all other conditions people with high health literacy recalled more information compared to low health literate individuals. For people with low health literacy, positive attitudes mediated the relationship between spoken text and the intention to have a colorectal cancer screening (b=.12; 95% CI 0.02-0.25).
   Conclusions: We conclude that spoken animation is the best way to communicate complex health information to people with low health literacy. This format can even bridge the information processing gap between audiences with low and high health literacy as the recall differences between the two groups are eliminated. As animations do not negatively influence high health literate audiences, it is concluded that information adapted to audiences with low health literacy suits people with high health literacy as well.

AB  - Analysis of Russian films in 1992-2017 on the school-university topis shows that:
   - the educational / educational process left in the past the Soviet framework of communist orientations and anti-religious orientation;
   - the number of entertaining interpretations has sharply increased;
   - the stories are not directly related to key international political events, although they are to some extent dependent on domestic political attitudes;
   - the main conflicts are built on the confrontation of extraordinary teachers and students with stagnation, bureaucracy, the grayness of the bosses / colleagues / team; very often the focus is on problem zones (crisis, disappointment and fatigue, professional "burnout" of teachers, bureaucracy, corruption, pragmatic cynicism of students, teenage cruelty, etc.);
   - Among the characters distinctly manifested materialistic differentiation;
   - the pupil characters are mainly divided into the following categories: optimistic and vital perspectives (often associated with material status and hedonism), or in a state of depression and hopelessness;
   - activity of students is more directed towards entertainment, sex and material gain;
   - the attitude of teachers and students has lost the barriers of subordination, largely because the prestige of the pedagogical profession in the eyes of students and the public continued to fall;
   - in the pedagogical collectives, the images of female teachers, often lonely and unsettled, still come to the fore;
   - the appearance of students and teachers has become even more "free", vividly denoting female sex appeal;
   - film stories about students, in contrast to a number of Soviet counterparts, are virtually devoid of intellectual disputes, but are densely immersed in the genre element of melodrama and / or comedy; and in general, the theme of love in the cinema on the school-university theme is for the most part given accented comedic and / or melodramatic.

AB  - As social media marketing becomes more pervasive, questions continue to emerge regarding utilizing the medium strategically to maximize positive brand-related outcomes. Marketers are increasingly seeking guidance for targeting consumers who will interact and behave in ways that are meaningful to the brand on social media. Understanding how individual differences among consumers can influence social media behaviors linked to valuable organizational outcomes is crucial for managers seeking to justify social media marketing expenditures. This research addresses that issue by applying Attachment Theory to social media. In Study 1, we examine the roles of two individual difference factors, attitude toward social media and attachment to social media (ASM), in predicting token and meaningful behaviors on social media. We find that while attitude toward social media and ASM are both related to token behaviors, only ASM predicts meaningful behaviors. In Study 2, we investigate attachment and attitude toward the brand and social media as predictors of offline and social media brand advocacy and demonstrate that individuals who are attached to or have a positive attitude toward the brand are more likely to engage in offline advocacy. Further, ASM adds incremental explanatory power, beyond attitude and attachment to the brand, in predicting advocacy via social media. In Study 3, we examine likelihood of advocating for a brand via social media as a moderator and find that even consumers who are not likely to be offline advocates are more likely to advocate for the brand on social media if they are strongly attached to social media. In sum, the results indicate that ASM is an important predictor of meaningful social media behaviors and is a new means by which marketers can identify consumers who are more likely to perform meaningful behaviors for brands via social media.

AB  - Purpose - This study explores the impact of perceived trust, search for novelty and perceived usefulness on consumer attitudes towards social network advertising, and the impact of those attitudes on buying intention, buying and word- of-mouth information spread.
   Design/Methodology/Approach - The research included convenience sample of 265 respondents. Online survey distributed through Facebook and Instagram was used as a research method. The data was analysed using a multiple regression analysis.
   Findings and implications - The results show that positive attitudes towards social network advertising depend on perceived trust and usefulness. The impact of the search for novelty on consumer attitudes towards social network advertising proved to be insignificant. Furthermore, buying intention, buying and disseminating information by word-of-mouth represent relevant outcomes of consumer attitudes towards social network advertising. This research has implications for companies in terms of a better understanding of the relevant predictors and outcomes of consumer attitudes in online advertising context. Managers can also benefit from the findings when creating successful communication strategies.
   Limitations - A major research limitation is the use of non-probability convenience sample that did not capture the population as a whole. Therefore, this may be regarded as a future research direction.
   Originality - This study sheds new light on relevant predictors and outcomes of consumer attitudes towards social network advertising, which was not previously researched from the proposed framework perspective.

AB  - Objective There is a paucity of data on the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms among pregnant and postnatal women with COVID-19 infection. We, therefore, aimed to explore the psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19 at tertiary-level hospitals.
   Methods This was a qualitative phenomenological study conducted in 2021 with a sample size of 16 women admitted at two referral hospitals serving as COVID-19 admission facilities for pregnant and postnatal women in Lusaka, Zambia. In-depth interviews were conducted via telephone to understand what these women experienced when diagnosed with COVID-19. All the interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Thematic analysis was conducted using the six steps approach to develop emerging themes.
   Results Two major themes emerged: psychosocial issues and coping mechanisms. The primary psychosocial issues were worry and stigma. Women worried about infecting their unborn baby or neonate, being separated from the baby, the general safety of the baby, and the health of other family members. Women also worried about the attitude of health care providers and faced discrimination or stigma because of their infection. Thus, some coping mechanisms were developed that helped them, such as a positive attitude, keeping the disease secret, reliance on family members for support and using positive information from social media.
   Conclusion This study provides unique insights into the psychosocial experiences of pregnant and postnatal women diagnosed with COVID-19. Women were particularly concerned about the unborn baby's well-being and discrimination. This study suggests the need for policy and clinical practice to consider the integration of effective mental health services into the provision of maternal health and COVID-19 services.

We examined levels of familiarity with "clean" eating, sources of information, and perceptions of this dietary trend among a large, diverse sample of U.S. adolescents and emerging adults recruited from the National MyVoice Text Message Cohort (n= 1266; ages 14-24 years). Participants answered five questions assessing knowledge of "clean" eating, definitions, perceived healthiness vs. harm, and willingness to adopt "clean" eating, and responses were coded by three trained researchers. Results indicate that 55% of respondents had previously heard of "clean" eating, most commonly through social media, other online sources, and peers. Definitions were heterogeneous, with 40% offering "non-processed" or "whole foods" and 13% noting "non-GMO" or "organic" components. Few respondents (0.6%) expressed outright skepticism about "clean" eating, but many (30%) identified dietary avoidance and restriction as part of the definition. Overall, 71% characterized "clean" eating as a healthy approach, whereas 6% flagged it as "unhealthy", and 18% noted elements of both healthfulness and harm. Notably, 41% reported they "probably would" try "clean" eating themselves, with greater willingness to try "clean" eating among cisgender women. Present findings highlight high levels of awareness and positive attitudes toward "clean" eating among young people in the U.S., with little recognition of the potential risks of dietary restriction. Further research should examine actual dietary behaviors to clarify potential risks of "clean" eating and related trends and thus inform strategies for eating disorder prevention.

AB  - Background: Injury causing wounds is a frequent event. Inadequate or inappropriate treatment of injuries can threaten individual health. However, little is known about wound care knowledge, attitudes, and practices and mobile health (mHealth) use in the home environment in Taiwan.
   Objective: This study aimed to evaluate wound care knowledge, attitudes, and practices and mHealth technology use among social network users.
   Methods: A cross-sectional survey on social media platforms was conducted on adults aged 20 years and older. Data were collected from social network users in the home environment.
   Results: A total of 361 participants were enrolled. The mHealth technology use of participants was positively correlated with wound care knowledge (r=.132, P=.01), attitudes (r=.239, P<.001), and practices (r=.132, P=.01). Participants did not have adequate knowledge (correct rate 69.1%) and were unfamiliar with the guidelines of proper wound care (correct rate 74.5%). Most participants had positive attitudes toward wound care and mHealth technology use. A total of 95.6% (345/361) of participants perceived that the use of mHealth technology can improve wound care outcomes, and 93.9% (339/361) perceived that wound care products should be optimized to be used with a mobile device. However, 93.6% (338/361) of participants had no experience using mHealth technology for wound care.
   Conclusions: Our study shows the potential of mHealth technology to enhance wound care knowledge among social network users. Thus, government agencies and medical institutions in Taiwan should provide easy-to-use information products that enhance wound care knowledge, promote adequate behavior toward wound care, and prevent unpredictable or undesirable outcomes.

AB  - Objective: To assess the practice of post-abortion family planning (PAFP) counselling among Chinese abortion service providers, and identify the influencing factors.
   Methods: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted between July and September 2013 among abortion services providers in 30 provinces in China. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to identify the factors that influenced PAFP counselling.
   Results: 94% of the 579 service providers responded to the questionnaire in the survey. The median age was 39 years (range 20-72), and 95% were females. 92% providers showed a positive attitude and had promoted the PAFP counselling services; however, only 57% spent more than 10 min for it. The overall knowledge on PAFP was limited to the participants. After adjusting for potential confounding factors: providers from the middle region (compared with 'east region', ORadj=3.33, 95% CI: 2.12-5.21) conducted more PAFP counseling; providers with more knowledge (ORadj=2.08, 95% CI: 1.38-3.15) provided more counseling; and compared with 'middle school and below', providers with higher education gave more counseling [ORadj(95% CI)] for 'college', 'university' and 'master/doctor' [1.99 (1.01,3.92), 2.32 (1.22,4.40) and 2.34 (1.06,5.17), respectively].
   Conclusions: The majority of providers could provide PAFP counselling to women undergone an abortion, but some of them had insufficient time to make it available. Education, knowledge about fertility and reproductive health and residence region were the main factors influencing the practice. Training of health providers and integrating family planning as a part of abortion services are essential to provide adequate PAFP to abortion seekers, thereby reducing the risk of unintended pregnancy.

AB  - Purpose To examine whether an Internet-based learning module and small-group debriefing can improve medical trainees' attitudes and communication skills toward patients with substance use disorders (SUDs).
   Method In 2011-2012, 129 internal and family medicine residents and 370 medical students at two medical schools participated in a cluster randomized controlled trial, which assessed the effect of adding a two-part intervention to the SUDs curricula. The intervention included a self-directed, media-rich Internet-based learning module and a small-group, faculty-led debriefing. Primary study outcomes were changes in self-assessed attitudes in the intervention group (I-group) compared with those in the control group (C-group) (i.e., a difference of differences). For residents, the authors used real-time, Web-based interviews of standardized patients to assess changes in communication skills. Statistical analyses, conducted separately for residents and students, included hierarchical linear modeling, adjusted for site, participant type, cluster, and individual scores at baseline.
   Results The authors found no significant differences between the I- and C-groups in attitudes for residents or students at baseline. Compared with those in the C-group, residents, but not students, in the I-group had more positive attitudes toward treatment efficacy and self-efficacy at follow-up (P < .006). Likewise, compared with residents in the C-group, residents in the I-group received higher scores on screening and counseling skills during the standardized patient interview at follow-up (P = .0009).
   Conclusions This intervention produced improved attitudes and communication skills toward patients with SUDs among residents. Enhanced attitudes and skills may result in improved care for these patients.

AB  - Advancements in computer vision and artificial intelligence (Al) carry the potential to make significant contributions to health care, particularly in diagnostic specialties such as radiology and pathology. The impact of these technologies on physician stakeholders is the subject of significant speculation. There is however a dearth of information regarding the opinions, enthusiasm, and concerns of the pathology community at large. Here, we report results from a survey of 487 pathologist-respondents practicing in 54 countries, conducted to examine perspectives on Al implementation in clinical practice. Despite limitations, including difficulty with quantifying response bias and verifying identity of respondents to this anonymous and voluntary survey, several interesting findings were uncovered. Overall, respondents carried generally positive attitudes towards Al, with nearly 75% reporting interest or excitement in N as a diagnostic tool to facilitate improvements in workflow efficiency and quality assurance in pathology. Importantly, even within the more optimistic cohort, a significant number of respondents endorsed concerns about Al, including the potential for job displacement and replacement. Overall, around 80% of respondents predicted the introduction of Al technology in the pathology laboratory within the coming decade. Attempts to identify statistically significant demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, type/place of practice) predictive of attitudes towards Al using Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) testing revealed several associations. Important themes which were commented on by respondents included the need for increasing efforts towards physician training and resolving medical-legal implications prior to the generalized implementation of Al in pathology.

AB  - Over the last century, changing public attitudes about the value of wildlife have triggered substantial changes in species management that have both benefited and hindered conservation efforts. Understanding and integrating contemporary public values is therefore critical for effective conservation outcomes. Using historic and contemporary examples, we highlight how public attitudes-expressed through the media and campaigns-are shaping the management of introduced and native species, as values shift towards animal welfare and mutualism. We focus on the issue of deliberate human-caused killing of wildlife, because protests against such management have disrupted traditional political and management structures that favoured eradication of wildlife across many jurisdictions and ecological contexts. In doing so, we show that it is essential to work with multiple stakeholder interest groups to ensure that wildlife management is informed by science, while also supported by public values. Achieving this hinges on appropriate science communication to build a better-informed public because management decisions are becoming increasingly democratised.

AB  - Although otitis media poses a serious health risk in developing countries, being a frequent occurrence in children below five years of age, parental awareness and practices about otitis media have not been adequately researched. Present cross-sectional study was undertaken in Navi Mumbai schools, from October 2019 to December 2019, wherein parents with children <= 5 years of age answered a questionnaire which gathered data on their knowledge, attitude and practices about otitis media in their wards. Chi-square tests, Cramer's V were used to study association between gender, age-group and education of parents with their knowledge, practice and attitude about otitis media. Out of 425 valid responses, overall most parents displayed adequate knowledge (77%), positive attitude (61%) and good care-seeking practices (70%). There was a positive correlation of knowledge and practice with level of education. This study shows acceptable levels of knowledge, attitude and practices in parents about otitis media. Parents who did not seek treatment from health centre attributed the behaviour to poverty, ignorance and lack of health insurance. The positive correlation of knowledge and practices with level of education highlights the importance of role of education in modifying parental awareness and care seeking behaviour. Our findings call for a need to further strengthen community-based healthcare and improve parental confidence in healthcare services for early detection and adequate treatment of otitis media.

AB  - Introduction: As of December 1, 2020, when the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices published their COVID-19 vaccine distribution and prioritization recommendations, health care workers (HCWs) and the elderly were deemed to be at greatest risk of contracting the coronavirus. Limited extant research suggests that most HCWs are willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, and findings from studies examining vaccine uptake in non-HCW samples also have reported high vaccination willingness. The health belief model (HBM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) suggest that beliefs about severity and susceptibility of disease, perceived benefits of and obstacles to vaccination, and normative beliefs of others affect vaccine uptake. Further, perceptions of safety, side effects, and demographic factors can uniquely impact COVID-19 vaccine uptake. Method: Using a cross-sectional design, we recruited 526 participants via social media, through snowball emailing methods, and from university settings. Results: The present findings demonstrate that 37% of participants intend to get the vaccine, and 35% reported that they might get the vaccine. No relationships among demographic factors, willingness to receive the vaccine, and level of intent were observed. However, those who reported that they would not receive the COVID-19 vaccine demonstrated fewer positive attitudes, less agreement, fewer normative views, and less anticipatory regret regarding the COVID-19 vaccine. Also, perceptions of susceptibility, severity, and barriers were associated with participants' willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Discussion: Our results suggest that factors related to the HBM and TPB might uniquely impact COVID-19 vaccine acceptability and could guide the crafting of interventions meant to encourage vaccine uptake.
   Public Significance Statement The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have approved various vaccines to build immunization from COVID-19; however, vaccine hesitancy and antivaccination are prevalent in the United States. This study explores perceptions of susceptibility, severity, and barriers to uptake that are associated with participants' willingness to get the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - The aims of the present study are to assess the impact of a pleasure-oriented intervention on the nutritional quality of midafternoon snacks chosen by mother-child dyads and to evaluate the evolution of the relationship between the liking and perceived healthiness of the food items offered for the snack choices. Data were collected at two laboratory sessions (T1 and T2), during which children and mothers were separately asked to choose two food items (among 10) for a midafternoon snack, first for themselves and then for the other dyad member. Participants also rated their liking and perceived healthiness of the 10 food items. After T1, dyads were randomly assigned to an experimental group (N = 94) with an in-home pleasure-oriented intervention to stimulate the pleasure of consuming healthy foods or to a control group (N = 93). Our study shows the lack of a significant effect of the intervention on the nutritional quality of snacks chosen at T2. However, for the children in the experimental group, the relationship between liking and perceived healthiness which was not significant at T1 (tau(median) = - 0.05, P = 0.56) became significant and positive at T2 (tau(median) = 0.13, P = 0.002). Moreover, this increase of the relationship in T2 was significantly higher for the experimental group compared to the control group (P = 0.05). For mothers, the existing relationship between liking and perceived healthiness at T1 (tau(median) = 0.27, P < 0.001) increased significantly between T1 and T2 (P = 0.006) only in the experimental group, even if this increase was not significantly higher compared to the control group (P = 0.21). Since the relationship between food liking and perceived healthiness in mother-child dyads increased after the intervention, one could argue that this higher positive attitude towards healthy foods could constitute the first step in a behavioural change in favour of healthier choices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Trauma research has been limited by perceived patient reluctance to participate in exception from informed consent (EFIC) studies. We hypothesized that race, socioeconomic status, and proximity to violence influence willingness to participate in and perception of EFIC research among at-risk populations.
   METHODS: Trauma patients, families, and community members ranked statements regarding attitude toward EFIC in the context of an upcoming trial and willingness to participate in emergency research using a 5-point Likert scale during a community consultation. Higher total scores reflected a more positive attitude regarding EFIC (range, 6-30; neutral, 18) and willingness (range, 23-115; neutral, 69). Subject zip code was used to calculate median income, as an estimate for socioeconomic status, and proximity to the five most violent city zip codes. Linear regression, Spearman's correlation, and Kruskal-Wallis tests (p < 0.05) were used to evaluate relationships between estimated socioeconomic status, race, mechanism of injury, proximity to violence, and attitudes toward EFIC.
   RESULTS: A total of 179 subjects participated including trauma patients (n = 99), families (n = 33), and community members (n = 47). Overall, participants were supportive of EFIC and reported high scores in willingness to participate (median, 24; interquartile range, 21-25; median 89, interquartile range, 82-95, respectively). Proximity to violence did correlate with race (p = 0.03) but was not associated with violent mechanism of injury, perception of EFIC, or willingness to participate in emergency research. Estimated socioeconomic status and race did not correlate with perception of or willingness to participate in EFIC.
   CONCLUSION: Based on our data, there is no correlation between either proximity to violence or estimated socioeconomic status and willingness to participate in EFIC research. Given this lack of correlation, researchers should partner with at-risk communities to conduct EFIC studies without concern for limited participation. (J Trauma Acute Care Surg. 2015;79: 364-371.

AB  - Smart wearables as a part of the Internet of Things nowadays gaining confidence in our daily lives because of its accessibility and simplicity. Today, with the outbreak of Coronavirus around the world, a smart wearable device can become another solution to help slowing the virus spreading by ensuring public health and social measures. In this paper, a system consisting of distance detector and touchless door access is proposed to help the personal, physical and social distancing measures practice in a public indoor area. A BLE positioning method based on RSSI localization is used to ensure the physical distancing around the user. WPA2 and MAC address-based authentication for the touchless door access is used to restrict and trace the visitor of the indoor area. The system is implemented in ESP microcontroller. A proof of concept is conducted to see if the functionality of the system already satisfied the public health and social measures practice. The results show that only registered devices can give a signal to open the door and the device can guarantee the physical distance around the user with 4.51% error in indoor area.

AB  - Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to examine consumer attitude toward gamification in the context of over-the-top (OTT) media service. The particular focus of this paper is on game mechanics from the mechanics-dynamics-aesthetics framework and its effects on consumer attitude toward both gamification and OTT media service provider brand.
   Design/methodology/approach
   A 2 x 2 x 2 between-subjects factorial experiment to examine the three core elements of game mechanics - components, controls and courses on consumer attitude, which was operationalized in eight vignettes with a sample size of 296.
   Findings
   It was found that the three elements in game mechanics demonstrated a multiplicative effect. The different combinations of elements in game mechanics would result in eliciting different consumer attitudes toward gamification and brand. Despite one combination that attained a high positive consumer attitude toward gamification in OTT, that same combination was not effective in creating a high positive attitude toward the OTT provider brand. The findings demonstrate the need for OTT providers to be clear of their gamification objectives before selecting the combination of game mechanics.
   Research limitations/implications
   This study adds to the body of knowledge on consumer attitude toward gamification, especially in the OTT market where there is still literature is limited.
   Practical implications
   OTT providers should determine their objectives for using gamification and design the game mechanics according to the optimal combination of elements - components, controls and courses.
   Originality/value
   According to the author's knowledge, this is the first paper to examine consumer attitude toward gamification and OTT provider based on game mechanics. It provides an understanding on the interaction of elements in game mechanics and shows that different element combinations can be used to meet different goals.

AB  - Background: Using condoms consistently could prevent unintended pregnancy among young people. This study highlights multiple domains of inuence on condom use among male college students in China, including knowledge, attitudes, health services utility on condom use and reproductive health information sources.
   Methodology/Principal Findings: To identify factors associated with condom use in Chinese male college students, we examined a sample of 870 sexually experienced male students in seven colleges in Wuhan, China, 2009. 535 (61.5%) of 870 male students reported condom use during their most recent sexual encounter. Male students with steady partners were more likely to use condoms than students with casual partners (adjusted OR = 3.11, 95%CI 2.30-4.20). And positive attitudes toward contraceptive responsibility were associated with greater odds of condom use (adjusted OR = 1.40, 95%CI 1.02-1.92). Only 54(6.2%) and 83(9.5%) of respondents reported that free condoms and reproductive health counseling were available at the student health center. Providing free condoms and reproductive health counseling at the student health central were associated with increased condom use among college students (both P<0.05). In addition, students who gained reproductive health information mainly through websites, television and radio programs were more likely to use condoms than through school education (all P<0.05).
   Conclusions: Improving attitudes of male students toward contraceptive responsibility, providing proper reproductive health information through mass media and making free condoms and reproductive health counseling available in school may help increase condom use among college students in China.

AB  - Objective: To assess the awareness, attitude, and knowledge about basic life support (BLS) among medical, dental, and nursing students and faculties and the proposal of BLS skills in the academic curriculum of undergraduate (UG) course. Recognition, prevention, and effective management of life-threatening emergencies are the responsibility of health-care professionals. These situations can be successfully managed by proper knowledge and training of the BLS skills. These life-saving maneuvers can be given through the structured resuscitation programs, which are lacking in the academic curriculum. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire study consisting of 20 questions was conducted among 659 participants in the Kalinga Institute of Dental Sciences, Kalinga Institute of Medical Sciences, KIIT University. Medical junior residents, BDS faculties, interns, nursing faculties, and 3(rd)-year and final-year UG students from both medical and dental colleges were chosen. The statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS software version 20.0 (Armonk, NY:IBM Corp). Results: After collecting the data, the values were statistically analyzed and tabulated. Statistical analysis was performed using MannuWhitney U-test. The results with P < 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Our participants were aware of BLS, showed positive attitude toward it, whereas the knowledge about BLS was lacking, with the statistically significant P value. Conclusion: By introducing BLS regularly in the academic curriculum and by routine hands on workshops, all the health-care providers should be well versed with the BLS skills for effectively managing the life-threatening emergencies.

AB  - Science communication has been historically predicated on the knowledge deficit model. Yet, empirical research has shown that public communication of science is more complex than what the knowledge deficit model suggests. In this essay, we pose four lines of reasoning and present empirical data for why we believe the deficit model still persists in public communication of science. First, we posit that scientists' training results in the belief that public audiences can and do process information in a rational manner. Second, the persistence of this model may be a product of current institutional structures. Many graduate education programs in science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields generally lack formal training in public communication. We offer empirical evidence that demonstrates that scientists who have less positive attitudes toward the social sciences are more likely to adhere to the knowledge deficit model of science communication. Third, we present empirical evidence of how scientists conceptualize the public and link this to attitudes toward the deficit model. We find that perceiving a knowledge deficit in the public is closely tied to scientists' perceptions of the individuals who comprise the public. Finally, we argue that the knowledge deficit model is perpetuated because it can easily influence public policy for science issues. We propose some ways to uproot the deficit model and move toward more effective science communication efforts, which include training scientists in communication methods grounded in social science research and using approaches that engage community members around scientific issues.

AB  - Nowadays, the whole world is confronting an infectious disease called the coronavirus. No country remained untouched during this pandemic situation. Due to no exact treatment available, the disease has become a matter of seriousness for both the government and the public. As social distance is considered the most effective way to stay away from this disease. Therefore, to address the people eagerness about the Corona pandemic and to express their views, the trend of people has moved very fast towards social media. Twitter has emerged as one of the most popular platforms among those social media platforms. By studying the same eagerness and opinions of people to understand their mental state, we have done sentiment analysis using the BERT model on tweets. In this paper, we perform a sentiment analysis on two data sets; one data set is collected by tweets made by people from all over the world, and the other data set contains the tweets made by people of India. We have validated the accuracy of the emotion classification from the GitHub repository. The experimental results show that the validation accuracy is approximate to 94%.

AB  - Background: The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity.
   Objective: We aim to investigate Twitter users' attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Canada after vaccine rollout.
   Methods: We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination-related tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward "vaccination" changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects.
   Results: After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, "immunity" and "pfizer") and 6775 opinion terms (eg, "trustworthy" for the positive sentiment and "jeopardize" for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to "vaccine distribution," "side effects," "allergy," "reactions," and "anti-vaxxer," and positive sentiments related to "vaccine campaign," "vaccine candidates," and "immune response." These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the "anti-vaxxer" population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the "Covid Zero" population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response.
   Conclusions: Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to explore the lived experiences of informal caregivers for pregnant women seeking scheduled antenatal care during the early stage of China's COVID-19 lockdown and potential measures to address the challenges. Design: This is a phenomenological qualitative study. Setting: The study was carried out in a leading teaching hospital in Southwest China. Participants: We recruited 15 informal caregivers for healthy pregnant women on routine antenatal visits about six months after China launched the city-wide lockdown and other control measures for COVID-19, including 10 males and 5 females with diverse demographic backgrounds. Measures and findings: The research team developed a demographic form and an interview outline with key questions, conducted semi-structured interviews with the informal caregivers, and analyzed the data using the Colazzie's method. Five themes of lived experiences were revealed, i.e., increased caregiving burdens, disruption of routines in family life, lack of accurate information and knowledge, active role adjustment, and positive attitudes and coping in a difficult time. Some caregivers reacted positively to the lockdown experience and saw it as an opportunity to rethink their lives and improve family relations. Key conclusions: The informal caregivers experienced increased physical and psychological burdens. Strategies such as adoption of a less frequent prenatal visit schedule, use of tele-medicine technologies, and provision of accurate information and knowledge may help to ease the increased informal caregiving burdens. Psychological counseling, community services and disaster response policies specially targeting pregnant women and their informal caregivers may also be valuable resources. Implications for practice: Attention should be drawn to the group of informal caregivers for pregnant women during a COVID-19 lockdown, including professional assistance delivered by nursing and other related professionals. Measures are called for to minimize exposure opportunities such as adoption of a new prenatal care schedule and tele-medicine technologies. Patient education with reliable information should be provided, preferably by nursing staff and physicians. Social support efforts including professional mental counseling may added and work with other resources such as community services and policy makers.

AB  - This study adopted a sequential explanatory mixed-methods approach and followed the Vygotskian social-constructivist theory of learning to explore the impact of wiki-mediated collaborative writing on English as a foreign language (EFL) students' writing performance, writing self-regulation, and writing self-efficacy. To this aim, two intact classes were selected and randomly assigned to experimental group with 35 EFL students and control group with 32 EFL students. Over the period of one term (almost 12 ninety-minute sessions), the students were aimed to co-construct and improve their writing performance, writing self-regulation, and writing self-efficacy through collaborative writing activities. In the experimental group, the EFL students received wiki-mediated collaborative writing instruction, while in the control group the EFL students experienced face-to-face (non-wiki) collaborative writing instruction. Two timed writing tasks, second language writing self-regulation and writing self-efficacy scales, and an individual semi-structured interview were conducted to collect the required data. Additionally, the types and frequencies of the students' writing mediations in the wiki-mediated collaborative writing group were identified. The quantitative data were analysed using paired samples t-tests and one-way ANCOVA, and language-related episodes and thematic analyses were applied to analyse the qualitative data. The quantitative data analyses indicated that both wiki-mediated and non-wiki collaborative writing instructions improved the writing performance, writing self-regulation, and writing self-efficacy of the EFL students. The quantitative data analyses also showed that the EFL students in wiki-mediated collaborative writing group outperformed those in the non-wiki collaborative writing group. The qualitative data analyses uncovered a number of peer writing mediations contributing to the EFL students' writing content (i.e. clarity of the produced message), writing organisation (i.e. sequencing of information), and language use (i.e. grammar, lexicon, & writing mechanics) in the wiki space. The qualitative data analyses further indicated the EFL students' positive attitudes and perceptions towards wiki-mediated collaborative writing. Pedagogical implications are further discussed.

AB  - When do social media users click on sponsored content or intend to visit the website at a later time? A qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) using arguments based on herd theory, strength of ties, and social distance shows that only "likes" from socially close and knowledgeable users can consistently generate click-through or view-through intentions. Considering social tie strength in a herd behavior context, the analysis of sufficient configurations for click- and view-through intentions provides a nuanced perspective on social media user behavior and social influence. For instance, click-through intention requires observing a "like" from a close person, while view-through intentions can also develop after observing "likes" from less close acquaintances, yet in the last case only if the user assumes the acquaintance is better informed regarding the sponsored content. In addition, a "like" from a close friend deemed better informed can even make a user click on a sponsored content that was not considered valuable before.

AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed.

AB  - Double cropping is an essential strategy for increasing crop productivity, promoting employment, satisfying food demands, and enhancing sustainability of production. However, much of the evidence on which farmers double crop (and if so, how often) is anecdotal. Factors affecting the adoption of double cropping were explored in Rasht County of Guilan Province in northern Iran. Most farmers (58.3%) practiced double cropping with one crop (i.e., ratoon rice, vegetables or pulses). Leafy vegetables, such as coriander (Coriandrum sativum), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), and garden cress (Lepidium sativum) as well as root vegetables, such as garlic (Allium sativum), carrot (Daucus carota subsp. sativus), and radish (Raphanus sativus) were the most common vegetables. Cranberry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and faba bean (Vicia faba) were the most common pulses. Almost a third of the farmers (32.5%) practiced double cropping with a combination of two crops (i.e., ratoon rice plus vegetables or ratoon rice plus pulses). Adopters of double cropping had a more positive attitude for this cropping practice (as expressed by perceptions of high profitability and sufficient satisfaction of household food demands), higher levels of social participation (i.e., participation in cooperatives, associations, unions) and cooperation with other farmers, more use of communication tools (i.e., TV, radio, internet, magazines), and higher income from rice farming than the non-adopters. A logistic regression model with predictive ability 72.8% showed that farmers' attitude towards double cropping had the greatest role in the prediction of its acceptance followed by attendance of education courses and farming experience. The results are of practical significance for policy-makers who seek the best options for greater farm productivity and well-being in developing countries. Training courses and discussion meetings, particularly targeted to young farmers, as well as the establishment of cooperatives to foster social participation could motivate adoption of double cropping.

AB  - Aim To investigate the prevalence of infections by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and other respiratory viruses among children admitted to paediatric emergency departments (PEDs). Methods From April to July 2020, a prospective, multicentre cohort study was conducted in the PEDs of eight French university hospitals. Regardless of the reason for admission, a nasopharyngeal swab sample from each child was screened using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction tests for SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses. We determined the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 and other respiratory viruses and identified risk factors associated with a positive test. Results Of the 924 included children (median [interquartile range] age: 4 years [1-9]; boys: 55%), 908 (98.3%) were tested for SARS-CoV-2. Only three samples were positive (0.3%; 95% confidence interval: 0.1-1) and none of these children had symptoms of coronavirus disease 2019. Of the 836 samples (90%) tested for other viruses, 129 (15.4%) were positive (primarily rhinovirus). Respiratory viruses were significantly more common in young children and in children with respiratory tract symptoms and fever. Conclusion The prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 among children admitted to emergency departments was low. In contrast, and despite social distancing and other protective measures, the prevalence of other respiratory viruses detection was high.

AB  - Research has shown that the temporal focus of individuals can have a real effect on behavior. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study posits that temporal focus will affect adherence behavior regarding health control measures, such as social distancing, hand washing and mask wearing, which will be manifested through the degree of spread of COVID-19. It is suggested that social media can provide an indicator of the general temporal focus of the population at a particular time. In this study, we examine the temporal focus of Twitter text data and the number of COVID-19 cases in the US over a 317-day period from the inception of the pandemic, using text analytics to classify the temporal content of 0.76 million tweets. The data is then analyzed using dynamic regression via advanced ARIMA modelling, differencing the data, removing weekly seasonality and creating a stationary time series. The result of the dynamic regression finds that past orientation does indeed have an effect on the growth of COVID-19 cases in the US. However, a present focus tends to reduce the spread of COVID cases. Future focus had no effect in the model. Overall, the research suggests that detecting and managing temporal focus could be an important tool in managing public health during a pandemic.

AB  - This paper introduces a historical, macro-political argument into the literature on anti-immigration sentiment, which has mainly considered individual-level predictors such as education or social capital as well as country-level factors such as fluctuations in labor market conditions, changing composition of immigration streams, or the rise of populist parties. We argue that past geopolitical competition and war have shaped how national identities formed and thus also contemporary attitudes toward newcomers: countries that have experienced more violent conflict or lost territory and sovereignty developed ethnic (rather than civic) forms of nationalism and thus show higher levels of anti-immigration sentiment today. We introduce a geopolitical threat scale and score 33 European countries based on their historical experiences. Two anti-immigration measures come from the European Social Survey. Mixed-effects, ordinal logistic regression models reveal strong statistical and substantive significance for the geopolitical threat scale. Furthermore, ethnic forms of national identification do seem to mediate this relationship between geopolitical threat and restrictionist attitudes. The main analysis is robust to a wide variety of model specifications, to the inclusion of all control variables known to affect anti-immigration attitudes, and to a series of alternative codings of the geopolitical threat scale.

AB  - The implementation of physical or social distancing during the Covid-19 pandemic has an implication on the shifting of conventional to online business activities. This study aims to explore how financial support, perceived benefits, external pressure determine social media marketing as well as understanding the role of internet and e-business technology (IEBT) that occurs in this relationship. This study adopted a quantitative study with Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)-based variance Partial Least Square (PLS), which aims to enhance understanding of the relationship between variables. The surveyed population of this study came from 123 small- and medium-sized enterprise (SME) owners in East Java of Indonesia, using an online survey and selected with the convenience random sampling method. The findings of this study indicated that the perceived benefits and external pressure have a positive effect on the adoption of IEBT. However, financial support failed in explaining SMEs' adoption of IEBT. This study confirmed that the adoption of IEBT has successfully mediated the influence of financial support, perceived benefits, and external pressure on social media marketing. Despite the samples solely collected from East Java, this study is the first step in research related to the social media marketing in SMEs in Indonesia.

AB  - Background and objectives: The Covid-19 pandemic has forced mass closures of childcare facilities and schools. While these measures are necessary to slow virus transmission, little is known regarding the secondary health consequences of social distancing. The purpose of this study is to assess the proportion of injuries secondary to physical child abuse (PCA) at a level I pediatric trauma center during the Covid-19 pandemic. Methods: A retrospective review of patients at our center was conducted to identify injuries caused by PCA in the month following the statewide closure of childcare facilities in Maryland. The proportion of PCA patients treated during the Covid-19 era were compared to the corresponding period in the preceding two years by Fisher's exact test. Demographics, injury profiles, and outcomes were described for each period. Results: Eight patients with PCA injuries were treated during the Covid-19 period (13 % of total trauma patients), compared to four in 2019 (4 %, p < 0.05) and three in 2018 (3 %, p < 0.05). The median age of patients in the Covid-19 period was 11.5 months (IQR 6.8-24.5). Most patients were black (75 %) with public health insurance (75 %). All injuries were caused by blunt trauma, resulting in scalp/face contusions (63 %), skull fractures (50 %), intracranial hemorrhage (38 %), and long bone fractures (25 %). Conclusions: There was an increase in the proportion of traumatic injuries caused by physical child abuse at our center during the Covid-19 pandemic. Strategies to mitigate this secondary effect of social distancing should be thoughtfully implemented.

AB  - Entrepreneurship is perceived as a critical pillar for unemployment alleviation and economic growth, especially in the era of COVID-19, which highlights the importance of the entrepreneurial potential of college students. The current research focused on the role of personal values in the entrepreneurial process and investigated the relationship between materialism and entrepreneurial intention among college students. Few studies have been examined this relationship, and the underlying mechanisms were also not identified. From the perspective of personal value, we hypothesized that materialism could positively predict entrepreneurial intention. Moreover, based on McClelland's theory of need for achievement and the theory of planned behavior, a serial mediation model, with achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude as the mediators, was proposed. We conducted a correlational study on a sample of 1,002 Chinese university students to examine our hypotheses. They participated in an online survey and completed the measurement of entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneurial attitude, materialism, and achievement motivation. The hypothesized models were examined through serial mediation bootstrapping procedures. The results showed that materialism positively predicted college students' entrepreneurial intention, and this relationship was serially mediated through achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude. Materialism boosted college students' achievement motivation, which in turn was associated with a more positive entrepreneurial attitude and subsequently stronger entrepreneurial intention. The present research is the first to empirically examine this association's mechanism and establish a serial mediation involving achievement motivation and entrepreneurial attitude. For the theoretical contribution, the present research provides a more comprehensive picture of the role of personal values in entrepreneurship by complementing the effect of materialism. And regarding the practical implications, the present research implies the silver lining of materialism and points out a possible way to enhance college students' entrepreneurial intention, i.e., entrepreneurial education could take advantage of the characteristics of materialism and transform the "harmful" value into socially beneficial entrepreneurial intentions through enhancing their achievement motivation and positive attitude toward entrepreneurship.

KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Background: Support for long-distance research and clinical collaborations is in high demand and has increased owing to COVID-19-related restrictions on travel and social contact. New digital approaches are required for remote scientific exchange.
   Objective: This study aims to analyze the options of using an augmented reality device for remote supervision of exercise science examinations.
   Methods: A mobile ultrasound examination of the diameter and intima-media thickness of the femoral and carotid arteries was remotely supervised using a head-mounted augmented reality device. All participants were provided with a link to a YouTube video of the technique in advance. In part 1, 8 international experts from the fields of engineering and sports science were remotely connected to the study setting. Internet connection speed was noted, and a structured interview was conducted. In part 2, 2 remote supervisors evaluated 8 physicians performing an examination on a healthy human subject. The results were recorded, and an evaluation was conducted using a 25-item questionnaire.
   Results: In part 1, the remote experts were connected over a mean distance of 1587 km to the examination site. Overall transmission quality was good (mean upload speed: 28.7 Mbps, mean download speed: 97.3 Mbps, mean ping: 21.6 milliseconds). In the interview, participants indicated that the main potential benefits would be to the fields of education, movement analysis, and supervision. Challenges regarding internet connection stability and previous training with the devices used were reported. In part 2, physicians' examinations showed good interrater correlation (interclass correlation coefficient: 0.84). Participants valued the experienced setting as highly positive.
   Conclusions: The study showed the good feasibility of the chosen design and a highly positive attitude of all participants toward this digital approach. Head-mounted augmented reality devices are generally recommended for collaborative research projects with physical examination-based research questions.

AB  - This study demonstrates a post-hoc segmentation that is effective in creating distinct and robust segments of interest for researchers and practitioners in science communication. We use agglomerative hierarchical clustering to classify survey respondents based on answers to a short, five-item battery of questions drawn from variables that are frequently used in science communication. Resulting segments demonstrate strong differences in regards to demographics, issue-specific science knowledge, attention to media, sentiment toward media, and social networking site use. We assess the utility of the segments through a series of regression analyses in order to determine differences among segments with regards to intent to seek information about three science issues: fracking, nanotechnology, and synthetic biology.

AB  - The development and use of nanotechnology in the food industry (nanofood) have grown steadily. While visions for nanofood suggest that the applications will improve quality and safety, they are also controversial for several reasons including potential health risks coupled with difficulty in assessing low-dosage nanoparticle risks as well as values-based objections. In recent years, debate over nanofoods has sparked inquiry into factors that predict public attitudes and purchase intentions. Such studies have investigated the roles of demographics and sociographics, value predispositions toward science and technology, preferences for natural products, trust in regulatory agencies, scientific knowledge, and media attention. This study assesses the role of each of these factors in shaping public attitudes toward nanofood and improves the predictive models by evaluating concepts from protection motivation theory. We find that incorporating threat and coping appraisals provides the best predictive models of public attitudes and intention to purchase nanofood products.

AB  - Digital diplomacy has become indispensable amid COVID-19-imposed travel restrictions, social distancing and stay at home guidelines, causing many African countries to increasingly utilise social media platforms for the conduct of diplomacy. This study examines how the Kenyan Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MFA) practises digital diplomacy, and specifically `social media diplomacy'. It analyses the MFA's posts on Twitter and Facebook in terms of content, in addition to a network analysis of connections. The study aimed to determine the government's tactics and strategies, and to consider its challenges. Findings indicate that the number of social media connections have not changed significantly relative to the pre-COVID-19 period, suggesting that while the MFA is equipped to deploy social media diplomacy to conduct public diplomacy, its tactics and strategies are not optimal. This article proposes alternative tactics and strategies, such as networking and coalition-building with other actors, to achieve the country's overall foreign policy objectives.

AB  - Addressing the high prevalence of depression among university students and the need to motivate professional help seeking, we examine whether recovery stories featuring a similar- compared to a dissimilar- person sharing their personal experience of coping with depression will reduce stigmatization (attitudes, social distance, prosocial intentions) and the self-stigma of help seeking as mediated by perceived similarity and identification. We conducted a one-factorial between-subject experiment to test the effects of lifestyle similarity on stigmatization and self-stigma of help seeking. 169 students (74.6% female; M-age = 23.5, SD = 3.5) were randomly assigned to read either a recovery story about a similar or dissimilar author's reflections on their experience of coping with depression or a control story. Contrary to expectations, recovery stories did not reduce stigmatization nor the self-stigma of help seeking, irrespective of whether they were told by a similar or dissimilar person. However, a significant indirect effect on prosocial intentions through perceived similarity and identification as well as several interesting exploratory results point to potential beneficial and detrimental effects of recovery stories and similarity that should be explored in future research.

AB  - Introduction: In the absence of vaccines and specific drugs, prevention effort has been attributed as the primary control mechanism of COVID-19. Knowledge, attitude, and practice are used to determine the current situation and formulate appropriate control interventions as well as risk communication. This study, therefore, aims to assess knowledge, attitude, practice and information needs about COVID-19 in Indonesian society.
   Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey in the third week of August 2020. Purposive and random sampling was used to select the respondents. People with a minimum age of 18 years and residing in Indonesia were allowed to participate in this study. The survey was conducted with an online questionnaire that spread on several platforms such as WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook by distributing the link and continuous chain messages on that platform. Data were analysed using descriptive, chi-square and logistic regression test.
   Results: A total of 816 respondents were included in this study. In general, public knowledge about COVID-19 was sufficient, but some topic areas were still low. Most people had a positive attitude about the COVID-19, but they provided a negative response to government policies. Most of the community has taken preventive measures for COVID-19. However, some behaviours received a low percentage. Information about how to prevent COVID-19 was the most wanted information during this pandemic. Social media was a favourite source of information, with the most popular type of visualisation was a table containing numbers. Age and education were significantly associated with knowledge. Some attitudes were affected by age and occupation scope. Gender and health insurance ownership significantly associated with preventive measures.
   Conclusion: This research highlights the importance of providing valid, effective, efficient, and continuous information to the public through appropriate channels to increase understanding about COVID-19 precautions.

AB  - Objective: To report the findings of an evaluation of an NHS dental practice-based minor oral surgery service. Basic research design: Service evaluation. Clinical setting: NHS specialist practice in England. Participants: Patients and referring practitioners. Interventions: analysis of activity, patient and referring practitioner satisfaction data. Main outcome measures: Numbers and case-mix treated; non-attendance; antibiotic prescribing; complication rates; patients and referring practitioner satisfaction. Results: 5,796 treatment appointments were arranged, with a median waiting time from receipt of referral to treatment of 35 days. Treatment provided included: surgical removal of third molars and non-third molars, surgical endodontics and other surgical and oral medicine cases (28.3%, 53.3%, 3.5%, and 15.0% of cases, respectively). Antibiotics were prescribed at 13.1% of all treatment appointments and 2.5% required appointments for post-operativecomplications. All but one patient reported overall satisfaction and over 98% strongly agreed/agreed with positive attitudinal statements about the oral surgeon's communication/information giving, technical competence and understanding/acceptance. 70.1% of patients were seen on time and under 1% were seen more than 15 minutes late. Some 83.1% felt the standard of service was better than expected from a hospital and none felt it was worse. More than 85% of referring practitioners agreed that: waiting times were shorter than at the hospital; urgent problems were seen quickly; and, the referral process was easy and understandable. Over 98% either strongly agreed or agreed that they were happy with the service provided. Conclusions: A range of minor oral surgery procedures can be provided with low complication rates, short waiting times, acceptable accessibility and high levels of patient and referring practitioner satisfaction from a specialist NHS dental practice-based service.

AB  - The rapid increase in recent years of Chinese outbound foreign direct investment (FDI) has prompted growing scholarly interest in its economic and political implications for host countries. However, relatively little attention has been paid to how concerns over the rise of China may shape public attitudes towards such investment. This article tests the link between threat perception and preferences for FDI in the United States. We argue that, due to heightened geopolitical concerns and nationalism, perceptions of the China threat negatively affect how the American public views the impact of incoming Chinese FDI. Using a survey experiment, we show that respondents are indeed less likely to support Chinese FDI when primed with information that highlights the security and economic threats posed by China than when they receive no such priming. Furthermore, causal mediation analyses reveal that the treatment effects of security and economic threats are mediated by respondents' concerns about the challenges that Chinese FDI poses to national security as well as to American economy.

AB  - Background Interprofessional education (IPE) encompasses integration, communication, mutual trust and shared decision-making with a common goal of improved patient care and safety. Despite its crucial role, IPE has not gained its anticipated popularity. This study aims to determine the impact of an online educational intervention about IPE on medical, dental and health sciences students in the University of Sharjah (UoS). Methods This quasi-experimental research was conducted in three phases; a pre-intervention phase where the Readiness for Interprofessional Learning Scale (RIPLS) inventory was administered online to the medical, dental and health sciences students of UoS; an intervention phase where an online workshop was organized via Microsoft Teams (R); and a post-intervention phase where RIPLS was used to gather the students' attitudes towards IPE. The independent t test was used to compare the responses between genders and junior and senior students. A paired sample t test was used to determine the impact of the intervention on the students' understandings and attitudes about IPE. Results Out of 800 invited students, 530 students responded to the pre-intervention RIPLS survey. A comparison of the pre-post intervention for the RIPLS subscales of teamwork and collaboration, professional identification, and professional roles showed a significant improvement of students' attitudes with p-values 0.03, 0.00 and 0.00, respectively. All workshop moderators scored a median of 4 or 5 to the essential elements of IPE during intervention except for a median of 3 for group dynamics. Conclusion The present data, derived from the application of a brief online educational intervention, underpins the readiness and positive attitudes of undergraduate medical students towards IPE. The positive impact of online intervention necessitates the development of a structured and unified IPE curriculum to enhance the receptiveness and application of IPE in the medical field.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine the value, strengths, and challenges of implementing an e-learning based flipped classroom (FC) educational modality as part of the standardized physiology National Neonatology Curriculum (NNC), created for neonatal-perinatal medicine (NPM) fellow learners and faculty educators.
   Study Design This is a cross-sectional study of NPM fellows and faculty educators who utilized at least one of the e-learning based NNC FC respiratory physiology programs between May and September 2018. Participants were surveyed anonymously regarding their experiences participating in the NNC, including measures of preparation time. A combination of descriptive statistics and proportion comparisons were used for data analysis.
   Results Among 172 respondents, the majority of fellow and faculty respondents reported positive attitudes toward the educational content and case discussions, and the majority supported national standardization of NPM physiology education (92%). Fellows reported greater preclass preparation for their FC compared with previous didactic lectures (30-60 vs. 0-15minutes, p <0.01). Faculty facilitators reported less preparation time before facilitating a FC compared with the time required for creating a new didactic lecture (median: 60 vs. 240minutes, p <0.01). Both fellows and faculty respondents preferred the FC approach to traditional didactics, with fellows showing a greater degree of preference than faculty (68 vs. 52%, respectively, p =0.04).
   Conclusion Fellows and faculty educators supported the FC learning, reporting peer-to-peer learning, and the establishment of a learning community which promotes adult learning and critical thinking skills. A national physiology curriculum creates equitable and engaging educational experiences for all NPM fellows while reducing individual program burden of content creation. Our findings further supported the development of an NNC using a flipped classroom modality.

AB  - Digital interactive language learning has become increasingly prevalent and significant in educational settings. It is challenging to apply collaborative learning methods because students tend to engage passively with traditional methods of lectures. Several studies have suggested that digital interactive technologies such as Zuvio Interactive Response System (IRS) have been applied to increase learning motivation. However, related studies on using IRS in English a foreign language (EFL) classrooms are limited in Taiwan, especially from learners' perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate an interactive response system into an English grammar course and to explore whether the assistance of this digital tool could promote students' learning motivation and whether it could facilitate a student learning environment. Based on the research background and rationale, the following research questions were investigated: (1) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward their learning attitudes? (2) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward learning contents? (3) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward classroom interaction? An experimental design was employed. This research was conducted in this one-semester project to uncover 49 EFL learners' views of IRS in a grammar class. Zuvio IRS and the British Council Grammar Snacks videos were utilized in this experimental instruction. A questionnaire was administered and consisted of demographic information, Likert scale questions, and open-ended short-answer questions. The results showed positive attitudes for learning with Zuvio IRS and videos, and the interactions between students and the teacher that mediated by Zuvio IRS. Future studies might explore learning outcomes of students from different majors, implement results of IRS studies into curriculum and instruction, and create more appropriate questions into IRS.

AB  - Objective: To study parents' knowledge and attitude towards children with epilepsy, and to identify contributing factors to negative attitudes.
   Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study including consecutive parents attending the pediatric neurology clinics of King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from February to August 2012. A structured 40-item questionnaire was designed to examine their demographics, knowledge, and attitudes.
   Results: A total of 117 parents were interviewed, 57% were mothers. The ages of their epileptic children ranged from 1-16 years (median 6.6), mostly boys (65%). Although most parents (70%) felt informed and recognized various treatment modalities, many believed that epilepsy is a mental disorder (48%), correlates with evil (44%), or affects the child's intelligence (38%). Up to 53% admitted to treating their child differently and avoiding upsetting or punishing him/her. This behavior was less likely if they achieved college education (p=0.01). Some parents (29%) admitted to using non-medical treatments, usually traditional or religious practices. Those parents were more likely to believe that epilepsy is a mental disease (p=0.002), or correlates with evil (p=0.015).
   Conclusions: The level of knowledge among parents of epileptic children needs improvement. Many have significant misconceptions, negative attitudes, and poor parenting practices. Increased awareness and educational programs are needed to improve the quality of life of these families.

AB  - A common feature among populist parties and movements is their negative perspective on the media's role in society. This paper analyzes whether citizens with a populist worldview also hold negative attitudes toward the media. From a theoretical point of view, the paper shows that both the anti-elite, anti-outgroup and people centrism dimension of populism contradicts the normative expectations toward the media. For instance, the assumption of a homogeneous people and the exclusion of a societal outgroup is incompatible with a pluralistic media coverage. The results of a representative survey in Germany predominantly confirmed a relation between a populist worldview and negative media attitudes. However, the three populism dimensions influenced the evaluations not in a consistent way. A systematic relation could only be found for antielite populism, which is negatively associated with all analyzed media evaluations such as media trust or satisfaction with the media's performance. This indicates that in a populist worldview, the media are perceived as part of a detached elite that neglects the citizens' interests. However, the results confirm the assumption of a natural ally between populism and tabloid or commercial media. Individuals with people centrist and anti-outgroup attitudes have higher trust in these media outlets.

AB  - Museums have been increasingly investing in their digital presence. This became more pressing during the COVID-19 pandemic since heritage institutions had, on the one hand, to temporarily close their doors to visitors while, on the other, find ways to communicate their collections to the public. Virtual tours, revamped websites, and 3D models of cultural artefacts were only a few of the means that museums devised to create alternative ways of digital engagement and counteract the physical and social distancing measures. Although 3D models and collections provide novel ways to interact, visualise, and comprehend the materiality and sensoriality of physical objects, their mediation in digital forms misses essential elements that contribute to (virtual) visitor/user experience. This article explores three-dimensional digitisations of museum artefacts, particularly problematising their aura and authenticity in comparison to their physical counterparts. Building on several studies that have problematised these two concepts, this article establishes an exploratory framework aimed at evaluating the experience of aura and authenticity in 3D digitisations. This exploration allowed us to conclude that even though some aspects of aura and authenticity are intrinsically related to the physicality and materiality of the original, 3D models can still manifest aura and authenticity, as long as a series of parameters, including multimodal contextualisation, interactivity, and affective experiences are facilitated.

AB  - This study examines the relationship between interreligious contact and negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. It uses unique survey data collected by the authors among Christian and Muslim students in Maluku and Yogyakarta (Indonesia) and Mindanao and Metro Manila (the Philippines). Even after taking self-selection effects into account, interreligious friendships reduce negative attitudes towards the religious out-group. However, casual interreligious contact increases negative out-group attitudes. Also individuals who experienced interreligious violence have more negative out-group attitudes than those without such experience. The experience of interreligious violence has no influence on the effect of interreligious friendships but it further deteriorates the relationship between casual interreligious contact and out-group attitudes. Perceived group threat is an important mechanism explaining the effects of both positive and negative interreligious contact. [125]. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Do improvements in health service delivery affect trust in political leaders in Africa? Citizens expect their government to provide social services. Intuitively, improvements in service delivery should lead to higher levels of trust in and support for political leaders. However, in contexts where inadequate services are the norm, and where political support is linked to ethnic or religious affiliation, there may be weak linkages between improvements in service delivery and changes in trust in political leaders. To examine this question empirically, we take advantage of a national intervention that improved health service delivery in 500 primary health care facilities in Nigeria, to estimate the impact of residence within 10 km of one or more of the intervention facilities on trust in the president, local councils, the ruling party, and opposition parties. Using difference-in-difference models, we show that proximity to the intervention led to increases in trust in the president and the ruling party. By contrast, we find no evidence of increased trust in the local council or opposition parties. Our study also examines the role of ethnicity and religious affiliation in mediating the observed increases in trust in the president. While there is a large literature suggesting that both the targeting of interventions, and the response of citizens to interventions is often mediated by ethnic, geographic or religious identity, by contrast, we find no evidence that the intervention was targeted at the president's ethnic group, zone, or state of origin. Moreover, there is suggestive evidence that the intervention increased trust in the president more among those who did not share these markers of identity with the president. This highlights the possibility that broad-based efforts to improve health services can increase trust in political leaders even in settings where political attitudes are often thought to be mediated by group identity.

AB  - People higher in benevolent sexism often outwardly endorse gender equality, but support men over women for challenging positions and experiences. Reflecting shifting standards (a tendency to evaluate stereotyped group members against within-category judgment standards), people higher in sexism may evaluate prominent women's competence against a lower competency standard for women (who are stereotyped as less competent than men are), and not against a standard for men. Thus prominent women could be perceived as especially competent (versus other women), yet men might still garner ultimate support. Study 1 tested for this possibility using an ecologically valid example: the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Study 1 showed that benevolent (and not hostile) sexism predicted less opposition to Donald Trump's candidacy and more positive attitudes toward the election outcome among 57 mostly female U.S. college students. Study 1 also showed that benevolent sexism positively predicted competence perceived in Hillary Clinton. To determine if this positive relationship reflected shifting standards, we manipulated the gender to which a prominent woman would be compared in Study 2 with 189 U.S. adults. Reflecting shifting standards, benevolent sexism related to evaluating women as more competent when they were evaluated against other women versus other men. Shifting standards also mediated a relationship between benevolent sexism and expecting lower female success. Using shifting standards may be one way that people higher in benevolent sexism might evaluate prominent women as especially competent, yet ultimately support men.

AB  - This paper examines public attitudes toward urban red foxes and coyotes in Madison, Wisconsin (US), and the roles that perceived risks and benefits, attention to local news about urban wildlife, political ideology, and ecological worldview play in an individual's attitude toward these species. Data were collected using an in-person survey at four public events around Madison from July to August 2017 (n = 163, response rate = 47%). Results showed that perceived benefits, perceived risks, and ecological worldview were significant predictors of attitudes toward both urban coyotes and foxes. Although political ideology and attention to local news about urban wildlife were not significant predictors of attitudes toward urban foxes or coyotes, these concepts interacted in predicting attitudes toward urban coyotes. This study demonstrated the importance for wildlife managers to consider attention to news about urban wildlife and political ideology, as well as developing separate communications for different species.

KW  - POLITICS
AB  - The current debate over the extent of polarization in the American mass public focuses on the extent to which partisans' policy preferences have moved. Whereas maximalists claim that partisans' views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), minimalists (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). Using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both Republicans and Democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. The more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans' biased views of their opponents.

AB  - Despite some changes to the way that people with intellectual disabilities (ID) are viewed in society, negative attitudes prevail. One of the aspirations of the 2012 Paralympic games was to influence the public's attitudes toward people with disabilities. The aim of this study was to investigate whether stimuli depicting people with ID performing at Paralympic level of competition change attitudes toward ID. A mixed randomized comparison design was employed comparing 2 groups: those who viewed Paralympic-level ID sport footage and information and those who viewed Olympic footage and information. One hundred fourteen students, mean age 25 yr, were administered measures of implicit (subconscious) attitudes toward disability and explicit (belief-based) attitudes toward ID. Implicit attitudes significantly changed in a positive direction for both groups. The findings provide evidence that both Paralympic (ID) and Olympic media coverage may have at least a short-term effect on attitudes toward people with disabilities.

AB  - The current research examined the potential effects of age-morphing technology as a communication tool on reducing ageism and promoting positive attitude and behavioral intention to address issues affecting older adults. Two competing theoretical frameworks-construal level theory (CLT) and perspective taking (PT)-were tested as underlying mechanisms to understand the technology's effects. In two online experiments, we examined the main and interaction effects of construal level manipulated using the technology and perceived probability of getting Alzheimer's Disease on ageism, attitude toward helping older adults, behavioral and donation intentions (Study 1) and explored message appeals as a boundary condition to improve the potential negative outcomes of technology-mediated communication (Study 2). The findings revealed that an age-morphed image led to more concrete construal of one's future life as an older adult. An age-morphed image combined with high perceived probability led to less stereotypical thoughts about older adults and more supporting intentions to address the issue. However, it showed that for low perceived probability, an age-morphed image resulted in less favorable outcomes. The findings showed that a model based on CLT can explain the effects as an underlying mechanism. This research indicates that the effects of age-morphing technology vary but that the technology still can be used as a strategic communication tool that might elicit favorable outcomes depending on how it is combined with perceived probability and message appeals.

AB  - Extensive research has been carried out to study the relationship between Malaysian youth and their perceptions of sexual and reproductive health (SRH); ranging from knowledge and awareness levels to lifestyle choices. However, there is insufficient information on youth e-health literacy levels on the subject matter. Therefore, this study examines the factors that influence youth intention towards using healthcare websites to search for SRH information. This study is guided by the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) which suggests that the best indicator of behaviour is intention, which is formed by attitude and subjective norms. Participants for the study were 400 youth (from 18 - 40 years of age) based in the Klang Valley area. Data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire where the research instruments were adopted from the TRA framework, namely: Attitude, Subjective Norms, and Intention. Overall, the findings showed that youth who had positive attitudes and adequate social support/pressure towards using healthcare websites to find SRH information were likely to have a high intention to do so. One crucial finding in the context of this study is how subjective norms are a stronger predictor of SRH information-seeking intention compared to attitude. This finding here can add a new dimension to how the TRA framework is utilised, especially in studies revolving around Asian youth intentions and behaviours. Ministries, NGOs, and private institutions that advocate better SRH practices in Malaysia should leverage the influence of new media to improve health literacy levels among youth.

AB  - This study aims to examine the efficacy of Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) of English as a foreign or second language (L2) through two perspectives: learning gain and learner autonomy. Previous studies have shown that L2 learning combined with media could activate the learning processes, resulting in an easier recall of the target vocabulary required in L2. In addition, mobile-assisted L2 learning could also enhance autonomous learning inasmuch as successful MALL would have to rely mainly on the autonomous learner even in learning contexts where the goal and task are already fixed. Based on this standpoint, the study hypothesizes that the engagement in L2 learning with mobile devices along with a classroom-based writing course could make L2 learners not only achieve the target L2 lexis effectively, leading to better L2 writing performance, but also help them to be more autonomous even in a setting when the task and goal are fixed. To test this hypothesis, both empirical and questionnaire studies were conducted for Japanese undergraduates (n=94). Based on the results of three weeks of L2 academic writing practice between groups learning with and without mobile devices, the findings of our t-test analyses of learners' vocabulary recall and a questionnaire survey about learner autonomy suggested that MALL significantly contributed not only to L2 vocabulary recall in comprehensive and productive tests, but also to enhancing positive attitudes towards autonomous learning.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate, from the perspective of a retailer, which of two philanthropy programs (pay-what-you-want [PWYW] with charitable giving or mere donation) results in more positive impressions of, and behavioral intentions toward, the retailer sponsoring the program. Design/methodology/approach Two studies investigate the influence of donation format (PWYW with charitable giving versus mere donation) on attitude and behavioral intentions toward the retailer, the second of which also explores equity as the mediating mechanism that produces the more favorable attitudes and intentions. Findings Results indicate that PWYW with charitable giving is effective at enhancing purchase intentions and attitudes toward the retailer. Specifically, results suggest that the implementation of a PWYW with charitable giving format leads to higher perceptions of equity, ultimately leading to more positive attitudes and higher purchase intentions toward the retailer as compared with a mere donation format. Alternative explanations are examined and ruled out. Originality/value To date, research predominantly examines PWYW with charitable giving from a pricing perspective and has yet to explore how it compares with other donation campaigns in terms of the impact on consumers' attitudes and intentions toward the sponsoring retailer. This research fills that gap and contributes to the literature by broadening the perspective by which PWYW with charitable giving is examined. Managerially, the research is important, as it suggests that consumers consider the equity of various donation formats and think more favorably of retailers using more equitable donation campaigns.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the eligibility of female-to-male (FtM) transgender people as donor candidates with regard to histologic, surgical, and social aspects.
   Materials and Methods: In this prospective cohort study, 31 FtM transgender people underwent standard hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy for gender reassignment upon their request. The pelvic viscera of the transgender people was intraoperatively observed and the histology of the removed uteri were evaluated for fertility capacity and procurement surgery. A questionnaire was administered to explore their attitude towards uterus donation.
   Results: The mean +/- standard deviation age was 28.5 +/- 5 years. The median duration of testosterone supplementation was 2.4 years; therefore, they all had irregular menstrual periods during this therapy. None had any previous abdominal surgery or additional morbidity. The mean uterine volume was 138 +/- 48 cm(3). No adenomyosis, endometriosis, polyps, adhesions or uterine anomalies were either observed or reported. Endometrial histology was reported as proliferative (58%), atrophic (29%), and secretory (13%) pattern. Of the 31 transgender people, 30 (96.7%) had a positive attitude; only one had no opinion at the beginning. After detailed information about the procedure was given, 26 (84%) still wanted to volunteer for donation, but 4 (12%) changed their opinion to negative (p=0.12, McNemar test).
   Conclusion: The proposal of the FtM transgender population as uterus donor is a hypothetical model that has not been experienced before. Nevertheless, our experience revealed that the FtM transgender population would be good candidates socially, legally, and biologically.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has changed people's lives and has brought society to a sudden standstill, with lockdowns and social distancing as the preferred preventative measures. To lift these measurements and reduce society's burden, developing an easy-to-use, rapid, and portable system to detect SARS-CoV-2 is mandatory. To this end, we developed a portable and semi-automated device for SARS-CoV-2 detection based on reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification followed by a CRISPR/Cas12a reaction. The device contains a heater element mounted on a printed circuit board, a cooler fan, a proportional integral derivative controller to control the temperature, and designated areas for 0.2 mL Eppendorf(R) PCR tubes. Our system has a limit of detection of 35 copies of the virus per microliter, which is significant and has the capability of being used in crisis centers, mobile laboratories, remote locations, or airports to diagnose individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2. We believe the current methodology that we have implemented in this article is beneficial for the early screening of infectious diseases, in which fast screening with high accuracy is necessary.

AB  - Introduction
   In December 2020, the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved in the United States (U. S.) and recommended for distribution to front-line personnel, including nurses. Nursing students are being prepared to fill critical gaps in the health care workforce and have played important supportive roles during the current pandemic. Research has focused on vaccine intentions of current health care providers and less is known about students' intentions to vaccinate for COVID-19.
   Methods
   A national sample of undergraduate nursing students were recruited across five nursing schools in five U.S. regions in December 2020. The survey measured perceived risk/threat of COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccine attitudes, perceived safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, sources for vaccine information and level of intention to become vaccinated [primary, secondary (i.e., delayed), or no intention to vaccinate].
   Results
   The final sample consisted of 772 students. The majority (83.6%) had intentions to be vaccinated, however of those 31.1% indicated secondary intention, a delay in intention or increased hesitancy). The strongest predictors of primary intention were positive attitudes (OR = 6.86; CI = 4.39-10.72), having lower safety concerns (OR = 0.26; CI = 0.18-0.36), and consulting social media as a source of information (OR = 1.56; CI = 1.23-1.97). Asian (OR = 0.47; CI = 0.23-0.97) and Black (OR 0.26; CI = 0.08-0.80) students were more likely to indicate secondary intention as compared to primary intention. Students in the Midwest were most likely to indicate no intention as compared to secondary intention (OR = 4.6; CI = 1.32-16.11).
   Conclusions
   As the first two COVID-19 vaccines were approved/recommended in the U.S. nursing students had overall high intentions to vaccinate. Findings can guide development of educational interventions that reduce concerns of vaccine safety that are delivered in a way that is supportive and affirming to minoritized populations while being respectful of geo-political differences.

AB  - Background: Sitting time is ubiquitous for most adults in developed countries and is most prevalent in three domains: in the workplace, during transport and during leisure time. The correlates of prolonged sitting time in workplace settings are not well understood. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the gender-specific associations between the socio-demographic, behavioural and cognitive correlates of work-related sitting time.
   Methods: A cross-sectional sample of working German adults (n = 1515; 747 men; 43.5 +/- 11.0 years) completed questionnaires regarding domain-specific sitting times and physical activity (PA) and answered statements concerning beliefs about sitting. To identify gender-specific correlates of work-related sitting time, we used a series of linear regressions.
   Results: The overall median was 2 hours of work-related sitting time/day. Regression analyses showed for men (beta = -.43) and for women (beta = -.32) that work-related PA was negatively associated with work-related sitting time, but leisure-related PA was not a significant correlate. For women only, transport-related PA (beta = -.07) was a negative correlate of work-related sitting time, suggesting increased sitting times during work with decreased PA in transport. Education and income levels were positively associated, and in women only, age (beta = -.14) had a negative correlation with work-related sitting time. For both genders, TV-related sitting time was negatively associated with work-related sitting time. The only association with cognitive correlates was found in men for the belief 'Sitting for long periods does not matter to me' (beta = .10) expressing a more positive attitude towards sitting with increasing sitting durations.
   Conclusions: The present findings show that in particular, higher educated men and women as well as young women are high-risk groups to target for reducing prolonged work-related sitting time. In addition, our findings propose considering increasing transport-related PA, especially in women, as well as promoting recreation-related PA in conjunction with efforts to reduce long work-related sitting times.

AB  - Introduction: Forensic odontology involves application of dental sciences in the identification of deceased individuals through comparison of ante-mortem and post-mortem records. Forensic odontology plays an important role in criminal, monetary disputes, marital, social, and burial and the identification of individuals missing for prolonged periods. Aim: To study knowledge, awareness, attitude, and practice of forensic odontology among the dentists of Punjab. Materials and Methods: A questionnaire based cross-sectional survey that included a total of 15 questions was conducted on 644 subjects of Punjab state which were further divided on the basis of their degree as undergraduate and postgraduate students, BDS and MDS dental practitioners. These were further categorized into urban and rural dentists. Results: In our study, the general awareness about forensic odontology is more among the undergraduates than postgraduates of Punjab. Overall, there is lack of adequate knowledge, awareness, and practice of forensic odontology among the dentists of Punjab. However, the practitioners did have a positive attitude toward the field and were keen to learn more about it. Conclusion: Conducted on 644 dentists of Punjab, this study reflects the current situation of Punjab in the field of forensic odontology. It also reveals significant lack of record maintenance, inadequate knowledge, poor attitude, and lack of practice prevailing among these study subjects of Punjab. This condition can be improved if necessary steps are taken to make forensic odontology a part of our course and need more exposure from practical point of view.

AB  - Caregiving is associated with various burdens for family caregivers. The COVID-19 pandemic and the protective measures implemented to restrict public life, such as social distancing and the closure of services and educational institutions, add further challenges. Little is known about how they are perceived by family caregivers. Based on an analysis of German social media posts, the aim of this study was to explore the additional strains family caregivers experience during the pandemic. The websites of three social media services were searched using the respective search engines provided by the websites. Data from a 10-month period (March to December 2020) were identified and examined. A total of 237 publicly available posts were included in the analysis. Seven main categories were identified using a thematic approach: care and support, deterioration of the condition of the person being cared for, psychological challenges, financial challenges, infection control, access to protective equipment, and acknowledgement of family caregivers. Family caregivers are affected by additional burdens during the pandemic, which makes the development of support and relief services tailored to this population group necessary.

AB  - Why are certain individuals persistent in opposing immigration? The behavioral immune system framework implies that a psychological mechanism, which adapted to detect and avoid pathogen threats, is also reflected in contemporary social attitudes. Moreover, prejudice towards outgroups might be partially driven by implicit pathogen concerns related to the perceived dissimilarity with these groups' hygiene and food preparation practices. Disgust, a universal core emotion supposedly evolved to avoid pathogen threats, as well as olfaction, both play a pivotal role in evoking disgust. In an online study (N = 800), we investigated whether individual differences in body odor disgust sensitivity (BODS) correlate with negative attitudes towards a fictive refugee group. The data analysis plan and hypotheses were preregistered. Results show that body odor disgust sensitivity is associated with xenophobia: BODS was positively associated with negative attitudes towards the fictive group. This relationship was partially mediated by perceived dissimilarities of the group in terms of hygiene and food preparation. Our finding suggests prejudice might be rooted in sensory mechanisms.

T2  - PLOS ONE

KW  - RESIDENTS
AB  - Coronavirus disease- 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging contagious infectious disease. It is pandemic and has affected more than 21 million people and resulted in more than 750,000 deaths worldwide (; 14/08/20). Our research group initiated a study to ascertain the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of Jordanians toward COVID-19 prior to any initial case report in Jordan. This project was underway when the first Jordanian case was reported. We extended our study to identify how case reporting would alter public KAP towards COVID-19. This cross-sectional study randomly selected and recruited 2104 Jordanian adults. A four-section questionnaire was devised to address the sociodemographic characteristics of the subjects and their KAP toward COVID-19. The mean knowledge score for the study population was 15.9 +/- 2.2 (out of the 20 knowledge questions), with 60.9% of the participants having good knowledge about COVID-19. Participants' practices to prevent transmission of COVID-19 were adequate in more than 60% of participants. Most participants had positive attitudes regarding their role in preventing COVID-19 and many of the participants' attitudes and practices changed to more appropriate ones after reporting the first case of COVID-19 in Jordan. The percentage of participants who trust the government in confronting COVID-19 increased significantly (p value < 0.001). However, one alarming and unexpected finding was that the prevention practice score of participants working in the medical field was similar to those from the general population. This may necessitate stricter training and guidelines for this group who will be in the frontline in combating the disease. Impact of this study: The data generated from this study shows that when cases of disease were reported, the public's attitudes and practices improved in many aspects, and that confidence in the government to contain the disease was boosted. We believe that this study is important in allowing other, international governments to develop an understanding of public KAP during pandemic disease outbreaks.

AB  - Research on whether descriptive representation enhances the legitimacy of, doseness to and satisfaction with political institutions, as well as levels of political engagement, has produced mixed results. This may be caused by the empirical and methodological challenges underpinning this inquiry, like reverse causation and endogeneity. To overcome such constraints, we use a framing experiment embedded in nationally representative online surveys in Spain and Portugal. We show that symbolic effects on women's political engagement and system evaluation are fundamentally drivers by perceptions of a heightened gender balance in political institutions, even when barriers to access on equal terms or gendered portrayals of women politicians' competency are presented to respondents. Male citizens also evaluate the system more positively with frames referencing a more level political field, even when women politicians are depicted as not sufficiently prepared. Raising awareness of gains made in women's descriptive representation is thus instrumental to positive symbolic effects.

AB  - The presence of technology changes the way humans communicate in cyberspace compared to the real world. "Hootsuite We are social" research in January 2019 showed that there are approximately 150 million social media users in Indonesia or 56% of the total population. There has been an increase of 20 million social media users in Indonesia compared to last year. The extensive use of social media, including Twitter, is changing the news production platform. News is not only produced by mass media, but potentially by everyone who can produce reports, shape public opinion, and create a virtual society. This condition has a destructive power because it can quickly spread and provoke powerful emotions and heated discourse. This paper discusses the characteristics of Indonesian language impoliteness on Twitter using qualitative research methods. The data were collected from Twitter statuses of Indonesian users in 2018. The analysis showed that impoliteness in speech and language occurs because of the ideology and power of each speaker. The impolite speech in this research related to the impoliteness nuanced with contempt to ethnicity, religion, race, and to a social group. The impoliteness nuanced with insult to ethnicity was 20% of our observed samples, while impoliteness nuanced with religious contempt was 25.1%; impoliteness related to race was 18.3%; and impoliteness toward social groups was 36.6%. The impoliteness is also often caused by the stimulation of the occurring social and political causes at that time.

AB  - The present research aims to deconstruct the proclamatory discourses on COVID-19 circulating in the networks of cyberspaces. The study attempts to analyse whether the knowledge produced about the precautionary assumptions such as a lockdown or social distancing are intentionally highlighted through media and other social networks. For this purpose, the research borrows Jean Baudrillard's concept of Simulacra and Simulation to analyse how the COVID-19 pandemic creates a sensation of unreal fear at the global level. This excessive sensation constructs a culture of exercising power that gradually replaces the real understanding of discrimination between reality and imitation. This projection of sustained discordance aligns with Baudrillard's basic tenets of media simulation of reality, wherein a simulation process is a fabricated culture constructed by human beings that dominates nature through a reversal of commonsensical understanding about the relationship between nature and the culture that is constructed by man. Hence, whatever knowledge is consumed as a constructed entity remains a copy ad infinitum. The exploration demonstrates the stage of hyper-reality highlighted in the process of simulation and simulacra. The present analysis is interested in perusing the effects of interpenetration between the real/created media knowledge production through Baudrillard's concept of simulation simulacra.

Female students viewed gay men and lesbians in similar ways. Male students, on the other hand, held more negative attitudes toward gay men than toward lesbians. Participants reported widespread experiences of homophobic behaviors in their schools, especially verbal abuse. Students' perceptions of a homophobic school climate and respondent sex predicted homophobic attitudes among participants. Homophobic school climate mediated the relationship between respondent sex (male) and homophobia against gay men.

AB  - Since the outbreak of COVID-19, reaction quarantine, social distancing, and economic crises have posed a greater risk to physical and psychological health. Such derogatory mental health stigma is associated with adverse outcomes in the student population. The purpose of the current study is to provide a timely evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its adverse effects on students' psychological well-being to sustain economic sustainability. A thorough review of the literature and current studies, significant emphasis of socio-demographic indicators, interpretation of physical symptoms, home quarantine activities, and COVID-19 unique stressors were extracted. Data were collected through electronic surveys from 640 university students at local and foreign universities. The findings revealed substantial adverse effects resulting in varying levels of stress, symptoms of depression, and specific discomfort in the case. Among COVID-19 stressors, financial instability, unpredictability toward future/career, and media exposure have been described as common factors that cause poor psychological well-being and weaken economic sustainability. COVID-19, quarantine, self-isolation, and onerous interventions primarily weaken university students' mental health. The emphasis on this vulnerable category, however, is substantially absent from the literature. This research addresses the urgent need to develop possible solutions and preventive measures to promote economic sustainability by ensuring students' psychological well-being.

AB  - The popularity of virtual concerts increased as a result of the social distancing requirements of the coronavirus pandemic. We aimed to examine how the characteristics of virtual concerts and the characteristics of the participants influenced their experiences of social connection and kama muta (often labeled "being moved"). We hypothesized that concert liveness and the salience of the coronavirus would influence social connection and kama muta. We collected survey responses on a variety of concert and personal characteristics from 307 participants from 13 countries across 4 continents. We operationalized social connection as a combination of feelings and behaviors and kama muta was measured using the short kama muta scale (Zickfeld et al., 2019). We found that (1) social connection and kama muta were related and predicted by empathic concern, (2) live concerts produced more social connection, but not kama muta, than pre-recorded concerts, and (3) the salience of the coronavirus during concerts predicted kama muta and this effect was completely mediated by social connection. Exploratory analyses also examined the influence of social and physical presence, motivations for concert attendance, and predictors of donations. This research contributes to the understanding of how people can connect socially and emotionally in virtual environments.

AB  - Patients with heart failure (HF) who contract SARS-CoV-2 infection are at a higher risk of cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Regardless of therapeutic attempts in COVID-19, vaccination remains the most promising global approach at present for controlling this disease. There are several concerns and misconceptions regarding the clinical indications, optimal mode of delivery, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines for patients with HF. This document provides guidance to all healthcare professionals regarding the implementation of a COVID-19 vaccination scheme in patients with HF. COVID-19 vaccination is indicated in all patients with HF, including those who are immunocompromised (e.g. after heart transplantation receiving immunosuppressive therapy) and with frailty syndrome. It is preferable to vaccinate against COVID-19 patients with HF in an optimal clinical state, which would include clinical stability, adequate hydration and nutrition, optimized treatment of HF and other comorbidities (including iron deficiency), but corrective measures should not be allowed to delay vaccination. Patients with HF who have been vaccinated against COVID-19 need to continue precautionary measures, including the use of facemasks, hand hygiene and social distancing. Knowledge on strategies preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection (including the COVID-19 vaccination) should be included in the comprehensive educational programmes delivered to patients with HF.

AB  - The Japanese people's understanding of the Fifteen Years War (1931-1945) is still problematic. The problem of the war was commonly solved by transferring responsibility for the war to an obscure subject called the State, and by offering financial compensation to those who were directly affected. However, there has been no in-depth discussion of how the Japanese public's understanding of the war in the period before defeat was modified in the post-war period. This article is a study of the children's magazineShonen Kurabu, which gained wide popularity by featuring articles related to war during the early modern era of Japan, including the wartime period, and continued to be published until 1962. By focusing onShonen Kurabu, this paper explores the close relationship between the mass media and the public attitude toward war, and the handling of the theme of war by both the media and the public.

TI  - Does Interest in Smoking Affect Youth Selection of Pro-smoking Videos? A Selective Exposure Experiment

AB  - Background Many pro-smoking videos on YouTube reach view counts in the hundreds of thousands and more. Yet, there is limited information on who is viewing these potentially misleading videos. This study attempts to understand the viewership of online pro-smoking videos to examine if youth at high risk for smoking are more likely to watch these videos.
   Methods We conducted a selective exposure experiment with a national sample of youths (ages 15-21 years; n = 614) to identify characteristics that make individuals more likely to select pro-smoking videos. During a 10-min browsing session, participants were given a set of 16 videos (eight smoking and eight nonsmoking) and were asked to view video(s) of their choice. Exposure to videos was unobtrusively logged. View count was manipulated such that smoking videos had either high or low views.
   Results Behavioral data revealed that youth with higher interest in smoking were more likely to select and spend more time watching pro-smoking videos than youth with lower interest in smoking. The view count manipulation did not affect selection patterns. However, exposure to high view count smoking videos was associated with more positive attitudes toward smoking.
   Conclusions The findings of this study call into question the existence and prominence of pro-smoking videos on YouTube and bring to attention the need for regulatory or monitoring efforts of such content.
   Implications Given the presence and prevalence of misleading pro-smoking videos online, this is the first study to ask the practical and important question of who is viewing these videos. Using behavioral data, we are able to demonstrate that youth who are high at risk for smoking are more susceptible to select and spend more time viewing pro-smoking videos than youth who are low at risk for smoking. Findings also show that when pro-smoking videos appear to be popular, they affect attitudes toward smoking. Our findings provide policy implications regarding regulation of smoking promotion videos online.

AB  - The onset of the coronavirus pandemic led to profound changes in populations' everyday lives. The main purpose of this research is to investigate the factors that affected life satisfaction during the first-wave lockdown in Greece. A web-based survey was developed, and 4305 questionnaires were completed corresponding to all Greek regional units. Statistical modeling (multivariate logistic regression) was performed to evaluate to which extent significant geographical attributes and socioeconomic characteristics are likely to influence life satisfaction during lockdown due to the pandemic. In the course of the present work, some key findings emerged: social distancing and confinement measures affected mostly women in relation to men; there was a strong positive association between life satisfaction and age, especially as regards the older population; changes to employment status, increase in psychosomatic disorders, and increased usage of social media were also likely to negatively impact people's life satisfaction. By contrast, trust in the government and the media and limited health concerns seem to have a strong association with subjective wellbeing. Finally, life satisfaction does not depend much on geographical characteristics such as urbanity or insularity, highlighting that the lockdown had an impact on the Greek population regardless of the physical isolation.

AB  - Science does not occupy a prominent place on Spanish television, possibly due to those in charge of the creation, production, organization, and programming of content. Previous research has shown that television executives have mental images of their audiences that they actively use in their professional practice. This study adopts a mixed, qualitative-quantitative method to determine the beliefs of Spanish television executives regarding the attitudes of their audiences toward scientific programs and content. The study began with two focus groups, each made up of five professionals, to identify a wide range of attitudes. A Likert-scale questionnaire was then applied to examine the level of agreement with those attitudes among 450 employees of different types of private and public networks from six different regions of Spain. The main findings are that Spanish television managers do not believe that their viewers enjoy scientific topics or have any interest in them. However, professionals with previous experience of the production of scientific content tend to have a slightly more positive attitude about the opinion of general audiences regarding televised science. Hence, familiarity with televised science positively impacts the appreciation of such content on television. This research highlights the fundamental role of network managers in explaining the lack of science on Spanish media. Its results are coherent with previous studies confirming that TV professionals have preconceived images about their audiences that are derived from their own preferences and that guide their decisions.

AB  - The spread of the novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has continued to rise in Nigeria despite all scientifically proven preventive measures. Factors militating against preventive and control efforts are yet to be addressed thus the study examined COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria within the first two months of outbreak and its preventive and control challenges. Data from the daily updates of Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) were graphically used to describe the trend of spread while facts from both verified online and print media reports on COVID-19 were used to assess the challenges. Outcome of the study showed a steady increase in COVID-19 from one case on the 27th of February 2020 to 1,932 confirmed cases, 58 fatalities, and 319 discharged cases by 30th April 2020. COVID-19 preventive measures in the country include hand washing, use of sanitizers, wearing of face masks, lockdown and social distancing. Factors which undermined government preventive efforts were poor compliance attitude, selective lockdown, social media interference, misconceptions and myths, stigmatization, fear, inadequate health facilities, and distrust for government. It is recommended among others that there is need to ameliorate the adverse effects of COVID-19 misconceptions and myths through evidence-based campaigns using all sources of information.

AB  - In contrast to authors of previous single-nation studies, we propose that supporting multiculturalism (MC) or assimilation (AS) is likely to have different effects in different countries, depending on the diversity policy in place in a particular country and the associated norms. A causal model of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, integrating both country-specific factors (attitudes and perceived norms related to a particular diversity policy) and general social-psychological determinants (social dominance orientation), was tested among participants from countries where the pro-diversity policy was independently classified as low, medium, or high (N = 1,232). Results showed that (a) anti-Muslim prejudice was significantly reduced when the pro-diversity policy was high; (b) countries differed strongly in perceived norms related to MC and AS, in ways consistent with the actual diversity policy in each country and regardless of participants' personal attitudes toward MC and AS; (c) as predicted, when these norms were salient, due to subtle priming, structural equation modeling with country included as a variable provided support for the proposed model, suggesting that the effect of country on prejudice can be successfully accounted by it; and (d) consistent with the claim that personal support for MC and AS played a different role in different countries, within-country mediation analyses provided evidence that personal attitudes toward AS mediated the effect of social dominance orientation on prejudice when pro-diversity policy was low, whereas personal attitudes toward MC was the mediator when pro-diversity policy was high. Thus, the critical variables shaping prejudice can vary across nations.

AB  - Technostress, a stressor, has implications for employee's psychological states; however, flexibility like work from home can have positive outcomes, especially for instructors who have to teach and ensure social distance during COVID-19. The present study examined the relationship of technostress and employee performance while taking training and creative self-efficacy as boundary conditions. A sample of 222 university instructors, who worked from home or hybrid (home and workplace) during COVID-19 lockdown, was selected from Pakistan. The responses were recorded using a closed-ended questionnaire. Stepwise linear regression and PROCESS Macro by Hayes (2013) was used to analyze the data. It was revealed that technostress, instead of having adverse effects, had a positive effect on employee's performance and both training and one's creative self-efficacy significantly moderated the relationship. As the main finding, it was revealed that the employees continued to perform well despite the prevalence of technostress. The training and one's creative self-efficacy were useful to control the technostress and maintain the performance of instructors during COVID-19. The university administrators and employees must take technology as a positive tool for performance. The training, along with creative self-efficacy, adds to the working capacity of employees and enhances their performance.

AB  - In this article, we review the different functions that language and symbols (in particular clothing) fulfill in group life; language and clothing are rarely, if ever, discussed together in the same conceptual space. Our review includes a consideration of how social identities are communicated and discredited, boundaries crossed, and group norms established, maintained, and regulated. Throughout, we integrate motivational and social-cognitive approaches, ending with proposals for future research and theory in intergroup communication.

AB  - 1. Bees and wasps are important facets of natural capital to be valued by human societies: bees pollinate wild flowers and agricultural crops; wasps regulate arthropod populations, including insect vectors of human diseases and crop pests. Despite the importance of both taxa, bees are universally loved whilst wasps are universally despised. This study explores some of the reasons behind this. 2. Here data are presented from almost 750 members of the public on their perceptions of insects, including bees and wasps. In addition, an analysis is conducted of researcher effort on bees and wasps, using publication numbers of peer-reviewed papers over the last 37 years, and unpublished conference proceedings at specialist international conferences over the last 16 years. 3. The results show that wasps are indeed universally disliked by the public and moreover are unpopular research taxa among researchers. Words used to describe wasps are emotive and negative, whilst those describing bees are functional and positive. A low level of interest in nature and a lack of knowledge (among the public) and research effort (among scientists) regarding the ecosystem services of wasps are likely to be at the root of the negative perception. Whilst the ecosystem services of bees are well understood by the public, those provided by wasps are poorly understood. 4. Positive action to promote research on wasps and to overhaul the public image of wasps via outreach and the media could help to reset the imbalance in appreciation of two of the world's most ecologically important taxa. Cultural shifts to a more positive attitude towards wasps could be pivotal in working with these facets of natural capital, rather than against them.

AB  - As a result of the recent events associated with the SARS-CoV-2 around the world, there has been a need for research to strengthen health care. The use of masks or respirators has been an effective measure, reducing the risk of contagion caused by the spread of the virus in public places. Currently, there are masks that retain up to 99% of particles > 0.3 microns; however, they lack an airtight seal with the face, leading to discomfort and poor protection in conditions without social distancing and areas without ventilation. The device proposed in this study includes a geometric design of static valves with convergent spirals and interior baffles that promotes enhanced aerodynamics with bidirectional flow. According to the analysis and CFD simulation of the proposed reusable, washable, and economic mask and valve system for breathing, coughing, and sneezing events, enhanced air exchange could be maintained, facilitating a higher inhalation flow through the side of the mask (62%) and a higher exhalation through the front of the mask (74%), thereby avoiding the recirculation of the flow to the interior of the mask. The inclusion of filters with KN95 characteristics in the inlets and outlets maintains velocities below 10 cm/s, reducing the probability of infection.
