AB  - The public is increasingly using social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook to express their views on a variety of topics. As a result, social media has emerged as the most effective and largest open source for obtaining public opinion. Single node computational methods are inefficient for sentiment analysis on such large datasets. Supercomputers or parallel or distributed processing are two options for dealing with such large amounts of data. Most parallel programming frameworks, such as MPI (Message Processing Interface), are dif-ficult to use and scale in environments where supercomputers are expensive. Using the Apache Spark Parallel Model, this proposed work presents a scalable system for sentiment analysis on Twitter. A Spark-based Naive Bayes training technique is suggested for this purpose; unlike prior research, this algorithm does not need any disk access. Millions of tweets have been classified using the trained model. Experiments with various-sized clusters reveal that the suggested strategy is extremely scalable and cost-effective for larger data sets. It is nearly 12 times quicker than the Map Reduce-based model and nearly 21 times faster than the Naive Bayes Classifier in Apache Mahout. To evaluate the framework’s scalabil-ity, we gathered a large training corpus from Twitter. The accuracy of the classi-fier trained with this new dataset was more than 80%. © 2023, Tech Science Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Forecasting the stock market is one of the most difficult undertakings in the financial industry due to its complex, volatile, noisy, and nonparametric character. However, as computer science advances, an intelligent model can help investors and analysts minimize investment risk. Public opinion on social media and other online portals is an important factor in stock market predictions. The COVID-19 pandemic stimulates online activities since individuals are compelled to remain at home, bringing about a massive quantity of public opinion and emotion. This research focuses on stock market movement prediction with public sentiments using the long short-term memory network (LSTM) during the COVID-19 flare-up. Here, seven different sentiment analysis tools, VADER, logistic regression, Loughran–McDonald, Henry, TextBlob, Linear SVC, and Stanford, are used for sentiment analysis on web scraped data from four online sources: stock-related articles headlines, tweets, financial news from "Economic Times" and Facebook comments. Predictions are made utilizing both feeling scores and authentic stock information for every one of the 28 opinion measures processed. An accuracy of 98.11% is achieved by using linear SVC to calculate sentiment ratings from Facebook comments. Thereafter, the four estimated sentiment scores from each of the seven instruments are integrated with stock data in a step-by-step fashion to determine the overall influence on the stock market. When all four sentiment scores are paired with stock data, the forecast accuracy for five out of seven tools is at its most noteworthy, with linear SVC computed scores assisting stock data to arrive at its most elevated accuracy of 98.32%. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The high popularity of Twitter renders it an excellent tool for political research, while opinion mining through semantic analysis of individual tweets has proven valuable. However, exploiting relevant scientific advances for collective analysis of Twitter messages in order to quantify general public opinion has not been explored. This paper presents such a novel, automated public opinion monitoring mechanism, consisting of a semantic descriptor that relies on Natural Language Processing algorithms. A four-dimensional descriptor is first extracted for each tweet independently, quantifying text polarity, offensiveness, bias and figurativeness. Subsequently, it is summarized across multiple tweets, according to a desired aggregation strategy and aggregation target. This can then be exploited in various ways, such as training machine learning models for forecasting day-by-day public opinion predictions. The proposed mechanism is applied to the 2016/2020 US Presidential Elections tweet datasets and the resulting succinct public opinion descriptions are explored as a case study. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: We are currently witnessing an ongoing drug overdose death epidemic in many nations linked to the distribution of illegally manufactured potent synthetic opioids. While many health policy makers and researchers have focused on the root causes and possible solutions to the current crisis, there has been little focus on the power of advocacy and community action by people who use drugs (PWUDs). Specifically, there has been no research on the role of PWUDs in engaging and influencing mass media opinion. Methods: By relying on one of the longest and largest peer-run drug user advocacy groups in the world, the Vancouver Area Network of Drug Users (VANDU), newspaper articles, television reports, and magazines that VANDU or its members have been directly involved in will be identified via two data bases (the Canadian Newsstream & Google News). The news articles and videos related to the health of PWUDs and issues affecting PWUDs from 1997 to the end of 2020 will be analyzed qualitatively using Nvivo software. Discussion: As our communities are entering another phase of the drug overdose epidemic, acknowledging and partnering with PWUDs could play an integral part in advancing the goals of harm reduction, treatment, and human rights. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Every day millions of people use social media platforms by generating a very large amount of opinion-rich data, which can be exploited to extract valuable information about human dynamics and behaviors. In this context, the present manuscript provides a precise view of the 2020 US presidential election by jointly applying topic discovery, opinion mining, and emotion analysis techniques on social media data. In particular, we exploited a clustering-based technique for extracting the main discussion topics and monitoring their weekly impact on social media conversation. Afterward, we leveraged a neural-based opinion mining technique for determining the political orientation of social media users by analyzing the posts they published. In this way, we were able to determine in the weeks preceding the Election Day which candidate or party public opinion is most in favor of. We also investigated the temporal dynamics of the online discussions, by studying how users’ publishing behavior is related to their political alignment. Finally, we combined sentiment analysis and text mining techniques to discover the relationship between the user polarity and sentiment expressed referring to the different candidates, thus modeling political support of social media users from an emotional viewpoint. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Is art appreciation universal? Previous evidence suggests a general preference for representational art over abstract art, and a tendency to like art originating from one’s own culture more than another culture (an ingroup bias), modulated by art expertise. However, claims about universality are difficult given that most research has focused on Western populations. Across two pre-registered and statistically powered experiments, we explore the role of culture and art expertise in the aesthetic evaluation of Indian and Western paintings and dance depicting both abstract and representational content, by inviting expert and art-naïve Indian and Western participants to rate stimuli on beauty and liking. Results suggest an ingroup bias (for dance) and a preference for representational art (for paintings) exists, both modulated by art expertise. As predicted, the ingroup bias was present only in art-naïve participants, and the preference for representational art was lower in art experts, but this modulation was present only in Western participants. The current findings have two main implications: (1) they inform and constrain understanding of universality of aesthetic appreciation, cautioning against generalising models of empirical aesthetics to non-western populations and across art forms, (2) they highlight the importance of art experience as a medium to counter prejudices. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is the most prevalent mental health disorder after childbirth, notably during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, PPD is known to have a long-term influence on the mother and the newborn, and the role of social support network is crucial in early illness recognition. This study aims to evaluate the social support networks’ level of knowledge, attitudes and beliefs regarding PPD and examine their sociodemographic variables and exposure to the public information relating to PPD during the COVID-19 pandemic in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted via an online Google Form disseminated to people in Klang Valley through WhatsApp, Email, Facebook, Instagram and other available social media among postpartum women’s social support networks aged 18 years and living in the Klang Valley area (N = 394). Data were collected from 1 March to 5 July 2021 and analysed using the Mann–Whitney U-test and generalised linear mixed models. Results: During the COVID-19 epidemic in Klang Valley, most participants had good knowledge, negative attitudes and awareness of PPD. Marital status, gender and parity all had significant correlations with the amount of awareness regarding PPD. Ethnicity, gender, parity and educational level showed significant association with attitude towards PPD. No significant relationship was noted between sociodemographic variables and PPD beliefs. Public awareness of PPD was also associated with knowledge and attitude towards it. Conclusions: A significant positive knowledge, negative attitude and negative awareness level of PPD exist among social support networks for postnatal women. However, no significant effect of belief on PPD awareness level was noted. Implications: Insight campaigns and public education about PPD should be conducted to enhance postnatal mothers’ awareness and knowledge. Postnatal care, mental check-ups and counselling sessions for the new mothers are recommended. In future studies, a closer assessment of postpartum social support, variances and similarities across women from diverse racial/ethnic origins is critical. Strengths and limitations: This cross-sectional study is one of the early studies on the area of PPD in the Malaysian region during COVID-19. Numerous data have been collected using low-cost approaches using self-administered surveys through Google Forms in this research. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The damage COVID-19 has caused interms of mortalities, economic breakdown and social disruption is immense. The COVID-19 vaccine has been one of the efficient prevention strategies so far in preventing the pandemic. However, the publics’ hesitancy towards vaccines has enormously affected this task. With emerging research findings indicating that a substantial proportion of adults are hesitant about a vaccine for COVID-19, important work that identifies and describes vaccine hesitant individuals is required to begin to understand and address this problem. Objective: This study assessed public attitude towards COVID-19 Vaccine and identified important factors that lead to its hesitancy. Methods: A web and paper-based cross-sectional survey study was conducted from July 31 to August 12, 2021. The study participants are staffs and students at Jimma University. A total of 358 participants were selected using stratified simple random sampling and requested to fill a survey questionnaire. Binomial logistic regression analysis was done to identify factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy. Results: Half of the participants were found to be hesitant to COVID-19 vaccine. The odds of becoming vaccine hesitant among middle income was two times more than those with lower income (AOR 2.17, 95% CI 1.05–4.5). Furthermore, respondent’s extent of exposure was associated with vaccine hesitancy with the odds of becoming vaccine hesitant among those whose source of COVID-19 information is from four media sources (Social Media, Mass Media, Health care worker and Friends/family/Neighbor) being 74% lower (AOR.26, 95% CI.09–.69) than those with one media source. Concern towards vaccine side effect, vaccine effectiveness and having the belief to treat COVID-19 with traditional remedies were found to increase the odds of becoming vaccine hesitant by 31%, 42% and 37% respectively. Moreover, the association between side-effect concern and vaccine hesitancy was moderated by participant’s religious affiliation. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - We analyze President Trump's Twitter posts on the COVID-19 pandemic to quantitatively construct his sentiment proxy to examine its predictive power in industry-level equity returns. With the growing influence of social media, some “special” people have been able to use their celebrity status for wielding significant market influence, thereby causing a new modern crisis. This study parsed words from 2574 tweets from President Trump's Twitter account to explore the predictive power of his sentiments on the US market during the pandemic. After controlling for rigorous factors, result shows that an industry-level negative tone in general content is unlikely to be predictive of stock returns. Furthermore, the consumer goods industry exhibited a negative return when Trump displayed a negative attitude toward the pandemic. Industries adversely affected by the pandemic because of travel restrictions, consumption shocks, and public health issues are statistically correlated with Trump's negative tone on the pandemic. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Online social networking platforms allow people to freely express their ideas, opinions, and emotions negatively or positively. Previous studies have examined sentiments on these platforms to study their behavior in different contexts and purposes. The mechanism of collecting public opinion information has attracted researchers to automatically classify the polarity of public opinions based on the use of concise language in messages, such as tweets, by analyzing social media data. In this paper, we extend the preceding work where an unsupervised approach to automatically detect extreme opinions/posts in social networks is proposed. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on five different social network and media datasets. In this work, we use a semi-supervised approach known as BERT to reevaluate the accuracy of our prior approach and the obtained classified dataset. The experiment proves that in these datasets, posts that were previously classified as negative or positive extreme are extremely negative or positive in many cases while using BERT. Furthermore, BERT shows the capability to classify the extreme sentiments when fine-tuned with an appropriate extreme sentiments dataset. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: The psychiatric treatment gap is substantial in Korea, implying barriers in seeking help. Objectives: This study aims to explore barriers of seeing psychiatrists, expressed on the internet by age groups. Methods: A corpus of data was garnered extensively from internet communities, blogs and social network services from 1 January 2016 to 31 July 2019. Among the texts collected, texts containing words linked to psychiatry were selected. Then the corpus was dismantled into words by using natural language processing. Words linked to barriers to seeking help were identified and classified. Then the words from web communities that we were able to identify the age groups were additionally organized by age groups. Results: 97,730,360 articles were identified and 6,097,369 were included in the analysis. Words implying the barriers were selected and classified into four groups of structural discrimination, public prejudice, low accessibility, and adverse drug effects. Structural discrimination was the greatest barrier occupying 34%, followed by public prejudice (27.8%), adverse drug effects (18.6%), and cost/low accessibility (16.1%). In the analysis by age groups, structural discrimination caused teenagers (51%), job seekers (64%) and mothers with children (43%) the most concern. In contrast, the public prejudice (49%) was the greatest barriers in the senior group. Conclusions: Although structural discrimination may most contribute to barriers to visiting psychiatrists in Korea, variation by generations may exist. Along with the general attempt to tackle the discrimination, customized approach might be needed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social media interactions invariably include trolling, where disruptive or annoying comments are made online, and gender trolling is one aspect of trolling. Gender trolling in India has turned ugly, with mischievous and offensive tweets transforming into threats. However, far too little research has examined the perceptions of such trolling among women. What do Indian women on Twitter feel about trolling? Are they encountering prejudice on the platform as well? How do they cope with vitriolic trolls and online threats? This study employs a feminist narrative approach to evaluate perceptions of gender trolling among women on Twitter in India. The study aims to understand the impact of online trolling among Indian women Twitter influencers. Insights into their online trolling experiences from twenty-five selected women social media influencers on Twitter were gathered through detailed interviews. This study unravelled some critical observations and responses towards gender trolling among women Twitter influencers in India. The research also explored if the regularization of misogynistic laced gender trolling within the Indian online space alters the way women social media influencers respond to trolling. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives: Advance care planning is a key preparatory step in ensuring high-quality palliative and end of life care, and should be considered as a process, beginning with community-level conversations among lay persons. There is, however, indication that death talk among community-dwelling adults is not occurring, and there is a dearth of research examining why this is the case. This study aims to provide the first examination of barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying among the general population in a UK region (Northern Ireland), and to provide a novel application of health behaviour change theory towards developing a theoretical understanding of the sources of this behaviour. Methods: The study involved qualitative analysis of responses (n = 381 participants) to two open-ended questions within a cross-sectional online survey, with recruitment via social media of adults currently living in Northern Ireland. Reflexive thematic analysis was conducted on open text responses per question, with the barriers and facilitators mapped on to health behaviour change models (the Behaviour Change Wheel COM-B and the Theoretical Domains Framework). Results: The findings evidence a myriad of barriers and facilitators to engaging in death talk, with themes aligning to areas such as lack of acceptance of death in social contexts and fear of upsetting self or others, and a need to improve interpersonal communication skills for facilitating conversations and improve knowledge of the existing services around death and dying. A theoretical understanding of the drivers of death talk is presented with findings mapped across most components of the COM-B Behaviour Change Model and the Theoretical Domains Framework. Conclusions: This study contributes to a small but emergent research area examining barriers and facilitators to talking about death and dying. Findings from this study can be used to inform new public health programmes towards empowering adults to have these conversations with others in their community towards upstreaming advance care planning. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - As COVID-19 spread around the world, epidemic prevention and control policies have been adopted by many countries. This process has prompted online social platforms to become important channels to enable people to socialize and exchange information. The massive use of social media data mining techniques, to analyze the development online of public opinion during the epidemic, is of great significance in relation to the management of public opinion. This paper presents a study that aims to analyze the developmental course of online public opinion in terms of fine-grained emotions presented during the COVID-19 epidemic in China. It is based on more than 45 million Weibo posts during the period from December 1, 2019 to April 30, 2020. A text emotion extraction method based on a dictionary of emotional ontology has been developed. The results show, for example, that a high emotional effect is observed during holidays, such as New Year. As revealed by Internet users, the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic and its rapid spread, over a comparatively short period of time, triggered a sharp rise in the emotion “fear”. This phenomenon was noted especially in Wuhan and the immediate surrounding areas. Over the initial 2 months, although this “fear” gradually declined, it remained significantly higher than the more common level of uncertainty that existed during the epidemic’s initial developmental era. Simultaneously, in the main city clusters, the response to the COVID-19 epidemic in central cities, was stronger than that in neighboring cities, in terms of the above emotion. The topics of Weibo posts, the corresponding emotions, and the analysis conclusions can provide auxiliary reference materials for the monitoring of network public opinion under similar major public events. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - In today’s digital era, the proliferation of vernacular languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil, and Malayalam cannot be overlooked. The social media sites like Facebook and Twitter are great sources of opinionated content for these languages. The work to analyze public opinions has been concentrated on English, with very few Sentiment Analysis studies of minor or morphologically rich languages like Marathi. Moreover, it is a challenge to investigate the results of Sentiment Analysis with the local context for the under-resourced languages. This paper presents the sentiment prediction work over Twitter for the Marathi language using supervised machine learning techniques. The first-ever attempt experiments on the dataset for the Marathi political tweets. The benchmark dataset of 4248 tweets for the four major political parties of Maharashtra (India) is created. The Multinomial Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines with both linear and RBF kernel, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are used to train classifiers considering the Term Frequency vs. Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) as features to classify the tweets as positive or negative. The performance of the Sentiment Analysis model is evaluated using the standard measures viz., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score. The experimental results evidence that the Multinomial Naïve Bayes outperforms among all the classifiers with the maximum accuracy of 87.29% in the prediction of the Indian State Assembly Election 2019. The proposed model ranks first in the list of Naïve Bayes classifiers employed for the current state-of-the-art sentiment analysis of Indian text. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Vaccination against COVID-19 has been available in Germany since December 2020. However, about 30% of the population report not wanting to be vaccinated. In order to increase the willingness of the population to get vaccinated, data on the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors are necessary. Little is known about why individuals refuse the COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons leading to rejecting vaccination, based on posts from three social media sites. Methods: The German-language versions of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were searched regarding negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. We used an interpretive thematic approach to analyze the data and to inductively generate codes, subcategories and categories. Results: Based on 333 posts written by 323 contributing users, we identified six main categories of reasons for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination: Low perceived benefit of vaccination, low perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, health concerns, lack of information, systemic mistrust and spiritual or religious reasons. The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination. Conclusions: The study emphasizes the relevance of providing trustworthy and quality-assured information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination to all population groups. In addition, vaccinations should be easily accessible in order to promote the population’s willingness to be vaccinated. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: We explored associations between sociodemographic factors and public beliefs, behaviors, and information acquisition related to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to identify how the experiences of subpopulations in Canada may vary. Methods: We administered a national online survey through Ipsos Incorporated to adults residing in Canada. Sampling was stratified by population age, sex, and regional distributions. We used descriptive statistics to summarize responses and test for differences based on gender, age, educational attainment, and household income using chi-squared tests, followed by weighted logistic regression. Results: We collected 1996 eligible questionnaires between April 26th and May 1st, 2020. Respondents mean age was 50 years, 51% were women, 56% had a post-secondary degree, and 72% had a household income <$100,000. Our analysis found differences within the four demographic groups, with age effects most acutely evidenced. Respondents 65 years and older were more likely to perceive the pandemic as very serious, less likely to report declines in overall health, and more likely to intend to get vaccinated, compared to 18–29 year olds. Women overall were more likely to report negative outcomes than men, including stress due to the pandemic, and worsening social, mental/emotional, and spiritual health. Respondents 45 and older were more likely to seek and trust information from traditional Canadian news sources, while 18-29 year olds were more likely to seek and trust information on social media; overall, women and respondents with a post-secondary degree were more likely to access and trust online information from public health sites. Conclusion: This study found important demographic differences in how adults living in Canada perceived the COVID-19 pandemic, the impacts on their health, and their preferences for information acquisition. Our results highlight the need to consider demographic characteristics in tailoring the format and information medium to improve large scale acceptance and uptake of mitigation and containment measures. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: From 2015 to 2018, the Netherlands faced an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by serogroup W. To counter the rise in infections, the government introduced a catch-up menACWY vaccination campaign for teenagers in 2018 and 2019. The outbreak situation induced substantial media attention and a run on menACWY vaccines outside the vaccination campaign. This study aimed to gain insights into the dynamics of public perceptions of and responses to the outbreak and the menACWY vaccination, and into the media coverage about the outbreak. Methods: Three repeated surveys (N = 1110) between 2017 and 2019 were sent to parents of teenagers invited for a menACWY catch-up vaccination, other parents, and individuals with no under-age children. These surveys assessed IMD risk perceptions, attitudes towards the menACWY vaccination, trust in involved institutions, and willingness to vaccinate with the menACWY vaccine. Changes in the public perceptions and responses were studied with linear multilevel regression analyses. In addition, 103 national newspaper articles from the period 2017–2019 were thematically coded with themes about IMD and the menACWY vaccination. Results: The survey results showed clear increases in perceived IMD severity, positive attitude towards the menACWY vaccination, and willingness to vaccinate over time. Perceived IMD vulnerability remained low across all three waves, and trust in involved institutions increased slightly. Differences between the survey groups were limited. The newspaper articles discussed the rise in infections extensively, the disease symptoms, and the possible fatal outcome of IMD. In addition, while many articles discussed the menACWY vaccine shortage, few discussed the safety or effectiveness of the vaccine. Conclusion: The real-time insights into the interrelated dynamics of public perceptions, responses, and media coverage provide an integrated portrait of the social developments during this outbreak. The focus on IMD severity and the absence of doubt in the public discussion about vaccine safety may have played an important role in the societal response to this outbreak and the recommended vaccine. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Effective strategies of prevention have been and can aid in reducing and overcoming contagious diseases including COVID-19, still there is dearth of knowledge regarding general public awareness and perception. The current study aims to determine the existing knowledge and perception of people living in Karachi about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Methods: This cross-sectional online survey was conducted during the months of March and April 2020. The study included men and women of age 18 years and above quarantined during COVID-19. Convenience sampling followed by snowball sampling technique was used. An online structured questionnaire was developed using Google Form. It included questions on socio demographic information, public knowledge and perception about isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables and p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 548 participants were involved in this survey, 34% (n = 184) males with a mean age of 28 ± 10 years ranging from 18 to 75 years. The major source of hearing about COVID-19 was social media (72%, n = 393). Overall knowledge scores revealed that 27% (n = 146) participants had excellent knowledge about symptoms and prevention of the COVID-19. Excellent knowledge of quarantining, isolation and community containment and social distancing was 38% among participants. Participants who had good and excellent knowledge were more likely to have positive perception of isolation (p-value < 0.001). Majority participants (89%, n = 487) felt isolation may or may not be against human rights and this perception was found significantly associated with moderate to excellent knowledge about community mitigation measures (p-value = 0.009). Conclusion: This study concludes that optimal public knowledge and perception related to certain aspects of isolation, quarantine, social distancing and community containment exists however knowledge gaps and misperceptions prevail that need to be addressed. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Patient awareness plays an important role in integrating palliative care into the patient care process. Lack of awareness can create a negative attitude towards palliative care and affect patients' decisions during the treatment process. The present study was conducted to determine the level of knowledge about palliative care in Iranian patients with cancer. Methods: The descriptive study was conducted with a convenience sample of 103 cancer patients admitted to an oncology center in Yazd, Iran, A three-part questionnaire including demographic information, sources of palliative care information and the Palliative Care Knowledge Scale (PaCKS) was used to collect data. All statistical analyses were performed using software SPSS 21. Results: The mean age of patients was 36.2 ± 13.5 years. Of the total, 38.8% of patients received information about palliative care through the media and 36.9% from the treatment team. On a scale of 0 to 13, the mean PaCKS score was 6.7 ± 3.7. A ‘good’ level of knowledge was reported by 29.1% of participants; however 84.5% stated that they should leave other doctors at the time of receiving palliative care, 71.8% considered palliative care for patients in the last six months of life, 84.5% considered palliative care for patients with cancer, and 70.9% stated that palliative care encourages people to discontinue treatments aimed at treating their disease. Conclusion: Our study found most cancer patients have a moderate to weak level of knowledge and considerable misinformation about palliative care, which highlights the importance of providing palliative care education. The development of training programs in this area could play an effective role in improving patients' knowledge of palliative care. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: In the pandemic time, many low- and middle-income countries are experiencing restricted access to COVID-19 vaccines. Access to imported vaccines or ways to produce them locally became the principal source of hope for these countries. But developing a strategy for success in obtaining and allocating vaccines was not easy task. The governments in those countries have faced the difficult decision whether to accept or reject offers of vaccine diplomacy, weighing the price and availability of COVID-19 vaccines against the concerns over their efficacy and safety. We aimed to analyze public opinion regarding the governmental strategies to obtain COVID-19 vaccines in three Central Asian countries, focusing particularly on possible ethical issues. Methods: We searched for opinions expressed either in Russian or in the respective national languages. We provided data on the debate within three countries, drawn from social media postings and other sources. The opinion data was not restricted by source and time. This allowed collecting a wide range of possible opinions that could be expressed regarding COVID-19 vaccine supply and human participation in the vaccine trial. We recognized ethical issues and possible questions concerning different ethical frameworks. We also considered scientific data and other information, in the process of reasoning. Results: As a result, public views on their respective government policies on COVID-19 vaccine supply ranged from strongly negative to slightly positive. We extracted the most important issues from public debates, for our analysis. The first issue involved trade-offs between quantity, speed, price, freedom, efficacy, and safety in the vaccines. The second set of issues arose in connection with the request to site a randomized trial in one of the countries (Uzbekistan). After considering additional evidence, we weighed individual and public risks against the benefits to make specific judgements concerning every issue. Conclusions: We believe that our analysis would be a helpful example of solving ethical issues that can arise concerning COVID-19 vaccine supply around the world. The public view can be highly critical, helping to spot such issues. An ignoring this view can lead to major problems, which in turn, can become a serious obstacle for the vaccine coverage and epidemics’ control in the countries and regions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Human embryonic stem cells are currently used for developing treatment against Parkinson’s disease (PD). However, the use of ES cells is surrounded with moral concerns. Research regarding the public's attitudes can form an important basis for policymaking. The aim was to explore the perceptions of the public on using donated human embryos for developing treatment of Parkinson’s Disease. Methods: Semi-structured individual qualitative interviews were conducted with 11 members of the general population in Sweden. Interviews were analyzed with thematic content analyses. Results: Four categories and additional sub-categories; Different views on the embryo requires delicacy, Using embryos to treat Parkinson’s disease, Doing things in the right way, and Communication, media, and public opinion. In general, respondents were positive towards the usage of embryotic stem cells to treat PD, but the usage were conditioned and specific terms were demanded. Informed consent from both donors were required and delicacy and sensitivity when working with embryos were needed. Conclusions: It was perceived better to use surplus embryos to treat PD increase is than to discard them, also among those who perceived the embryo as “a potential life.” The participants raised several conditions under usage for treatment should be allowed. Even if the embryos otherwise are going to be discarded, usage requires informed consent from the donating couples. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - As survey costs continue to rise and response rates decline, researchers are seeking more cost-effective ways to collect, analyze and process social and public opinion data. These issues have created an opportunity and interest in expanding the fit-for-purpose paradigm to include alternate sources such as passively collected sensor data and social media data. However, methods for accessing, sourcing and sampling social media data are just now being developed. In fact, there has been a small but growing body of literature focusing on comparing different Twitter data access methods through either the elaborate firehose or the free Twitter search or streaming APIs. Missing from the literature is a good understanding of how to randomly sample Tweets to produce datasets that are representative of the daily discourse, especially within geographical regions of interest, without requiring a census of all Tweets. This understanding is necessary for producing quality estimates of public opinion from social media sources such as Twitter. To address this gap, we propose and test the Velocity-Based Estimation for Sampling Tweets (VBEST) algorithm for selecting a probability based sample of tweets. We compare the performance of VBEST sample estimates to other methods of accessing Twitter through the Search API on the distribution of total Tweets as well as COVID-19 keyword incidence and frequency and find that the VBEST samples produce consistent and relatively low levels of overall bias compared to common methods of access through the Search API across many experimental conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social networks are increasingly used for discussing all kinds of topics, including those related to politics, serving as a virtual arena. Consequently, analysing online conversations, for example, to predict election outcomes, is becoming a popular and challenging research area. On social networking sites, citizens express themselves spontaneously regarding political topics, often driven by specific events in social life. Real-time analysis of social media can provide valuable feedback and insights to both politicians and news agencies. In this paper, we discuss the design and implementation of a system for tracking and analysing social media. The SocMINT system provides an easy-to-use, visual dashboard to monitor the discussion on specific topics, to capture trends in communities and, by iteratively applying multidimensional data analysis and filtering, to deeply analyse posts and influencers. SocMINT aggregates data from multiple social sources and performs sentiment analysis on textual, visual and mixed content via a specifically designed neural network architecture. The system was applied in a real context by administrative staff of a political party to effectively analyse candidates’ political communication on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter and the related online community reactions and discussion. In the paper, we report on this real-world case study, showing how the system meaningfully captures trends in public opinion, comparing the main KPIs provided by SocMINT with the outcomes of traditional polls. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: From 9th April 2021, everyone in England has been encouraged to take two COVID-19 tests per week. This is the first time that national mass asymptomatic testing has been introduced in the UK and the effectiveness of the policy depends on uptake with testing and willingness to self-isolate following a positive test result. This paper examines attitudes towards twice-weekly testing, as well as barriers and facilitators to engaging in testing. Methods: Between 5th April and 28th May 2021 we searched Twitter, Facebook, and online news articles with publicly available comment sections to identify comments relating to twice-weekly testing. We identified 5783 comments which were then analysed using a framework analysis. Results: We identified nine main themes. Five themes related to barriers to engaging in testing: low perceived risk from COVID-19; mistrust in the government; concern about taking a test; perceived ineffectiveness of twice-weekly testing policy; and perceived negative impact of twice-weekly testing policy. Four themes related to facilitators to engaging in testing: wanting to protect others; positive perceptions of tests; a desire to return to normal; and perceived efficacy for reducing asymptomatic transmission. Conclusions: Overall, the comments identified indicated predominately negative attitudes towards the twice weekly testing policy. Several recommendations can be made to improve engagement with twice weekly testing, including: 1) communicate openly and honestly about the purpose of testing; 2) provide information about the accuracy of tests; 3) provide financial support for those required to self-isolate, and; 4) emphasise accessibility of testing. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The majority of biomedical research is funded by public, governmental, and philanthropic grants. These initiatives often shape the avenues and scope of research across disease areas. However, the prioritization of disease-specific funding is not always reflective of the health and social burden of each disease. We identify a prioritization disparity between lung and breast cancers, whereby lung cancer contributes to a substantially higher socioeconomic cost on society yet receives significantly less funding than breast cancer. Using search engine results and natural language processing (NLP) of Twitter tweets, we show that this disparity correlates with enhanced public awareness and positive sentiment for breast cancer. Interestingly, disease-specific venture activity does not correlate with funding or public opinion. We use outcomes from recent early-stage innovation events focused on lung cancer to highlight the complementary mechanism by which bottom-up “grass-roots” initiatives can identify and tackle under-prioritized conditions. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Corporate credit ratings are comprehensive indicators of a company's management performance, earnings quality, and future prospects; they represent its market evaluation and status in the industry and are relevant to the financing and investment decision-making process. Financial institutions determine corporate credit ratings using corporate financial and governance indicators. With advancements in the Internet and the popularity of social media, the appeal of enterprises on social media has become a relevant research topic. Social media represents an alternative method for financial institutions to determine corporate credit ratings. Therefore, the large amounts of data from social media have been used to effectively analyze and predict corporate credit ratings in risk management departments of financial institutions in the field of financial technology (FinTech). This study develops an approach to forecasting corporate credit ratings by analyzing public opinion toward corporations on social media to assist financial institutions in effectively evaluating and controlling corporate risk. This objective is achieved through the following steps: (i) designing a corporate credit rating forecasting process based on big data from social media, (ii) developing techniques for corporate credit rating forecasting, and (iii) implementing and evaluating the corporate credit rating forecasting mechanism. The experimental results of this research show that the accuracy of corporate credit rating prediction based on social media big data is higher than that of traditional financial report, corporate governance and macroeconomic indicators. Moreover, the adopted forecasting model, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), is superior to the other machine learning models in terms of accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Online misinformation has become a constant; only the way actors create and distribute that information is changing. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) such as GPT-2 mean that actors can now synthetically generate text in ways that mimic the style and substance of human-created news stories. We carried out three original experiments to study whether these AI-generated texts are credible and can influence opinions on foreign policy. The first evaluated human perceptions of AI-generated text relative to an original story. The second investigated the interaction between partisanship and AI-generated news. The third examined the distributions of perceived credibility across different AI model sizes. We find that individuals are largely incapable of distinguishing between AI- and human-generated text; partisanship affects the perceived credibility of the story; and exposure to the text does little to change individuals' policy views. The findings have important implications in understanding AI in online misinformation campaigns. © 2022 Cambridge University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social media is commonly used by the public during election campaigns to express their opinions regarding different issues. Among various social media channels, Twitter provides an efficient platform for researchers and politicians to explore public opinion regarding a wide range of topics such as the economy and foreign policy. Current literature mainly focuses on analyzing the content of tweets without considering the gender of users. This research collects and analyzes a large number of tweets and uses computational, human coding, and statistical analyses to identify topics in more than 300,000 tweets posted during the 2020 U.S. presidential election and to compare female and male users regarding the average weight of the discussed topics. Our findings are based upon a wide range of topics, such as tax, climate change, and the COVID-19 pandemic. Out of the topics, there exists a significant difference between female and male users for more than 70% of topics. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This work utilizes data from Twitter to mine association rules and extract knowledge about public attitudes regarding worldwide crises. It exploits the COVID-19 pandemic as a use case, and analyzes tweets gathered between February and August 2020. The proposed methodology comprises topic extraction and visualization techniques, such as WordClouds, to form clusters or themes of opinions. It then uses Association Rule Mining (ARM) to discover frequent wordsets and generate rules that infer to user attitudes. The goal is to utilize ARM as a postprocessing technique to enhance the output of any topic extraction method. Therefore, only strong wordsets are stored after discarding trivia ones. We also employ frequent wordset identification to reduce the number of extracted topics. Our findings showcase that 50 initially retrieved topics are narrowed down to just 4, when combining Latent Dirichlet Allocation with ARM. Our methodology facilitates producing more accurate and generalizable results, whilst exposing implications regarding social media user attitudes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Whether or not consumers participate in beverage packaging recycling is based on their ecological cognition to make the best choice under the comprehensive influence of rationality and perceptuality. After careful research, we shows that: ①ecological cognition has a significant role in promoting the willingness of consumers to participate in the recycling of beverage packaging; ②attitudes toward behavior, subject norms, and perceived behavioral control all have a significant impact on consumers’ willingness to participate in beverage packaging recycling; ③the exemplary norms have greater driving demonstration effects on consumers’ participation in the recycling of beverage packaging than the mandatory norms. Therefore, it is necessary to give full play to the guiding role of the media, increase the publicity of relevant policies such as protecting the ecological environment, and improve the supervision and management system of the urban ecological environment, actively mobilize consumers' willingness to participate in beverage packaging recycling. © 2022

AB  - COVID-19 has illuminated health inequity in the United States. The burdens of disease are much higher among Black and Indigenous people and other people of color. Disparities by income are also profound, as lower-wage workers were less able to adopt mitigating behaviors compared to higher-income counterparts. These disparities became part of public health discourse in 2020, with commentators frequently highlighting the connection between racism, socioeconomic position, and COVID-19. But what proportion of the public—and among key subgroups—recognized these social group disparities, relative to disparities associated with age and chronic illness, and did public recognition change over the first year of the pandemic? To address these questions, we analyzed data from three nationally-representative cross-sectional public opinion surveys, collected using the NORC AmeriSpeak panel in April 2020 (N = 1007), August 2020 (N = 2716), and April 2021 (N = 1020). The key outcomes were respondents' agreement with statements about disparities in COVID-19 mortality by age, chronic illness, income, and race. We found little change from 2020 to 2021 in Americans' recognition of disparities. At all three time points, most respondents acknowledged age and chronic illness disparities, while no more than half at any time point recognized income- and race-based disparities. Political party affiliation was not statistically associated with agreement with age or illness-related disparities, but was strongly associated with views about income- and race-based disparities. Efforts to promote recognition of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the United States need to be mindful of the ways in which public understanding of health inequities is linked to partisanship. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social media have increasingly been used by political bodies and experts to disseminate health information to the public. However, we still know little about how the communication of these actors on social media is received by other users and how it reflects trends in public trust. We examined social media dynamics in the communication of information by major actors (n = 188) involved in COVID-19 online discussions in Switzerland. These actors are scientists (experts), policymakers (government officials, cantonal executives, and other parties), and representatives of mass media. We found little correlation between Twitter features (other users' engagement and negativity in other users' replies) and the level of public trust found in representative opinion surveys. We used topic modelling in combination with correspondence analysis, and including additional variables for actor types and the period of the public debate further enabled us to detect salient episodes related to the pandemic on social media. In particular, we found that differing roles were played by the (health) experts and political authorities in terms of both topics and influence on the specific timing of the pandemic. The results of this study provide helpful conclusions for communication among political authorities, health experts, and the public. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Since the rapid spread of the COVID-19 worldwide, the pandemic has led to a huge impact on global sporting events. As a major international event, the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics has commonalities with the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, and the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in terms of international public opinion context and epidemiological background. In this study, over 1 million pieces of UGC(User Generated Contents) in Chinese and English languages were obtained from social media platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, as well as traditional mass media in various countries to compare the differences between the two languages in international public opinion. Using sentiment analysis, this study explores the evolution of international public opinion topics and sentiment differences among the above four Olympic Games. The analysis results show that:1) regardless of traditional mass media or online social media, there is a more obvious tendency of general politicization in the topics of the 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, and extreme emotional remarks of the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics are more frequent; 2) in the topic of political opinion involving China, international Chinese public opinion presents more negative sentiment than those in English; 3) Among the topics involving COVID-19, the negative level of public opinion in Chinese and English is opposite for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics;4) International public opinion on the topic of sports events is significantly more positive in Chinese than in English;5) YouTube's Chinese opinion environment is better than English. © 2022

AB  - While ample research has scrutinised the causes and consequences of support for the European Union, a pressing question remains: what do people actually mean when they express support for, or opposition to, their country’s membership of the institution? We use Correlational Class Analysis to assess this. Our analysis of high-quality representative Dutch survey data (n = 2053), including novel items informed by in-depth qualitative research, reveals that European Union support comes in three guises: federalist, non-federalist and instrumental-pragmatist Strikingly, many Europhiles are not federalists. In addition, we reveal that the social bases of the three types of support especially differ regarding political competence, political orientation, and media consumption. The implications for ongoing debates on European Union atttidues are discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Information cascade diffusion is ubiquitous in modern social medias and other fields, such as viral marketing, paper citation dynamics, and public opinion communication. However, the existing deep learning-based methods to model and predict the growth of information cascades pay much attention to the nodes in the cascades and ignore the overall propagation structure of the cascades. Simultaneously, they are usually of high complexity and low computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for information cascade predictor, named CasTCN, which can effectively capture the structure dynamic of the information cascades. Firstly, we design a dynamic mapping mechanism, which can represent the overall structure of information cascades an its dynamic evolution. Secondly, we extract the higher-level representation of cascade network through deep temporal convolutional network. Finally, the prediction module is applied to predict the growth scale of information cascades. Since CasTCN is a graph-level method, it has relatively fewer model parameters, so the model training time is also less than other baseline methods. Our experiments on two real-world datasets show that CasTCN can achieve better performance than other baseline methods on both effectiveness and efficiency. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods, the prediction error is reduced by 8.58%, 7.13% and 6.89% respectively on 3 subdatasets of Weibo, and 15.00%, 11.02% and 9.12% on 3 subdatasets of APS respectively. Also, the training time is much more less than baselines. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Public opinion is among the critical types of information that often inform policy changes and political strategies. Extreme public opinion is of particular importance due to the potential it has in leading to radical behaviors and violent actions. The monitoring and analysis of extreme public opinion are therefore of great interest to government officials seeking to maintain public order and preempt violent actions. Radicalization is the process employed to influence individuals to develop extreme views and behaviors. Due to their global reach and popularity, social media platforms are used tools for recruitment and radicalization. Recently, data mining and natural language processing techniques have been employed for the detection of extremism and radicalization online. However, the existing approaches focus on the classification of individuals as extremists or non-extremists, thus simplifying the concept of radicalization to a binary problem. Such approaches fail to capture the nuances and the complexity of the radicalization process that is influenced by many aspects such as peer pressure, social interactions, and the impact of prominent figures. Aiming at addressing those limitations, this work proposed a sophisticated approach for the analysis of extreme views expressed on social media. The proposed approach combines the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques with expert content analysis to achieve a fine-grained and detailed analysis of Twitter extremist content related to the Far-right ideology as a case study. A dataset of over 259,000 tweets collected over five years was used to test our approach, leading to sophisticated analytics and insights about Far-right extremism. The proposed approach can serve as a powerful decision support tool for governments for the analysis of extreme public opinion that is expressed online, and open the door for more effective and responsive decision making. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - We present the first field experiment on how organized interest groups' television ads affect issue opinions. We randomized 31,404 voters to three weeks of interest group ads about either immigration or transgender nondiscrimination. We then randomly assigned voters to receive ostensibly unrelated surveys either while the ads aired, one day after they stopped, or three days afterwards. Voters recalled the ads, but three ads had a minimal influence on public opinion, whereas a fourth's effects decayed within one day. However, voters remembered a fact from one ad. Our results suggest issue ads can affect public opinion but that not every ad persuades and that persuasive effects decay. Despite the vast sums spent on television ads, our results are the first field experiment on their persuasive power on issues, shedding light on the mechanisms underpinning-and limits on-both televised persuasion and interest group influence. ©

AB  - Social media technologies have been widely adopted by governments to increase civic engagement, promote openness, and extend services. Previous research finds that public managers’ attitudes are important predictors of social media adoption and successful implementation. Managers’ attitudes may vary due to different organizational structures, functions, and operations based on department type or because departments vary along with key dimensions. This research investigates the following questions: (1) Does department type significantly predict public managers’ attitudes toward social media, (2) does department type moderate the effect of predictors of managers’ attitudes toward social media found in previous research, and (3) do the predictors of managers’ attitudes toward social media found in previous research mediate attitude differences observed across different kinds of departments. Using data collected from a 2014 national web survey in the United States on technology in city government, we find department type is an important predictor of managers’ attitudes toward social media use. The effects of other predictors of attitudes toward social media use were not moderated by department type. Instead, those predictors had similar effects regardless of department type. Some of the variables related to organizational characteristics and culture (e.g., social media use, innovativeness, and use of e-services) helped to explain differences between the attitudes of managers from different departments. Our findings are important for developing strategies to target managers’ negative attitudes toward using social media, thus removing one of the barriers to successful technology implementation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - I develop a model in which an incumbent with reelection concerns seeks to influence public opinion by strategically controlling the media's access to information. I show that the incumbent's optimal access strategy balances her demand for positive bias with the public's demand for credible coverage. The media's access increases with the competence of politicians over issues under public focus. Controlling media's access can be instrumental in shaping public opinion, especially in the hands of popular incumbents. Persistence of key election issues, however, decreases the effectiveness of media access control by incumbents. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Twitter is a valuable resource for research because of its potential to provide insight into public opinion as well as to identify the most influential sources of information. Mixed-methods exploratory analysis was used to evaluate the discourse on Twitter regarding gifted education. The results of the quantitative analysis of the matrix of connections using NodeXL Pro indicate that gifted education Twitter is a cohesive network and that the top influencers are organizations and educational consultants. Sentiment analysis using Linguistics Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC2015, Pennebaker et al., 2015) software indicates that tweets related to gifted education have a mix of positive and negative emotive tone. The qualitative analyses suggest that gifted education professionals and parents engage in Twitter in similar ways to what has been described in past research: to share interesting articles and videos, to discuss current issues, promote one's ideas, and seek opportunities. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Social media platforms enable people exchange their thoughts, reactions, emotions regarding all aspects of their lives. Therefore, sentiment analysis using textual data is widely practiced field. Due to large textual content available on social media, sentiment analysis is usually considered a text classification task. The high feature dimension is an important issue that needs to be resolved by examining text meaningfully. The proposed study considers a case study of coronavirus (COVID) vaccination to conclude public opinions about prospects for vaccination. Text corpus of tweets is collected, published between December 12, 2020, and July 13, 2021 is considered. The proposed model is developed considering phase-by-phase data analysis process, followed by an assessment of important information about the collected tweets on coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine using two sentiment analyzer methods and probabilistic models for validation and knowledge analysis. The result indicated that public sentiment is more positive than negative. The study also presented statistics of trends in vaccination progress in the top countries from early 2021 to July 2021. The scope of study is enormous regarding sentiment analysis based on keyword and document modeling. The proposed work offers an effective mechanism for a decision-making system to understand public opinion and accordingly assists policymakers in health measures and vaccination campaigns. © 2022 Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

AB  - Drawing on a multimodal approach to Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this research critically examines the 2017 “burqa stunt” of Australian far-right populist politician, Pauline Hanson. Adapting Scalmer's (2002) conceptualisation of the “political gimmick”, this paper makes the following arguments: Firstly, that Hanson's “burqa stunt” must be understood as an articulation of Islamophobia and political performance. It was the interplay of Hanson's radical right and populist ideologies that informed the stunt. As such, this paper bridges the ideational and performative approaches to populism. Secondly, the stunt was the product of the mediatisation of politics and the logics that govern contemporary media in Australia. The aim of Hanson's stunt was clear: to generate controversy and media attention. In this, the “burqa stunt” was incredibly successful and was extensively covered both nationally and internationally. The stunt was the most overt expression of the anti-Muslim racism that has defined Hanson's contemporary political resurgence. This paper furthers our growing understanding of how far-right populist actors strategically employ performance strategies designed to generate controversy and media attention. It also highlights how racist far-right actors are able to articulate Islamophobia in novel ways that exploit the logics of the contemporary media environment. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are receiving increasing attention in academic, policy, and media discourses. However, no public opinion research has focused on ACEs. We conducted a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults to address this knowledge gap. A web-based survey was conducted using the Ipsos KnowledgePanel (N = 503, completion rate = 60.5%) in fall 2019. We found that inter-personal stigma and parental blame related to ACEs were prevalent, with 25.0% of respondents unwilling to have a person with “a lot of ACEs” as a close co-worker and 65.2% believing that parents were very much to blame for the consequences of ACEs. Fifty percent of respondents believed that government intervention to prevent ACEs was very important. After adjustment for demographic characteristics, inter-personal stigma toward people with ACEs and conservative ideology were significantly associated with lower perceived importance of government intervention to prevent ACEs. Black race, Hispanic ethnicity, and female gender were significantly associated with higher perceived importance of government intervention. These findings provide an empirical foundation to inform strategies to communicate ACE science to public and policymaker audiences. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Given recent and growing societal movements focusing on sexual assault, such as the #MeToo Movement, it is imperative to understand current attitudes about sexual assault and these movements. The aim of this study was to examine negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault in the context of the #MeToo Movement by qualitatively analyzing social media posts (i.e., tweets) containing the hashtag “metoo” on Twitter, a popular social media platform. The initial sample consisted of 4,559 tweets that were publicly posted by Twitter users across a four-day timeframe and represented events and attitudes regarding both about an accuser and an accused. Data were cleaned and coded, and a remaining 508 tweets were included because they contained content that was categorized as negative in their attitudes or beliefs (either through attitudes of condemnation or ambivalence towards accusers and/or the #MeToo Movement). Results from a qualitative content analysis of tweets demonstrated that negative attitudes and beliefs about sexual assault within the context of the #MeToo Movement were conveyed through six main themes: (1) invalidating the accusations made as part of the #MeToo Movement; (2) insisting, and likely believing, that accusations made were false; (3) claiming that there were alternative motives for those accusations; (4) showing a concern for the harm that accusations may cause those accused; (5) exhibiting concerns about the effects of the Movement on male power, privilege, and status; and (6) questioning the integrity of the #MeToo Movement as a whole. These findings provide a deeper understanding of attitudes and beliefs about the #MeToo Movement, including novel beliefs not often addressed in the literature. Most importantly, these findings show that rape culture continues to persist despite current interventions and social movements. Results underscore the need for future interventions that aim to educate and improve societal attitudes towards sexual assault. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - With the wide application of social media, public opinion analysis in social networks has been unable to be met through text alone because the existing public opinion information includes data information of various modalities, such as voice, text, and facial expressions. Therefore multi-modal emotion analysis is the current focus of public opinion analysis. In addition, multi-modal emotion recognition of speech is an important factor restricting the multi-modal emotion analysis. In this paper, the emotion feature retrieval method for speech is firstly explored and the processing method of sample disequilibrium data is then analyzed. By comparing and studying the different feature fusion methods of text and speech, respectively, the multi-modal feature fusion method for sample disequilibrium data is proposed to realize multi-modal emotion recognition. Experiments are performed using two publicly available datasets (IEMOCAP and MELD), which shows that processing multi-modality data through this method can obtain good fine-grained emotion recognition results, laying a foundation for subsequent social public opinion analysis.

AB  - Purpose: American police agencies' swift adoption of body-worn camera (BWC) technology, coupled with the ubiquity of smartphones and social media, has led to a “new visibility” of policing. Video recordings are often touted as objective evidentiary accounts of police-civilian interactions. Yet even these recordings are rarely seen in a vacuum, but instead accompanied by headlines and accounts. Design/methodology/approach: Using a diverse sample of young American adults (N = 943) and an experimental design incorporating a short poorly recorded BWC video embedded within a survey, this study investigates perceptions of the appropriateness of police behavior in an ambiguous situation where officers used deadly force on a Black civilian. All respondents viewed the same video, but were randomly assigned to one of four ultimate outcomes. Findings: Respondents overwhelmingly reported the BWC video was personally important and significant for a subsequent investigation and public opinion. The experimental manipulation, along with background factors, exerted a substantial effect on perceptions of the officers' actions. Respondents found the officers' actions more appropriate when told the civilian held a weapon. Originality/value: Americans are divided on the role of police in a democratic society. Objective accounts like video recordings may be used to build consensus, but our results, derived from a novel method and dataset, suggest deeper cognitive biases must also be overcome. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - After decades of relatively high inflows of foreign nationals, immigration is now at the center of substantial political divisions in most European countries and has been implicated in one of the most vexing developments in European politics, the rise of the xenophobic right. However, it is not clear whether high levels of immigration actually do cause a public backlash, or whether publics become habituated to, and supportive of, immigration. This study tests these backlash and habituation theories using novel measures of immigration mood and immigration concern produced by combining over 4,000 opinion datapoints across twenty-nine years and thirty countries. The authors find evidence of a public backlash in the short to medium run, where mood turns negative and concern about immigration rises. Yet the study also finds evidence of a longer-run process of habituation that cancels out the backlash effect within one (concern) to three (mood) decades. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The effects of intergroup contact in reducing prejudices have been well documented, but few studies have investigated the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. This article examines the predictors of social distance from Muslims in a large sample of (non-Muslim) German university students (N = 404). Intergroup contact was an important predictor of reduced social distance even after demographics and perceptions of parents, tertiary institutions, media and broader intergroup dynamics were taken into account. The contact-social distance relationship was, however, mediated in part by perceived parental support for intergroup relations and perceived fairness of media representation. Students’ perceptions of broader group dynamics relating to assigning positive and negative attributes largely impeded the relationship – more so for male students than female. The findings attest to the importance of the broader context within which contact occurs. Having contact with outgroup members leads to reduced social distance from the outgroup, but perceived norms and outgroup perceptions play a pivotal role in explaining this relationship. © Equinox Publishing Ltd. 2022.

AB  - Partisan segregation within the news audience buffers many Americans from countervailing political views, posing a risk to democracy. Empirical studies of the online media ecosystem suggest that only a small minority of Americans, driven by a mix of demand and algorithms, are siloed according to their political ideology. However, such research omits the comparatively larger television audience and often ignores temporal dynamics underlying news consumption. By analyzing billions of browsing and viewing events between 2016 and 2019, with a novel framework for measuring partisan audiences, we first estimate that 17% of Americans are partisan-segregated through television versus roughly 4% online. Second, television news consumers are several times more likely to maintain their partisan news diets month-over-month. Third, TV viewers’ news diets are far more concentrated on preferred sources. Last, partisan news channels’ audiences are growing even as the TV news audience is shrinking. Our results suggest that television is the top driver of partisan audience segregation among Americans.

AB  - Extraction of public opinion is a way of gathering knowledge based on short texts written by users to provide attitudes. This condition encourages a lot of research using social media, especially the sentiment analysis approach in conducting initial identification or predictions. Social media is a dynamic medium to get public opinion which is very cheap and very large in number. This research aims to provide a review of predictions using sentiment analysis, one of the analytical methods in big data analytics. Sentiment analysis techniques are used to predict customer review, market, health, and social behavior. The sentiment analysis approach sourced from social media is able to contribute to making predictions in the form of an early warning system of problems so that it can help decision-makers based on big data analytics. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific

AB  - Objective/Context: The present article develops a theoretical tool to explain drug policy decisions called the Psychoactive Politics Framework. It is built on the assumption that the design and implementation of drug policies affect several political goals, such as popularity, winning elections, material benefits, and international reputation. Therefore, the framework expects these policies to be the result of national and international incentives that will help policy makers achieve those goals. These are incentives related to public opinion, policy advocacy, crises, pressure, standing, and leadership. Methodology: The second part of the article applies the Psychoactive Politics Framework to explain Peru's first legislation to eradicate illicit coca crops: the Decree Law 22095 of 1978. Through examining diplomatic cables, protocols of international meetings, and media sources, the analysis gathers evidence in favor and against each of the incentives outlined in the framework. Conclusions: While Peru's drug policy reform took place in an increasingly prohibitionist international environment, its primary driver was the advocacy of national actors, such as the Ministry of the Interior, the Investigative Police, and the attorney general. Originality: The findings question the popular notion that prohibitionist drug policies in South America resulted exclusively from US pressure. Furthermore, the article presents a coherent tool to carry out theory-guided research about past and present drug policy decisions. © 2022 Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

AB  - Before the advent of social media and big data analytics, the right to vote under conditions of ballot secrecy ensured a complementary relationship between the privacy of the voting act and political self-observation as a second-order observation in democratic political systems. Key to this relationship is the notion of public opinion. This notion and its relevance for professional political actors in dealing with political uncertainty are at stake in the age of social media. The privacy of the voting act becomes a problem once it is believed to be subject to the overriding influence of algorithmic recommendation and targeted advertising. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Media discourse reflects and shapes social and public opinion, which is crucial to the policy-making and energy system deployment. In this study, we focus on exploring the impact of media discourse on social perceptions towards biomass energy utilization in the different economic areas of China via free-expression surveys guided by the framework of socio-political evaluation of energy deployment (SPEED), which are posted and promoted in social networks. A systematical benefit-risk analysis in each SPEED framework has been discussed. Responses to the survey questions regarding the impact of media discourse on social perceptions towards biomass energy utilization in each SPEED benefit-risk framework are processed by natural language processing, and then analyzed via the word network model in social network services where several network-based indices are computed. The hidden keywords addressing the impact of media discourse on social perceptions towards biomass energy utilization are revealed. This study is to serve the public communication and implementation strategies on biomass energy deployment and utilization, and unveil the often-overlooked social influences affecting energy system change. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Dental care expenses are reported to present higher financial barriers than any other type of health care service in the United States. Social media platforms such as Twitter have become a source of public health communication and surveillance. Previous studies have demonstrated the usefulness of Twitter in exploring public opinion on aspects of dental care. To date, no studies have leveraged Twitter to examine public sentiments regarding dental care affordability in the United States. Objective: The aim of this study is to understand public perceptions of dental care affordability in the United States on the social media site, Twitter. Methods: Tweets posted between September 1, 2017, and September 30, 2021, were collected using the Snscrape application. Query terms were selected a priori to represent dentistry and financial aspects associated with dental treatment. Data were analyzed qualitatively using both deductive and inductive approaches. In total, 8% (440/5500) of all included tweets were coded to identify prominent themes and subthemes. The entire sample of included tweets were then independently coded into thematic categories. Quantitative data analyses included geographic distribution of tweets by state, volume analysis of tweets over time, and distribution of tweets by content theme. Results: A final sample of 5314 tweets were included in the study. Thematic analysis identified the following prominent themes: (1) general sentiments (1614 tweets, 30.4%); (2) delaying or forgoing dental care (1190 tweets, 22.4%); (3) payment strategies (1019 tweets, 19.2%); (4) insurance (767 tweets, 14.4%); and (5) policy statements (724 tweets, 13.6%). Geographic distributions of the tweets established California, Texas, Florida, and New York as the states with the most tweets. Qualitative analysis revealed barriers faced by individuals to accessing dental care, strategies taken to cope with dental pain, and public perceptions on aspects of dental care policy. The volume and thematic trends of the tweets corresponded to relevant societal events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and debates on health care policy resulting from the election of President Joseph R. Biden. Conclusions: The findings illustrate the real-time sentiment of social media users toward the cost of dental treatment and suggest shortcomings in funding that may be representative of greater systemic failures in the provision of dental care. Thus, this study provides insights for policy makers and dental professionals who strive to increase access to dental care. © Shahen Yashpal, Ananditha Raghunath, Nihan Gencerliler, Lorel E Burns.

AB  - Background: On May 18, 2020, the New York State Department of Health implemented a statewide flavor ban to prohibit the sales of all flavored vapor products, except for tobacco or any other authorized flavor. Objective: This study aims to investigate the discussion changes in e-cigarette–related tweets over time with the implementation of the New York State flavor ban. Methods: Through the Twitter streaming application programming interface, 59,883 e-cigarette–related tweets were collected within the New York State from February 6, 2020, to May 17, 2020 (period 1, before the implementation of the flavor ban), May 18, 2020-June 30, 2020 (period 2, between the implementation of the flavor ban and the online sales ban), July 1, 2020-September 15, 2020 (period 3, the short term after the online sales ban), and September 16, 2020-November 30, 2020 (period 4, the long term after the online sales ban). Sentiment analysis and topic modeling were conducted to investigate the changes in public attitudes and discussions in e-cigarette–related tweets. The popularity of different e-cigarette flavor categories was compared before and after the implementation of the New York State flavor ban. Results: Our results showed that the proportion of e-cigarette–related tweets with negative sentiment significantly decreased (4305/13,246, 32.5% vs 3855/14,455, 26.67%, P<.001), and tweets with positive sentiment significantly increased (5246/13,246, 39.6% vs 7038/14,455, 48.69%, P<.001) in period 4 compared to period 3. “Teens and nicotine products” was the most frequently discussed e-cigarette–related topic in the negative tweets. In contrast, “nicotine products and quitting” was more prevalent in positive tweets. The proportion of tweets mentioning mint and menthol flavors significantly increased right after the flavor ban and decreased to lower levels over time. The proportions of fruit and sweet flavors were most frequently mentioned in period 1, decreased in period 2, and dominated again in period 4. Conclusions: The proportion of e-cigarette–related tweets with different attitudes and frequently discussed flavor categories changed over time after the implementation of the New York State ban of flavored vaping products. This change indicated a potential impact of the flavor ban on public discussions of flavored e-cigarettes. © Yankun Gao, Zidian Xie, Dongmei Li.

AB  - Background: Oral nicotine pouches are a new form of tobacco-free nicotine products launched in recent years with a variety of flavors. Objective: This study aims to examine the public perceptions and discussions of oral nicotine pouches on Reddit, a popular social media platform for sharing user experiences. Methods: Between February 15, 2019, and February 12, 2021, a total of 2410 Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches were obtained over a 2-year period. After the removal of unrelated or commercial posts, 653 Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches remained. Topics and sentiments related to oral nicotine pouches on Reddit were hand coded. Results: The number of Reddit posts related to oral nicotine pouches increased during the study period. Content analysis showed that the most popular topic was “sharing product information and user experience” (366/653, 56%), in which sharing oral nicotine pouch products and user experiences were dominant. The next popular topic was “asking product-related questions” (product properties and product recommendations; 115/653, 17.6%), followed by “quitting nicotine products” such as vaping or smoking through use of oral nicotine pouches or quitting the oral nicotine pouches themselves (83/653, 12.7%) and “discussing oral nicotine pouch-related health” symptoms or concerns related to oral nicotine pouches (74/653, 11.3%). The least popular topic was “legality and permissions” related to oral nicotine pouches (15/653, 2.3%). In addition, a greater number of Reddit posts described positive attitudes compared to negative attitudes toward oral nicotine pouches (354/653, 54.2% vs 101/653, 15.5%; P < .001). Conclusions: Reddit posts overall had a positive attitude toward oral nicotine pouches and users were actively sharing product and user experiences. Our study provides the first insight on up-to-date oral nicotine pouch discussions on social media. © Yihan Shao, Jonathan Zou, Zidian Xie, Rachel Grana Mayne, Deborah J Ossip, Irfan Rahman, Scott McIntosh, Dongmei Li.

AB  - Cinema has long been used to mediate new technologies as contentious as the atomic bomb, yet historians of technology have largely overlooked mediation processes. This article argues that media are integral to the historical definition, negotiation, and spread of new technologies by demonstrating useful cinema’s significance for the social shaping of mainframe computing. When the 1950s’ adoption of computers triggered a wave of automation anxiety among working Americans, powerful institutional actors turned to educational, industrial, and documentary films to reshape American public opinion. Films tailored by IBM, the U.S. Navy, and CBS helped quell crises from software labor shortages to the existential threat of pushbutton weapons. Once distributed among educational film channels, however, these films reached increasingly large audiences, spreading and generalizing computerization’s narrative inevitability. By tracing films instead of hardware, this article demonstrates the importance of the media-historical approach to studying the social shaping of technology. © 2022 by the Society for the History of Technology.

AB  - Public behavior in cyberspace is extremely sensitive to emergency disaster events. Using appropriate methodologies to capture the semantic evolution of social media users’ behaviors and discover how it varies across geographic space and time still presents a significant challenge. This study proposes a novel framework based on complex network, topic model, and GIS to describe the topic change of social media users’ behaviors during disaster events. The framework employs topic modeling to extract topics from social media texts, builds a user semantic evolution model based on a complex network to describe topic dynamics, and analyzes the spatio-temporal characteristics of public semantics evolution. The proposed framework has demonstrated its effectiveness in analyzing the semantic spatial–temporal evolution of Chinese Weibo user behavior during COVID-19. The semantic change in response to COVID-19 was characterized by obvious expansion, frequent change, and gradual stabilization over time. In this case, there were obvious geographical differences in users’ semantic changes, which were mainly concentrated in the capital and economically developed areas. The semantics of users finally focused on specific topics related to positivity, epidemic prevention, and factual comments. Our work provides new insight into the behavioral response to disasters and provides the basis for data-driven public sector decisions. In emergency situations, this model could improve situational assessment, assist decision makers to better comprehend public opinion, and support analysts in allocating resources of disaster relief appropriately. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Social bots, or algorithmic agents that amplify certain viewpoints and interact with selected actors on social media, may influence online discussion, news attention, or even public opinion through coordinated action. Previous research has documented the presence of bot activities and developed detection algorithms. Yet, how social bots influence attention dynamics of the hybrid media system remains understudied. Leveraging a large collection of both tweets (N = 1,657,551) and news stories (N = 50,356) about the early COVID-19 pandemic, we employed bot detection techniques, structural topic modeling, and time series analysis to characterize the temporal associations between the topics Twitter bots tend to amplify and subsequent news coverage across the partisan spectrum. We found that bots represented 8.98% of total accounts, selectively promoted certain topics and predicted coverage aligned with partisan narratives. Our macro-level longitudinal description highlights the role of bots as algorithmic communicators and invites future research to explain micro-level causal mechanisms. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Even though social media contain rich information on events and public opinions, it is impractical to manually filter this information due to data’s vast generation and dynamicity. Thus, automated extraction mechanisms are invaluable to the community. We need real data with ground truth labels to build/evaluate such systems. Still, to the best of our knowledge, no available social media dataset covers continuous periods with event and sentiment labels together except for events or sentiments. Datasets without time gaps are huge due to high data generation and require extensive effort for manual labelling. Different approaches, ranging from unsupervised to supervised, have been proposed by previous research targeting such datasets. However, their generic nature mainly fails to capture event-specific sentiment expressions, making them inappropriate for labelling event sentiments. Filling this gap, we propose a novel data annotation approach in this paper involving several neural networks. Our approach outperforms the commonly used sentiment annotation models such as VADER and TextBlob. Also, it generates probability values for all sentiment categories besides providing a single category per tweet, supporting aggregated sentiment analyses. Using this approach, we annotate and release a dataset named TED-S, covering two diverse domains, sports and politics. TED-S has complete subsets of Twitter data streams with both sub-event and sentiment labels, providing the ability to support event sentiment-based research. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Technologies offered and used on the Internet play a significant part in the lives of children; nevertheless, little research has been done on how children view and use machine translation (MT). According to recent literature, there are various benefits to using MT in teaching/learning foreign languages, such as more fluent writing, more effective communication, and fewer errors. Nevertheless, the use of MT in classroom settings is often viewed as problematic by language teachers. Despite the fact that a vast number of students have used MT for various purposes or have tried experimenting with MT for certain academic or entertainment purposes, they seem to have mixed feelings about it. The present qualitative study is based on semi-structured interviews and aims to capture a snapshot of Lithuanian children’s perceptions and awareness of MT technologies. The results of the interviews reveal that children mostly find out about MT as a result of their own efforts and employ MT tools for a variety of purposes; however, at school no systematic guidance and/or support in terms of MT use is provided and children tend to perceive that their teachers generally hold negative attitudes towards MT. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Cancer patients, being immunocompromised, are at higher risk of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The current study determines cancer patients’ knowledge, attitude, perception, and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: A cross-sectional online survey was conducted in Pakistan from 1 April 2020 to 1 May 2020. The study respondents were cancer patients with ages equal to or greater than 18 years. Following a request for participation, the URL for the survey was distributed on numerous channels. Other social media platforms, including WeChat, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Messenger, and LinkedIn, were used to increase cancer patient interaction. The questionnaire comprised five different sections such as: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) knowledge, (3) attitude, (4) perception, and (5) impact of COVID-19 on cancer patients. Descriptive medical statistics such as frequency, percentage, mean, and standard deviation were used to illustrate the demographic characteristics of the study participants. To compare mean knowledge scores with selected demographic variables, independent sample t-tests and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used, which are also practical methods in epidemiological, public health and medical research. The cut-off point for statistical significance was set at a p-value of 0.05. Results: More than 300 cancer patients were invited, of which 208 agreed to take part. The response rate was 69.33% (208/300). Gender, marital status, and employment status had a significant association with knowledge scores. Of the total recruited participants, 96% (n = 200) (p < 0.01) knew about COVID-19, and 90% were aware of general symptoms of COVID-19 disease, such as route of transmission and preventive measurements. In total, 94.5% (n = 197) (p < 0.01) were willing to accept isolation if they were infected with COVID-19, and 98% (n = 204) (p < 0.01) had reduced their use of public transportation. More than 90% (n = 188) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients were found to be practicing preventative measures such as using a face mask, keeping social distance, and avoiding handshaking and hugging. Around 94.4% (n = 196) (p < 0.01) of cancer patients had been impacted by, stopped or had. changed cancer treatment during this pandemic, resulting in COVID-related anxiety and depression. Conclusion: The included cancer patients exhibited a good level of COVID-19 knowledge, awareness, positive attitude, and perception. Large-scale studies and efforts are needed to raise COVID-19 awareness among less educated and high-risk populations. The present survey indicates that mass-level effective health education initiatives are required for developing countries to improve and reduce the gap between KAP and COVID-19. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The study dealt with the role of the media in shaping the mental image of women in public opinion. Advertising has exploited the image of women as a marketing means, and invest their emotional characteristics to stimulate the social change and disruption of development and progress. The study aimed to investigate the role of electronic media in shaping the image of Arab women, the nature of this image, and the mechanisms of imprinting it in the minds of public opinion. The descriptive approach was used to illustrate the study problem and to survey a sample of the contents of women's affairs on the BBC.NEWS website. It was conducted from the years 2020-2021 and represented (183) news and programs that were subjected to analysis and came out with following results: the study showed that 70% of the mental images that an individual forms about the surrounding world come from the media. It also showed that social topics were among the most frequently discussed topics, as they came in by 50.8% and constituted more than half of the contents in the sample, which reflects the personality of women and their social role. The results showed that the contents published on women's affairs on the website of the Arabic channel (BBC News) reflected the negative image of Arab women by 68.85% compared to the contents that reflected the positive image, which represents only 31.14% of the total sample of the analysis. © 2022 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

AB  - Objective: Risk assessment and response is important for understanding human behavior. The divisive context surrounding the coronavirus pandemic inspires our exploration of risk perceptions and the polarization of mitigation practices (i.e., the degree to which the behaviors of people on the political “Left” diverge from those on the “Right”). Specifically, we investigate the extent to which the political polarization of willingness to comply with mitigation behaviors changes with risk perceptions. Method: Analyses use data from two sources: an original dataset of Twitter posts and a nationally-representative survey. In the Twitter data, negative binomial regression models are used to predict mitigation intent measured using tweet counts. In the survey data, logit models predict self-reported mitigation behavior (vaccination, masking, and social distancing). Results: Findings converged across both datasets, supporting the idea that the links between political orientation and willingness to follow mitigation guidelines depend on perceived risk. People on the Left are more inclined than their Right-oriented colleagues to follow guidelines, but this polarization tends to decrease as the perceived risk of COVID-19 intensifies. Additionally, we find evidence that exposure to COVID-19 infections sends ambiguous signals about the risk of the virus while COVID-19 related deaths have a more consistent impact on mitigation behaviors. Conclusions: Pandemic-related risks can create opportunities for perceived “common ground,” between the political “Right” and “Left.” Risk perceptions and politics interact in their links to intended COVID-19 mitigation behavior (as measured both on Twitter and in a national survey). Our results invite a more complex interpretation of political polarization than those stemming from simplistic analyses of partisanship and ideology. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Documenting the emergent social representations of COVID-19 in public communication is necessary for critically reflecting on pandemic responses and providing guidance for global pandemic recovery policies and practices. This study documents the dynamics of changing social representations of the COVID-19 pandemic on one of the largest Chinese social media, Weibo, from December 2019 to April 2020. We draw on the social representation theory (SRT) and conceptualize topics and topic networks as a form of social representation. We analyzed a dataset of 40 million COVID-19 related posts from 9.7 million users (including the general public, opinion leaders, and organizations) using machine learning methods. We identified 12 topics and found an expansion in social representations of COVID-19 from a clinical and epidemiological perspective to a broader perspective that integrated personal illness experiences with economic and sociopolitical discourses. Discussions about COVID-19 science did not take a prominent position in the representations, suggesting a lack of effective science and risk communication. Further, we found the strongest association of social representations existed between the public and opinion leaders and the organizations’ representations did not align much with the other two groups, suggesting a lack of organizations’ influence in public representations of COVID-19 on social media in China. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study examines the effects of self-generated and other-generated electronic word-of-mouth communication (eWOM) in inoculating individuals against potential misinformation. A three-phase between-subject experiment (N = 543) was conducted to compare the persuasive effects of inoculation messages combined with different eWOM content (self-generated, other-generated, and inoculation only) over two health topics (Covid-19 vaccine and e-cigarette). The results show that exposure to inoculation messages did not significantly increase resistance to misinformation. But inoculation messages combined with other-generated eWOM helped the participants develop more negative attitudes toward alternative smoking immediately after exposure to the inoculation stimuli. The participants who wrote eWOM after exposure to inoculation messages were more resistant to the attack of misinformation in Phase 3. Self-generated and other-generated eWOM did not significantly differ in their persuasive effects in any phases. The findings extend the literature on the effects of WOM in the inoculation process and offer theoretical implications over inoculation theory in online contexts. The study provides empirical guidance on using inoculation messages to combat misinformation in social media. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Given the global popularity and ubiquity of electronic media coverage of wildlife and conservation, media frame analysis is widely used to help conservation decision-makers understand public opinion, differing goals and priorities, and arguments used in conflict. Nonetheless, media frame analysis has only been used on occasion to elucidate how different conservation stakeholders frame wildlife management plans. We applied media frame analysis to the case of critically endangered Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus), one of the world's rarest felids now confined to Iranian deserts. Between January 2018 and December 2020, 91 interviews from 44 conservation stakeholders were published in Persian-language electronic media following the development of an Asiatic cheetah management plan. Media framed conservationists as agreeing on the alarming situation of Asiatic cheetahs and high-level interventions needed for possible recovery yet disagreeing about using integrated (in situ + ex situ) versus single management approaches (in situ only) between academic and NGO interviewees. Interviews presented a balance of thematic (year-round) and episodic around National and International Cheetah Days. We also found that the current media debate was highly skewed toward non-local perspectives while views from reserve staffs were rarely (n = 2) reflected in the media. The increasing number of controversial conservation topics in media debates can persuade the public or policymakers by setting agenda. Disagreement in premises, threats and interventions confuse managers and potentially creates procrastination of necessary actions. Higher inclusion of reserve staffs, technical cooperation between stakeholders and pursuing the existing management plan are interventions that may portend great potential to enhance the conservation impact of media debates. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Computational technologies have vastly replaced our prior modalities of information seeking. Social media platforms have become the first choice of many information seekers. Increasingly, these platforms are also becoming vehicles for coordinated, manipulative disinformation campaigns. These campaigns of computational propaganda have resulted in an information environment in which the assignment of authority and trust in information sources has become increasingly opaque. This epistemic process of information evaluation has increasingly become the purview of automated algorithmic systems that we as human beings tend to falsely implicitly trust to provide us with the most accurate information available. Propagandists have begun to exploit the algorithmic components of these systems as well as human cognitive deficits in order to manipulate public opinion, control the narrative of public discourse, and flood our information ecosystems in order to work towards the manufacture of false consensus on a wide range of political and cultural issues. This work aims to review and synthesize the literature on computational propaganda, how it manipulates our human cognitive deficits, and how information literacy can be utilized in order to correct for the resultant epistemic failure. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This study explores the effect of negative news about an organization on its sustainable supply chain management (SSCM) practices. We focus on how public reports about controversial business practices motivate a company to make adjustments so that environmental and social concerns are better included in its supply chain management practices. Using agenda-setting theory, we identify managerial commitment as an important factor in transmitting external media pressure. We analyse longitudinal data, ranging from 2002 through 2014 and collected for more than 700 US-based corporations. Our findings reveal that companies significantly increase SSCM after being the subject of negative news, particularly when management commitment to environmental sustainability and social welfare is high. Our findings should encourage supply chain decision makers to consider more broadly how external stakeholders view their global supply chain operations. Our research sheds light on negative news as an external factor; previous literature used media attention as anecdotal evidence and focused more on internal company factors. We contribute to research in SSCM by studying the mediation effect. It is essential that supply chain decision makers better apprehend the importance of negative news, management commitment, and SSCM and understand their role in influencing public opinion. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper puts forth a theory explaining domestic backlash against international investment law by connecting media coverage—specifically the bias in the news media’s selection of international disputes—to public opinion formation towards international agreements. To test our theory, we examine both the content and effects of the media’s reporting on international disputes, focusing on the increasingly controversial form known as investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS). We find that newspaper outlets in both the United States and Canada have a bias in favor of covering disputes filed against their home country as opposed to those filed by home country firms. Using two national survey experiments fielded in the United States and Canada, we further find that the bias in news story selection has a strong negative effect on attitudes towards ISDS and related agreements, especially among highly nationalistic individuals. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Many people practiced COVID-19-related safety measures in the first year of the pandemic, but Republicans were less likely to engage in behaviors such as wearing masks or face coverings than Democrats, suggesting radical disparities in health practices split along political fault lines. We developed an “intervention tournament” which aimed to identify the framings that would promote mask wearing among a representative sample of Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. from Oct 14, 2020, to Jan 14, 2021 (N = 4931). Seven different conditions reflecting different moral values and factors specific to COVID-19—including protection from harm (self), protection from harm (community), patriotic duty, purity, reviving the economy, threat, and scientific evidence—were implemented to identify which framings would “win” in terms of promoting mask wearing compared to a baseline condition. We found that Republicans had significantly more negative attitudes toward masks, lower intentions to wear them, and were less likely to sign or share pledges on social media than Democrats, which was partially mediated by Republicans, compared to Democrats, perceiving that the threat of COVID-19 was lower. None of our framing conditions significantly affected Republicans' or Democrats' attitudes, intentions, or behaviors compared to the baseline condition, illustrating the difficulty in overcoming the strength of political polarization during COVID-19. © 2022

AB  - This study examines how the fandom of pop star Taylor Swift negotiates her ‘political’ awakening, after politically coming-out via Instagram in 2018. When Swift announced her vote for two Democratic senators, (international) media and her fandom considered it controversial. Swift, unlike many other pop-singers, had never publicly expressed her political views, until 2018. Yet, doing so put her on the map as a potential celebrity politician (CP): a celebrity who is fighting for a particular interest or certain political outcome, while holding a certain political influence over an audience. By scrutinizing how her fandom, the “Swifties,” deal with their idol’s political revelations, this study offers a granular insight into the intersection between celebrity, fandom, and political culture. Drawing on a content analysis of fan-interviews and online comments, this study illustrates how fans negotiate Swift’s transition from popstar to CP. It demonstrates how fans consider Swift’s political coming-out: On the one hand, they think it is a potential career-strategy of Swift, to lift her persona from singer to strategic “business” woman. On the other hand, the fans consider it a “must” for pop stars in today’s political climate to express where they stand politically. This discussion highlights that the how of Swift’s message, and not just the what or why, are of importance in understanding her position as a CP. Therewith, this study illustrates how fans make sense of today’s politics through the celebrity persona—potentially putting an even greater burden on the shoulders of today’s stars. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Social media influencers promote not only products and brands but also their opinions on serious topics like party politics or climate change. These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers’ political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers’ communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (NT2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (NT2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers’ content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers’ communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest—yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Plastic pollution is widespread globally, and consumers play a crucial role in reducing the pollution produced by plastic waste. Although many studies have analyzed and estimated the intentions or behavior of recycling, relatively few studies have specifically focused on plastic. Moreover, we have little understanding of how technology (e.g., social media) has changed and can change consumer behavior related to plastic pollution. Therefore, this study expands our comprehension of which factors interact with consumers' behavior and intention to recycle plastics, extending knowledge of the influence of social media on consumer behavior. Through two analyses conducted on a sample of four hundred and sixty-seven American consumers, we reveal that attitudes, followed by perceived control and peer influence, positively impact consumers' intentions to recycle plastic. However, the influence of social media turns out to be significant only when examined on the cluster of consumers exposed to plastic recycling-themed content on their social media feeds. Furthermore, the results of this study indicate that intentions are a crucial underlying determinant in the manifestation of plastic recycling behavior (Direct Behavior) and support for diffusion through political and administrative interventions (Indirect Behavior). Finally, the parametric and PLS-MGA tests show a significant difference in the influence of social media on demographic clusters. Thus, this study provides theoretical and practical implications for plastic recycling frameworks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Research investigating the early emergence of racial prejudice has been largely limited to contexts in which racial prejudice is most likely to emerge—multiracial societies that have pronounced racial inequality (e.g., United States, South Africa). The present study assessed whether pro-White racial bias is also early emerging in a homogenous Black community that has little exposure to modern media and where children presumably experience less overt discrimination than in past samples. Black African children (N = 214) between 5- and 12-years-old living in rural Uganda exhibited substantial pro-White racial bias, preferring White over Black children 78% of the time. Ugandan children also judged White children as higher status than Black children, and these status judgments predicted their degree of pro-White bias. Our results indicate that pro-White racial biases can emerge even in a homogenous Black community and that, in some contexts, minimal status cues can be sufficient for the early development of racial prejudice. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - This article addresses the participation of celebrities and their fans in media controversies. As techno-social events, controversies are constitutive of discursive battles, between numerically conscious participatory communities, aimed at describing the meaning and significance of cultural symbols. Celebrities, in their capacity as cultural symbols, provide the ground for staging these discursive battles. Fan participation, as auxiliary of celebrity participation, is studied here specifically to discern its essential functions vis-a-vis controversies. For elaborating its argument, this article looks at Shah Rukh Khan (hereafter SRK) and his fandom in India. SRK, as a transcultural symbol of Liberal Islam, was embroiled in media controversies wherein the meaning and significance of his ‘Muslimness’ was debated and scrutinised. Marked by struggles between SRK fandom, on one side, and right-wing/reactionary groups on the other, these controversies testify SRK’s centrality in political debates surrounding the ‘Muslim Question’ in Indian Polity. This article argues that SRK Fandom’s primary discursive function is to create an ‘Eulogistic Buffer’ that insulates SRK from right-wing/reactionary islamophobia. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Issue addressed: News reports linking mental illness to violent crime are among the most stigmatising portrayals. These portrayals can perpetuate stereotypes of dangerousness, negatively influencing public attitudes and having a harmful impact on people with lived experience of mental illness. With the aim of improving the quality of news portrayals and mitigating harm, best-practice guidelines for media reporting on mental illness, violence and crime have been developed. To increase understanding of the guidelines’ content, a 1-hour workshop based on the main principles was developed for journalism students. Methods: In this study, the workshop was piloted with a pre and 3-week follow-up evaluation with a cohort of journalism students (n = 29). Results: Three weeks after the workshop, there were significant improvements in attitudes towards severe mental illness, knowledge of best-practice reporting, intentions and confidence to report consistently with the best-practice guidelines and performance on an editing task designed to assess adherence to the guidelines. Belief in dangerousness/unpredictability reduced markedly, demonstrating that the workshop effectively addressed misinformation about people with severe mental illness being a risk to the public. Conclusions: This pilot trial provides promising initial results and provides a basis for wider implementation and evaluation of media training on this topic. So what: Improved understanding of best-practice media guidelines, as generated through this workshop, has potential to reduce stigmatising news reporting on people with mental illness, and consequently reduce public stigma. © 2021 Australian Health Promotion Association.

AB  - Our concern in this contribution is to ask what the special features of populism in Hungary are, where government and the largest opposition party can be considered populist. The study aims at analyzing motivations, interests, benefits, and profits of populism in fragile Hungarian regions. The main part examines three peculiar features of state populism: the rural support for stabile political and social structures; early-born conservative social policy, which freezes and preserves social inequalities and pacificates social conflicts; and selective social policy that has made a strong difference between “worthy” and “unworthy” poor, thus, contributing to ethnic-based conflicts and emerging prejudice. The Hungarian case shows that poverty and social inequalities, disintegration, hierarchical local power structure with dominance of economic–political oligarchy, weak participation, monopolization of local and non-local media, and racialization of poverty are enabling factors of populism. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - This article examines the media coverage of vote intention polls in the Netherlands. We assess whether the quality of media reporting on polls depends on the availability of information regarding the quality in pollster’s reports. Our analysis of the quality looks at three different quality measures: (1) mentioning WAPOR items, such as field dates, sampling method, and polling method, (2) mentioning the margin of error, and (3) the correct interpretation of (in)significant changes and differences. The Netherlands provides an interesting case, because there is variation over time and across pollsters in the way they report their polls as well as the increased popularity of a polling aggregator. Our findings indicate that the overall quality of Dutch coverage of polls is low. When a pollster mentions the margin of error in its report, media reports on that poll are more likely to include this information and to correctly interpret the significance of differences between two parties. This effect is particularly visible when the pollster provides uncertainty intervals in its headline figures. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Facing the challenge of the new normal, mainstream public opinion advises China to adopt a conservative strategy of “slowing down the growth and lowering the leverage.” This paper proposes an alternative compatible idea of “stabilizing the growth and lowering the leverage.” For this purpose, the study first describes the investment and credit-led mode as well as the dilemma confronted by China with an identity equation to deliberate the harmonic role played by the efficiency of aggregate social financing increments. The empirical work uses data from 31 regions in China from the first quarter of 2014 to the first quarter of 2018 as observations. The outcome shows that, if the aggregate social financing increment reaches full efficiency, the rate of output growth could provide a chance to stabilize in the short term up to around 10%, while the surging leverage and debt ratio could become moderate. There should also be an opportunity to eliminate the threat of financial risks in the medium term if combined with the deployment and implementation of ongoing supporting measures. This paper recommends a three-step strategy of promoting efficiency, easing the risks and optimizing the structure. The expectation of “stabilizing the growth and lowering the leverage” would not be unachievable. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Aim: This study explored the knowledge, attitude and practices (KAP) of higher education students towards COVID-19. In addition, this study analysed the association of socio-demographic variables with KAP apart from finding the relationship between KAP. Subject and methods: This is a cross-sectional study conducted in India. Study participants were selected using a convenient sampling method from various higher educational institutions across 22 states in India. Data was collected using self-administered close-ended questionnaires via Google forms. The data were analysed using frequencies and percentage for descriptive purposes. A chi-square test was used to determine the association between groups, and correlation analysis was used to illustrate the significant relationship between KAP. Results: The majority, that is, 65.5% of students possess a high level of knowledge about the disease. It was noteworthy that 71.0% of them had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 and 66.7% of them exhibited desirable practices to mitigate COVID-19. Furthermore, the results showed a significant association between KAP and some of the socio-demographic variables studied. Social media emerged as a vital source of information regarding COVID-19 for the majority (81.0%) of students. Also, a strong significant positive correlation was observed between KAP variables. Conclusion: One-fourth of the students demonstrated only low and moderate levels of knowledge, negative attitude and undesirable practices in preventing COVID-19. The implications suggesting various approaches to enhance KAP to moderate the spread of COVID-19 among the students were recommended to aid the higher educational institutions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This research is a sentiment analysis of opinion data obtained from the Twitter social network about the palm oil industry in Indonesia. The opinion data used is text in Indonesian to show the palm oil industry in Indonesia and text in English to show issues of the palm oil industry happening globally. The palm oil industry in Indonesia is one of the strategic industries engaged in agriculture, so it is necessary to monitor public sentiment with information on the Internet, especially on social media. This research has produced a model for classifying public opinion on the palm oil industry from Twitter data. The data collection technique used is the Twitter Developer API, and it obtained 14,048 words for Indonesian and 12,421 words for English. This data collection begins in July and ends in September 2021. This study uses a machine learning model with the Naïve Bayes Classifier and Support Vector Machine algorithms to separate sentiment into two labeling classes, namely positive and negative, then compares which algorithm best serves to classify opinion data. The model generated by the Naive Bayes algorithm has the highest accuracy value, namely for domestic (Bahasa Indonesia) data of 82% and international (English) data of 85%. © 2022 Little Lion Scientific.

AB  - Introduction: Vaccine hesitancy remains a serious challenge for ending the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. Digital media has played an immense role in the spread of information during the pandemic. One method to gauge public interest in COVID-19 related information is to examine patterns of online search queries. Methods: Google Trends (GT) was used to analyze results for search terms relating to COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, information, and accessibility from October 1st, 2020 to May 27th, 2021. GT allows you to compare multiple queries at one time. The resultant relative search volumes (RSVs) range from 0 to 100. The search term and point in time on the graph that has the greatest search volume is given a score of 100 and all other terms and times are given values relative to that maximum. Search interest peaks were analyzed by subgroups (misinformation, information seeking, and access seeking) and across key time points throughout the pandemic. Results: GT analysis revealed that search interest related to vaccine misinformation, general information, and access seeking changed in relation to events taking place throughout the pandemic. The most commonly searched terms in each subgroup were: “Covid vaccine infertility”, “Covid vaccine side effects”, and “Covid vaccine appointment”. Searches related to misinformation peaked in December 2020. Search terms in the general information category peaked in April 2021. RSVs for access seeking terms peaked in March 2021 and have decreased since April 2021. Conclusion: Misinformation RSVs were highest after FDA authorization and have multiple repeated spikes after subsequent vaccine announcements. General information seeking terms peaked concurrently with increased vaccination uptake in the United States. Search interest has decreased with wider vaccine availability, despite many individuals in the United States remaining unvaccinated. GT can be used to monitor trends in public attitudes and misinformation regarding COVID-19 vaccines and further target education. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Media has paid more attention recently on environmental issues caused by construction companies which imposes public opinion pressure on construction companies and could potentially impact their decision-making processes for green innovations. However, research on the relationship between public opinions pressure and construction company green innovation behavior is still limited. To understand how such public opinions pressure can impact construction companies' green transition and formulate advice accordingly, it is necessary to use empirical data to find the correlations. Therefore, this research has gathered questionnaire data of the construction companies in Chengdu-Chongqing economic circle of China to study the influencing mechanism of environmental public opinion pressure on enterprise green innovation behavior, analyzes the realization path of leaders' environmental intention as a mediating variable in the impact of environmental public opinion pressure on enterprise green innovation behavior, and reveals the role boundary of environmental regulation as a moderating variable in the impact of environmental public opinion pressure on enterprise green innovation behavior. The results show that environmental public opinion pressure has a significant positive impact on enterprise green innovation behavior. More specifically, enterprise green innovation behavior is affected by leaders' environmental intention and the latter plays a partial mediating role between environmental public opinion pressure and enterprise green innovation behavior. Environmental regulation also enhances the sensitivity of companies to environmental public opinion pressure, and therefore can significantly strengthen the relationship between environmental public opinion pressure and enterprise green innovation behavior. Further research find that, compared with incentive-based environmental regulations, mandatory environmental regulations make companies more sensitive to environmental public opinion pressure and has a more significant positive moderating effect. The research conclusions could be used to provide theoretical reference with empirical data for accelerating the green innovation transformation and promoting the high-quality development in the construction industry.

AB  - “Rough sex” can be considered an act of sexual violence that is consensual or non-consensual, often resulting in bodily harm and in rare cases, fatalities. The rough sex defense is typically advanced by male perpetrators in an effort to portray a sexual encounter as consensual, to avoid criminal sanctions for causing injury or death. Public attitudes toward this defense are often reflected on social media following high profile cases and appear to echo dominant discourses that reinforce widely held sexual violence stereotypes. Therefore, this study aims to deconstruct public attitudes surrounding the rough sex defense. Namely, how female victims/survivors and male perpetrators of sexual violence are constructed online, whilst exploring the wider implications upon society. NVivo12 NCapture software was used to collect a sample of 1000 tweets mentioning the terms “rough sex” or “rough sex defense.” Data were examined using Feminist Critical Discourse Analysis (FCDA), underpinned by a social constructionist perspective, to elicit emergent discourses. Findings indicate that Twitter allowed women to resist harmful victim-blaming discourses and constrained binary identities. Opposingly, men were constructed as sexually entitled predators, yet resisted these subject positions by advocating support for male victims/survivors. Additional analyses examine account holders’ constructions of British Parliamentarians (MP’s) and their campaigns against the rough sex defense. These constructions demonstrated a cultural, heteronormative and victim-blaming understanding of sexual violence, which calls for legislative clarity.

AB  - What are the agenda-setting effects between the news media and its audience regarding organic food? This longitudinal text-mining study investigates the relationship between topics mentioned in news articles and reader comments published the online news outlets nytimes.com (USA) and spiegel.de (Germany) from 2007 to 2020. Topics are modeled using a neural network approach based on clustered multilingual sentence embeddings. Results show that the salience of topics in news articles significantly influences their salience in reader comments but not vice versa. Metrics for agenda distance and agenda diversity confirm the media's agenda-setting role and additionally point out periods of time when events caused the media and public attention to diverge. The news media drives public opinion on organic food in the US and Germany by determining the discussion topics and is thus an important player in the promotion of organic food consumption to be considered by marketers and policy makers. © 2022

AB  - Japan's plan to dump nuclear wastewater into the sea has generated a tremendous amount of discussion on social media due to the potential wide-ranging impact. To our knowledge, few studies have mined social media platforms to assess similar pollution concerns. We use the Octopus Collector to collect online textual data regarding “Japan's plan to dump nuclear wastewater into the sea” from Sina Weibo since April 13, 2021. After the posts from Sina Weibo were preprocessed, user opinions were analyzed using natural language processing. We used a naive Bayes classifier for sentiment analysis and latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) to extract and cluster topics from the posts, allowing for users' related opinions to be mined and analyzed. The study found that there were three major themes in terms of public concern: nuclear pollution and marine ecology, seafood imports and food safety, and international responsibility and public ethics. In our emotional analysis, we found that most people expressed negative emotions about the plan. However, there was also a positive emotional aspect because, with the release of relevant information and the popularization of knowledge, the public has been able to have a rational discussion about the consequences of this event, and the topic includes a focus on positive factors such as environmental protection and sustainable development. For this reason, the government and relevant agencies should keep up-to-date with the latest news of the incident to further raise public awareness and lead the public to a rational discussion to avoid excessive negative emotions. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Objective: The study aimed to evaluate the knowledge, attitude, and practices toward the prevention of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) among the public in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted online among the general public in Malaysia from June 2020 to August 2020 between the second and third wave (Phase 3 of the Recovery Movement Control Order). Participants were conveniently recruited through multiple social media platforms to encourage nationwide participation. A patient-administered questionnaire was used to assess their knowledge, attitude, and practice toward the prevention of COVID-19. For descriptive analysis, percentage, mean, and standard deviation (SD) were used to report demographic characteristics and knowledge, attitude, and practice scores. For inferential analysis, t-test, ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation, Chi-square test, and Binary Logistic Regression was used to analyze the study variables' differentiation, association, and correlations. The confidence interval selected for this study was 95%. Results: A total of 420 respondents participated in this survey. The majority of the participants (n = 412, 98%) were aware of COVID-19. Most participants (60%) learned about the pandemic through social media. About half of the participants had poor knowledge (45.5%) and a negative attitude (43.3%). Participants residing in urban areas showed good preventive practices as compared to those residing in rural areas (P < 0.05). There was a significant association between participants' attitudes and preventive practices toward COVID-19, where the majority of the participants (57.4%) who showed negative attitudes were more likely to follow poor preventive practices. Conclusion: Despite having good knowledge, participants with a negative attitude toward COVID-19 were less likely to follow the preventive practices of COVID-19. People's mindset and willingness may play an important role to influence their practices. Thus, these are the vulnerable groups, and strategies should be made to change their mindset through proper counseling and education.

AB  - The number of opinion clusters is the main focus of opinion dynamics. Different methods have been proposed to help agents form fewer opinion clusters or achieve consensus. In this study, sensitive agents suffering the group pressure are introduced into the Hegselmann-Krause opinion model, where other agents are insensitive and without the group pressure. The introduction of sensitive agents provides more chances for cluster merging, forming fewer clusters, and even reaching consensus. The sensitive factor plays a dominant role in opinion consensus: a large value for the group pressure becomes the public opinion, small value makes the group pressure concentrate on the agent's own opinion, and medium one causes a nonlocal one to greatly forge consensus. The group pressure significance tunes the proportion group pressure felt by sensitive agents and forms fewer clusters together with the sensitive factor. Surprisingly, the ratio of sensitive agents shows almost no difference. © Copyright © 2022 EPLA.

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Czech population experienced a second lockdown lasting for about half a year, restricting free movement and imposing social isolation. However, it is not known whether the impact of this long lockdown resulted in habituation to the adverse situation or in the traumatization of the Czech population, and whether the media and specific media use contributed to these effects. Objective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the long lockdown on the mental health of the Czech population, and the role of exposure to COVID-19 news reports and specific forms of media news use in mental health. Methods: We conducted two consecutive surveys in the early (November 2020) and late (March/April 2021) phases of the nationwide lockdown on the same nationally representative group of Czech adults (N=1777) participating in a longitudinal panel study. Results: Our findings showed that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in the second observation period, confirming the negative effect of the pandemic lockdown as it unfolded, suggesting that restrictive measures and continuous exposure to a collective stressor did not result in the strengthening of resilience but rather in ongoing traumatization. The results also suggest a negative role of the media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mental health during the early, and particularly late, phases of the lockdown. Furthermore, we found several risk and protective factors of specific media news use. The media practice in news consumption connected to social media use was the strongest predictor of exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly in the late phase of the lockdown. Moreover, news media use characterized by internalization of information learned from the news, as well as negative attitudes toward media news, were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Conversely, the use of infotainment, together with an in-depth and contextual style of reading news articles, were related to improvement of mental health. Conclusions: Our study showed that the long lockdown resulted in traumatization rather than habituation, and in more pronounced effects (both negative and positive) of media use in mental health. © Dominika Grygarová, Petr Adámek, Veronika Juríčková, Jiří Horáček, Eduard Bakštein, Iveta Fajnerová, Ladislav Kesner

AB  - As for the mitigation of the negative consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and the related crisis, governments should inter alia facilitate the willingness to vaccinate. However, related discussions became politicised, especially in countries with an extremely high level of partisan polarisation in opinions and media discourses, like in Hungary, which is the selected case of our study. As previous research about the United States shows, general trust in science is also influenced by the ideological alignment of individuals - people with conservative identification are more likely to question scientific results and recommendations, considering global warming, or the characteristics of the pandemic and the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. In our study we examine two main questions: first, whether the ideological orientation and partisan alignment of Hungarian citizens influence their general trust in science, and second, whether the same factors influence their opinion on scientists' ability to develop effective vaccines against the coronavirus. Furthermore, we also investigate whether media consumption habits might influence these interrelations. According to the results of the representative online survey, the more conservative someone in Hungary identifies, the more likely they will be sceptical in terms of both questions. However, support of government or opposition parties does not determine whether they believe in the ability of scientists to develop effective vaccines, and it is influenced by their media consumption habits. We showed that (1) opposition supporters are much more different along their preferred media source than government supporters, (2) television watchers are of the same opinion independent of their party preference and (3) social media consumers are generally more likely to reject scientific results. The phenomenon that supporters of the conservative government and of the alliance of opposition parties are different in terms of their media consumption is a surprising finding in the polarised Hungarian context. We provide two main explanations for this. First, it is most probably the consequence of the government's intensive campaign that encouraged vaccination. Second, the government used the issue of vaccination as a source of legitimacy regarding the effectiveness of their crisis management. © 2022 Eszter Farkas et al., published by Sciendo.

AB  - In this essay, I suggest that the study of comparative literature is subject to the same distorting pressures as the study of the Orient. “Comparativism,” as I call it, is like orientalism: both a description and a distortion. Constructing its critique in the process of comparing, it inherits deep foundations of historical, cultural, and geographical prejudgment. As with Said’s orientalism, the cornerstone of this construction is West-Eastern (and North-Southern) paternalism, but it is far from the only building block: other obstacles include predetermined views of genre, medium, and even language. There is little, in fact, that is not grist to the will of Western-educated critics. Eastern comparative methodologies, however, are no more innocent of power struggles than their Western counterparts; for one thing, the structural role of empire is shared by both West and East. Simply replacing one hemisphere with another will hardly recalibrate our critical compasses; wherever we are looking from, partiality of perspective is inevitable. The question, then, is whether comparativism constructs itself diversely in diverse circumstances, or whether its prejudices remain essentially the same despite the changing details of time and place. It is a matter, in other words, of the old comparative contest between similarity and difference. What do we talk about when we talk about comparing?. © 2022, Hunan Normal University Press.

AB  - Policies to reduce meat consumption are needed to help achieve climate change targets, and could also improve population health. Public acceptability can affect the likelihood of policy implementation. This study estimated the acceptability of policies to reduce red and processed meat consumption, and whether acceptability differed when policies were framed as benefitting health or the environment. In an online experiment, 2215 UK adults rated the acceptability of six policies, presented in a randomised order. Prior to rating policies, participants were randomised to one of two framing conditions, with policy outcomes described either as benefitting health or the environment. Regression models examined differences in the primary outcome – policy acceptability (rated on a 7-point scale) – by framing. Labels were the most accepted policy (48% support), followed by a media campaign (45%), reduced availability (40%) and providing incentives (38%). Increasing price (27%) and banning advertising (26%) were the least accepted. A substantial proportion of participants neither supported nor opposed most policies (26–33%), although this fell to 16% for increasing price. There was no evidence that framing policy benefits from a health or environment perspective influenced acceptability (−0.06, 95%CIs: 0.18,0.07). Fewer than half of the UK sample expressed support for any of six policies to reduce meat consumption, regardless of framing measures as benefitting health or the environment. Conversely, fewer than half expressed opposition, with the exception of price, suggesting considerable scope to influence public opinion in support of meat reduction measures to meet environmental and health goals. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy continues to limit global efforts in combatting the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging research demonstrates the role of social media in disseminating information and potentially influencing people's attitudes towards public health campaigns. This systematic review sought to synthesize the current evidence regarding the potential role of social media in shaping COVID-19 vaccination attitudes, and to explore its potential for shaping public health interventions to address the issue of vaccine hesitancy. Methods: We performed a systematic review of the studies published from inception to 13 of March2022 by searching PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, PsychNET, Scopus, CINAHL, and MEDLINE. Studies that reported outcomes related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccine (attitudes, opinion, etc.) gathered from the social media platforms, and those analyzing the relationship between social media use and COVID-19 hesitancy/acceptance were included. Studies that reported no outcome of interest or analyzed data from sources other than social media (websites, newspapers, etc.) will be excluded. The Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS) was used to assess the quality of all cross-sectional studies included in this review. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021283219). Findings: Of the 2539 records identified, a total of 156 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the quality of the cross-sectional studies was moderate – 2 studies received 10 stars, 5 studies received 9 stars, 9 studies were evaluated with 8, 12 studies with 7,16 studies with 6, 11 studies with 5, and 6 studies with 4 stars. The included studies were categorized into four categories. Cross-sectional studies reporting the association between reliance on social media and vaccine intentions mainly observed a negative relationship. Studies that performed thematic analyses of extracted social media data, mainly observed a domination of vaccine hesitant topics. Studies that explored the degree of polarization of specific social media contents related to COVID-19 vaccines observed a similar degree of content for both positive and negative tone posted on different social media platforms. Finally, studies that explored the fluctuations of vaccination attitudes/opinions gathered from social media identified specific events as significant cofactors that affect and shape vaccination intentions of individuals. Interpretation: This thorough examination of the various roles social media can play in disseminating information to the public, as well as how individuals behave on social media in the context of public health events, articulates the potential of social media as a platform of public health intervention to address vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - The article discusses two symptomatic texts that are imbricated within the utopian/dystopian ambience: Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury and Utopia by Ahmed Khaled Towfik. The style and structure of the selected novels are revealed at the level of the chronotope and aimed at clarifying the correlation of genre-forming components within the triad of a 'person - civilisation - society'. This paper tests a hypothesis that the discursive representation of these components in a narrative structure is realised through colliding utopian and dystopian worlds. Problematising this idea in fiction reveals how the tension between the diametrically opposed worlds promotes critical scrutiny of both to draw attention to the most pressing social problems facing humanity: the role of ordinary people in society, impact of mass media on public opinion, dissolution of morals, social disparity, drug addiction, etc. The study primarily follows a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach to exploring the theoretical and practical aspects of utopian/dystopian worldviews in the literary dimension. The dichotomy of utopia/dystopia manifests in the novels through the overt conflict of different patterns of life, mentalities, and cultures. Analysing the ways of a literary embodiment of this conflict in Bradbury's and Towfik's books explicates how creating a new reality from utopian/dystopian perspectives alters consciousness and promotes a completely different paradigm of existence. © 2022 Librairie du Liban Publishers.

AB  - Background: On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization Emergency Committee declared the rapid worldwide spread of COVID-19 a global health emergency. By December 2020, the safety and efficacy of the first COVID-19 vaccines had been demonstrated. However, international vaccination coverage rates have remained below expectations (in Europe at the time of manuscript submission). Controversial mandatory vaccination is currently being discussed and has already been introduced in some countries (Austria, Greece, and Italy). We used the Twitter survey system as a viable method to quickly and comprehensively gather international public health insights on mandatory vaccination against COVID-19. Objective: The purpose of this study was to better understand the public's perception of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in real time using Twitter polls. Methods: Two Twitter polls were developed (in the English language) to seek the public's opinion on the possibility of mandatory vaccination. The polls were pinned to the Digital Health and Patient Safety Platform's (based in Vienna, Austria) Twitter timeline for 1 week in mid-November 2021, 3 days after the official public announcement of mandatory COVID-19 vaccination in Austria. Twitter users were asked to participate and retweet the polls to reach the largest possible audience. Results: Our Twitter polls revealed two extremes on the topic of mandatory vaccination against COVID-19. Almost half of the 2545 respondents (n=1246, 49%) favor mandatory vaccination, at least in certain areas. This attitude contrasts with the 45.7% (n=1162) who categorically reject mandatory vaccination. Over one-quarter (n=621, 26.3%) of participating Twitter users said they would never get vaccinated, as reflected by the current Western European and North American vaccination coverage rate. Concatenating interpretation of these two polls should be done cautiously as participating populations might substantially differ. Conclusions: Mandatory vaccination against COVID-19 (in at least certain areas) is favored by less than 50%, whereas it is opposed by almost half of the surveyed Twitter users. Since (social) media strongly influences public perceptions and views, and social media discussions and surveys are specifically susceptible to the “echo chamber effect,” the results should be interpreted as a momentary snapshot. Therefore, the results of this study need to be complemented by long-term surveys to maintain their validity. © Valentin Ritschl, Fabian Eibensteiner, Erika Mosor, Maisa Omara, Lisa Sperl, Faisal A Nawaz, Chandragiri Siva Sai, Merisa Cenanovic, Hari Prasad Devkota, Mojca Hribersek, Ronita De, Elisabeth Klager, Eva Schaden, Maria Kletecka-Pulker, Sabine Völkl-Kernstock, Harald Willschke, Christoph Aufricht, Atanas G Atanasov, Tanja Stamm.

AB  - Little research has systematically examined the relationship between ideology and perceptions of sexual harassment. Recognising differences in the way in which sexual harassment and assault were discussed on political programming and social media by partisans, we posed the following questions: (1) ‘Is there an ideological difference in perceptions of observed sexual harassment?’; and (2) ‘Is there also an ideological difference in perceptions of personally experienced sexual harassment?’ Using data from two studies, we find that conservatives are less likely than liberals to perceive and label both ambiguous and unambiguous situations as sexual harassment. Our third study – a survey of adult women – demonstrates that compared to liberal women, conservative women report significantly fewer instances of personally experienced gender discrimination and sexual harassment than liberal women. These results indicate that both observed and lived experiences of sexual harassment are linked to one’s ideological belief structures. © European Conference on Politics and Gender and Bristol University Press 2022.

AB  - In this paper, we consider climate scepticism in the Russian context. We are interested in whether this has been discussed within the social scientific literature and ask first whether there is a discernible climate sceptical discourse in Russia. We find that there is very little literature directly on this topic in either English or Russian and we seek to synthesise related literature to fill the gap. Secondly, we consider whether Russian climate scepticism has been shaped by the same factors as in the USA, exploring how scientists, the media, public opinion, the government and business shaped climate scepticism in Russia. Climate scepticism in the USA is understood as a ‘conservative countermovement’ that seeks to react against the perceived gains of the progressive environmental movement, but we argue that this is not an appropriate framework for understanding Russian climate scepticism. Articulated within a less agonistic environment and situated within an authoritarian regime, Russian expressions of climate scepticism balance the environmental, political and economic needs of the regime under the constraints of a strong ‘carbon culture’ and closed public debate. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) goes hand in hand with realising a more sustainable future, taking into account environmental, economic and social dimensions. Education can accelerate these goals, with teachers playing a central role. In 2021, a study was conducted among teachers in Italian mandatory schools to investigate knowledge, sources of information and attitudes towards the SDGs. An online survey was conducted, based on a Likert-scale with 62 items. The questionnaire was completed by 417 teachers. The overall knowledge score shows a median of 42.9%, an interquartile range of 25% and a range of 1.8–91.1%. A very good level of knowledge among teachers is limited to some topics, such as the Greenhouse effect (19.6%) and Resilience (13%), which may be better known due to wider media coverage. Sustainability issues are not yet considered as a shared responsibility, as teaching in designated hours was often suggested. The commitment of Italian teachers and schools to a stronger integration of sustainability issues into didactic programmes still needs to be improved. A change of perspective is urgently needed, whereby sustainability education should be seen as a collective responsibility. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Both the suddenness and seriousness of COVID‐19 have caused a variety of public opinions on social media, which becomes the focus of social attention. This paper aims to analyze the strategies regarding the prevention and guidance of public opinion spread under COVID‐19 in social networks from the perspective of the emotional characteristics of user texts. Firstly, a model is established to mine text‐based emotional tendency based on the Susceptible‐Infectious‐Susceptible (SIS) model. In addition, a mathematical and simulation analysis of the model is presented. Finally, an empirical study based on the data of microblog contents regarding COVID‐19 public opinion in the Sina Weibo platform from January to March 2020 is conducted to analyze the factors that boost and hinder COVID‐19 public opinion. The results show that when positive emotion is higher than 0.8, the spread of negative public opinion can be blocked. When the negative emotion and neutral emotion are both below 0.2, the spread of COVID‐19 public opinion would be weakened. To accu-rately guide public opinion on COVID‐19, the government authorities should establish a public opinion risk evaluation and an early warning mechanism. Platforms should strengthen public opinion supervision and users should improve their media literacy. The media organizations should insist on positive reporting, improve social cohesion, and guide the trend of public opinion. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - While the effect of academic discipline on political attitudes has long been acknowledged, much less is known on how disciplinary background affects policy attitudes. Linder and Peters (1992) argued that attitudes to policy instruments correspond with discipline: lawyers are assumed to tend to be partial to legalistic regulatory instruments, economists to favor economic tools such as loans or taxation. Nevertheless, relevant empirical evidence is almost non-existent. The paper attempts to bridge this gap by comparing policy instruments attitudes in different academic disciplines on a sample of Czech university students (N = 8820). We inquire whether students in different academic fields (with special emphasis on economics, law, education, political science, and mass media/journalism) differ in their political and policy views. In line with previous research, students pursuing economics and law (as well as education) are found to be more right-wing oriented than students of political science and mass media. Students also differ in terms of their overall acceptance of policy instruments, with those of political science being the most accepting of all types of instruments. However, we find little support for the correspondence thesis proposed by Linder and Peters. © 2022 Arnošt Veselý et al.

AB  - Objective This study aimed to determine how prejudice and attitude toward people with severe mental illness, formed through exposure to the mass media, affect discriminatory behavior toward them. Methods Between September and November 2019, demographic data were collected using an online survey of 622 adults residing in South Korea. The scales used in this study were taken from the 2008 survey by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. Structural equation modeling was performed for a comparative analysis of the direct and indirect effects. Results Virtual experience through mass media exposure had a statistically significant effect on prejudice against people with severe mental illness. Direct experience had a positive influence on reducing prejudice and discriminatory behavior. The direct effects of prejudice on discriminatory behavior were significant. In terms of indirect effects, the full mediating effect of prejudice was significant for the virtual experience through the mass media-prejudice-discriminatory behavior path, and the partial mediating effect of prejudice was significant on the direct experience-prejudice-discrimination behavior path. Conclusion This study recommends more careful reporting of mental illness in the media, promoting anti-stigmatization programs that provide opportunities for direct contact between the public and people with severe mental illness. © 2022.

AB  - Background: Effective interventions aimed at correcting COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, known as fact-checking messages, are needed to combat the mounting antivaccine infodemic and alleviate vaccine hesitancy. Objective: This work investigates (1) the changes in the public's attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines over time, (2) the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information on social media engagement and attitude change, and (3) the emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking information ecosystem. Methods: We collected a data set of 12,553 COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking Facebook posts and their associated comments (N=122,362) from January 2020 to March 2022 and conducted a series of natural language processing and statistical analyses to investigate trends in public attitude toward the vaccine in COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts and comments, and emotional and linguistic features of the COVID-19 fact-checking information ecosystem. Results: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all COVID-19 vaccine posts peaked in May 2020 and then steadily decreased as the pandemic progressed (r=–0.92, df=21, t=–10.94, 95% CI –0.97 to –0.82, P<.001). The salience of COVID-19 vaccine entities was significantly lower in comments (mean 0.03, SD 0.03, t=39.28, P<.001) than in posts (mean 0.09, SD 0.11). Third-party fact checkers have been playing a more important role in more fact-checking over time (r=0.63, df=25, t=4.06, 95% CI 0.33-0.82, P<.001). COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical (r=0.81, df=25, t=6.88, 95% CI 0.62-0.91, P<.001) and more confident (r=0.59, df=25, t=3.68, 95% CI 0.27-0.79, P=.001) over time. Although comments did not exhibit a significant increase in confidence over time, tentativeness in comments significantly decreased (r=–0.62, df=25, t=–3.94, 95% CI –0.81 to –0.31, P=.001). In addition, although hospitals receive less engagement than other information sources, the comments expressed more positive attitudinal valence in comments compared to other information sources (b=0.06, 95% CI 0.00-0.12, t=2.03, P=.04). Conclusions: The percentage of fact-checking posts relative to all posts about the vaccine steadily decreased after May 2020. As the pandemic progressed, third-party fact checkers played a larger role in posting fact-checking COVID-19 vaccine posts. COVID-19 vaccine fact-checking posts continued to be more analytical and more confident over time, reflecting increased confidence in posts. Similarly, tentativeness in comments decreased; this likewise suggests that public uncertainty diminished over time. COVID-19 fact-checking vaccine posts from hospitals yielded more positive attitudes toward vaccination than other information sources. At the same time, hospitals received less engagement than other information sources. This suggests that hospitals should invest more in generating engaging public health campaigns on social media. ©Haoning Xue, Xuanjun Gong, Hannah Stevens.

AB  - Coronavirus popularly known as COVID-19 is a pandemic that stormed the globe and rendered strong nations helpless and even the world powers, powerless. Initially, the Nigerian government was reluctant to put measures in place or lock its borders until a returnee was diagnosed after he had infected some people. This necessitated several measures including total lockdown, social distancing and improved personal hygiene to forestall its spread. Moreover, Nigerians believe that the state of the nation is even worse than this pandemic and, thus, have developed mastery, especially via satire in weathering any kind of storm. It is therefore, not surprising that the Facebook has become a veritable platform where Nigerians evoke humour while exposing human foibles in their linguistic disposition, with the intention to improve the society. This study, therefore, examined the satirical devices in the Facebook posts of Nigerians with the aim of teasing out the ideologies portrayed in relation to the existing social, economic and political attitude of the people towards the pandemic. Consequently, 22 Facebook posts were purposively selected for analysis, drawing input from Horatian’s approach to satire and Fairclough’s (1995) sociocultural approach to Critical Discourse Analysis. The analysis reveals various satirical elements deployed as a subtle and effective alternative to contest power abuse, social injustice and propagate change. The study also reveals the wittiness and absurdity of satire that makes it a ready tool to unbridle people’s feelings; laden with different ideologies with the aim of relaxing tension and catalysing transformation in the society. Moreover, the import of weathering the storm becomes bare as an essential make-up of Nigerians; the tinge of humour intended in the posts relieves perceived tension and reminds the readers to take life easy, thus, making the study quite engaging. © 2022 Intellect Ltd.

AB  - Figurative framing, in the form of metaphorical expressions, is especially effective in carrying conceptual content on an issue and affecting public opinion. One topic that has been heavily debated in contemporary Hungarian media is migration. Framing starts with the label that journalists select to refer to fled people: bevándorló ("immigrant"), migráns ("migrant") or menekült ("refugee"). Depending on the label, different associations emerge, resting upon differing (metaphorical) conceptualizations evoked by the labels. We analysed metaphorical compounds based on the keywords in a media corpus of approx. 15 million words. Our results indicate that while all three keywords evoke predominantly negative frames and evaluations that build on stock metaphorical conceptualizations of fled people as also identified in the international literature - such as flood, object, business, war and crime -, the distribution of these metaphors does vary, depending on a) the selected keyword; and b) the political agenda of the media source. © John Benjamins Publishing Company.

AB  - Nutrition information on food labels can help consumers to choose healthier food. We investigated consumers’ awareness of food labels and their influence on the decision to buy food items among students of health sciences of King Khalid University, Abha. This cross-sectional study involved 350 females who gave informed verbal consent and were selected by systematic random sampling technique. Data was collected by using a self-administered questionnaire. Statistical analysis was done by using SPSS version 21. Overall 76.3% of students knew food labeling. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed between the knowledge about food labeling and education, the number of family members, earning members, frequency of shopping and income. Almost half of the students checked food labels before buying, 43.7% replaced food on an importance basis and value of labeling, and 60% replaced on a cost basis. More than half of students were ready to buy food items with no labels, and 21.7% even utilized expired food items because of a lack of knowledge regarding expiry date and low cost of food which could be hazardous for their health. Awareness of food labeling and expiry date should be enhanced by including this subject in the curriculum and electronic media to avoid health hazards of expired food items. Choosing healthy food options shall reduce the nutrition and chronic diseases among the general population in future. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Vaccination has been proposed as one of the most effective methods to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the day the first vaccine, with an efficiency of more than 90%, was announced, the entire vaccination process and its possible consequences in large populations have generated a series of discussions on social media. Whereas the opinions triggered by the administration of the initial COVID-19 vaccine doses have been discussed in depth in the scientific literature, the approval of the so-called 3rd booster dose has only been analyzed in country-specific studies, primarily using questionnaires. In this context, the present paper conducts a stance analysis using a transformer-based deep learning model on a dataset containing 3,841,594 tweets in English collected between 12 July 2021 and 11 August 2021 (the month in which the 3rd dose arrived) and compares the opinions (in favor, neutral and against) with the ones extracted at the beginning of the vaccination process. In terms of COVID-19 vaccination hesitance, an analysis based on hashtags, n-grams and latent Dirichlet allocation is performed that highlights the main reasons behind the reluctance to vaccinate. The proposed approach can be useful in the context of the campaigns related to COVID-19 vaccination as it provides insights related to the public opinion and can be useful in creating communication messages to support the vaccination campaign. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we collected data (N = 1,420) from Portugal and Spain in relation to personality (i.e., Dark Triad traits, Big Five traits, religiousness, and negative affect) and attitudes related to COVID-19 about its origins, opinions on how to deal with it, and fear of it. The most pervasive patterns we found were: (1) neurotic-type dispositions were associated with stronger opinions about the origins of the virus and leave people to have more fear of the virus but also more trust in tested establishments to provide help. (2): religious people were less trusting of science, thought prayer was answer, and attributed the existence of the virus to an act of God. We also found that sex differences and country differences in attitudes towards COVID-19 were mediate by sex/country differences in personality traits like emotional stability, religiousness, and negative affect. For instance, women reported more fear of COVID-19 than men did, and this was verified by women’s greater tendency to have negative affect and low emotional stability relative to men. Results point to the central role of neuroticism in accounting for variance in broad-spectrum attitudes towards COVID-19. Copyright: © 2022 Brito-Costa et al.

AB  - Despite the popularity and efficiency of dictionary-based sentiment analysis (DSA) for public health research, limited empirical evidence has been produced about the validity of DSA and potential harms to the validity of DSA. A random sample of a second-hand Ebola tweet dataset was used to evaluate the validity of DSA compared to the manual coding approach and examine the influences of textual features on the validity of DSA. The results revealed substantial inconsistency between DSA and the manual coding approach. The presence of certain textual features such as negation can partially account for the inconsistency between DSA and manual coding. The findings imply that scholars should be careful and critical about findings in disease-related public health research that use DSA. Certain textual features should be more carefully addressed in DSA. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The illegal wildlife trade is resulting in worldwide biodiversity loss and species’ extinction. It should be exposed so that the problems of conservation caused by it can be highlighted and resolutions can be found. Social media is an effective method of information dissemination, providing a real-time, low-cost, and convenient platform for the public to release opinions on wildlife protection. This paper aims to explore the usage of social media in understanding public opinions toward conservation events, and illegal rhino trade is an example. This paper provides a framework for analyzing rhino protection issues by using Twitter. A total of 83,479 useful tweets and 33,336 pieces of users’ information were finally restored in our database after filtering out irrelevant tweets. With 2422 records of trade cases, this study builds up a rhino trade network based on social media data. The research shows important findings: (1) Tweeting behaviors are somewhat affected by the information of traditional mass media. (2) In general, countries and regions with strong negative sentiment tend to have high volume of rhino trade cases, but not all. (3) Social celebrities’ participation in activities arouses wide public concern, but the influence does not last for more than a month. NGOs, GOs, media, and individual enterprises are dominant in the dissemination of information about rhino trade. This study contributes in the following ways: First, this paper conducts research on public opinions toward wildlife conservation using natural language processing technique. Second, this paper offers advice to governments and conservationist organizations, helping them utilize social media for protecting wildlife. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative analysis of COVID-19′ s impact on the development, delivery, and uptake of “Favoring Myself”, a school-based interactive wellness program conducted via Zoom during 2020–2021. “Favoring Myself” targets resilience, self-esteem, body-esteem, self-care behaviors, and media literacy among 5th-grade preadolescents. Data were obtained from meetings, 23 semi-structured interviews with parents, teachers, and principals, and other modes of correspondence. All data were transcribed and thematically analyzed. The analysis highlighted the barriers faced when delivering external programs during COVID-19. Parents’ difficulties in cooperating with the program, distrustful relationships between parents and the education system, as well as teachers’ overload and stress, were identified as barriers to the external program’s sustainability. These challenges are discussed in light of previous studies of school-based programs, the psychological and social contexts of an ongoing crisis and the impact of neoliberalism on education. This study concludes that school-based prevention programs and accompanying research should be more flexible and focus on understanding and relating to parents’ and schools’ fears, uncertainties, and resistance. It is the hope of the authors that knowledge created through this exploration will be helpful in future coping vis-à-vis prevention program teams and recipients in times of unpredictable, unmanageable, and overpowering crises. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study aims to analyze the forward/reverse causal relationships between belief (risk perception), attitude (judgment), and behavior (acceptance). A traditional view stresses forward causal relationships between the three variables. However, recently, several studies have reported the possibility of reverse causal relationships between them. Based on survey data collected from 1027 Korean/Japanese participants, here we test not only the forward or reverse relationships between these three variables, but also how such causal relationships depend on the trust and country contexts (Korea and Japan in this study). The results showed that, first, not only a general forward causal relationship but also reverse causal relationship exists between belief, attitude, and behavior. Second, there exist the moderated mediation and mediated moderation effect of trust in government and media across two countries. Third, the effects of trust in government and media work significantly overall. However, the patterns of interaction effects differ between two countries. The level of trust in the government influenced the belief and attitude of citizens in Japan more than in Korea. However, the level of trust in the media showed opposite results. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The use of disinformation to disrupt the domestic politics of other states has become a staple of contemporary global politics. How these campaigns operate at a microlevel of individual users and network communities, however, remains undertheorized. In this article, we develop a theoretical framework to analyze how states leverage existing social media networks strategically for that purpose. Drawing from social network theory, we argue that the spread of disinformation in the digital age is best understood by examining how actors achieve and maintain access to the existing social media networks via a process of cultural keying-mimicking the cultural cues of the target network to camouflage their intentions and attract followers. While this activity is usually limited in scale and scope, it may be amplified to seize on critical domestic and international events. To demonstrate these arguments, we examine the Twitter behavior of the Kremlin-linked news outlets RT and Sputnik during and after the 2017 French presidential election. We first analyze their presence and salience in a network of accounts interested in French politics. We then use structural topic modeling to identify thematic overlap between the outlets and our panel of users. Our analysis suggests that Kremlin-linked outlets are indeed active in local networks and repeatedly key on salient themes such as Islamophobia and Euroscepticism to blend in. © 2022 The Author(s) (2022).

AB  - Introduction: Breakthroughs in stem cell research (SCR) and regenerative medicine (RM) have attracted significant public attention worldwide. Simultaneously, scientific communities and science policies have tried to establish appropriate governance of SCR and RM. In this context, effective communication between scientific communities and the public is regarded as a key factor. However, the diversity of public attitudes and interests has not been sufficiently examined, especially the differences across countries. Methods: We conducted an international comparison of public attitudes toward SCR and RM. We circulated an internet questionnaire among people in six countries: Japan, South Korea, the United States, the UK, Germany, and France. We collected 100 valid responses from each country, and a total of 600 responses were obtained. Results: Our key findings are the diversity of interests in RM, which can be expressed as user pragmatism, governance and handling of RM, risk, and benefit, and scientific interests. The priority of interests varied across the six countries, and the variations may be influenced by the political, social, cultural, and media contexts of SCR and RM in each country. Conclusion: The implications can contribute to a deeper understanding of the diversity of public attitudes, and bring about an appropriate examination of a wide range of ethical and social concerns of SCR and RM in global contexts. © 2022 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine

AB  - Renewable energy development is a widely and intensively discussed topic, though it is still unclear which exactly variables may influence people's evaluation of the phenomenon. There is a need to study the general public's knowledge, emotions, and cognitions linked to energy technologies especially in the context of advanced inventions. Social media is a powerful communication tool which has a huge impact on studying public opinions. This study aims to describe linguistic connections through an analysis of 1500 Instagram posts, assuming and interpreting emotional and/or cognitive words. Using a socio-cognitive approach, this research explores the salient words under a set of pre-specified renewable energy technology (RET) hashtags. Building on the appraisal theories of emotions, this research investigates the coexistence of several energy technologies (solar, wind, biomass, and geothermal) and powerlines. The results showed the highest linguistic interconnection between solar and wind energy posts. Furthermore, powerlines were not linguistically connected to the RETs, as they are not included in the schema or not salient when people write posts about renewable energy. Solar, wind, and geothermal posts evoked more emotional and positive emotions than the other RETs and powerlines. Instead, biomass posts had a high frequency of cognitive processes and causal words. Powerline posts were linked to the words of risk, body, health, and biological process showing a great concern for health and perceived threat. These differences in the words used can be a guide to understanding peoples' reactions and communication for each of the energy sources. This study, taking both emotions and cognitions into account, explains different types of considerations towards energy projects. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Experiments with autonomous vehicles continue to proliferate. And yet, their broader public profile remains low. Commissioned by the French Ministry for Transport, this research examines the image of autonomous vehicles with the public at large. The methodology employed includes a thorough review of the French media discourse, in order to analyse the ways in which autonomous vehicles are presented and perceived in the press and social media. Over 2,600 press articles and 43,000 tweets in French were gathered and analysed in a period stretching from December 2017 to May 2018, supplementing a historical corpus of 2,200 articles appearing in the national press in the period 2012–2017. Analysis of this material yielded quantitative and qualitative information on autonomous vehicles. We attain a statistical description of the dissemination of information relating to autonomous vehicles and a dynamic analysis of the content shining a light on the process by which opinions are formed. The results reveal steadily growing but fluctuating media interest. Peaks correspond to widespread press coverage and substantial interest on Twitter, but never attained the critical mass required to constitute a media-hype. We also observed a significant homogenisation of content at these times. The same sources of information were widely shared. Economic stakeholders are at the centre of discussions, and they are also the principal sources of information. This predominance of the views espoused by private stakeholders shapes the prevalent framing of all of the subjects considered here. It leads us to conclude that autonomous vehicles are yet to achieve the level of general public interest that we associate with real issues of public interest. This point is of particular importance to the government agencies concerned with the deployment of autonomous vehicles and the social acceptability of such technologies. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society

AB  - Whereas politicians broker peace deals, it falls to the public to embrace peace and help sustain it. The legacy of conflicts can make it difficult for people to support reconciling and reintegrating with former enemies. Here we create a five-minute media intervention from interviews we conducted with Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) ex-combatants in a Colombian demobilization camp and non-FARC Colombians in neighbouring communities. We show that exposure to the media intervention humanizes FARC ex-combatants and increases support for peace and reintegration. These effects persisted at least three months post-exposure, were replicated in an independent sample of non-FARC Colombians and affected both attitudes (for example, support for reintegration policies) and behaviour (for example, donations to organizations supporting ex-combatants). As predicted, the intervention’s effects were mediated by changing conflict-associated cognitions—reducing the belief that ex-combatants are unwilling and unable to change—beyond affective pathways (for example, increased empathy or reduced prejudice). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Fake news and disinformation are not a new phenomenon. However, in recent years, they have acquired great prominence on the public agenda, conditioning electoral results and generating episodes of political destabilization. Academic interest runs in parallel with the consideration of disinformation as a growing priority for governments and international organizations, due to its geostrategic relevance and its importance for national sovereignty and security. The interference of countries such as Russia or China in other nations’ electoral processes, using new tools and methods to manipulate public opinion and proliferate cyberattacks have led to the creation of agencies or regulations aimed at curbing disinformation in some states. The UN, the EU and other countries’ governments have tried to develop strategies to respond to this growing threat. The pandemic has accelerated the decline of local media, which leaves communities in a state of serious vulnerability. Reliable resources and sources around local information are scarce assets, information is increasingly consumed through social media, and in them disinformation easily proliferates. With this proposal, we intend to start a discussion around disinformation at a local level, something that has been absent in disinformation studies. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: The pharmacovigilance system is playing a vital role in the process of patient safety through reporting of ADRs and other drug-related problems. Although, the. Pharmacovigilance system is well established in other Gulf Cooperation Countries (GCC). In Kingdom of Bahrain, the Pharmacovigilance system is still in its early stages. Establishing a successful Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain requires a collective effort from various stakeholders such as the ministry of health and the National Health Regulatory Authority (NHRA). Aim: To assess the current status of the Pharmacovigilance system in Bahrain and the feasibility of its development. Objectives: To investigate the current Pharmacovigilance activities in Bahrain, to explore the attitude / knowledge of healthcare providers towards PV systems and to identify the limitations, and barriers of the PV system in Bahrain. Methodology: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study utilising an online survey composed of 24 questions. It was distributed to pharmacists, physicians, and nurses working at government and private hospitals in Bahrain through emails and social media. In addition, a telephone interview was performed with a pharmacist working for NHRA in Bahrain. Ethics approval was prior to commencing the study. Results: More than half of the respondents (69.8%) did not report any ADRs so far in their practice, whereas 30.2% had done so. A total of 95.8% of those who have never reported before were willing to report in the future. Participants who received training regarding reporting ADRs reported lower positive attitudes (3.3 ± 0.8 vs 3.6 ± 0.6). In addition, the participants were more knowledgeable about the ADRs reporting process than the PV system. The results showed the absence of an active PV program. The activity of PV in Bahrain is limited to receiving notifications and periodic safety update records from manufactures or the GHC. Conclusion: Despite the average level of knowledge of healthcare providers towards the PV system, the results indicated a negative attitude. Moreover, some barriers were reported. Establishing a specialised PV centre is the next step to improve the status of PV system in Bahrain. © 2022

AB  - Background: The media plays a vital role in addressing the issues of society through audiovisual means that contribute to the transmission of media messages. Drama contributes to implement positive values or negative attitudes in people's minds towards various societal issues. The negative stereotypes shaped by drama about persons with disabilities (PWDs) have attracted the attention of the researchers. Therefore, Arabic drama is required to present a true portrait of PWDs that reflects their reality without exaggeration or discrimination. It is also required to re-correct the stereotyped image that has been formed in society towards PWDs. Aims: This literature research was conducted to review and analyze research and theses that presented PWDs in Arabic drama. The research sought to reveal the stereotypical behavior of PWDs in Arabic drama, categories of disability, and drama genres that presented PWDs. Methods and procedures: This research included 17 peer-reviewed research and thesis obtained from Arab and international databases from 2002 to 2022. The content analysis card was used to achieve the aims of this research. Outcomes and results: The findings of the literature review indicated that the majority of Arab dramas presented negative stereotypes of PWDs. The results also showed that intellectual disability, visual impairment, and physical disabilities were the most dominant in Arabic movies and television series. Conclusions and implications: Arabic drama and media were unable to present accurate representations of PWDs. They appeared in a distorted and satirical way in movies and television series. Perhaps, these negative stereotypes emerged from the prevailing popular cultures in the Arab countries that produce these movies and series. It is thus necessary to remove these stereotypes expressed in drama to enhance awareness and societal inclusion in the Arab culture and countries. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Saving water is a common responsibility of all humanity, which is essential for achieving sustainable use of global water resources. The aim of this study is to discover the determinants of an individual's intention to save water. Based on the theory of planned behavior, a novel comprehensive framework has been developed by extending environmental concern, perceived risk, and information publicity. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to perform an empirical analysis with data from questionnaire of 265 residents in Jinan, the famous Chinese “Spring City”. The findings indicate that residents have a strong environmental concern and water-saving intention with mean values of 6.78 and 6.67, respectively. Attitude and information publicity are the most important antecedents of water-saving intention, followed by subjective norms and perceived behavioral control. Environmental concern and perceived risk indirectly affect the intention to save water through attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control. The role of environmental concern is more important than the role of perceived risk. Interestingly, a high level of information publicity may strengthen the impact of attitude on water-saving intention but weaken the impact of perceived behavioral control. This study strongly supplements current knowledge on water-saving behavior. Moreover, these findings provide insights for policymakers to motivate people to save water. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social media holds the potential to transform presidential communication and leadership. We test whether presidential tweets affect public opinions about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) as well as partisan reputations for handling health policy using a survey-based experiment. We find that negative tweets about the ACA from President Trump reduced favorability toward the ACA among Republicans and increased the partisan gap. Support was particularly reduced among Republicans with low levels of racial resentment, with a corresponding opposite effect among Democrats with high levels of racial resentment. We found only limited effects on opinions about party handling of health policy more generally. © 2022 Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress.

AB  - This article examines why an aboveground pink economy has emerged in mainland China, where equal rights for gay people are repressed and public attitudes toward homosexuality are overwhelmingly negative. Drawing on interviews, supplemented with a minimal amount of media data, this article demonstrates that in China there was a group of gay people wishing to fulfill needs mainstream businesses disregard and that such consumer needs necessitate China’s pink sector. More importantly, the state set the stage for the nascent sector to emerge: Government policies triggered a surge in funding resources and technology infrastructure upgrades that laid the material foundations for pink entrepreneurship. Despite being born in an institutional void, pink ventures employed legitimizing strategies to hedge against risk and uncertainty, thereby consolidating this new market. China’s pink economy developed independently of the influence of the gay movement and even expanded, as never before, at the low ebb of the movement. This research gives credence to the notion that an aboveground pink economy could precede political rights but, unlike American scholarship, questions a similar causal relationship between the two in the Chinese context. © 2022 Eastern Sociological Society.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media. Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups. Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively. Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6–2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35–0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59). Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As gene editing technologies such as CRISPR have become increasingly prominent, so have media portrayals of them. With this in mind, the present study builds on theoretical accounts of framing effects, cultivation effects, and genre-specific viewing effects to examine how different forms of media use predict attitudes toward applications of gene editing. Specifically, the study tests how news use, overall television viewing, and science fiction viewing are related to such attitudes. The analyses draw on original data from two surveys of the U.S. public, one conducted in 2020 and the other in 2021. The results from both surveys indicate that news use and overall television viewing predict support for uses of gene editing, whereas science fiction viewing is not significantly related to opinion. The findings suggest that media frames and images may carry implications for the trajectory of public opinion about gene editing technologies and, ultimately, the social context for their development and adoption. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The U.S. witnessed deep ideological rifts during the 2020 presidential election, with reverberations that continue to this day. Both the media reports and the research evidence reveal the passion with which people cling to their ideologies and the barriers to communication that people often erect between themselves and those who do not share their political viewpoints. Consider the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol in January 6, 2021, as an historical example of the vilification and disrespect that people express toward those with different viewpoints from their own. Here we test whether moments of shared subjective experience (i.e., I-sharing) can facilitate liking for politically different others, as well as more productive dialogue across political lines. Drawing from previous work on the intergroup implications of I-sharing, we predicted and found that I-sharing increased liking for one’s interaction partner, irrespective of one’s own political preferences and irrespective whether one’s interaction partner shares those political preferences. In addition, I-sharing (relative to not I-sharing) promoted a greater sense among Biden supporters that they could have a productive dialogue with Trump supporters, although the parallel effect did not hold true for Trump supporters. The results point to the possibility that moments of I-sharing can get people with differing political views to, as Biden put it so simply on November seventh, 2020, “listen to each other again.”. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This article examines how the Houthi rebels in Yemen use tribal poetry as a propaganda platform to influence public opinion about the current war crisis in the country. By digitalizing Yemeni oral popular poetry, zamil, in the form of motivational war songs and YouTube videos, the Houthi militia group is able to attract young supporters, and publicly denounce Saudi airstrikes and the international sanctions imposed by the United Nations Security Council. While the study unpacks the hidden agenda of Houthi digital poetry and its multiple underpinnings, it sheds light on two important findings: 1) the understudied role of Houthi media campaign the way it’s been used as a digital weapon to advance Yemen’s Shiite militia movement, 2) how the Houthi use of social media revived a Yemeni poetic tradition, zawamil (plural of zamil) to disseminate a wide populous sentiment against the Saudi-led coalition and the United Nations Security Council in this civil conflict. © 2022, American University in Cairo.

AB  - Due to the continuous progress and development of new media technology, the living habits and ways of Chinese people have undergone profound changes due to the emergence and development of the Internet. Many college students are bombarded with information from the Internet, and they also gradually feel great social pressure. In addition, the Internet has become an important channel and platform for many college students to make suggestions, communicate and study. However, due to the characteristics of hidden, open and free travel of the Internet, college students can not only get access to positive and positive information, but also suffer from many unhealthy information infringements. Under the dual influence of social pressure and public opinion, college students will have a negative impact on the physical and mental development of college students. In serious cases, online mass incidents will occur, which will be detrimental to the construction of a harmonious society. Based on this, it is necessary to correctly handle the social pressure and public opinion related content of college students in the new media environment. In this paper, the connotation, characteristics and environment of new media are analyzed, combined with regression calculation, the pressure brought by new media to college students is further analyzed from four angles, and the four characteristics of college students’ public opinion are discussed in detail. Then, it puts forward the countermeasures of social pressure and public opinion from five dimensions. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - This study investigates the bias of Twitter as an agenda-setter during COVID-19. Specifically, we analyze the agenda-setting function of Twitter (Study 1) and characteristics of information disseminators on Twitter, agenda-builders (Study 2), related to the COVID-19 pandemic. In Study 1, we examined rank correlations between the media agendas on COVID-19 and public agendas. The results indicated that Twitter agendas resonate with those who have liberal tendencies. In Study 2, we used data from the Internet survey to identify the political attitudes of agenda-builders who tweet or retweet on COVID-19. The results of the model analyses indicated that people with liberal tendencies, motivated by their political attitude, created original tweets, and some of those tweets were then retweeted by flaming-oriented people driven by a sense of justice. This seems to be how information about COVID-19 spreads on Twitter in Japan. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Theories of mediatization and domestication provide an analytical framework in understanding how patterns of interpretation are related to the public opinion's attitudes towards actors and topics. In this study, we focus on the coverage of the Skripal case by major Greek newspapers in March 2018 in a pursuit to determine the variety of dispositions towards Russia. The Greek media's coverage seems to comply with a disengaged approach: More news than views. The majority of news reports -instead of opinions-can be regarded as an effect of awkwardness or a choice not to provide analysis on Russia, even though the abundant news reports have the exact opposite effect of maintaining the public's vivid interest. By performing a content analysis on articles with references to Russia, we seek to look beneath this veneer. We suggest that the Greek newspapers' coverage is linked with more structural traits, such as Russophilia, as we identify several distinct subcultures in the press when it comes to dispositions towards Russia. © 2022 M Y U Scientific Publishing Division.

AB  - This article focuses on co-operatives’ faltering position in 21st century Canadian public opinion. I argue co-operative education's introverted bias toward ‘boardrooms and classrooms’ neglects public opinion; and that shifting international norms and historical conditions have reinforced this retreat from mass media and the public sphere. A co-operative communication gap of international significance is the result. Cultural hegemony theory and qualitative methods are used to develop the argument. Historical analysis first demonstrates that educational conventionalism dangerously discounts the contemporary cultural environment's threat to mutualism. It is argued that the International Co-operative Alliance's (ICA) contradictory doctrine has deepened normative confusion about co-operative education's scope, further delaying media activism and popular education. Textual analysis illustrates this contradiction in key documents. These include the Report of the ICA Commission on Co-operative Principles (1967), the Statement on the Co-operative Identity (1995), and the Guidance Notes to the Co-operative Principles (2016). Finally, conjunctural analysis shows that contradictory tendencies inside and outside international mutualism reshaped an inward-turning pedagogy from 1995 to 2016. Findings thus extend our understanding of the communication gap by accounting for barriers to popular educational innovation, both conceptual and strategic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim: To test (1) if there was a change in self-reported lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine use by birth cohort and (2) if the extent of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was associated with the proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem. Design: Observational study using seven waves of repeated cross-sectional nationally representative household surveys between 2001 and 2019. Setting: Australia. Participants: Participants were from three birth cohorts: 1951–60 (age 68–77 at the 2019 survey; n = 29 458; 55% female), 1961–1970 (age 58–67; n = 29 859; 57% female) and 1971–1980 (age 48–57; n = 28 758; 59% female). Data were weighted to align the sample to the Australian population. Measurements: Past year meth/amphetamine use; under-reporting of lifetime meth/amphetamine use in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum (operationalised as the difference between self-reported lifetime prevalence in 2001 and that of each subsequent year); proportion of the population who nominated meth/amphetamine as a drug problem in each birth cohort, year and survey stratum. Under-reporting was regressed on the proportion of people holding negative attitude towards meth/amphetamine. Survey year and birth cohort were adjusted for. Findings: Between 2001 and 2019, the lifetime prevalence of meth/amphetamine decreased from 6.1% (95% CI = 5.3–6.9) to 1.7% (95% CI = 1.2–2.2) in the 1951–1960 birth cohort (p < 0.001), from 13.0% (95% CI = 12.0–14.1) to 4.4% (95% CI = 3.7–5.2) in the 1961–1970 birth cohort (p < 0.001) and from 21.4% (95% CI = 19.9–22.9) to 11.2% (95% CI = 10.0–12.4) in the 1971–1980 birth cohort (p < 0.001). The proportion who nominated meth/amphetamine as a ‘drug problem’ increased significantly in all three cohorts (all p < 0.001) and the degree of under-reporting of meth/amphetamine use was significantly associated with proportion of people who nominated meth/amphetamine as the ‘drug problem’ (b = 0.09, SE = 0.01, p < 0.001). Conclusion: In Australia, the actual prevalence of lifetime meth/amphetamine use may be two- to fourfold higher than that estimated in the most recent national household surveys (2019). The level of under-reporting is strongly associated with increasing negative attitudes towards methylamphetamine and d-amphetamine use over the same period. © 2021 Society for the Study of Addiction.

AB  - The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Social media have become a major venue where citizens discuss matters of public concern, prompting some scholars to apply theory of the public sphere to analyze online discussion. However, the public sphere is often viewed as a static space; little attention is given to the complex processes through which topics are raised, debated, and refined by the public through this discussion. This study conceptualizes the public sphere as a problematization process and proposes a novel framework combining a four-phase process analysis together with content analysis to analyze public deliberation process on social media. A case study is conducted of public discussion on Sina Weibo about municipal policy in Hangzhou, China. Data generated using the framework illustrate how social media function as a filtering mechanism, channeling salient public opinions from civil society to decision-making bodies in the center of the politico-legal system, where these opinions play a role in policy decision-making. This paper provides analytic leverage for understanding the relevance of public sphere theory to policymaking processes. © 2022 Policy Studies Organization.

AB  - How did Britons view China in 2020, at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic? This paper presents new, detailed evidence of the negative and worsening perceptions of China in the UK across three domains: public opinion (based on survey data collected in autumn 2020), political elites in parliament, and the media. The worsening of perceptions of China emerged in the context of a changing and more contested China policy from the UK government and a greater level of public debate about China, partly a consequence of the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. The paper places analysis of these perceptions in the context of the development of relations between the UK and China. Together with deteriorating Chinese views of the UK’s China policy and controversy over a number of developments in China, widespread negative views about China among the British public and in political circles will constrain UK-China relations from developing in a more positive direction. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In recent years, online social networks have become vital platforms for political discussions as well as electoral campaigns. Political organizations have leveraged social media as a tool for distributing information, monitoring public opinion, promoting candidates, and even influencing the election outcomes. To achieve their goals, groups or organizations may purchase or register plenty of accounts, the so-called sockpuppets, to shape the opinion and influence the public atmosphere. In this article, we investigate sockpuppet accounts based on their activity behaviors. A series of user behavior based, network-based, content-based features, and temporal features are proposed and extracted for the classification task. To categorize users into sockpuppets and legitimate users, we employ ensemble learning as well as single classifiers and a thorough evaluation is presented. Experimental results on an officially verified dataset obtained from the largest social forum in Taiwan show that a maximum value of area under the curve score achieves 0.904 via an ensemble learning with feature engineering in our proposal. © 2007-2012 IEEE.

AB  - During the last decades the Nordic media model has been challenged by neoliberal policy and welfare retrenchment. This study asks about the extent to which the values, functions and institutions of the “media welfare state” are supported by the adult Swedish citizenry, despite political mobilization against it. Drawing on a national survey (n = 2003) this study shows that the media welfare state is generally well-supported by the population. Using exploratory statistical analysis, we identify a media welfare state of mind. While widespread in the population, this attitudinal constellation is more common in older segments of the population, in the working-class, and by those who frequently use and trust public service media. The main conclusion is that support for the media welfare state primarily can be explained by political attitudes, where left-leaning and GAL-oriented individuals are more positive than people holding right-wing and TAN-attitudes. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Given the growing importance of issue competition and the growing use of social media during elections, this study seeks to create a better understanding of how issue dynamics relating to political parties play out on social media. It tests whether issue ownership theory can explain how parties and issues are being discussed on Twitter and to what extent a mediated form of issue ownership aligns with citizens' perceptions of issue ownership. The results indicate that perceptions of issue ownership as measured in representative surveys correlate with variations of what issues parties are linked with on Twitter. Some deviations also emerged, which possibly reflect short-Term changes in parties' issue competition. Understanding how issue ownership mediates through social media platforms is important in order to evaluate the role of social media in contemporary opinion forming processes and sheds light on the issue competition among political parties in online fora. © 2021 Sandberg, published by De Gruyter.

AB  - This study focuses on social media use of citizens from two groups that are often associated with the rise of social media: populist and postmaterialist citizens. Considering their ideological underpinnings, we theorize that they will make more political use of social media and that this further reifies their political attitudes into voting for populist and postmaterialist parties, respectively. Using unique survey data including the relatively new populist attitudes and political use of social media, we test this theory on the Dutch case. We find that both groups do not read political news or connect to politicians more, but both are more likely to react to political content. Moreover, social media use does not seem to lead to a retention in one’s own ideological funnel signified by populist or postmaterialist voting. Among more postmaterialist citizens, passive social media use even makes it more likely to vote for other parties. © 2021, European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - Information spread on social media has been extensively studied through both model-driven theoretical research and data-driven case studies. Recent empirical studies have analyzed the differences and complexity of information dissemination, but theoretical explanations of its characteristics from a modeling perspective are underresearched. To capture the complex patterns of the information dissemination mechanism, we propose a resistant linear threshold (RLT) dissemination model based on psychological theories and empirical findings. In this article, we validate the RLT model on three types of networks and then quantify and compare the dissemination characteristics of the simulation results with those from the empirical results. In addition, we examine the factors affecting dissemination. Finally, we perform two case studies of the 2019 novel Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19)-related information dissemination. The dissemination characteristics derived by the simulations are consistent with the empirical research. These results demonstrate that the RLT model is able to capture the patterns of information dissemination on social media and thus provide model-driven insights into the interpretation of public opinion, rumor control, and marketing strategies on social media. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The Internet brings new opportunities and challenges to scientific development and science communication. Previous studies overwhelmingly focused on individual-level Internet factors but overlooked the potential explanatory strength of Internet context. This study addresses the existing gap by examining how the Internet influences Chinese people’s scientific optimism from a comprehensive perspective (Internet as a medium and Internet as a context). Multilevel models were built based on individual-provincial merged data. The results indicate that (1) the Internet context impairs scientific optimism while Internet exposure has no significant effect. (2) The relationship between individual Internet exposure and scientific optimism varies by province. As a quantitative indicator of Internet context, Internet penetration mitigates the weakening effect of individual Internet exposure on scientific optimism. This research provides empirical evidence on scientific attitude formation in the non-Western environment and expands the analytic approach of public attitudes toward science. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Since its 2016 launch, negative attitudes toward The Athletic, a network of hyperlocal subscription sports news sites, have resonated throughout the journalism community because of the new media startup’s nontraditional approach, one centered on hiring established journalists from the hometown newspaper. Therefore, to accurately paint a picture of The Athletic’s perceived impact on print journalism, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with newspaper sports editors. This analysis reveals that most sports editors were generally accepting of The Athletic and viewed its presence as reinforcement that newspapers need to stick to daily coverage to stand out in the crowded sports media marketplace. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The failure of large-scale resettlement policies has been largely determined by the collective resistance of residents. For migrants who must leave their original residence and get resettled, mass media and interpersonal communication are important sources to get policy information, which affects their attitudes and responses to resettlement policies. Existing studies have provided two pathways to explain the influencing mechanism between information sources and people’s collective resistance intention. One of these pathways focuses on trust in government and the other highlights perceived benefits. However, it is still unclear how to predict migrants’ collective resistance intention based on different information sources within these two pathways. By concentrating on the policy domain of Chinese resettlement projects, this study aims to develop an integrated, theoretical framework to explore the causal paths between information sources and migrants’ collective resistance intention. Based on a survey of three towns in Ankang, China, we tested the causal mechanism with a structural equation model. The results demonstrate that the pathway that involves trust in government is more explanatory in illustrating the causal mechanism than the pathway of perceived benefits, and interpersonal communication yields stronger effects than mass media in mitigating migrants’ collective resistance intention. The implications for resettlement policy publicity and trust-building in China are discussed. Points for practitioners: Public communication is a critical competency for public managers. Public managers are recommended to flexibly apply various information sources to communicate with migrants in order to eventually mitigate their collective resistance intention by strengthening their trust in government, as well as their perceived benefits. In the early stages of policy publicity, a variety of mass media are needed to inform the migrants of resettlement policies. Then, at the stage of policy implementation, the primary focus becomes interpersonal communication that offers sufficiently detailed information. In this regard, local government managers should carry out more programs that entail face-to-face information sharing to help participants understand the resettlement policy, and encourage them to explain it to their family and friends. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This essay argues that Arundhati Roy’s inclusion of numerous Indian vernacular words and phrases in her fiction is carefully calibrated to serve the author’s activist political agenda. This is true not only of her first novel, The God of Small Things, but also of the more recent Ministry of Utmost Happiness. Both feature a Bakhtinian or dialogic interplay of linguistic modes. The earlier work poses two languages against each other: Malayalam, the primary language of Kerala, and English, the medium of narration and the preferred tongue of the prominent Ipe family. The outcome of this contest highlights the Ipes’ imprisonment within a life-denying straitjacket of outworn prejudices and conventions. In The Ministry of Utmost Happiness the linguistic terrain broadens to include several tongues of the subcontinent, along with English. Roy gives special exposure to two: Urdu and Kashmiri, to reclaim them from the oppression both of them, along with their speakers, are undergoing at the hands of the dominant Hindi-speaking majority. Tilo, a pivotal character, is enthusiastically polyglot, a trait which accords with her more general adaptability and freedom from sectarian narrowness. The other central figure, the transgender Anjum, resembles Tilo in her resistance to strict definitions of her fluid selfhood, but must endure forms of verbal as well as physical violence. Like her first novel, but on a more capacious stage, Roy’s second aims at speaking multilingual truth to monolingual power. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - Objective Data on COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy is limited in Ethiopia and other parts of Africa. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy and its associated factors in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Design A community-based concurrent mixed-method study. Setting In a community setting. Participants Adult residents (n=422) of Akaki Kality subcity who were recruited by a two stage sampling technique and 24 adults who were selected purposively were included for the quantitative and qualitative part of the study respectively. Outcome measures Data were collected by face-to-face interview using a semistructured questionnaire. Factors associated with COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy were identified by multivariable binary logistic regression model. Results One out five (19.1%, 95% CI 15.3% to 24.6%) participants were not willing to get vaccinated. In the multivariable analysis, vaccine hesitancy was significantly associated with being female (aOR=1.97; 95% CI 1.10 to 3.89), having negative attitude towards COVID-19 and its preventive measures (aOR=1.75; 95% CI 1.08 to 3.02), and primary information source being social media (internet) (aOR=3.59; 95% CI 1.75 to 7.37). Study participants have predominantly stated that they did not have enough information about the vaccine, feared it would not be effective or have too many side effects, and reflected their uncertainty towards the quality of the vaccine. Conclusions A considerable proportion of the people in Addis Ababa have concerns on COVID-19 vaccines and unwilling to accept them. This was due to the misconceptions, negative attitudes and use of social media as their primary source of information. Providing the community with health education and consistent efforts to enhance the prevention measures are important, particularly using different medias including social media. ©

AB  - Public concern over major agricultural product safety incidents, such as swine flu and avian flu, can intensify financial losses in the livestock and poultry industries. Crawler technology were applied to reviewed the Weibo social media discussions on the African Swine Fever (ASF) incident in China that was reported on 3 August 2018, and used content analysis and network analysis to specifically examine the online public opinion network dissemination characteristics of verified individual users, institutional users and ordinary users. It was found that: (1) attention paid to topics related to “epidemic,” “treatment,” “effect” and “prevent” decrease in turn, with the interest in “prevent” increasing significantly when human infections were possible; (2) verified individual users were most concerned about epidemic prevention and control and play a supervisory role, the greatest concern of institutional users and ordinary users were issues related to agricultural industry and agricultural products price fluctuations respectively; (3) among institutional users, media was the main opinion leader, and among non-institutional users, elites from all walks of life, especially the food safety personnel acted as opinion leaders. Based on these findings, some policy suggestions are given: determine the nature of the risk to human health of the safety incident, stabilizing prices of relevant agricultural products, and giving play to the role of information dissemination of relevant institutions.

AB  - Background: Vaccine hesitancy is responsible for low vaccine coverage and increased risk of epidemics. The purpose of this study was to assess whether public knowledge, attitudes, practices, and willingness to vaccinate against COVID-19 have changed over time and at different stages of vaccination. Methods: Two consecutive surveys were conducted among residents of the Leshan Community in Jinan from May to June, 2021 (n = 423) (basic dose vaccination phase) and from December, 2021 to January, 2022 (n = 470) (booster vaccination phase). Randomly sampling was used in residents to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Chi-square test was used to compare the changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices of the subjects in different survey stages. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to explore factors related to vaccination hesitancy. Results: In the booster vaccination phase, protective behaviors (89.9%) of residents increased significantly compared with the basic vaccination phase (74.5%). Residents were more hesitant to receive booster doses than basal doses of COVID-19 vaccine (OR: 18.334, 95% CI: 9.021–37.262). Residents with other marital statuses (OR: 2.719, 95% CI: 1.632–4.528), negative attitudes toward government measures were more hesitant to get vaccinated (OR: 2.576, 95% CI: 1.612–4.118). People who thought their physical condition was very good or good were more likely to be vaccinated than those who thought they were in fair or poor health (OR: 0.516, 95% CI: 0.288–0.925; OR: 0.513, 95% CI: 0.295–0.893). Young people inclined to use new media (such as WeChat and microblog) to obtain information, while the elderly inclined to use traditional methods (such as television). Government propaganda, residents' perception of the importance of vaccines and the risk of disease were the main reasons for accelerating residents to vaccinate. The main reasons affecting residents' lack of vaccination were contraindications to the vaccine or inconvenient time for vaccination. Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy increased significantly with change in vaccination stage. Strategies should be adopted to increase vaccination coverage such as improving the convenience of vaccination, promoting through multiple channels.

AB  - This work aims to establish whether astroturfing was used during the Covid-19 pandemic to manipulate Spanish public opinion through Twitter. This study analyzes tweets published in Spanish and geolocated in the Philippines, and its first objective is to determine the existence of an organized network that directs its messages mainly towards Spain. To determine the non-existence of a random network, a preliminary collection of 1,496,596 tweets was carried out. After determining its 14 main clusters, 280 users with a medium-low profile of participation and micro-and nano-influencer traits were randomly selected and followed for 103 days, for a total of 309,947 tweets. Network science, text mining, sentiment and emotion, and bot probability analyses were performed using Gephi and R. Their network structure su-ggests an ultra-small-world phenomenon, which would determine the existence of a possible organized network that tries not to be easily identifiable. The data analyzed confirm a digital communication scenario in which astroturfing is used as a strategy aimed at manipulating public opinion through non-influencers (cybertroops). These users create and disseminate content with proximity and closeness to different groups of public opinion, mixing topics of general interest with disinformation or polarized content. © 2022, El Profesional de la Informacion.

AB  - Conservation outreach is regularly conducted to increase support for conservation by altering local awareness and attitudes about species or environmental issues. However, there is often little assessment of the effectiveness of these activities. We investigated knowledge of past conservation outreach in 26 villages adjacent to Bawangling National Nature Reserve, Hainan, China, which contains the last population of the Hainan gibbon (Nomascus hainanus). The medium of past outreach activities was reported most frequently by interviewees, followed by who delivered them and the outreach topic, with the fewest interviewees reporting the specific messages being communicated (the consequences of following conservation management policies). Negatively-framed messages, emphasizing prohibited activities and associated punishments, were reported more than positively-framed messages that aimed to foster conservation support. Male interviewees and those with higher education levels reported more aspects of past activities. The Hainan gibbon had higher salience than other threatened native species, and reporting the occurrence (but not necessarily the content) of past outreach was associated with increased likelihood of knowing that gibbons were threatened. These findings highlight the need for conservation outreach to increase both exposure and retention of key messages among target audiences. Meaningful and concrete conservation benefits should be communicated to local communities, and the effectiveness of outreach using a flagship species could be expanded to also improve awareness of other conservation-priority species within the same landscape. © 2022

AB  - With the development of Internet technology, social media platforms have become an indispensable part of people’s lives, and social media have been integrated into people’s life, study, and work. On various forums, such as Taobao and Weibo, a large number of people’s footprints are left all the time. It is these chats, comments, and other remarks with people’s emotional evaluations that make up part of public opinion. Analysis of this network public opinion is conducive to maintaining the peaceful development of society. Therefore, sentiment analysis has become a hot research field and has made great strides as one of the hot topics in the field of natural language processing. Currently, the BERT model and its variants have achieved excellent results in the field of NLP. However, these models cannot be widely used due to huge demands on computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the transformer mechanism, which mainly includes two parts: knowledge distillation and text augmentation. The former is mainly used to reduce the number of parameters of the model, reducing the computational cost and training time of the model, and the latter is mainly used to expand the task text so that the model can achieve excellent results in the few-sample sentiment analysis task. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive results. Copyright © 2022 Gong, Ying, Zhong and Gong.

AB  - Purpose: The online users’ characteristic information can provide decision support for policy-designing and construction of public strategies. Hence, this paper aims to conduct online public opinion mining on the recovery policy stimulating the economies stroked by COVID-19 epidemic. Also, sentimental analysis is performed to uncover the posters’ emotion towards the target policy. Design/methodology/approach: This paper adopts bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) as classifier in classification tasks, including misinformation detection, subject analysis and sentimental analysis. Meanwhile, latent Dirichlet allocation method and sentiment formulations are implemented in topic modelling and sentiment analysis. Findings: The experimental results indicate that public opinion is mainly non-negative to the target policy. The positive emotions mainly focus on the benefits that the recovery policy might bring to stimulate economy. On the other hand, some negative opinions concerned about the shortcomings and inconvenience of the target policy. Originality/value: The authors figured out the key factors focused by the public opinion on the target recovery policy. Also, the authors indicated pros and cons of the recovery policy by analysing the emotion and the corresponding topics of the public opinion on social media. The findings of the paper can be generalized in other countries theoretically to help them design recovery policy against COVID-19. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the attitude of medical students towards cultural diversity aiming to elucidate our current status in understanding cultural awareness and sensitivity. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: A web-based cross-sectional study was carried out among 601 undergraduate health science students (medical and dental courses) at a health sciences university in eastern Nepal via various modes of social-media platforms like WhatsApp, Messenger, Gmail, etc. OUTCOME MEASURES: Medical students' attitude towards cultural diversity and its association with the sociodemographic profile of the students. RESULTS: A total of 601 students participated in the study, out of which, 64.2% were men with a sex ratio of 1.8:1 and a mean age of 22.3±1.9 years. More than two-thirds (77.2%) of the students had an excellent to good attitude towards cultural diversity. The proportion of students reporting 'excellent' attitude towards cultural diversity was higher among male students compared with female students (37.8% vs 20.5%) and students aged >22 years compared with younger students (37.1% vs 26.7%). Gender (p<0.001) and age (p=0.009) were significantly associated with the attitude towards cultural diversity. CONCLUSIONS: Medical students, in general, are aware of the impacts of a cross-cultural society on the delivery of quality healthcare and also about the need to be aware of prejudices doctors may have towards certain cultures. Majority suggest the inclusion of concepts of multicultural awareness and sensitivity in the medical curriculum itself. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2022. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

AB  - Purpose: The spread of fake news on social networking sites (SNS) poses a threat to the marketing landscape, yet little is known about how fake news affect consumers’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviors. This study aims to explore when consumers believe fake news, whom they blame for it (e.g. negative attitudes toward brands or SNS) and when they choose to share it. Design/methodology/approach: Data obtained from 80 open-ended, semistructured interviews, conducted with SNS consumers and experts, is analyzed following the principles of grounded theory and the Gioia methodology. Findings: Factors affecting consumers’ perceptions of fake news include skepticism, awareness, previous experience, appeal and message cues. Consumers’ brand- and SNS-related attitudes are affected by consumers’ blame, which is determined by consumers’ perceptions of the vetting efforts, role and ethical obligation of SNS. Consumers’ motives for sharing fake news include duty, retaliation, authentication and status-seeking. Theoretical and practical implications derived from the study’s novel conceptual framework are discussed. Practical implications: This study identifies communication strategies that marketing professionals can use to mitigate and counter the negative effects of fake news. Originality/value: By simultaneously considering consumers’ perceptions of the source, information and medium (i.e. SNS), this study presents a novel conceptual framework providing a marketing-centered, dynamic view on consumers’ fake news experience and connecting consumers’ perceptions, attitudes and behaviors in the context of fake news. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - In the Internet era, people can encounter a vast array of political news outlets, many with which they are unfamiliar. These unknown media outlets are notable because they represent potential sources of misinformation and coverage with a distinctive slant. We use two large survey experiments to consider how source familiarity influences political communication. Although this demonstrates the public is averse to consuming news from unfamiliar media, we show that - conditional on exposure to them - unknown local and foreign media sources can influence public opinion to an extent similar to established mainstream news outlets on the same issues. This comparable effectiveness stems from the public's charitable evaluations of the credibility of unfamiliar news sources and their relatively low trust in familiar mainstream media. We find avoidance of unknown news outlets, not resistance to their coverage, is the primary factor limiting their political influence. ©

AB  - In this study, I take a critical look at the presence of narcoculture in reggaeton using as a case study the music video of the remix of 'Somos de calle'. Specifically, I evaluate whether and to what extent reggaeton's narco-messages and narco-representations - when they converge with other variables - could potentially influence an individual's modes of thinking and behaviour. The study does not aim to provide a definitive answer to the debate surrounding this issue. More than anything, it strives to analyse the extent to which the claim that such influence may occur has scientific merit, in order to advocate further research on this matter. The article also discusses the highly politicized debate that has surrounded this topic in public discourse, and how this has seemingly affected its critical assessment in academia. For the analysis I rely particularly on social psychology literature concerning violent media content and in the areas of persuasion studies and prejudice studies, but I also consider literature from other fields, including criminology. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The development and scope of using various food preservation methods depends on the level of consumers’ acceptance. Despite their advantages, in the case of negative attitudes, producers may limit their use if it determines the level of sales. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of seven different food processing methods and to identify influencing factors, such as education as well as living area and, at the same time, to consider whether consumers verify this type of information on the labels. Additionally, the study included the possibility of influencing consumer attitudes by using alternative names for preservation methods, on the example of microwave treatment. The results showed that conventional heat treatments were the most preferred preservation methods, whereas preservatives, irradiation, radio waves and microwaves were the least favored, suggesting that consumers dislike methods connected with “waves” to a similar extent as their dislike for preservatives. The control factors proved to significantly modify the evaluation of the methods. The analysis of alternative names for microwave treatment showed that “dielectric heating” was significantly better perceived. These research findings are important as the basis for understanding consumer attitudes. Implications for business and directions of future research are also indicated. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19–related keywords and then using vaccine- and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule–based and deep learning–based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes. ©Zain Hussain, Zakariya Sheikh, Ahsen Tahir, Kia Dashtipour, Mandar Gogate, Aziz Sheikh, Amir Hussain.

AB  - Vaccination saves lives and can be an effective strategy for preventing the spread of the COVID-19, but negative attitudes towards vaccines lead to vaccine hesitancy. This study aimed to explore the factors influencing the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine in the Nepali community in the United Kingdom (UK). This qualitative study included in-depth interviews with 20 people from Nepal living in the UK. Interviews were conducted by a native-Nepali speaker and all interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and translated into English before being analysed thematically. Our study found that attitudes towards COVID-19 are generally positive. Nine overlapping themes around barriers to COVID-19 vaccination were identified: (a) rumours and mis/disinformation; (b) prefer home remedies and yoga; (c) religion restriction; (d) concern towards vaccine eligibility; (e) difficulty with online vaccine booking system; (f) doubts of vaccine effectiveness after changing the second dose timeline; (g) lack of confidence in the vaccine; (h) past bad experience with the influenza vaccine; and i) worried about side-effects. Understanding barriers to the uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine can help in the design of better targeted interventions. Public health messages including favourable policy should be tailored to address those barriers and make this vaccination pro-gramme more viable and acceptable to the ethnic minority communities in the UK. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: When the first COVID-19 cases were noticed in China, many racist comments against Chinese individuals spread. As there is a huge need to better comprehend why all of these targeted comments and opinions developed specifically at the start of the outbreak, we sought to carefully examine racism and advocacy efforts on Twitter in the first quarter of 2020 (January 15 to March 3, 2020). Objective: The first research question aimed to understand the main type of racism displayed on Twitter during the first quarter of 2020. The second research question focused on evaluating Twitter users’ positive and negative responses regarding racism toward Chinese individuals. Methods: Content analysis of tweets was utilized to address the two research questions. Using the NCapture browser link and NVivo software, tweets in English and Spanish were pulled from the Twitter data stream from January 15 to March 3, 2020. A total of 19,150 tweets were captured using the advanced Twitter search engine with the keywords and hashtags #nosoyunvirus, #imNotAVirus, #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan, #racism, “No soy un virus,” and “Racismo Coronavirus.” After cleaning the data, a total of 402 tweets were codified and analyzed. Results: The data confirmed clear sentiments of racism against Chinese individuals during the first quarter of 2020. The tweets displayed individual, cultural, and institutional racism. Individual racism was the most commonly reported form of racism, specifically displaying physical and verbal aggression. As a form of resistance, Twitter users created spaces for advocacy and activism. The hashtag “I am not a virus” helped to break stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination on Twitter. Conclusions: Advocacy efforts were enormous both inside and outside the Chinese community; an allyship sentiment was fostered by some white users, and an identification with the oppression experienced by the Chinese population was expressed in the Black and Muslim worldwide communities. Activism through social media manifested through art, food sharing, and community support. ©Amanda Lloret-Pineda, Yuelu He, Josep Maria Haro, Paula Cristóbal-Narváez.

AB  - Background: In the current phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are witnessing the most massive vaccine rollout in human history. Like any other drug, vaccines may cause unexpected side effects, which need to be investigated in a timely manner to minimize harm in the population. If not properly dealt with, side effects may also impact public trust in the vaccination campaigns carried out by national governments. Objective: Monitoring social media for the early identification of side effects, and understanding the public opinion on the vaccines are of paramount importance to ensure a successful and harmless rollout. The objective of this study was to create a web portal to monitor the opinion of social media users on COVID-19 vaccines, which can offer a tool for journalists, scientists, and users alike to visualize how the general public is reacting to the vaccination campaign. Methods: We developed a tool to analyze the public opinion on COVID-19 vaccines from Twitter, exploiting, among other techniques, a state-of-the-art system for the identification of adverse drug events on social media; natural language processing models for sentiment analysis; statistical tools; and open-source databases to visualize the trending hashtags, news articles, and their factuality. All modules of the system are displayed through an open web portal. Results: A set of 650,000 tweets was collected and analyzed in an ongoing process that was initiated in December 2020. The results of the analysis are made public on a web portal (updated daily), together with the processing tools and data. The data provide insights on public opinion about the vaccines and its change over time. For example, users show a high tendency to only share news from reliable sources when discussing COVID-19 vaccines (98% of the shared URLs). The general sentiment of Twitter users toward the vaccines is negative/neutral; however, the system is able to record fluctuations in the attitude toward specific vaccines in correspondence with specific events (eg, news about new outbreaks). The data also show how news coverage had a high impact on the set of discussed topics. To further investigate this point, we performed a more in-depth analysis of the data regarding the AstraZeneca vaccine. We observed how media coverage of blood clot-related side effects suddenly shifted the topic of public discussions regarding both the AstraZeneca and other vaccines. This became particularly evident when visualizing the most frequently discussed symptoms for the vaccines and comparing them month by month. Conclusions: We present a tool connected with a web portal to monitor and display some key aspects of the public's reaction to COVID-19 vaccines. The system also provides an overview of the opinions of the Twittersphere through graphic representations, offering a tool for the extraction of suspected adverse events from tweets with a deep learning model. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Disaster-preventive migration (DPM) is an important method for disaster risk management, but migration itself entails a potential social stability risk. This study took County D in Yunnan Province, one of the counties most severely threatened by geological disasters in China, as an example to construct an indicator system of social stability risk factors for disaster-preventive migration based on a literature survey and in-depth interviews. The system consists of 5 first-level risk factors and 14 s-level risk factors. The social stability risk of DPM in County D was assessed using a fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method based on experts’ weights. The results showed that the overall social stability risk level of disaster-preventive migration in County D is ‘high’. In terms of importance, the five first-level risk factors were ranked as follows: public opinion risk > compensation risk > livelihood recovery risk > cultural risk > geological disaster risk. Among the risk factors, the level of public opinion risk and compensation risk appeared to be high, whereas that of livelihood recovery risk, cultural risk and geological disaster risk resulted to be medium. To our knowledge, this paper is the first research to evaluate the social stability risk of DPM; it not only enriches the theories of social stability risk assessment, but also has important guiding significance for people relocation and resettlement in Chinese ethnic minority areas. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Gender and racial diversity in STEM has been deemed an essential need for a sustainable future, but girls and children from underrepresented racial/ethnic backgrounds continue to show less interest in STEM than their White and male counterparts. Media has been shown to reflect children’s occupational schema from an early age, and therefore might be used to help broaden children’s beliefs about who participates in STEM. In this field-based pre/post-experimental study, children in kindergarten and first grades (N = 48, 62.5% female, Mage = 6.57) viewed episodes of a STEM-focused educational television series that features a diverse group of protagonists two to three times a week for eight weeks. Their occupational schema were measured before and after exposure. Results suggest there was no quantifiable change in their attitudes. However, qualitative analysis of their open-ended responses sheds light on how children’s beliefs about who participates in STEM are shaped, i.e., by both mediated and real-world exposure. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Many countries show low COVID-19 vaccination rates despite high levels of readiness and delivery of vaccines. The public’s misperceptions, hesitancy, and negative emotions toward vaccines are psychological factors discouraging vaccination. At the individual level, studies have revealed negative perceptual/behavioral outcomes of COVID-19 information exposure via social media where misinformation and vaccine fear flood. Objective: This study extends research context to the global level and investigates social media discourse on the COVID-19 vaccine and its association with vaccination rates of 192 countries in the world. Methods: COVID-19 vaccine tweets were compared by country in terms of (1) the number per million Twitter users, (2) mentions of adverse events—death, side-effects, blood clots, (3) negative sentiment (vs. positive), and (4) fear, sadness, or anger emotions (vs. joy). Artificial intelligence (AI) was adopted to classify sentiment and emotions. Such tweets and covariates (COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates, GDP, population size and density, literacy rate, democracy index, institutional quality, human development index) were tested as predictors of vaccination rates in countries. Results: Over 21.3 million COVID-19 vaccine tweets posted between November 2020 and August 2021 worldwide were included in our analysis. The global average of COVID-19 vaccine tweets mentioning adverse events was 2% for ‘death’, 1.15% for ‘side-effects’, and 0.80% for ‘blood clots’. Negative sentiment appeared 1.90 times more frequently than positive sentiment. Fear, anger, or sadness appeared 0.70 times less frequently than joy. The mention of ‘side-effects’ and fear/sadness/anger emotions appeared as significant predictors of vaccination rates, along with the human development index. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that global efforts to combat misinformation, address negative emotions, and promote positive languages surrounding COVID-19 vaccination on social media may help increase global vaccination uptakes. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - We aimed to assess the Iranian people’s attitude and confidence in the COVID-19 vaccine, their concerns about the safety of vaccines, and their reasons for accepting or rejecting the COVID-19 vaccine. We conducted a web-based cross-sectional study with a mixed qualitative–quantitative approach from December 2020 to February 2021. Our questionnaire consisted of a COVID-19 vaccine attitude questionnaire, a COVID-19 vaccine confidence inventory, a modified vaccine safety scale, and questions about participants’ decision to accept or refuse the COVID-19 vaccine, and their explanations for their decisions. The research included 1928 people with an average age of 34.88 years with 1236 (64.1%) being female. A total of 1330 participants desired to have the COVID-19 vaccine (69%). Female gender, lower educational levels, following COVID-19 news through sources other than websites and social media, not following COVID-19 news, and loss of a first-degree relative due to COVID-19 were all associated with a more negative attitude toward the COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.01). To conclude, the acceptance rate of the COVID-19 vaccine among Iranians is comparable to the international average; however, it is still unfavorable. There are serious challenges to the vaccination program in Iran, such as older adults’ lower intention to undergo the COVID-19 vaccine and misinformation. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had a major impact on the education sector of most countries. One of the basic CDC prevention guidelines is the implementation of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to protect the health of students and staff members to curve the spread of COVID-19. The current study aimed to examine the knowledge, perceptions, attitudes, and practices of students at the Namibia University of Technology toward the COVID-19 pandemic. A cross-sectional descriptive survey was conducted using a closed-ended questionnaire. Data were collected from full-time students who were on campus during the COVID-19 pandemic between 29 January to 14 February 2021. The average knowledge about the modes of transmission, protective measures, and clinical symptoms ranged from 78% to 96%. About 31% of student respondents believed the virus was created in a laboratory, and 47% believed the vaccine has negative side effects and therefore, refused to take it. The three main sources of information about COVID-19 were social media (75%), television (63%), and friends and family (50%). The students had an overall positive attitude towards the implementation of NPIs. However, the importance of vaccine safety must be emphasized. Lockdowns should be lifted gradually to reduce the amount of time students are spending on online content. Reopening of classrooms for face-to-face study will bring unquestionable benefits to students and the wider economy. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - In recent years, the Hooded crow (Corvus cornix) has become one of the most successful wild bird species in urban environments across Europe. Hooded crows can cause several problems in cities, including trash scattering, noise disturbance, and aggressive behavior toward humans or pets, and they can be potential vectors of pathogens. To find effective solutions, the public has to be involved in the decision-making process in urban planning management, managed by the city administration. In this study, we surveyed the attitude of people in Hungary towards crows and crow management by collecting information using an online questionnaire containing 65 questions published in 14 Facebook groups. We found that many people were familiar with corvid species and had personal experience with them. In most cases, these experiences were not negative, so the crows were not or only rarely perceived to cause problems to people, such as aggressive behavior, damage to cars or stealing something. Most respondents recognized that the presence of large numbers of hooded crows is a problem to be solved and acknowledged that they do not know how to resolve it. The majority of people expressed their interest in raising public awareness of crows but not in their management actions, which they believe should be implemented by experts. Most respondents preferred passive, harmless methods. More direct methods such as egg/chick removal from the nest, control by trapping, poisoned baits or firearms, or oral contraceptives were the least acceptable. These results express the difficulty in identifying a control method for managing hooded crow populations that is both acceptable to most people and effective at the same time. This study demonstrates the importance of involving public opinion in wildlife management and providing more information to citizens to reduce human-crow conflicts. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This article provides a deep dive into several recent cases of majoritarian hate speech and violence perpetrated against Muslims in India. We first provide an introduction to Hindutva as a social movement in India, followed by an examination of three case studies in which Islamophobic hate speech circulated on social media, as well as several instances of anti-Muslim violence. These case studies—the Delhi riots, the Love Jihad conspiracy theory, and anti-Muslim disinformation related to the COVID pandemic—show that Hindu nationalism in India codes the Muslim minority in the country as particularly dangerous and untrustworthy. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Arabic is one of the official languages recognized by the United Nations (UN) and is widely used in the middle east, and parts of Asia, Africa, and other countries. Social media activity currently dominates the textual communication on the Internet and potentially represents people’s views about specific issues. Opinion mining is an important task for understanding public opinion polarity towards an issue. Understanding public opinion leads to better decisions in many fields, such as public services and business. Language background plays a vital role in understanding opinion polarity. Variation is not only due to the vocabulary but also cultural background. The sentence is a time series signal; therefore, sequence gives a significant correlation to the meaning of the text. A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a variant of deep learning where the sequence is considered. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an implementation of RNN with a particular gate to keep or ignore specific word signals during a sequence of inputs. Text is unstructured data, and it cannot be processed further by a machine unless an algorithm transforms the representation into a readable machine learning format as a vector of numerical values. Transformation algorithms range from the Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) transform to advanced word embedding. Word embedding methods include GloVe, word2vec, BERT, and fastText. This research experimented with those algorithms to perform vector transformation of the Arabic text dataset. This study implements and compares the GloVe and fastText word embedding algorithms and long short-term memory (LSTM) implemented in single-, double-, and triple-layer architectures. Finally, this research compares their accuracy for opinion mining on an Arabic dataset. It evaluates the proposed algorithm with the ASAD dataset of 55,000 annotated tweets in three classes. The dataset was augmented to achieve equal proportions of positive, negative, and neutral classes. According to the evaluation results, the triple-layer LSTM with fastText word embedding achieved the best testing accuracy, at 90.9%, surpassing all other experimental scenarios. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - During the COVID-19 pandemic, television and social media informed and entertained people. This cross-sectional study among adolescents and young adults (n = 859, 71.94% female, Mage = 20.55, SDage = 4.59) examined the associations between pro- and anti-governmental (social) media and youth's violations of the lockdown measures following the prototype willingness model (PWM). Data were collected during Belgium's first and strictest lockdown. The results largely confirmed the applicability of the PWM in a public health context. Posting of and exposure to anti-governmental social media messages positively related to violations of the regulations via higher descriptive norm perceptions of peers violating the measures and positive attitudes towards violations. Pro-governmental media interactions (i.e., exposure to news media and pro-governmental social media messages) negatively related to violations via negative attitudes towards violations. No support emerged for the role of (televised) series, prototype favorability, or subjective norms in the PWM. Differences in posting versus exposure of social media messages were found. Posting generally related stronger to risk cognitions and behaviors compared to exposure. Gender and age moderated some of the examined relations in the PWM. Implications for media research and health campaigns are discussed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - U.S. media has extensively covered racial disparities in COVID-19 infections and deaths, which may ironically reduce public concern about COVID-19. In two preregistered studies (conducted in the fall of 2020), we examined whether perceptions of COVID-19 racial disparities predict White U.S. residents’ attitudes toward COVID-19. Utilizing a correlational design (N = 498), we found that those who perceived COVID-19 racial disparities to be greater reported reduced fear of COVID-19, which predicted reduced support for COVID-19 safety precautions. In Study 2, we manipulated exposure to information about COVID-19 racial disparities (N = 1,505). Reading about the persistent inequalities that produced COVID-19 racial disparities reduced fear of COVID-19, empathy for those vulnerable to COVID-19, and support for safety precautions. These findings suggest that publicizing racial health disparities has the potential to create a vicious cycle wherein raising awareness reduces support for the very policies that could protect public health and reduce disparities. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pervasive surveillance in modern society has raised mounting debates, which are largely concentrated on the ethical dimension and lack sociological examination. Drawing on innovative national survey data, this study analyzes public opinion about social credit systems, an emerging infrastructure that expands the depth and breadth of surveillance in China. I find a general high support for expanding surveillance and punishment yet key variations among different social groups. Counterintuitively, people with higher political capital do not wholly embrace the expanding surveillance and punishment. For example, Chinese Communist Party members are less likely to support state-centered social credit systems compared with the general public. Higher political trust in the regime and socioeconomic status is consistently correlated with higher support, while different media consumption showed limited correlations. This study proposes an alternative theorization of surveillance and enriches our understanding of the heterogeneity and dynamic of the state and public in the authoritarian regime. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Climate change can only be tackled with public support for sustainable policies. Thus, public attitudes towards climate change matter. More than 3 decades of climate change opinion (CCO) research—conducted by geographers, environmental psychologists, behavioural scientists, sociologists etc.—have provided us with a wealth of information about which predictors shape public CCOs. This review synthesises these findings and highlights the different geographies (the self, the nation, the region, the digital) that emerge within this research. Given the increased importance of social media, virtual geographies of climate change scepticism are increasingly being identified. Our paper argues that new research agendas must be developed to address the meshwork of virtual space and small scale geographies (regions, towns, districts) in which CCOs are formed. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - Extreme voices are frequently spotted to have a significant effect on public opinions on online forums or social media, but very little is known about when, what, and how to tone it towards softened and how to manage them. To deal with the large volume of extreme opinions, companies, and PR authorities spent heavily on soothing the tension and sheltering customer word-of-mouth from devasting reviews by feeding public overloaded information, dominating public attention and grabbing new headlines, yet very few studies rationalize this assumption. This paper develops simulation experiments to unmask the aforementioned relations, in particular, how information environment (i.e., information preference and noise), individual factors (i.e., acceptance threshold, halo effect), and institutional efforts (i.e., promotion) affect the customer review's evolution at the aggregate level. The findings suggest that the evolution of opinion in divergence can occur in any preference-held audience whereas the information noise can substantially moderate the information valence and cause the polarized voices to get mild dramatically. In addition, a halo effect on the information source can stir the voice to be amplified by the influencer. The experimental results indicate the significance of understanding information valence and group conformity in conversational contexts and find a few clues of improving communication effects. This research bears high originality in explaining how public opinions evolve in a belief-neutral environment via audience-sensitive, context-bound, objective-manipulated techniques. The findings suggest valuable meanings to review monitor and control in information management. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Background: There is continued scientific debate regarding the link between risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity and tobacco and cannabis use. The way this topic is presented in news media coverage may influence public attitudes and behavior and is thus an important topic of investigation. This study examines (1) the extent to which Israeli news media reported a positive (i.e., protective/therapeutic), negative (i.e., harmful), or inconclusive association between three types of substance use (tobacco, medical cannabis, recreational cannabis) and risk of COVID-19 infection and/or increased disease severity, and (2) the extent that this media coverage refers to scientific research. Methods: A quantitative content analysis of news articles related to tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 (N = 113) from eleven of the highest circulation newspapers in Israel. Results: News items were significantly more likely to mention increased COVID-19 risk for tobacco use, compared to cannabis use. All medical cannabis news items reported that medical cannabis use was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. In contrast, news items about recreational cannabis use were more likely to describe a balanced or inconclusive risk for COVID-19, or increased risk. The majority of articles referred to scientific research. Conclusion: While Israeli news media reported a relatively consistent message about the increased risk of COVID-19 in relation to tobacco use, messages about cannabis use were less consistent in communicating risk information. Research should examine effects of media coverage of tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 on public perceptions and behaviors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: Vaccination for COVID-19 is an effective method of preventing complications; however, studies suggest that public attitudes toward the vaccine are heterogeneous. The objective of our study was to identify predictors for low likelihood of COVID-19 vaccination among women in the United States and determine whether reasons for low intention were modified by race, ethnicity, or other characteristics to better understand the factors that shape attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccine and help inform multilevel interventions. Methods: In January 2021, we used social media to recruit a cross-section of reproductive-aged women in the United States (N = 5269). Our primary outcome was self-reported low vaccination likelihood (responses of unlikely or very unlikely on a 5-item scale). Our secondary outcome was concerns influencing vaccination decision that participants selected from a list of 19 items. We estimated multivariable logistic regression models and controlled for respondents’ sociodemographic characteristics. Results: Overall, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, health insurance type, annual household income, partnership status, and US region were associated with low vaccine likelihood. The adjusted odds of reporting low likelihood were 1.83 (95% CI, 1.45-2.32) times greater among non-Hispanic Black than among non-Hispanic White participants. Among pregnant or postpartum participants, breastfeeding status was the strongest predictor (adjusted odds ratio = 2.77; 95% CI, 2.02-3.79). Conclusions: Vaccine hesitancy and concerns may exacerbate existing COVID-19 health disparities in racial and ethnic groups and highlight the need to target messaging to specific populations, including pregnant and breastfeeding women, because these populations are at high risk for COVID-19 complications. © 2022, Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.

AB  - Consumer DNA products, such as databases that allow the public to explore familial relationships, have recently been used by police to assist in investigations. This has moved the collection of DNA used in criminal investigations away from the limitations of criminal databases and has opened up ethical concerns regarding privacy and consent. This study explored public attitudes and support towards police use of consumer DNA databases in investigations to assess whether different crime types or moral and attitude alignments influenced the level of public support of police using these consumer products. An international survey of 438 adults, using theory and scales pertaining specifically to retributive punishment and attitudes towards law, courts and police, found that moral alignment and attitudes did influence the level of public acceptability towards police usage of these techniques and that support did vary based on crime type. This research found that higher levels of public support was given for the most serious case types explored (sexual assault and homicide). Participant support for police access to private DNA databases by case type was as follows; 83.5% for sexual assault, 83.2% for homicide, 85.2% for identifying unidentified human remains, 62.8% for robbery and 58.9% for illicit drug related cases. Small to medium effects sizes were observed for these results. Although these findings provided context towards public attitudes, further research specific to international attitude differences and variance between serious crime types and public acceptability could further develop these findings. © 2022 The Chartered Society of Forensic Sciences

AB  - The outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has been ongoing for almost two years and has had an unprecedented impact on the daily lives of people around the world. More recently, the emergence of the Delta variant of COVID-19 has once again put the world at risk. Fortunately, many countries and companies have developed vaccines for the coronavirus. As of 23 August 2021, more than 20 vaccines have been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO), bringing light to people besieged by the pandemic. The global rollout of the COVID-19 vaccine has sparked much discussion on social media platforms, such as the effectiveness and safety of the vaccine. However, there has not been much systematic analysis of public opinion on the COVID-19 vaccine. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the discussions related to the COVID-19 vaccine on Twitter. We analyze the hot topics discussed by people and the corresponding emotional polarity from the perspective of countries and vaccine brands. The results show that most people trust the effectiveness of vaccines and are willing to get vaccinated. In contrast, negative tweets tended to be associated with news reports of post-vaccination deaths, vaccine shortages, and post-injection side effects. Overall, this study uses popular Natural Language Processing (NLP) technologies to mine people’s opinions on the COVID-19 vaccine on social media and objectively analyze and visualize them. Our findings can improve the readability of the confusing information on social media platforms and provide effective data support for the government and policy makers. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Negative emotional contagion along with sentiment mutation through information propagation on social media is critical for mitigating disinformation and directing public opinion for compliance with key public interventions, such as vaccine uptake during a pandemic. Here, we develop a dynamic multiple negative emotional susceptible-forwarding-immune (MNE-SFI) model to examine how negative emotion spreads on social media and how sentiment mutation impacts by fitting the model to real multiple temporal information in messages with sentiments obtained from the Chinese Sina microblog. Emotional choices, meaning that individuals attempting to spread information are not only influenced by the objective emotions embedded in the influential information spread by influencers but also by subjective emotional tendencies, is an essential human behavior for information propagation. Hence, we seek to link the negative emotional contagion in the network at the macroscopic level to the emotional choices of individuals, and model parameters are used at the microcosmic level to measure the “copying” and “mutation” probabilities of negative sentiments in an event. Our results illustrate the emotional choices of users play essential roles in methods for mitigating harmful emotion spread and promoting meaningful emotion diffusion. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Increased income inequality, and policies that can limit its further growth, are an important issue for citizens, politicians and the media. Numerous empirical studies have measured political support for redistributive policies by asking whether the government should equalize gaps between rich and poor. They try to discover whether ‘redistributive’ policies are supported by public opinion and are therefore politically feasible. This research note argues that the standard instrument measures diffuse support for more equality, but gives rather vague hints if this support is transformed into a political mandate for redistributive programmes. With regard to the way in which the political demand for state redistribution to reduce income inequality has been raised so far, methodological critique and innovation is largely lacking. This article therefore tests the validity of the standard item. It argues that the conventional measurement only captures a general ‘inclination’ towards the idea of equality. However, since the item phrasing is unspecific, other orientations confound the answers, so that ultimately the predictive power in terms of political behaviour is low. The standard item measures egalitarian preferences with inconsistence. This limits its reliability, so that hardly any conclusions can be drawn regarding voting for left parties or support for redistributive programmes. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The rapid urbanisation of China has increased public awareness of rising housing prices, particularly in large and medium-sized cities. The popularisation of the Internet in China has driven a shift in the public's attention to housing prices, moving from geographic space to cyberspace. Based on web search engine data using geotag, this paper attempts to create a better visualisation of the shift in the public's attention to housing prices from the perspectives of geographic space and cyberspace. Intercity interaction is also analysed in the context of cyberspace-based urban networks, through hybrid featured graphics. Specifically, data regarding public attention to housing prices are gathered (via queries data through Baidu Index) in 363 Chinese cities. The data are divided into a local city housing price attention index and an offsite city housing price attention index. Second, public attention flows are presented using origin-destination flows maps, chord diagrams and violin diagrams. These hybrid feature graphics show the interrelationship between cities and the complexity of public attention flows. This information will help us to reveal intercity interaction and the cyberspace-based urban network structure in China. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Feminist reflexivity aims to (re)consider and challenge power differentials that exist in the research process. This activity is well represented in, for example, research into heterosexism. In this article we expand feminist reflexive practice in relation to cisgenderism through a (re)examination of interview transcripts conducted by a cisgender researcher on the topic of cisgenderism in media representations of trans and intersex sportspeople. Drawing on interviews with 18 cisgender and trans and non-binary participants, we analyse three forms of researcher collusion in cisgenderism, namely: 1) perpetuating cisgenderism in the selection of media materials; 2) assuming trans women are the referent; and 3) disunifying assumptions about trans sportspeople. This reflexive analysis is discussed with regard to how analytical insights can be generated into the operation and functioning of prejudice. In so doing, we further the conception of prejudice as a ubiquitous and latent activity in research practices. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Due to its near-real-time crowdsourcing nature, social media demonstrates a great potential of rapidly reflecting public opinion during emergency events. However, systematic approaches are still desired to perceive public opinion in a rapid and reliable manner through social media. This research proposes two quantitative metrics - the fraction of event-related tweets (FET) and the net positive sentiment (NPS) - to examine the intensity and direction dimensions of public opinion. While FET is modeled through normalizing population size differences, NPS is modeled through a Bayesian-based method to incorporate uncertainty from social media information. To illustrate the feasibility and applicability of the proposed FET and NPS, we studied public opinion on society reopening amid COVID-19 for the entire United States and four individual states (i.e., California, New York, Texas, and Florida). The reflected trends of public opinion have been supported by the reopening policy timeline, the number of COVID-19 cases, and the economy characteristics. This research is expected to assist policy makers in obtaining a prompt understanding of public opinion from the intensity and direction dimensions, thereby facilitating timely and responsive policy making in emergency events. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - In the September 2020 issue of Perspectives, Scott et al. argued that there is insufficient empirical work on White parents’ racial-socialization strategies to support generalizations about the topic and, therefore, that journalists’ recommendation that White parents discuss race and racism with their children represents a case of speculation without evidence. Although we strongly support Scott et al.’s call for additional, rigorous research on racial socialization in White families, we argue that their critique of popular-press pieces was unwarranted. Specifically, we argue that, although definitive tests of the effects of specific White parental racial-socialization strategies are lacking, the recommendation for parents to discuss race and racism with their children is both appropriate and empirically grounded. We describe research on racial socialization, intergroup contact, and cognitive development that is consistent with recommendations from developmental scientists reported in the popular press. Furthermore, we argue that parents may be the ideal socializers of racial attitudes. We conclude with a discussion of the broad context concerning media reports of findings from psychological science. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Due to its rapid spread over social media and the societal threat of changing public opinion, fake news has gained massive attention. Users’ role in disseminating fake news has become inevitable with the increase in popularity of social media for daily news diet. People in social media actively participate in the creation and propagation of news, favoring the proliferation of fake news intentionally or unintentionally. Thus, it is necessary to identify the users who tend to share fake news to mitigate the rampant dissemination of fake news over social media. In this article, we perform a comprehensive analysis on two different datasets collected from Twitter and investigate the patterns of user characteristics in social media in the presence of misinformation. Specifically, we study the correlation between the user characteristics and their likelihood of being fake news spreaders and demonstrate the potential of the proposed features in identifying fake news spreaders. Our proposed approach achieves an average precision ranging between 0.80 and 0.99 on the considered datasets, consistently outperforming baseline models. Furthermore, we also show that the user personality traits, emotions, and writing style are strong predictors of fake news spreaders. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - This study explores the mechanisms of racial discrimination in U.S. independent filmmaking. To answer this question, I combine the theoretical toolkits on Hollywood discrimination and Bourdieu’s theory of cultural production. I employ in-depth, semi-structured interviews with 30 U.S.-based independent filmmakers of color, and observations of public discussions at film festivals in the greater Los Angeles area. I find that despite independent film’s inclusive and non-commercial discourses, many of the mechanisms of racial exclusion that underlie Hollywood’s lack of diversity also exist in independent film: the economic uncertainty of creative labor, racialized market logics, the economic stigmatization of artists of color, and the reliance on closed social networks for career advancement. Furthermore, I also find that non-commercial factors in the field of independent film also constrain the ability for filmmakers of color to make art reflective of their experiences, form mutually beneficial collaborations with other artists of color, or invest their time in projects that are culturally innovative. These findings suggest that even at the margins of mainstream cultural production, mechanisms of racialization can still operate where racial prejudice and racialized economics outweigh artistic independence. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - Objectives: Social media platforms such as Twitter allow people to openly express their views about many topics, including the nursing profession. COVID-19 is currently a frequently searched and discussed topics on Twitter. This study was performed to identify the image of nursing in the social media before and during COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, and to review of public perceptions about nurses’ communication on twitter in Turkey. Design: This study was conducted using content analysis with a sample of tweets posted on Twitter before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. Codes were created, including expressions of respect, anxiety, violence, gratefulness, anger, positivity, and negativity. Results: Findings showed that 35.65% of the 373 tweets posted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic were positive while 64.35% were negative. During the pandemic 91.94% of the 1006 tweets were positive and 8.06% were negative. Conclusion: The results of this study suggests that public opinion about nurses, as reflected on Twitter during the COVID 19 pandemic, was positive. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Social network sites (SNS) facilitate the expression of users opinions to a large audience. This research aimed to investigate whether the characteristics of this new media context strengthen the adaptation of opinions to the majority and lead to an internalization of the expressed views. Based on literature on public self-presentation and identity shifts, it was assumed that the publicness of and the identifiability within SNS elicit stronger expression effects than online forums or non-public settings. A between-subjects experiment (N = 302) varied the visible majority opinion on a news issue as well as the media context in which participants were asked to write down their opinion. Results showed significant adaptation effects to the majority (positive vs. negative comments) across media contexts. The internalization of attitudes was stronger in SNS groups with a more relevant audience but also occurred in other settings. Consequences for the formation of public opinion are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This research presents a thorough study of the strategies deployed for information dissemination on social networks. The strategies are modeled for identifying factors proving pivotal in influencing public opinions. The public is categorized into active and passive participants to discuss the study of these strategies for disseminating informational pieces such as images, sketches, text, and so on social networks, based on computer modeling of the social network structure alongside modeling of the behavior of network users. The objective of this research is to benchmark the proposed model on the effectiveness of information dissemination strategies that can be proposed to spread informational influences on social networks. As a rule, “Opinion Leaders” in the purpose network sectors are used to spread information on social media among the largest number of users in the least amount of time. Experiments have proved the effectiveness of the information dissemination model using “Opinion Leaders”, as well as the efficiency of the methods of information dissemination for different winning structural positions in a social network. Experiments have also confirmed the high effectiveness in attracting “Opinion Leaders” to the dissemination processes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article explores persuasive applications of humour in public diplomacy. I propose a new concept of strategic humour – the use of humour by state and proxy actors to promote instrumental interpretations of contested international events to foreign and domestic publics. Through strategic humour, states frame events in ways that advance their interests, deflect external criticism, and challenge narratives of other actors. In an entertaining form, strategic humour delivers a serious message that is simple, accessible, memorable, suited to the new media ecologies, and competitive in capturing news media and public attention. I focus on Russia as a state recently involved in a range of major controversies and demonstrate its use of strategic humour in three case studies. I argue that strategic humour is a fast-emerging, multi-format tool in public diplomacy, facilitated by the rise of social media and post-truth politics and less dependent on the state’s broader power resources. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article introduces the conceptual distinctions between “mediated” and “immediate” Islamophobia. “Mediated” Islamophobia refers to the fact that most people who express Islamophobic sentiment do not know (m)any Muslims and know little about Islam; their knowledge about Islam and Muslims, and any Islamophobic sentiment they may have, come from the exposure to traditional and/or social media. Given the documented Islamophobic bias of many “Western” media, “mediated” Islamophobia may be on the rise. On the other hand, research has shown that what we call “immediate” Islamophobia is less of a problem: People who know Muslims personally, live close to them and are better informed about Islam, are less likely to be Islamophobic. This article uses empirical data to contribute to the discussion of immediate, face-to-face experiences of residents in two Muslim-concentration areas in Melbourne, Australia, with a reference to the “contact theory.” We analyze residents’ perceptions of Muslims and Islam based on everyday encounters with their (Muslim) neighbors, and Muslims’ perceptions and direct experiences of Islamophobia. We use data collected through a survey and follow-up interviews to support our conceptual argument. © 2021 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - In the last few years, research studies and opinion pieces have tried to account for the new polarisation and dealignment of US politics after Trump and the post-Brexit UK politics. It is now well-established both by academic research and by Facebook’s own research that Facebook leads to more polarisation in its users’ political views, but rhetorical analysis has not yet accounted for the role played by algorithms in political communication and persuasion. What does social media do to rhetoric? The situation of speech in social media is often treated like in a public sphere when it should not be. This misconception prevents rhetorical studies to take into consideration the question of technology. By using the recent literature in critical algorithm studies, I develop a new approach in rhetorical criticism. I argue here that the increasing agency that algorithms have acquired in delivering and mediating rhetoric means that we must consider the role played by intermediaries when examining rhetorical situations. This paper sheds light on what I call the four conditionalities of algorithms on rhetoric: (1) programmed speech content, (2) the verticalisation of political communication, (3) the new biases produced by digital media, and (4) the rhetorical machine learning. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Aim: Media as a source of information can shape public opinion regarding the COVID-19 response. Identifying how and where people seek information during the COVID-19 outbreak is vital to convey the most effective message about managing the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this study was to determine the sources of information and investigate the role of various demographic factors—age, gender, educational attainment and perceived economic level—on sources of information. Subject and methods: An online survey (n = 4624) was conducted on Turkish public during the early stages of the COVID-19. Results: The results showed that internet journalism and social media were the most preferable sources of information. Higher age, educational attainment and economic level were related to higher levels of seeking information from TV, newspaper, internet journalism and informative meetings. Females obtained information more from their friends and family and social media than males. High school graduates or below watched more TV and obtained less information from internet journalism, while university graduates sought information from their families and friends, and postgraduates attended informative meetings and read newspapers. People with medium and high economic status, respectively, watched more TV and read more newspapers, while people with low socioeconomic status attended informative meetings less. Conclusion: In sum, this study provides evidence that a source of information might be influenced by demographic factors. Researchers and policymakers can use a source of information to develop crisis-response strategies by considering variations in the demographic factors. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Using Leonel Severo Rocha's pragmatic-systemic theory, the present work approaches society as communication. It was discoursed about the categories "communication", "mass media", "public opinion", and "protest movements". The respective categories of Luhmannian theory were applied taking into account the AIDS epidemic and the respective attribution of HIV virus contamination to homosexuality. In the first cases of the disease, the mass media used sensationalist information, causing misinformation about AIDS. Homosexuals who were already stigmatized by their own sexual orientation served as "scapegoats", and the disease for decades was called "gay cancer". © 2022, University of Passo Fundo.

AB  - This research probes the influence of the construction of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) on the tourism development behavior of local residents. By applying social exchange theory (SET), this study examines the impact of the community dimension on tourism development behavior through overall attitude. In addition, this study also examines the use of social media as a moderator in the relationship between overall attitude and tourism development. A survey tool has been used to obtain data from the people of Gilgit-Baltistan. Hypotheses were examined using the structural equation method (SEM) on 417 survey responses. The findings indicated community satisfaction and an overall positive attitude to the effects of development, although a negative attitude regarding concerns about community resources. Overall, attitude has a significant impact on tourism development behavior. Additionally, the use of social media strengthens the relationship between overall attitude and behavior that favors tourism development. Copyright © 2022 Shang, Pitafi and Rashid.

AB  - Objective: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has threatened the state's governance and public safety. This study investigates whether and how public participation can affect central government policy response to this pandemic in the context of China. Methods: This study constructs the theoretical framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New Media, and the central government response in this pandemic. Results: Findings show that the Chinese central government does not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the central government, public participation firstly creates “participation” with the authority of the media, forms public opinion, and then the prompt policy response from the central government. Conclusion: This study confirms that the central government will refer to public participation to decide the policy response. It also shows that the theory of government response applies to both the local government and the central government. Copyright © 2022 Fu, Sun and Xu.

AB  - In the field of social media, the systematic impact that bot users bring to the dissemination of public opinion has been a key concern of the research. To achieve more effective opinion management, it is important to understand how and why behavior differs between bot users and human users. The study compares the differences in behavioral characteristics and diffusion mechanisms between bot users and human users during public opinion dissemination, using public health emergencies as the research target, and further provides specific explanations for the differences. First, the study classified users with bot characteristics and human users by establishing the relevant formulas of user indicator characteristics. Secondly, the study used deep learning methods such as Top2Vec and BERT to extract topics and sentiments, and used social network analysis methods to construct network graphs and compare network attribute features. Finally, the study further compared the differences in information dissemination between posts published by bot users and human users through multi-factor ANOVA. It was found that there were significant differences in behavioral characteristics and diffusion mechanisms between bot users and human users. The findings can help guide the public to pay attention to topic shifting and promote the diffusion of positive emotions in social networks, which in turn can better achieve emergency management of emergencies and the maintenance of online orders.

AB  - Research shows that government-controlled media is an effective tool for authoritarian regimes to shape public opinion. Does government-controlled media remain effective when it is required to support changes in positions that autocrats take on issues? Existing theories do not provide a clear answer to this question, but we often observe authoritarian governments using government media to frame policies in new ways when significant changes in policy positions are required. By conducting an experiment that exposes respondents to government-controlled media - in the form of TV news segments - on issues where the regime substantially changed its policy positions, we find that by framing the same issue differently, government-controlled media moves respondents to adopt policy positions closer to the ones espoused by the regime regardless of individual predisposition. This result holds for domestic and foreign policy issues, for direct and composite measures of attitudes, and persists up to 48 hours after exposure. Copyright © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The stereotypical view of creativity as an emblem of youth, and old age as a signifier of decline can hold grave consequences for filmmakers in the second half of life, as this misconception can result in negative attitudes, a decline in media coverage, and less funding for film production. Thus, ageing male film directors might face a collisional intersection, when the gender-based status that provides social privileges, meets with older age-based status, which leads to social weakening. This qualitative study explored the means which male directors in the second half of life use to remain creative and make films in an ageist, vastly changing world. The study is based on a dataset of transcribed semi-structured interviews with 13 well-known Israeli male directors over the age of 55. The findings led to the formation of a model of creativity in older age, which consists of the following six pathways: inspiration, adaptation, innovation, preservation, circumvention and imagination. While some of the interviewed directors emphasized their ability to change and adapt to the new cinematic world, others adhered to their old filmmaking language. The understanding of the cinematic creation as based upon the art of storytelling was common among both “camps”. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Objectives To investigate public perspectives on brain health. Design Cross-sectional multilanguage online survey. Setting Lifebrain posted the survey on its website and social media and shared it with stakeholders. The survey was open from 4 June 2019 to 31 August 2020. Participants n=27 590 aged ≥18 years from 81 countries in five continents completed the survey. The respondents were predominantly women (71%), middle aged (41-60 years; 37%) or above (>60 years; 46%), highly educated (69%) and resided in Europe (98%). Main outcome measures Respondents' views were assessed regarding factors that may influence brain health, life periods considered important to look after the brain and diseases and disorders associated with the brain. We run exploratory linear models at a 99% level of significance to assess correlates of the outcome variables, adjusting for likely confounders in a targeted fashion. Results Of all significant effects, the respondents recognised the impact of lifestyle factors on brain health but had relatively less awareness of the role socioeconomic factors might play. Most respondents rated all life periods as important for the brain (95%-96%), although the prenatal period was ranked significantly lower (84%). Equally, women and highly educated respondents more often rated factors and life periods to be important for brain health. Ninety-nine per cent of respondents associated Alzheimer's disease and dementia with the brain. The respondents made a connection between mental health and the brain, and mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression were significantly more often considered to be associated with the brain than neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson's disease. Few respondents (<32%) associated cancer, hypertension, diabetes and arthritis with the brain. Conclusions Differences in perceptions of brain health were noted among specific segments of the population. Policies providing information about brain-friendly health behaviours and targeting people less likely to have relevant experience may be needed. © 2022 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

AB  - Purpose: Existing algorithms for predicting suicide risk rely solely on data from electronic health records, but such models could be improved through the incorporation of publicly available socioeconomic data – such as financial, legal, life event and sociodemographic data. The purpose of this study is to understand the complex ethical and privacy implications of incorporating sociodemographic data within the health context. This paper presents results from a survey exploring what the general public’s knowledge and concerns are about such publicly available data and the appropriateness of using it in suicide risk prediction algorithms. Design/methodology/approach: A survey was developed to measure public opinion about privacy concerns with using socioeconomic data across different contexts. This paper presented respondents with multiple vignettes that described scenarios situated in medical, private business and social media contexts, and asked participants to rate their level of concern over the context and what factor contributed most to their level of concern. Specific to suicide prediction, this paper presented respondents with various data attributes that could potentially be used in the context of a suicide risk algorithm and asked participants to rate how concerned they would be if each attribute was used for this purpose. Findings: The authors found considerable concern across the various contexts represented in their vignettes, with greatest concern in vignettes that focused on the use of personal information within the medical context. Specific to the question of incorporating socioeconomic data within suicide risk prediction models, the results of this study show a clear concern from all participants in data attributes related to income, crime and court records, and assets. Data about one’s household were also particularly concerns for the respondents, suggesting that even if one might be comfortable with their own being used for risk modeling, data about other household members is more problematic. Originality/value: Previous studies on the privacy concerns that arise when integrating data pertaining to various contexts of people’s lives into algorithmic and related computational models have approached these questions from individual contexts. This study differs in that it captured the variation in privacy concerns across multiple contexts. Also, this study specifically assessed the ethical concerns related to a suicide prediction model and determining people’s awareness of the publicness of select data attributes, as well as which of these data attributes generated the most concern in such a context. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this is the first study to pursue this question. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Citizen journalism practices through social networking sites are increasingly becoming an imperative source of public opinion formation. Given the increase in the volume of information sharing on social media during COVID-19, this study aims to grasp the largely unknown interaction of the individual’s trust in citizen journalism practices and public perception formulation. Drawing on this idea, the study has twofold objectives: first, to examine the influence of user-generated information about economic policies of government during COVID-19 as the antecedent of public perception about government performance and second, to identify the moderating role of trust in citizen journalism practices during COVID-19 through social networking sites. Design/methodology/approach: The study used a survey method and a sample of 464 adults were collected through an online administrated questionnaire. Findings: The findings specify that user-generated content that is pro-government economic policies during COVID-19 positively influenced the perception of government performance. On the other hand, user-generated information that criticized government economic policies had a negative influence on public perception. Originality/value: This study seeks to intensify the understudied phenomenon of how nature and source of the information could interact to influence one’s information processing during a crisis such as pandemic COVID-19. Furthermore, only a little research has been conducted in this area focusing on two mechanisms, namely; citizen journalism and trust in social media user-generated information about prevailing economic insecurities during crisis provided through citizen journalism. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Since the beginning of the 21st century, sentiment analysis has been one of the most active research fields in natural language processing. Now sentiment analysis technology has not only achieved significant results in academia, but also has been widely used in practice. From business services to political campaigns, sentiment analysis is used in more and more fields. Sentiment analysis is essentially to dig out the user’s emotional attitude from the massive emotional natural language text data, and analyze the emotional dynamics of the text author through certain technical means. At present, there is almost no sentiment analysis in cross-media writing content, and it can rarely help cross-media writing vision to advance with the times and comprehensive improvement of writing ability to adapt to the current rapidly developing information society; the commonly used text media in the digital age are not. Then there is the only composition tool. Various new media appearing with the development of the ages continue to intervene in writing, and it is the general trend to cultivate media literacy in writing. The main content of this paper is the research on the emotional intensity of students’ Internet public Aiming at the shortcomings of the topic feature word selection in the sentiment tendency analysis of the students’ Internet public opinion, improvements have been made to facilitate the research on the sentiment intensity of the sentiment analysis of the students’ Internet public opinion.

AB  - Background: Previous research has shown that young adults are more hesitant/resistant to COVID-19 vaccine uptake than older age groups, although the factors underlying this tendency are still under debate. The current study aimed to identify the sociodemographic and psychological correlates of vaccine hesitancy and resistance among young adults (18–40 years) during the nationwide COVID-19 vaccination campaign in Italy, the first country after China being hit by the pandemic and which suffered a large number of fatalities. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, web-based study conducted in Italy using an ISO-certified international survey company (respondi.com). Data were collected on 1200 participants in June 2021. Results: Vaccine hesitancy/resistance was found for 25% of the sample. In multinomial logistic regression (N = 1159), being aged 30–40 years, residing in northern Italy, having lower educational and income level, being unemployed, and not knowing any friends/relatives diagnosed with COVID-19 were associated with higher odds of hesitancy or resistance. In multivariate analysis of variance (N = 1177), both vaccine hesitant and resistant young adults perceived significantly less social support from friends and family than vaccine accepting ones. Resistant individuals reported significantly higher levels of conspiracy theories and negative attitudes toward vaccines than their accepting and hesitant counterparts. Moreover, resistant individuals reported significantly lower levels of attachment to country and perceptions of a just government compared to accepting ones, with hesitant young adults scoring in between. Conclusions: Our findings support the idea that young adults with a hesitant (vs. resistant) attitude show a more nuanced and less extreme psychological profile. Public health messaging should capitalize on social media to provide accessible, transparent, and age-appropriate information concerning COVID-19 vaccine safety. Moreover, policy efforts improving the availability of social support systems are warranted to strengthen connectedness and foster trust in institutions amongst this particular segment of the population. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Unlike the biomedical account of illness, cultural/social/literary models investigate the central role of culture in mediating the lived experiences of the sufferers. As such, the meaning of illness is not shaped by biomedical factors alone, cultural artefacts also determine the social meanings of illness and suffering. Put differently, popular cultural media such as films, novels, television, and advertisements among others collectively generate and shape public attitudes toward illness. However, popular cultural media very often promote the prevailing stereotypes and normative concepts of illness and thus negatively contribute to the understanding of illness conditions. Along these lines, existing cultural and literary discourses on Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD) trivialize dementia and dehumanize the sufferers of dementia as zombies, empty shells, and non-persons. Taking these cues, the present paper close reads popular representations of dementia in movies, newspapers, novels, and comics in order to demonstrate how such representations of ADRD reinforce dominant stereotypes and even sustain them. Furthermore, the paper also investigates the negative implications of such representations in the context of illness and ADRD on personal and social lives. © 2022 Aesthetics Media Services.

AB  - The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 is the most comprehensive reform of American finance since the Great Depression and an ideal case to study how public opinion can counter the political power of finance. This article shows how pivotal congressional hearings created a clear story line for American media, one built around the way in which the investment bank Goldman Sachs made money during the crisis. We demonstrate that Goldman and CEO Lloyd Blankfein became the face of finance during these hearings. Results from a 2016 online survey experiment enable us to examine whether media portrayals highlighting the personal attributes of Blankfein and Goldman's deal-making activate public opinion differently than articles foregrounding conflict of interest regulation and Goldman. Compared to the control condition, focus on Blankfein as the face of banking triggers negative affective response, greater appetite for regulating markets and greater attribution of blame toward banks for the financial crisis. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Political polarization has dominated news coverage of Americans’ responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. In this research note, we report findings from two experimental studies, in which we present respondents with news stories about COVID-19 mitigation measures that emphasize partisan difference or accord. The stories present the same numeric facts about public opinion, but highlight either the partisan gap that existed at the time of the study, or the fact that large majorities of both Republicans and Democrats supported the measures at the time. Results from our first study, conducted late April 2020, show that a media frame drawing attention to shared concern across party lines produced a less polarized response to social-distancing restrictions than a frame that drew attention to partisan difference. Our findings suggest that the extensive media coverage about the red-blue divide in COVID-19 opinions reinforced partisan polarization. These results, however, did not replicate in a second study conducted much later in the pandemic. Qualitative data collected across the two studies demonstrate the degree to which polarization had rapidly become a dominant narrative in Americans’ thinking about COVID-19. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: The acceptance and availability of effective vaccines are crucial for the success of vaccination programs. Medical doctors and students are the epitome of shaping the public interest in vaccines. Aim: To evaluate the general public's attitudes, including dental students and health care professionals, at the national level towards COVID-19 vaccines and explore the potential drivers for students' acceptance levels. Methods: A national-level cross-sectional study was carried out in May-June 2021 using an online questionnaire. The sample was categorized based on age, gender, academic level, and location. The dependent variable was the willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine. The independent variables included demographic characteristics, COVID-19-related experience, and the drivers of the COVID-19 vaccine-related attitude suggested by the WHO SAGE. Results: The number of people who answered the questionnaire was 1271. The males accounted for 38.9%, and females were 61.1%. The age group, 18-45 years with 14.7%, has the highest percentage of people who have not taken vaccination. In context to gender, 13.5% of males and 13.1% of females have not taken vaccination. The percentage of vaccination hesitancy is highest in rural areas with 19.5%. The health care professionals were vaccinated with the highest percentage of 89.8%. Conclusion: The vaccination acceptance level of the population for COVID-19 vaccines was good, approximately 63%, and their worrisome level of vaccine hesitancy 27% was governed by demographic, social, and economic factors. The media and social media, public figures, insufficient knowledge about vaccines, and mistrust of governments and the pharmaceutical industry were major hurdles to vaccination. © 2022 Journal of Indian Academy of Oral Medicine & Radiology.

AB  - Even though the independence referendum held in 2017 in Catalonia was unsuccessful, 1the large role of the media together with easy, fast international broadcasting and the fear of a possible mimic effect in other regions made the entire world observe and discuss the event. The purpose of this article is to analyse the media coverage of the referendum in two benchmark British newspapers, The Guardian and The Telegraph. Based on hypotheses that the news coverage regarding the Catalonian referendum might be prone to the dissemination of information according to the editorial position of the newspapers, this research has analysed 188 news pieces by using framing analysis. The first hypothesis, that both newspapers adapted their versions of the story to readers according to the predisposition of the different editorial trends of each newspaper, was not confirmed. The results allow us to conclude that in the news of the benchmark British press regarding the illegal referendum in Catalonia, fair journalistic coverage prevailed. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article.

AB  - Objective/Context: In the hybrid media system, Twitter users can propose alternative framings to those defined by media. In the context of the 2019 social protest in Ecuador, the framing confrontation was organized around hashtag #cacerolazo: different frames interpreted differently the meaning of the protest designated with this name. Methodology: The study analyzed 119,756 tweets containing trending hashtags related to the protest. The most frequent terms were analyzed, and it was observed that the word “cacerolazo” was framed and organized into three groups according to its context: 1) opposition to the government, which was the most popular; 2) support for the government, and 3) neutral. The framing defined by digital media for the same word was examined and categorized into groups for comparison; this allowed disambiguating the meaning of the word “cacerolazo” in the tweets. As a result, 67% of the tweets with the hashtag were in group 1 (opposition to the government). Thus, it was determined that, for the community considered in this study, the act of performing a cacerolazo retains its meaning of protest and it is not a call for peace. Conclusions: The framing of hashtag #cacerolazo was mostly promoted by users whose publications were against the government, and it quoted and criticized the framing established by the media. Originality: The word2vec model was used, which is an automated methodology that helps identify different frames defined by social media users during a certain event. © 2022 Universidad de los Andes, Bogota Colombia.

AB  - Based on the study of open TV news that covered the trials of former presidents of Colombia (Uribe) and Brazil (Lula), the article explores some of the editorial choices made by the two main news broadcasts in these countries (Jornal Nacional, from Brazilian Globo and Noticias Caracol, from Colombian Caracol) and analyzes the impact of these choices in the construction of narratives aimed at producing effects on public opinion. Despite the growing role of digital media in the societies analyzed, we argue that the amount of time devoted to the subject by these newscasts and the rhetorical resources used in the presentation of the news reveals the intentionality to thematize the public debate, even dominating the repercussion in other media and forcing a homogenized narrative of these facts, contributing to the political polarization and the spread of hate speech in the different spheres of the social system. © 2022 Associacao Brasileira de Pesquisadores de Jornalismo.

AB  - This qualitative textual analysis used framing theory to compare 80 online arti-cles from Cable News Network (CNN) and British Broadcasting Company (BBC) dealing with the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting in New Zealand. The study examined themes of Islamophobia and White supremacy and the media representation of the White perpetrator who carried out the attack. The analysis over eight days following the shooting identified the most prominent frames used by both network, and how these frames were employed to serve a specific context. The study found that the attack was too shocking to the extent that BBC and CNN adopted a new non-classical narrative that was not typical of western news coverage of attacks committed by White perpetrators. This shift was represented by adopting frames of ‘terrorist’ and ‘terrorism’ and avoiding the frame of ‘mentally sick perpetrator’ that used to be prevalent in western media coverage of similar attacks. Both networks associated the perpetrator with White supremacy and engaging in a terrorist attack. While both CNN and BBC framed the shooting as a terrorist attack driven by Islamophobic sentiments, the terrorism framing was more obvious on CNN than on the BBC. The White supremacist motive was high-lighted by CNN, while the right-wing framing was central in the BBC coverage. © 2022 Intellect Ltd Article. English language.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in communicating with the public on social media during a global health emergency. More specifically, there is no study about the relationship between the agendas of the WHO and Twitter users during the COVID-19 pandemic. Objective: This study utilizes the network agenda-setting model to investigate the mutual relationship between the agenda of the WHO's official Twitter account and the agenda of 7.5 million of its Twitter followers regarding COVID-19. Methods: Content analysis was applied to 7090 tweets posted by the WHO on Twitter from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, to identify the topics of tweets. The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was used to investigate the relationship between the WHO agenda network and the agenda network of the 6 Twitter user categories, including “health care professionals,” “academics,” “politicians,” “print and electronic media,” “legal professionals,” and the “private sector.” Additionally, 98 Granger causality statistical tests were performed to determine which topic in the WHO agenda had an effect on the corresponding topic in each Twitter user category and vice versa. Results: Content analysis revealed 7 topics that reflect the WHO agenda related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including “prevention,” “solidarity,” “charity,” “teamwork,” “ill-effect,” “surveillance,” and “credibility.” Results of the QAP showed significant and strong correlations between the WHO agenda network and the agenda network of each Twitter user category. These results provide evidence that WHO had an overall effect on different types of Twitter users on the identified topics. For instance, the Granger causality tests indicated that the WHO tweets influenced politicians and print and electronic media about “surveillance.” The WHO tweets also influenced academics and the private sector about “credibility” and print and electronic media about “ill-effect.” Additionally, Twitter users affected some topics in the WHO. For instance, WHO followers affected “charity” and “prevention” in the WHO. Conclusions: This paper extends theorizing on agenda setting by providing empirical evidence that agenda-setting effects vary by topic and types of Twitter users. Although prior studies showed that network agenda setting is a “one-way” model, the novel findings of this research confirm a “2-way” or “multiway” effect of agenda setting on social media due to the interactions between the content creators and audiences. The WHO can determine which topics should be promoted on social media during different phases of a pandemic and collaborate with other public health gatekeepers to collectively make them salient in the public. © Iman Tahamtan, Devendra Potnis, Ehsan Mohammadi, Vandana Singh, Laura E Miller.

AB  - During presidential elections and showbusiness or social news events, society has begun to address the risk of fake news. The Sustainable Development Goals 4 for Global Education Agenda aims to “ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all” by 2030. As a result, various nations have deemed media literacy education a required competence in order for audiences to maintain a discerning attitude and to verify messages rather than automatically believing them. This study developed a highly efficient message discrimination method using new technology using artificial intelligence and big data information processing containing general news and content farm message data on approximately 938,000 articles. Deep neural network technology was used to create a news source credibility identification system. Media literacy was the core of the experimental course design. Two groups of participants used different methods to perform message discrimination. The results revealed that the system significantly expanded the participants’ knowledge of media literacy. The system positively affected the participants’ attitude, confidence, and motivation towards media literacy learning. This research provides a method of identifying fake news in order to ensure that audiences are not affected by fake messages, thereby helping to maintain a democratic society. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Nightlife is a controversial offer for its possible negative social impacts, but it is also important for its media impact and as an element of differentiation of the tourist destination. In the coastal resorts it is a very important offer as it complements the main offer. This paper seeks to determine the background of residents’ attitudes towards the offer of nightlife. To do this, the responses of a sample of 420 residents of the Maldonado-Punta del Este conurbation (Uruguay) who responded to a questionnaire with items measured with Likert scales are analyzed using Structural Equation Models. A first analysis, which presents costs and benefits of three types (economic, social and cultural) as a possible background of the degree of acceptance of this offer, did not detect significant relationships. In a second analysis, the mediation of the overall attitude towards tourism and the degree of acceptance of sun and beach tourism were proposed. In this second analysis it was found that: only economic benefits and cultural costs have significant effects on the overall attitude; the overall attitude has a significant effect on the acceptance of sun and beach tourism, but not on the acceptance of nightlife; and the acceptance of sun and beach tourism has a significant effect on the acceptance of nightlife. The acceptance of nightlife follows the same guidelines as its business development (it is a consequence of sun and beach tourism). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cryptocurrencies can be considered as mathematical money. As the most famous cryptocurrency, the Bitcoin price forecasting model is one of the popular mathematical models in financial technology because of its large price fluctuations and complexity. This paper proposes a novel ensemble deep learning model to predict Bitcoin’s next 30 min prices by using price data, technical indicators and sentiment indexes, which integrates two kinds of neural networks, long short-term memory (LSTM) and gate recurrent unit (GRU), with stacking ensemble technique to improve the accuracy of decision. Because of the real-time updates of comments on social media, this paper uses social media texts instead of news websites as the source data of public opinion. It is processed by linguistic statistical method to form the sentiment indexes. Meanwhile, as a financial market forecasting model, the model selects the technical indicators as input as well. Real data from September 2017 to January 2021 is used to train and evaluate the model. The experimental results show that the near-real time prediction has a better performance, with a mean absolute error (MAE) 88.74% better than the daily prediction. The purpose of this work is to explain our solution and show that the ensemble method has better performance and can better help investors in making the right investment decision than other traditional models. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The term political extremism is commonly used to refer to political attitudes considered to be outside the ideological mainstream. This study leverages computational content analysis of big data to longitudinally examine (1970–2019) the prevalence of terms denoting far-right and far-left political extremism in more than 30 million written news and opinion articles from 54 news media outlets popular in the United States and the United Kingdom. We find that the usage of terms denoting right and left political extremism has been increasing across news media outlets in both countries. This trend is particularly stark for far-right-denoting terms, which have been growing in prevalence since at least 2008. Most U.S. and U.K. news media outlets tend to use far-right-denoting terms substantially more often than they use far-left-denoting terms. The rising prevalence in news media of terms denoting political extremism is strongly correlated with similar growing usage of terms denoting prejudice and social justice discourse. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The influx of refugees to Europe is a topic that dominates the political and media agenda. Furthermore, the installation of asylum-seeker centres (ASCs) has made asylum seekers and refugees highly visible in the everyday life of many European citizens. Drawing on theories of ethnic threat and intergroup contact, we examine how geospatial proximity to ASCs translates into threat or contact in an everyday context and how this affects attitudes toward asylum seekers. By taking advantage of a natural experiment, where the ASCs are assigned to city districts as-if at random, as well as innovating measures of outgroup exposure and geospatial proximity, we find that, although higher numbers of asylum seekers in one's own neighbourhood are related to an increased perception of their local presence, the actual presence of asylum seekers does not lead to more negative attitudes or a greater threat perception, nor to more frequent contact. It is only when the number of asylum seekers in one's own direct neighbourhood suddenly increases that attitudes toward asylum seekers deteriorate. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - This article examines Kamila Shamsie's adaptation of Sophocles' Antigone in Home Fire (2017), a novel focused on Muslim identity, Islamophobia, and citizenship rights in contemporary Britain. It demonstrates that this novel is a multimedia work full of theatrical traces: A literary archive that preserves the dramatic quality of Sophocles' play but also encompasses multiple other forms of media and performance, from theatre and television to social media. The article focuses not so much on how Shamsie has adapted the plot of Antigone but on her reworking of tragedy's formal features or structures, such as dialogue, the chorus, and the messenger speech. In this polyphonic novel, such multimedia theatricality facilitates something that Greek tragedy itself produces: A contestation of multiple voices for audiences to hear, critique, and put against their own. Shamsie's manipulation of tragic form thus contributes to Home Fire's political import. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Opinion mining and sentiment analysis based on social media has been developed these years, especially with the popularity of social media and the development of machine learning. But in the community of nuclear engineering and technology, sentiment analysis is seldom studied, let alone the automatic analysis by using machine learning algorithms. This work concentrates on the public sentiment mining of nuclear energy in German-speaking countries based on the public comments of nuclear news in social media by using the automatic methodology, since compared with the news itself, the comments are closer to the public real opinions. The results showed that majority comments kept in neutral sentiment. 23% of comments were in positive tones, which were approximate 4 times those in negative tones. The concerning issues of the public are the innovative technology development, safety, nuclear waste, accidents and the cost of nuclear power. Decision tree, random forest and long short-Term memory networks (LSTM) are adopted for the automatic sentiment analysis. The results show that all of the proposed methods can be applied in practice to some extent. But as a deep learning algorithm, LSTM gets the highest accuracy approximately 85.6% with also the best robustness of all. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Often, global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, bring to light crucial weaknesses in political, economic, social and health systems. First, there are governments who formulate and implement policies and, second, there are the citizens who support them, thus contributing a great deal to their success. Our paper investigates the European citizens’ opinion on health policy, focusing on their preference for European health policy during the coronavirus pandemic. The paper uses bibliometric analysis, descriptive statistics, and logistic regression to discuss the public opinion on health policy, the factors of influence, the change in perspectives between 2020 and 2021, and the socio-demographic profile of those favorable for the development of a European health policy in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Our findings show that citizens from southern and central European countries are more likely to prioritize the development of a European health policy, as compared to Nordic countries. Between 2020 and 2021, pro-European health policy citizens profile changes and becomes clearer, from pensioners to young working age males with medium education. In general, people prioritizing a European health policy value health as the most important issue at a national level are generally satisfied with the European Union and do not trust their national government. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Thoughts travel faster and farther through cyberspace where people interact with one another regardless of limitations in language, space, and time. Is a poll sufficient to measure people’s opinions in this era of hyperconnectivity? This study introduces a deep learning method to measure online public opinion. By analyzing Korean texts from Twitter, this study generates time-series data on online sentiment toward the South Korean president, comparing it to traditional presidential approval to demonstrate the independence of the masses’ online discourse. The study tests different algorithms and deploys the model with high accuracy and advancement. The analysis suggests that online public opinion represents a unique population as opposed to offline surveys. The study model examines Korean texts generated by online users and automatically predicts their sentiments, which translate into group attitudes by aggregation. The research method can extend to other studies, including those on environmental and cultural issues, which have greater online presence. This provides opportunities to examine the influences of social phenomenon, benefiting individuals seeking to understand people in an online context. Moreover, it helps scholars in analyzing those public opinions—online or offline—that are more important in their decision making to assess the practicality of the methods. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - People's news diets are shaped by a diverse set of selection biases that may be unconscious in nature. This study investigates whether providing individuals with information about such unconscious biases attenuates selective exposure. More specifically, in two selective-exposure experiments among Dutch ingroup members focusing on ethnic (N = 286) and religious (N = 277) minorities, we expose individuals to their unconscious prejudices as measured by the Implicit Association Test (IAT) before documenting their news-selection patterns. Findings indicate that the effectiveness of this awareness-inducing strategy depends upon existing levels of implicit and explicit prejudice and overly expressed acceptance of the IAT scores. This implies that raising awareness of implicit prejudice works as an effective strategy for fighting biased news selection for some, but may backfire for others, and should therefore only be implemented with caution and attention for explicit considerations. © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The research on people–place relations makes an important contribution to the understanding of the public responses to renewable energy technologies (RETs). Social media not only provides easy access to the sentiments and attitudes of online users towards RETs, but social media content can also shape the discourse, both on-and offline, about RETs. Hence, social media content analysis provides valuable insights into the public responses to RETs. However, as of now, only a small number of studies have investigated people–place relations in the context of the energy transition via online content. To address this lack of knowledge, this study aims to increase the understanding of people–place relations by investigating the relationship between the place scales mentioined in Instagram posts (categorized from local to planet) and the sentiments that are expressed in said posts, depending on different energy infrastructures (solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, powerlines, and renewable energy in general). Our analysis of 1500 Instagram posts shows that the place scales that are mentioned in the Instagram posts are related to some differences in the post emotionality, and that these effects differ across the different hashtags that are related to RETs. By using a sociocog-nitive approach, this study is the first to investigate Instagram posts in the context of the energy transition and people–place relationships. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This paper examines the public relations battles in the US media over Mexico's Unión Nacional Sinarquista (UNS), an explicitly Catholic social movement founded in 1937 that aimed to restore the Church to its traditional role in Mexican society and to reject the reforms of the revolutionary government. The sinarquistas shared many of the features of fascism and Nazism, the major global antidemocratic movements of the time, including a strident nationalism, authoritarian leanings, an emphasis on martial discipline and strict organizational structure, and a militant aesthetic. Both its ideological leanings and rapid growth (as many as 500,000 members by the early 1940s) led many US writers to suggest that the UNS represented a dangerous fifth-column threat to both Mexico and the United States. Others, particularly in the Catholic press, saw the UNS as an anticommunist organization that could actually help foster democracy in Mexico. For their part, UNS leaders defended themselves vociferously and sought to build relationships with influential US Catholics who could advocate for them in the press. By analyzing this debate, this paper both underscores the transnational characteristics of the UNS and highlights the crucial role of US public opinion in Mexican politics during the 1940s. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Social networks have become increasingly popular lately, being a complementary method of expression and communication. With the adoption of quarantine and social distancing imposed by the authorities as measures to limit the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, society has used the opportunity offered by digital technology to continue its concern related to the protection and conservation of the environment, especially the forest. The purpose of this study was to highlight the public interest regarding the forests in the context of COVID-19, especially the extent to which public opinion expressed on social networks has determined public forest management policies. The results revealed a major interest in preserving biodiversity and forestry, in reducing legal logging and stopping illegal logging, and monitoring of timber shipments as measures to combat illegal logging. During the analyzed period (i.e., 1 February 2020 to 31 July 2020), several legislative acts were adopted that overlap with the requests and needs identified by environmental organizations, acts that address the issue of illegal logging, conservation, and protection of the forest, monitoring the traceability of wood. The legislation adopted in the analyzed timeframe and shortly after responded to several major topics related to the licensing and withdrawal of the logging license for illegal logging, amending the legislation for the conservation of biodiversity and the classification of areas with virgin forests as strictly protected forests. An IT system has also been implemented by the government environmental authority that allows the supervision of timber transport, offering the possibility of active involvement of civil society. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - International metropolises are key sites of outbreaks of COVID-19 cases. Global public evaluation of the pandemic in international cities is affected by many factors. This study examines how media exposure affects this evaluation and how media trust and media bias perception moderate the relationship between them. Based on an online survey of the evaluation of 13 international cities’ pandemic performances by 1171 citizens from 11 countries, this study conducted a multi-level stepwise regression analysis and discovered that: (1) different forms of media affect global citizens’ perceptions of international metropolis COVID-19 pandemic performance differently; and the role of traditional paper media, including newspapers and magazines, is of little significance in comparison to electronic media. (2) Among electronic media, TV and broadcasting have the greatest impact, followed by social media and the Internet. (3) Media trust and media bias perception affect people’s evaluations of international urban pandemics, but our survey reveals that they only function with regard to social media. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Many states have become concerned with Russian cyberattacks and online propaganda. The Ukrainian government responded to the information threat in 2017 by blocking access to several Russian websites, including VKontakte, one of the most popular social media websites in Ukraine. By exploiting a natural experiment in Ukraine, I find that the sudden censorship policy reduced activity on VKontakte, despite the fact that a vast majority of the users were legally and technically able to bypass the ban. Users with strong political and social affiliations to Russia were at least as likely to be affected by the ban as those with weak affiliations. I argue that the ease of access to online media—not political attitudes toward the state—was the main mechanism behind the users’ response to the ban. These findings suggest that this pragmatic view on the effects of censorship holds, even in the highly politicized military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, which later evolved into a full-scale Russian invasion. © 2022 Southern Political Science Association.

AB  - Introduction: Research has indicated a growing resistance to vaccines among U.S. conservatives and Republicans. Following past successes of the far-right in mainstreaming health misinformation, this study tracks almost two decades of vaccine discourse on the extremist, white nationalist (WN) online message-board Stormfront. We examine the argumentative repertoire around vaccines on the forum, and whether it assimilated to or challenged common arguments for and against vaccines, or extended it in ways unique to the racist WN agenda. Methods: We use a mixed-methods approach, combining unsupervised machine learning of 8892 posts including the term “vaccin*“, published on Stormfront between 2001 and 2017. We supplemented the computational analysis with a manual coding of randomly sampled 500 posts, evaluating the prevalence of pro- and anti-vaccine sentiment, previously identified pro- and anti-vaccine arguments, and WN-specific arguments. Results: Discourse was dynamic, increasing around specific events, such as outbreaks and following legal debates about vaccine mandates. We identified four themes: conspiracies, science, race and white innovation. The prominence of themes over time was relatively stable. Our manual coding identified levels of anti-vaccine sentiment that were much higher than found in the past on mainstream social media. Most anti-vaccine posts relied on common anti-vaccine tropes and not on WN conspiracy theories. Pro-vaccination posts, however, were supported by unique race-based arguments. Conclusion: We find a high volume of anti-vaccine sentiment among WN on Stormfront, but also identify unique pro-vaccine arguments that echo the group's racist ideology. Public health implication: As with past health-related conspiracy theories, high levels of anti-vaccine sentiment in online far-right sociotechnical information systems could threaten public health, especially if it ‘spills-over’ to mainstream media. Many pro-vaccine arguments on the forum relied on racist, WN reasoning, thus preventing the authors from recommending the use of these unethical arguments in future public health communications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the West, Islam has been historically ‘othered’ as a religion and frequently linked to negative media representation, terrorism, and fundamentalism. As the aftermath of 9/11 witnessed a global rise in anti-Muslim rhetoric and action, there was a parallel increase in academic research on the Muslim community, including adults, youth, and children. In this paper, a systematic literature review was undertaken to explore how empirical studies over the last two decades have investigated experiences of growing up as young Muslims in an age of Islamophobia. Based on objective inclusion and exclusion criteria, pertinent databases were searched for research with contextual, temporal, topical relevance. NVivo Plus software was used for content-coding, quantitative processing, and qualitative thematic analyses of data. A rigorous screening process resulted in the identification, compilation, and methodical review of 87 journal articles, between 2001 - 2021, on the topic ‘Islamophobia and Young Muslims.’ The descriptive analysis represented that there has been a substantial increase in empirical studies on young Muslims in the last five years, particularly in the field of educational studies. A majority of these studies covered experiences of adolescent Muslims, between 13-20 years, residing in western countries like U.K., U.S.A., and Australia. Qualitative research designs were frequently employed, with a sample size of >50 participants. Through the word-count frequency output of NVivo, four meaningful and recurrent themes of ‘Islamophobia’, ‘Identity’, ‘School’, and ‘Women’ were derived. Content analysis of these themes revealed that studies widely researched on diverse interpretations of Islamophobia in the lives of young Muslims, identity negotiation strategies adopted by Muslim minority youth, school-based religious bullying, and gendered facets of Islamophobia. Research gaps showed a requirement for studies that capture heterogeneous narratives of Muslim youth in non-western countries and early childhood settings. Future research recommendations are of a unique child or youth-based theoretical conceptualization of Islamophobia, that particularly highlights youth perspectives of their own lived realities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - While scholars have long recognized that social networks impact political engagement for partisans, comparatively little work has examined the role of networks for independent voters. In this article, we contribute to existing research on social networks and politics by surveying Arizona registered voters about their political persuasion, personal networks, and media consumption habits. Our findings show that independents have networks that are structurally different from partisans. Specifically, we found that both Democrat and Republican respondents were more likely to frequently talk about politics with independents than with members of the opposing party. Independents were also less likely than partisans to end a friendship over a political dispute. Taken together these findings show that independents may be frequent and reliable discussion partners for partisans and may be able to moderate political views. We find evidence for the moderating force of independents is especially apparent in the media consumption habits of Republican respondents.

AB  - Talking about politics with others or voicing your political views in public is a commonplace aspect of everyday life. In particular, after the U.S. presidential election in 2020, media sources highlighted the detrimental effects of political conversation at work on employee well-being and morale. Nevertheless, little academic research has sought to examine political interactions at work and their effects on employees' well-being and work outcomes. Integrating the concept of self-regulation with the coping model of stress, in this study we examine the costs of political conversations initiated by either supervisors or coworkers for employees' helping and withdrawal behaviors. We used an experience sampling method to collect two weekly surveys from 166 full-time workers from South Korea for 6 weeks (n = 823). Our multilevel path analysis found that during weeks when employees had more political conversations at work, they had higher levels of resource depletion, which in turn was linked to fewer helping behaviors and more withdrawal behaviors. Importantly, individuals' geographic region and political identity management (i.e., their preferences for openly talking about their political identity) moderated the indirect effects of political conversations on behavioral outcomes via increased resource depletion. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Community conflict is increasingly associated with commercial uses of the marine environment. This research investigates the evolution of newspaper coverage of finfish aquaculture over a 25-year period and how it has reflected growing levels of community conflict common to much of the world's salmon aquaculture production. A detailed case study suggests that by actively constraining debate to positive associations throughout the introduction and early growth stage of the industry lifecycle, companies and regulating agencies may have inadvertently: (i) eroded public trust by contributing to reader ambiguity and uncertainty relating to industry's environmental credentials and publicised partnerships with transnational environmental groups; (ii) failed to promote an open dialogue and a more informed community regarding the real benefits and risks of production; and (iii) created a situation in which negative influences on public opinion post-turning point were magnified. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates disparities in the portrayals of US and China images across ethnic media, homeland media, and host media that are serving the Chinese migrants in the United States. A quantitative content analysis of 156 news articles was conducted. Results reveal that ethnic media share more similarities with homeland media than with host media, which adds empirical explanations to ethnic and homeland media’s commonalities in retaining migrants’ ethnic identity. This also signals a pervasive impact of homeland news organizations on overseas ethnic media – although ethnic media are registered by US citizens or permanent citizens in America, they are actually owned or operated by Chinese news companies. As a result, ethnic media may have followed the same journalistic practices as their counterpart agencies from China. Implications of these findings for public opinion are also discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Background: Health information seeking is critical to medical decision-making and optimal health. Although researchers have begun to explore how people with disabilities search for health information, no studies have investigated health information seeking by women with physical disabilities. Objective: The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the health information seeking experiences of women with physical disabilities. Method: We conducted a series of semi-structured, online focus group meetings with 21 women with disabilities. Sessions were recorded and transcribed, and data were analyzed using conventional content analysis. Results: Two broad themes emerged: 1) pathways to information on general health; sexual and reproductive health; as well as bowel, bladder, and other pelvic health issues; and 2) perceived facilitators and barriers to obtaining health information. Information pathways differed by the type of information sought. Internet was a commonly used resource, with a high value placed on social media interaction among peers. Self-advocacy emerged as a prominent facilitator of health information seeking. Barriers identified were lack of disability-related education, limited accessibility, and providers’ negative attitudes. Conclusion: This is the first known in-depth qualitative exploration of health information seeking by women with disabilities. Study findings revealed pathways to information commonly used by women with disabilities. The study also identified notable gaps and challenges to health information seeking including the need for improved provider education and training. Findings highlight the importance of the availability and accessibility of high quality, health-related information essential for the health and well-being of women with disabilities. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Within the past decade, social media has become a primary platform for consumption of information and current events. Unlike with traditional news sources, however, social media posts do not have to go through a rigorous validation process prior to publication. The 2019 Mueller Report illustrates how malicious actors have taken advantage of these lax requirements to sway public opinion on topics from the #blacklivesmatter movement to the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Currently, social media companies rely primarily on communal-policing of misinformation; it is unlikely that this will happen with regularity. To counteract this, other literature on the topic is focused on using deep learning models to separate accurate from misleading content; however, the rapidly evolving nature of misinformation means that they will have to be retrained and redeployed on an iterative and time-consuming basis. This work, therefore, proposes a novel approach to the problem: treating misinformation as a virus. Specifically, we propose a ranking system that third-party fact checkers can utilize to prioritize posts for checking. This algorithm is then tested against multiple data sets with strong positive results, decreasing viral spread in a matter of minutes. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The cyber army in manipulating public opinion has become a hot foresight issue. The operating procedure and details of how cyber armies influence people’s thoughts are not clarified. Our research model combines computational algorithms and statistical methods from comprehensive and microscope dimension to analyze embedding operation systems and their influence of a specific manipulating group recognized by Taiwan judicial departments. Research shows that this group’s working type is well-trained with a sophisticated work division, and the cyber army’s influence is demonstrated by the speed with which the cyber army’s comments appear, rather than on a bias that the cyber army only manipulates other people’s stances and support specific stance to influence people’s thoughts. This study’s findings will serve as the foundation for future research on social media manipulation, allowing future studies to be more efficient. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - From the Rwandan genocide to the Arab Spring movement, it has been well known that social networks, offline or online, and mass media can collectively change and amplify public opinions, however there are few theoretical models to characterize the persuasion process. In this paper, we propose an opinion dynamics model based on invasion process with media effect and committed agents, and analytically obtain the fraction of each opinion at the steady state. We find that the relative proportion of committed agents plays a vital role in influencing corresponding opinion formation, and social networks can enhance the influence of committed agents through the interaction between individuals. Mass media can affect individuals not only directly due to exposure but indirectly due to social interactions. This paper reveals the influence of mass media and committed agents on the final distribution of opinions through a persuasion process, and lays the foundation for building more general models that consider individual heterogeneity and external influences. © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - This study investigates stereotypical portrayals of lesbians, gays, and bisexuals (LGBs) on Dutch television and whether these portrayals relate to people’s attitudes towards LGBs. Previous research shows that television programs in the U.S. contain many stereotypical portrayals of LGBs. These portrayals are both negatively and positively related to people’s attitude towards LGBs. Because the Dutch culture is relatively accepting of LGBs it is interesting to see if they are portrayed differently than in the U.S. A content analysis showed that there are stereotypical representations on Dutch television but there are also people who ‘just happen to be gay’. A survey among 272 participants showed that people who more frequently watch programs with stereotypical portrayals of LGBs do not have a more positive or negative attitude than people who do not. A mediation analysis showed that people who watch more television in general have a more stereotypical view of gay men, which is related to more negative attitudes towards LGBs. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: The attitudes of healthcare workers toward COVID-19 vaccines ensure that health services are able to run without interruption and potentially have a role in the messaging about vaccination that they convey to the public. Hence, healthcare workers’ attitudes ultimately have a significant role in controlling the pandemic. This study aimed to qualitatively investigate the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey in relation to COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: The study used the phenomenological approach. The sample consisted of 36 healthcare workers who were employed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected online using focus group interviews. A total of four focus group interviews were conducted. Findings: Following analysis of the data, the attitudes of healthcare workers in Turkey toward the COVID-19 vaccine were divided into three themes: “influencing factors,” “priority group” and “trust.”. Conclusions: Vaccination was found to create negative emotions among some of the healthcare workers. Their opinions about the COVID-19 vaccines were affected by the negative emotions and burnout they experienced during the pandemic. In addition, they saw the vaccination process as impacted by contraindications and uncertainty about the duration of the protection, the balance of the benefits and harm of the vaccines, and by vaccine myths and prejudices about the country where the vaccine was developed. Healthcare professionals expressed the need for trust to be established in the whole vaccination process. They suggested that different vaccine options should be offered, that the appointment and process notification system for vaccination should be improved, that evidence-based information about vaccines should be provided and that a safe environment should be created. Practice Implications: Vaccine hesitancy can be addressed by careful attention to the application of vaccination programs, correct and effective use of social media, transparent, and precise management of political processes, and the provision of evidence-based information about the vaccines. © 2021 NANDA International, Inc.

AB  - Background: Many women internalize negative attitudes regarding body shape and size because of the societal standards for women’s ideal body shapes and sizes. Internalized weight stigma is related to poorer physical and psychological health. A growing body of research has documented the links between other forms of internalized stigma (e.g., HIV-stigma) and poor sleep quality; however, little research examines the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep or the mechanisms that explain this relationship. Internalized weight stigma may be associated with poor sleep through increases in psychological distress. This study hypothesized that the links between internalized weight stigma and sleep would be mediated by higher levels of depression and anxiety. Methods: About 257 women were recruited via social media, word of mouth, and an undergraduate participant pool. Participants completed an online survey assessing various aspects of weight stigma and health through self-report questionnaires. Most women were non-Hispanic White (86.8%) and had a mean age of 31.40. Results: The indirect effects of internalized weight stigma on poorer global sleep quality and daily disturbances through depression and anxiety were significant. In contrast, depressive symptoms but not anxiety explained the links between internalized weight stigma and perceived sleep quality and neither depressive symptoms nor anxiety explained the link between internalized weight stigma and sleep efficiency. Conclusions: Internalized weight stigma is linked to poorer sleep quality, and these links may be explained by psychological well-being. Understanding the mechanisms by which internalized weight stigma is associated with sleep quality can inform the psychological interventions employed. © 2021, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.

AB  - Based on a two-dimensional valence-arousal sentiment evaluation method, we used the sentiment extracted from the text of online news media and stock forums to predict future financial performance of publicly listed companies. A Chinese lexicon called the Chinese Valence-Arousal Words, provided by Yu et al. (2016), was used to obtain the valence and arousal scores of all Web text for each of the 183 large listed companies for each fiscal quarter over the Q1 2013 through Q3 2017 period. Our empirical results tended to support our two hypotheses that there is a positive association between the valence (under Hypothesis 1) or arousal-augmented valence (under Hypothesis 2) of online public opinion about the listed companies and their future financial performance. In particular, when the sentiment was positive (negative) in the current fiscal quarter, whether measured by the valence alone or by the arousal-augmented valence, the financial performance (measured by ROA, ROE, and Tobin’s Q) observed in the next quarter would tend to be better (worse). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Under the authoritarian regime, earlier iterations of Vietnam’s public diplomacy (PD), especially during wartime, reassembled propaganda and psychological warfare. But thanks to Doi Moi (i.e. “renovation”) in 1986, new understandings of PD were made possible with a revamped foreign policy of multi-lateralisation and diversification. This article argues that information and communications technologies (ICTs), especially the internet and social media, have further transformed the practice of Vietnamese PD. Focusing on the period from 1997 when the internet was introduced in Vietnam, this article first provides a general analysis of the influence of ICTs on Vietnam’s politics. It then delves into how ICTs have transformed Vietnam’s PD. The key takeaway is that the internet and social media have significantly empowered public opinion in foreign policy, giving rise to cross-border cyber communities that can play the roles of both recipient and practitioner of PD. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The emergence of anti-immigration parties in mature democracies has triggered various reactions. These reactions, including stigmatization of these parties and prosecution of their members for hate speech, may have unintended consequences. What are the effects of these responses on the electoral support for these parties? Using an experimental approach, we confront a sample representative of the Dutch electorate with one of six versions of a manipulated news video about a new anti-immigration party. We find that stigmatization of the party reduces the propensity to vote for that party, and even more so if it is mentioned that a prominent member is prosecuted for hate speech than if not. Either way, the effect is moderated by anti-immigrant attitude and mediated by the party’s perceived legitimacy. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Objectives: Increasing dentists’ visibility in the media to make the case for sugary beverage taxes can help advance public policy that improves oral health outcomes. We assessed California dentists’ media engagement behaviors related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention and correlates of engaging in such behavior. Methods: Survey items related to sugar policies and media engagement were embedded in an electronically distributed statewide survey of dentists’ tobacco cessation counseling behaviors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent characteristics, perceived professional responsibility to discuss selected topics with patients, and attitudes and behaviors related to sugar restriction policy and media communication. Multivariable models identified independent correlates of media engagement. Results: Of 624 respondents, most had never talked to traditional media (78%) or posted to social media (64%) about sugar or sugar policies for dental caries prevention. Respondents with the highest level of media engagement were more likely to agree that sugary beverage taxes are effective at reducing dental caries, that they had support from dental professional organizations to talk to the media, that it is realistic for patients to reduce their sugar consumption, and that sugar and sugary drinks are extremely harmful to health. Conclusions: Efforts to increase dentists’ media engagement related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention should address dentists’ negative attitudes toward the effectiveness of sugar restriction policies and may require increased support from dental professional societies. Knowledge Transfer Statement: Study findings identify dentists’ low engagement in media advocacy to support sugar restriction policy adoption. The results identify correlates of media engagement and of dentists’ willingness and confidence to act, which could serve to inform interventions to support and enhance engagement. © International & American Associations for Dental Research 2021.

AB  - This study uses cluster analysis on a sample of regular cyclists from six European countries (the U.K., the Netherlands, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, and Spain) to shed light on common cycling patterns, demographic characteristics, and attitudes. Participants completed an online survey on cycling behaviour, attitudes towards cycling, discomfort while cycling in mixed traffic, cycling environment and comparative cycling risk perception. A two-step cluster analysis was performed to identify segments of cyclists based on cycling patterns, and a multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to profile the segments. The two-step cluster analysis yielded three components. Leisure-time cyclists cycled almost exclusively for leisure/training, had a clear preference for car use relative to bicycle, and low riding frequency. Resolute Cyclists were characterised by a high variety of cycling trip purpose, a clear preference for bicycle use relative to the car, and high riding frequency. Convenience Cyclists were characterised by cycling for personal business or leisure/training but not for commuting, no evident preference for bicycle vs car, and medium riding frequency. The value of the present study is to highlight commonalities in patterns, characteristics, and attitudes of cyclists in Europe. Our study showed that cycling patterns and habits are linked to psychosocial variables such as attitudes and the cycling environment, explicitly highlighting the importance of discomfort in mixed traffic and the relationship with cycling culture. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This study empirically investigates the dismissal of U.S. CEOs following negative media coverage of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices. Extending related literature on the media, ESG, and CEO dismissal, I develop a theoretical framework that considers the media as an influential third party that forms and reflects public opinion about ESG issues. In this role, the media reduces information asymmetry by providing cues on their relative salience and prompting corporate directors to attribute firm-level ESG issues to the CEO, regardless of their involvement in the misconduct. Findings confirm this framework and particularly suggest that coverage of issues in prominent media sources is more likely to result in CEO dismissal. Further, companies that have made public commitments to ESG oversight and those with stronger monitoring are more likely to dismiss the CEO following negative coverage of ESG issues. Overall, this study builds an understanding of how contemporary boards approach the uncertain CEO dismissal decision amidst media coverage of ESG- related misconduct and reflects a shifting norm towards ESG integration at the board-level. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Twitter has become a fertile place for rumors, as information can spread to a large number of people immediately. Rumors can mislead public opinion, weaken social order, decrease the legitimacy of government, and lead to a significant threat to social stability. Therefore, timely detection and debunking rumor are urgently needed. In this work, we proposed an Attention-based Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) network that uses tweet text with thirteen different linguistic and user features to distinguish rumor and non-rumor tweets. The performance of the proposed Attention-based LSTM model is compared with several conventional machine and deep learning models. The proposed Attention-based LSTM model achieved an F1-score of 0.88 in classifying rumor and non-rumor tweets, which is better than the state-of-the-art results. The proposed system can reduce the impact of rumors on society and weaken the loss of life, money, and build the firm trust of users with social media platforms. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - This study explores how televised football in Poland serves as a site for the (re)construction of discourses surrounding race and ethnicity and to what extent this squares with previous studies on sport media conducted mainly in Western countries. In our analysis, we identify the discourses surrounding race and ethnicity that the commentators in televised football draw on and examine how they relate to hegemonic discourses and categorizations in wider Polish society. Our findings show that Polish football commentators draw on transnationally circulating racialized/ethnicized discourses on assumed superior physicality when talking about Black football players and on supposed negative psychological capabilities when talking about White Southern European football players. The findings also show that when talking about non-Polish players and head coaches, the commentators regularly rely on an us-versus-them frame that constructs foreign influences as a threat. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Vox pops, interviews with ordinary people on the street, are one of the most common ways to represent public opinion in television news. Research found that they influence audience judgments more than static base-rate information such as poll results. However, little research has compared vox pops with vivified base-rate information. Most research studying vox pops assumed they are included in the news because of their apparent attractiveness and trustworthiness to audiences. Using a television news experiment comparing statistical base-rate information vivified by an expert with vox pop statements, this study shows that news items containing vox pop statements are perceived as being less attractive and trustworthy than items containing the expert statement. No difference is found between the two types of public opinion information in their influence on perceived public opinion, but vox pops do influence audiences' personal opinion more strongly. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Online social networks have been incorporated into people’s work and daily lives as social media and services continue to develop. Opinion leaders are social media activists who forward and filter messages in mass communication. Therefore, competent monitoring of opinion leaders may, to some extent, influence the spread and growth of public opinion. Most traditional opinion leader mining approaches focus solely on the user’s network structure, neglecting the significance and role of semantic information in the generation of opinion leaders. Furthermore, these methods rank the influence of users globally and lack effectiveness in detecting local opinion leaders with low influence. This paper presents a community-based opinion leader mining approach in semantic social networks to address these issues. Firstly, we present a new node semantic feature representation method and community detection algorithm to generate the local public opinion circle. Then, a novel influence calculation method is proposed to find local opinion leaders by combining the global structure of the network and local structure of the public opinion circle. Finally, nodes with high comprehensive influence are identified as opinion leaders. Experiments on real social networks indicate that the proposed method can accurately measure global and local influence in social networks, as well as increase the accuracy of local opinion leader mining.

AB  - Background: Physical activity (PA) is important for health. However, there is little evidence on how weight stigma, time spent on sedentary activities (including smartphone, social media, online learning), time spent on outdoor activity, and nomophobia associate with PA among Chinese individuals with consideration of gender. The present study examined the aforementioned associations in the COVID-19 pandemic era. Methods: University students (N = 3,135; 1,798 females, 1,337 males) with a mean age of 19.65 years (SD = 2.38) years completed an online survey from November to December, 2021. The online survey assessed weight stigma (using the Perceived Weight Stigma Scale and Weight Bias Internalization Scale), PA (using the International Physical Activity Questionnaire Short Form), time spent on different activities (using self-designed items for time on smartphone, outdoor activity, social media, and online learning), and nomophobia (using the Nomophobia Questionnaire). Parallel mediation models were constructed (dependent variable: PA; mediators: perceived weight stigma, weight-related self-stigma, time spent on smartphone, time spent on outdoor activity, time spent on social media, and time spent online learning; independent variable: nomophobia) and evaluated using Hayes' Process Macro Model 4 (IBM SPSS 20.0). Results: Weight-related self-stigma (β = −0.06; p = 0.03), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.21; p < 0.001), time spent on social media (β = 0.07; p = 0.02), time spent on online learning (β = 0.06; p = 0.03), and nomophobia (β = −0.07; p = 0.01) were all significant factors explaining the PA among female participants. Perceived weight stigma (β = −0.07; p = 0.01), time spent on outdoor activity (β = 0.27; p < 0.001), and time spent on online learning (β = 0.10; p = 0.002) were all significant factors explaining PA among male participants. Conclusion: Chinese healthcare providers should design programs on weight stigma reduction and outdoor activity improvement to enhance PA among university students.

AB  - Purpose: The outbreak and continuation of COVID-19 have spawned the transformation of traditional teaching models to a certain extent. The Chinese Ministry of Education’s guidance on “keep learning and teaching during class suspension” has made OTC and learning (OTC) become routinized, and the public’s emotional attitudes toward OTC have also evolved over time. The purpose of this study is to segment the emotional text data and introduce it into the topic model to reveal the evolution process and stage characteristics of public emotional polarity and public opinion of OTC topics during public health emergencies in the context of social media participation. The research has important guiding significance for the development of OTC and can influence and improve the efficiency and effect of OTC to a certain extent. The analysis of online public opinion can provide suggestions for the government and media to guide the trend of public opinion and optimize the OTC model. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes the topic of “OTC” on Zhihu during the COVID-19 epidemic as an example, combined with the characteristics of public opinion changes, chooses Boson emotional dictionary and time series analysis method to build an OTC network public opinion theme evolution analysis framework that integrates emotional analysis and topic mining. Finally, an empirical analysis of the dynamic evolution of the communication network for each stage of the life cycle of a specific topic is realized. Findings: This paper draws the following conclusions: (1) Through the emotional value table and the change trend chart of the number of comments, the analysis found that the number of positive comments is greater than the number of negative comments, which can be inferred that the public gradually accepts “OTC” and presents a positive emotional state. (2) By observing the changing trend of the average daily emotional value of the public, it is found that the overall emotional value shows a stable development trend after a large fluctuation. From the actual emotional value and the fitted emotional value curve, it can be seen that the overall curve fit is good, so ARIMA (12, 1, 6) can accurately predict the dynamic trend of the daily average emotional value in this paper. Therefore, based on the above-mentioned public opinion, emotional analysis research, relevant countermeasures and suggestions are put forward, which is conducive to guiding the development direction of public opinion in a positive way. Originality/value: Taking the topic of “OTC” in Zhihu as an example, this paper combines Boson emotional dictionary and time series to conduct a series of research analyses. Boson emotional dictionary can analyze the public’s emotional tendency, and time series can well analyze the intrinsic structure and complex features of the data to predict the future values. The combination of the two research methods allows for an adequate and unique study of public emotional polarization and the evolution of public opinion. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - As national and international health agencies rushed to respond to the global spread of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, commonly known as COVID-19), one challenge these organizations faced was the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus. Troublingly, much of the misinformation was couched in racialized language, particularly regarding the source of the virus and responsibility for its spread, fostering the development of related conspiracy theories. Media coverage of these conspiracy theories, particularly early on in the pandemic, had negative impacts on individuals' engagement in protective behaviors and concern with the spread of COVID-19. From extant work, racial resentment and white identity have been shown to be deeply woven into the fabric of contemporary American politics, affecting perceptions of public opinion even after accounting for social and political identities. While racial attitudes have been less studied in relation to conspiracy theory belief, we expect racial resentment and white identity to affect compliance with public health behaviors and COVID-19 conspiracy theory belief. Using observational and experimental survey data (N = 1,045), quota-sampled through Lucid Theorem (LT) in the spring of 2020, we demonstrate that framing the virus in racialized language alters endorsement of COVID-19 conspiracy theories, contingent upon levels of racial resentment and white identity and find that higher levels of conspiracy theory belief decreased compliance with preventative measures.

AB  - Purpose: This research aims to investigate consumers' food waste prevention behaviour through the lens of an extended theory of planned behaviour. The extension includes the examination of the role of social media usage in affecting consumers' decision-making process of food waste prevention behaviour. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire is developed based on measurement items of previously validated studies. 210 samples are collected and analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Findings: The results show that social media usage has a significant influence on attitude and injunctive norms. In addition, intention can be predicted by injunctive norms, moral norms and perceived behavioural control but not attitude. Lastly, the intention to reduce food waste is a significant predictor of food waste prevention behaviour. Originality/value: Overall, the extended theory of planned behaviour is useful in explaining consumers' food waste prevention behaviour. Interestingly, this study reveals that a negative attitude towards food waste behaviour does not translate into the intention to engage in food waste prevention behaviour. Furthermore, it is found that social media usage plays a significant in shaping consumers' attitudes towards food waste and injunctive norms. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has become a major public health emergency of global concern. Studying the Internet public opinion dissemination mechanism of public health emergencies is of great significance for creating a legalized network environment, and it is also helpful for managers to make scientific decisions when encountering Internet public opinion crisis. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the analysis of the process of spreading the Internet public opinion in major epidemics, a dynamic model of the Internet public opinion spread system was constructed to study the interactive relationship among the public opinion events, network media, netizens and government and the spread of epidemic public opinion. The Shuanghuanglian event in COVID-19 in China was taken as a typical example to make simulation analysis. Findings: Research results show three points: (1) the government credibility plays a decisive role in the spread of Internet public opinion; (2) it is the best time to intervene when Internet public opinion occurred at first time; (3) the management and control of social media are the key to public opinion governance. Besides, specific countermeasures are proposed to assist control of Internet public opinion dissemination. Originality/value: The epidemic Internet public opinion risk evolution system is a complex nonlinear social system. The system dynamics model is used to carry out research to facilitate the analysis of the Internet public opinion propagation mechanism and explore the interrelationship of various factors. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: The research objective of the paper is twofold. First, it scrutinises the current state of the art concerning adopting the most popular social media by European port managing bodies (PMBs). Second, it investigates the use of social media in the corporate social responsibility (CSR) communication strategies of European PMBs. Design/methodology/approach: The paper carries out online field research on the use of social media by the top-25 European ports. Then, it provides an in-depth case study of the use of Twitter by the Port of Rotterdam for CSR communication. Finally, a content analysis of the tweets published in the 2017–2019 timeframe is performed. Findings: Empirical results demonstrate the extensive use of social media by European PMBs to reach a wider array of stakeholders. Uneven approaches emerge considering port sizes and cultural clusters. The content analysis shows that one-third of tweets published by the Twitter account of the Port of Rotterdam address CSR issues, especially green initiatives, advocating the use of social media to communicate CSR. Research limitations/implications: The study focuses on the European domain. A broader sample of ports worldwide should be examined to further investigate the drivers affecting PMBs' strategic adoption and use of social media, mainly to communicate CSR. Practical implications: The paper provides port managers with insights to strengthen CSR communication. Given the increasing pressure of the public opinion on environmental and social issues, the ability of European PMBs to communicate their CSR commitment through social media represents a key driver when searching for consensus of stakeholders and “licence to operate”. Originality/value: The paper adds to the existing maritime logistics literature by introducing a promising field of research. © 2021, Pacific Star Group Education Foundation.

AB  - China is accused of conducting disinformation campaigns on Taiwan's social media. Existing studies on foreign interventions in democratic societies predict that such disinformation campaigns should lead to increasing partisan polarization within Taiwan. We argue that a backlash effect, making Taiwan's citizens more united against China, is equally plausible. We conduct a survey experiment exposing participants to a real-life rumour and rebuttal to test these competing hypotheses. We find, at best, mixed evidence for polarization. Although neither rumour nor rebuttal mention China, there is consistent evidence of backlash against China. Most notably, participants across the political spectrum are more inclined to support Taiwanese independence after viewing the rumour rebuttal. These findings indicate that citizens may put aside partisanship when confronted with false news that is plausibly linked to an external actor. We conclude by discussing the broader applicability of our theory and implications for cross-Strait relations. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Despite efforts to decrease the burden, vaccine hesitancy is increasing worldwide and deterring efforts to control the spread of COVID-19 after the approval of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. This study aims to assess levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance and predictors of hesitancy for pregnant women attending antenatal care in Ethiopia. Methods: Facility-based cross-sectional study was employed among 336 pregnant women from April 7 to June 10, 2021. The systematic random sampling technique was used to select pregnant from three health centers. Epi-Data version 3.2 and STATA/14 software were used for both data entry and analysis, respectively. A Logistic regression model was used to identify predictors of COVID-19 vaccine hesitance. Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval was used to estimate the strength of association at P<0.05. Result: This study included 336 pregnant mothers who were booked ANC in three health centers. The overall levels of COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among pregnant mothers were 79.17 %(95%CI: 74.5--83.2). Whereas, having poor attitude towards COVID-19 vaccines (AOR=9.4; 95%CI: 3.7--21.1, P<0.001), monthly income ≤118.5 US dollar (AOR =6.3; 95%CI: 2.9--12.2, P<0.002), Mother who are illiterate and started ANC (AOR=9.5; 95%CI: 4.6--22.6, P<0.001), Being unplanned pregnant (AOR =7.5; 95%CI: 3.6-11.2, P<0.002), first time ANC initiated (AOR =4.2; 95%CI: 2.9--15.1, P<0.001), and pregnant didn’t used social media (AOR= 6.0: 95%CI: 2.5--14.6, P< 0.02) were significantly associated with COVID-19 Vaccine hesitance. Conclusion: The acceptability of the COVID-19 vaccine among pregnant mothers was insufficient compared with previous research. Health care workers should provide health education during ANC visits to change their negative attitude and reassurance for the safety and effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine. © 2022 Lifescience Global.

AB  - We show that Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests shift public discourse toward the movement's agenda, as captured by social media and news reports. We find that BLM protests dramatically amplify the use of terms associatedwith the BLM agenda throughout the movement's history. Longitudinal data show that terms denoting the movement's theoretically distinctive ideas, such as "systemic racism," receivemore attention duringwaves of protest. We show that these shocks have notable impact beyond intense, or "viral," periods of nationwide protest. Together, these findings indicate that BLM has successfully leveraged protest events to engender lasting changes in the ways that Americans discuss racial inequality. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - The amino acid condensation reaction on a heterogeneous mineral surface has been regarded as one of the important pathways for peptide bond formation. In this work, the mechanism of peptide bond formation over a silica surface in an aqueous environment is studied using ab initio molecular dynamics calculations coupled with enhanced sampling methods such as metadynamics and umbrella sampling. The model includes a periodically repeated slab of amorphous SiO2 forming an interface with explicit liquid water. The adopted simulation method allowed reconstruction of a prejudice-free reaction mechanism of glycine dimerization and quantification of the corresponding free energy profile, with a detailed characterization of transition states and of the role of water. The resulting three-step mechanism features an overall free energy barrier of 155 kJ/mol at 300 K. In comparison to the bulk liquid phase, our results indicate that the interface has a strong catalytic effect on the condensation reaction, which we trace back to the capability of the silica-water interface in promoting an addition reaction by a transition state stabilization. The silica-water interface is found to behave as a less-polar reaction medium with respect to bulk water, promoting addition reactions and disfavoring elimination reactions. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The use of renewable energy has been an important topic in the four Pacific Northwestern states for the last 30 years. Large, statistically designed public surveys were conducted in the region in 1990, 2000, 2010, and 2020 to determine the perceived sustainability, future viability, and acceptance of the following ten energy sources: biomass, coal, geothermal, hydropower, natural gas, nuclear, oil, solar, tidal, and wind power. The survey questions were identical in all 4 years of the survey. These surveys were delivered by the US Postal Service to over 3500 randomly chosen residents in each survey year. The public response rate exceeded 50% in each survey year. Demographic data about age, gender, education level, community size, and state of residence of survey respondents were also collected. The survey data were statistically analyzed. In general, the public was literate identifying the renewable and nonrenewable energy sources as the majority of survey respondents correctly identified biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar, and wind as renewable energy sources. Based on survey results, over 75% of Pacific Northwest residents considered it important or very important that their energy resources were renewable in 2020. The findings of this study were important because it shows that the public is in line with the scientific community with the goal of greatly reducing energy reliance on C containing nonrenewable energy sources including oil, coal, and natural gas. In summary, (1) the public strongly supports the transformation to a sustainable energy system using primarily renewable energy sources, (2) the use of traditional nonrenewable energy sources like natural gas should not be discouraged in the present; however, they should be phased out over the short and medium terms, (3) solar and wind energy should be significant sources to meet future energy needs in the region, and (4) the renewables including biomass and geothermal have a place in the future energy mix within the Pacific Northwest. © 2022 WIT Press.

AB  - Conspiracy theories are gaining increasing interest in academic and public debate. A broad research agenda focused on the socio-political and psychological determinants of conspiracy theory beliefs, on the effect of social media as a new channel of dissemination, on the role played by populist leaders in explaining those theories, and on the impact on social and political outputs. This introduction to the special issue proposes a summary of this growing literature and addresses an aspect that is still under-investigated: the life cycle of conspiracy theories. Previous empirical studies investigated the topic either in a cross-sectional fashion or by employing short-term panels - focusing on how conspiracy theories change over a small period (e.g., before and after an election). Using panel survey data, we take a medium-term approach. We base our investigation on a longitudinal study composed of two survey waves, administered in 2016 and late 2020. Respondents were asked to rate the plausibility of different 'classic' conspiracy theories. This allows comparing changes in beliefs in those conspiracy theories over this 4-year time frame. Results show that believes in these theories decrease over time. Furthermore, this decline can only be marginally explained by individual socio-demographic characteristics or political orientations. After thoroughly describing these differences over time, we speculate on why this decline occurs, mainly basing our argument on the role of the media landscape in shaping public opinion.

AB  - Aims The main purpose of this study was to investigate the leveling of barriers to the development of sports volunteering for the disabled in Iran using a structural-interpretive model. Instrument & Methods It was performed based on the purpose of applied research and in terms of data collection by the exploratory mixed method. Participants included professors of sports management, managers, and specialists in the field of the disabled and volunteering in the country. Data collection tools were semi-structured interviews and structural self-interaction matrix questionnaires. In the first part, the data were organized using the thematic analysis method and in the form of basic, organized and comprehensive themes. Also, using the interpretive structural model, the identified obstacles were classified. Findings The results showed that barriers to the development of sports volunteering for the disabled as a comprehensive theme include 54 basic themes and 8 organizing themes which were classified into 3 levels and based on the results of lack of material and spiritual support for disabled volunteering, poor management of sports organizations, Ignorance of laws and macro-politics, non-compliance of sports facilities with the disabled are in the first level and are considered the most important obstacles. Also, in the second level, there is inappropriate media coverage, and in the last level, there are individual restrictions, inappropriate position of volunteering in Iranian sports, and a negative attitude towards the abilities and competencies of the disabled. Conclusion By focusing on removing the identified barriers, we can help a lot in the development of social capital as well as the effectiveness of the performance of sports organizations. © 2022, the Authors.

AB  - This article examines the gendered racialization of Muslim women in Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire (2017) and Samira Ahmed's Internment (2019) and argues that their young South Asian Muslim women protagonists navigate physical and digital spaces to claim their rights as citizens. The article first explores the ways in which the public sphere operates transnationally and has shaped perceptions of Muslims in the United Kingdom and United States since 9/11, and analyzes the role of transnational subaltern counterpublics to resist Islamophobia and state repression. The article then examines the ways in which the young Muslim women in Shamsie's and Ahmed's works fight the xenophobic state, its surveillance regime, and the curtailment of the ability of Muslims to move freely. In both novels, resistance emerges as a transnational subaltern counterpublic in traditional and digital media. The novels underscore the young women's agency in overcoming constraints on their mobility and freedom of speech to claim their rights as citizens and engage in an oppositional public sphere that counters their exclusion. © 2022 University of Tulsa.

AB  - Microblogging, like Twitter, has grown in popularity as a medium for human expression, allowing users to quickly create content on breaking news, public events, or products. The vast volume of microblogging data is a valuable and timely source of public attitudes, views, and opinions on a variety of issues. Users express themselves freely with varied degrees of uncertainty, which makes using microblogs as a data source a tedious task that necessitates the consideration of this factor. We're talking about the uncertainty expressed in microblogs, not the one relative to the claimed information factuality. This aspect of microblogging that we are addressing has gotten little attention, despite the fact that it is critical to understand the degree of ambiguity with which users plan to share information. This topic is particularly relevant to research projects involving information retrieval or investigation in microblogs. In this paper, we present a state of the art on the identification of uncertainty in microblogs with the aim of identifying this issue and describing the current knowledge through the study of similar or related work. We mainly concluded that, to adapt to the characteristics of social media, it is necessary to identify the uncertainty based on the contextual uncertain semantics rather than the traditional cue-phrases, and considering multiple subclasses could provide more information for research on handing uncertainty in social media texts. © 2022 Qazvin Islamic Azad University.

AB  - Information dissemination is not limited to conventional media as the advent of new media has transformed the entire political scenario. In a democratic country like India, people prefer to have information from different media like print media, broadcasting media, outdoor media, and new media, etc., which may impact their political attitude and participation. Therefore, the focus was to study the relative influence of different media on political attitude and political participation. A cross-sectional descriptive research design having a sample of 497 eligible voters was used. OLS regression analysis was used, and it was observed that media use for political information was a significant influencer for political participation, followed by political attitude, political knowledge, interest, and efficacy. Among all, social media was found to have a relatively higher significant positive influence, but traditional media cannot be ignored. The study results will contribute to the conceptualization of media behavior while considering multiple media for political information. © 2022, Associated Management Consultants Pvt. Ltd..

AB  - American Jewish support for Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War was in part the result of an emotional mobilization. American Jewish fundraisers constructed an extensive public-relations apparatus and formulated strategies for honoring supporters and shaming shirkers. They, along with journalists for the Jewish press, interpreted events through the lens of information provided by the newly formed Israeli government. Fundraising, however, could succeed only by responding to donors' emotional proclivities, and expressions of solidarity with Israel in Jewish media were laterally reinforcing as well as shaped from the top down. These findings underscore the role of positive emotions in generating groupness. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In this digital era, people rely on the internet for their news consumption. As people are free to express their opinions on social media, much information shared on the internet is loaded with propaganda. Propagandist contents are intended to influence public opinion. In the mainstream media or prominent news agencies, the authors' and news agencies' own bias may impact in the news contents. Hence, it is required to detect such propaganda spread through news articles. Detection and classification of propagandist text require standard, high-quality, annotated datasets. A few datasets are available for propaganda classification. However, these datasets are mostly in English. Hindi is the most spoken language in India, and efforts are needed to detect its propagandist contents. This research work introduces two new datasets: H-Prop and H-Prop-News, which consist of news articles in Hindi annotated as propaganda or non-propaganda. The H-Prop dataset is generated by translating 28,630 news articles from the QProp dataset. The H-Prop-News dataset contains 5500 news articles collected from 32 prominent Hindi news websites. We experiment with the proposed datasets using four supervised machine learning models combined with different feature vectors and word embeddings. Our experiments achieve 87% accuracy using Logistic Regression with TF-IDF feature vectors. The datasets provide high-quality labeled news articles in Hindi and open new avenues for researchers to explore techniques for analyzing and classifying propaganda in Hindi text. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The frequent occurrence of doctor-patient disputes in pediatrics departments in China has led to more doctor-patient online public discussions. The effects of comprehensive evolution have become the focus of public opinion governance. This paper obtains social media data regarding pediatric care from Sina Weibo, and analyzes changes in emotional tendencies and the evolutionary characteristics of public emotional events. Simulation experiments are conducted by constructing a comprehensive evolution model of public emotion to reveal the derivation rules of the information community. The results of the study show that: (1) the Chinese public’s attention in the field of pediatrics in recent years is focused on children medicine; (2) emotional tendencies show a small fluctuation, and the positive emotions are mainly stable; (3) when the public opinion evolves, the evolution effect of the community has a great effect on the topic escalating and social emotions strengthening; (4) other relevant events could promote the exacerbation of current events, making the expansion of the topic larger and longer. Research on pediatric doctor-patient online public emotional events is beneficial to the public’s key needs for pediatric medical care, and provides effective information for stakeholders to effectively monitor and guide public emotional events. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The current paper describes an effort to develop an integrated theory - integrated mediated intergroup contact (IMIC) model to account for the two types of mediated intergroup contact (parasocial and vicarious) that have been shown to help with prejudice reduction. To this end, our model applies concepts from intergroup contact theory, parasocial and vicarious research, and narrative transportation theory. The present research expands our theoretical understanding of how entertainment media can function as a tool for reducing prejudice toward various outgroups. The IMIC model accounts for the effects of the two types of mediated contact - parasocial and vicarious - and delineates the process of prejudice reduction. © 2022 Hogrefe Publishing GmbH.

AB  - Background: The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity. Objective: We aim to investigate Twitter users’ attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Canada after vaccine rollout. Methods: We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination–related tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward “vaccination” changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects. Results: After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, “immunity” and “pfizer”) and 6775 opinion terms (eg, “trustworthy” for the positive sentiment and “jeopardize” for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to “vaccine distribution,” “side effects,” “allergy,” “reactions,” and “anti-vaxxer,” and positive sentiments related to “vaccine campaign,” “vaccine candidates,” and “immune response.” These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the “anti-vaxxer” population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the “Covid Zero” population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response. Conclusions: Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research on hostile media perception (HMP) has suggested that both news slants and partisan source cues influence individuals’ perception of news bias. Yet, relatively little attention has been paid to the possibility that the two message features may interact. Extending the literature on HMP, the present experiment investigates the content-source interaction in the context of President Trump’s policy on immigration, with two audience characteristics as potential moderators: political ideology strength (PIS) and need for cognition (NFC). Results show that (1) the effect of news slants on HMP is greater when the news is from an in-group source and (2) such interaction is more pronounced for those with higher levels of PIS and lower levels of NFC. Implications for our understanding of HMP and for public opinion in an increasingly fragmented and partisan media environment will be discussed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Trust in information sources about COVID-19 may influence the public attitude toward the disease and the imposed restrictions, thus determining the course of the COVID-19 pandemic in a given country. Acknowledging an increase in trust in the government or the so-called rally ‘round the flag’ effect around the world at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, this study explores possible determinants of this effect in Latvia, looking at such variables as the perceived disease risk, gender, age, education, income, and language spoken in the family. Presuming that risk perception may be amplified by trust in various information sources, we investigate a spill-over of the rally ‘round the flag’ effect on healthcare professionals, media, and interpersonal networks. Studying data from a nationally representative sociological survey conducted in September 2020, we confirm a positive relationship between trust in all information sources, except friends, relatives, and colleagues, and perceived disease risk. Correlations are also strong regarding trust in almost all information sources and the measured socio-demographic variables, except gender. Interpersonal trust seems to be relatively stable, and in most cases the correlations are statistically insignificant. With this study we suggest that increase in trust in government institutions as well as other information sources, even in crisis situations, does not depend on any single element, but instead presents a more complex phenomenon. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Social media platforms such as Twitter have been used by political leaders, heads of states, political parties, and their supporters to strategically influence public opinions. Leaders can post about a location, a state, a country, or even a region in their social media accounts, and the posts can immediately be viewed and reacted to by millions of their followers. The effect of social media posts by political leaders could be automatically measured by extracting, analyzing, and producing real-time geospatial intelligence for social scientists and researchers. This paper proposed a novel approach in automatically processing real-time social media messages of political leaders with artificial intelligence (AI)-based language detection, translation, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition (NER). This method automatically generates geospatial and location intelligence on both ESRI ArcGIS Maps and Microsoft Bing Maps. The proposed system was deployed from 1 January 2020 to 6 February 2022 to analyze 1.5 million tweets. During this 25-month period, 95K locations were successfully identified and mapped using data of 271,885 Twitter handles. With an overall 90% precision, recall, and F1 score, along with 97% accuracy, the proposed system reports the most accurate system to produce geospatial intelligence directly from live Twitter feeds of political leaders with AI. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Aims: The diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is not easy as there is no direct test that exists to establish such a diagnosis. Increasing community and healthcare professional knowledge of the ASD spectrum is crucial because it will encourage parents of ASD children to seek screening and diagnosis from a specialist, allowing for better early detection and treatment. This study explored the knowledge of the general population in Saudi Arabia regarding ASD and assessed variables associated with an accurate understanding of ASD. Methods: A total of 769 participants were involved in this cross-sectional study, which was conducted in Saudi Arabia between November 2021 and February 2022 using an online survey tool to explore the knowledge of the general population in Saudi Arabia regarding typical child development and ASD. A binary logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors affecting participants’ knowledge of autism. Results: Overall, the study participants showed a weak level of knowledge about autism with a mean score of 5.9 (SD: 3.1), comprising 34.7% of the total maximum obtainable score. Participants with a middle income category of 5000–7500 SR are less likely to be knowledgeable about autism compared to others (OR: 0.60 (95% CI: 0.39–0.92)) (p-value = 0.020). Conclusion: The participants in our study showed limited knowledge about autism. Government funds should be made available to facilitate educational services for ASD children. More funding and resources should be allocated by the government to provide assistance for children with special needs, and changes in public facilities are required to meet the demands of ASD patients. Through an informed educational effort, various media platforms should assist in improving the community’s understanding of ASD and their attitude toward ASD patients. Educational campaigns should focus on enhancing the public’s knowledge about ASD treatment and etiology. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: In November 2018, a Chinese researcher reported that his team had applied clustered regularly interspaced palindromic repeats or associated protein 9 to delete the gene C-C chemokine receptor type 5 from embryos and claimed that the 2 newborns would have lifetime immunity from HIV infection, an event referred to as #GeneEditedBabies on social media platforms. Although this event stirred a worldwide debate on ethical and legal issues regarding clinical trials with embryonic gene sequences, the focus has mainly been on academics and professionals. However, how the public, especially stratified by geographic region and culture, reacted to these issues is not yet well-understood. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine web-based posts about the #GeneEditedBabies event and characterize and compare the public's stance across social media platforms with different user bases. Methods: We used a set of relevant keywords to search for web-based posts in 4 worldwide or regional mainstream social media platforms: Sina Weibo (China), Twitter, Reddit, and YouTube. We applied structural topic modeling to analyze the main discussed topics and their temporal trends. On the basis of the topics we found, we designed an annotation codebook to label 2000 randomly sampled posts from each platform on whether a supporting, opposing, or neutral stance toward this event was expressed and what the major considerations of those posts were if a stance was described. The annotated data were used to compare stances and the language used across the 4 web-based platforms. Results: We collected >220,000 posts published by approximately 130,000 users regarding the #GeneEditedBabies event. Our results indicated that users discussed a wide range of topics, some of which had clear temporal trends. Our results further showed that although almost all experts opposed this event, many web-based posts supported this event. In particular, Twitter exhibited the largest number of posts in opposition (701/816, 85.9%), followed by Sina Weibo (968/1140, 84.91%), Reddit (550/898, 61.2%), and YouTube (567/1078, 52.6%). The primary opposing reason was rooted in ethical concerns, whereas the primary supporting reason was based on the expectation that such technology could prevent the occurrence of diseases in the future. Posts from these 4 platforms had different language uses and patterns when they expressed stances on the #GeneEditedBabies event. Conclusions: This research provides evidence that posts on web-based platforms can offer insights into the public's stance on gene editing techniques. However, these stances vary across web-based platforms and often differ from those raised by academics and policy makers. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are environmental contaminants that have received significant public attention. PFAS are a large group of human-made chemicals that have been used in industry and consumer products worldwide since the 1950s. Human exposure to PFAS is a growing public health concern. Studies suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase the risk of some cancers and have negative health impacts on the endocrine, metabolic, and immune systems. Federal and state health partners are investigating the exposure to and possible health effects associated with PFAS. Government agencies can observe social media discourse on PFAS to better understand public concerns and develop targeted communication and outreach efforts. Objective: The primary objective of this study is to understand how social media is used to share, disseminate, and engage in public discussions of PFAS-related information in the United States. Methods: We investigated PFAS-related content across 2 social media platforms between May 1, 2017, and April 30, 2019, to identify how social media is used in the United States to seek and disseminate PFAS-related information. Our key variable of interest was posts that mentioned "PFAS," "PFOA," "PFOS," and their hashtag variations across social media platforms. Additional variables included post type, time, PFAS event, and geographic location. We examined term use and post type differences across platforms. We used descriptive statistics and regression analysis to assess the incidence of PFAS discussions and to identify the date, event, and geographic patterns. We qualitatively analyzed social media content to determine the most prevalent themes discussed on social media platforms. Results: Our analysis revealed that Twitter had a significantly greater volume of PFAS-related posts compared with Reddit (98,264 vs 3126 posts). PFAS-related social media posts increased by 670% over 2 years, indicating a marked increase in social media users' interest in and awareness of PFAS. Active engagement varied across platforms, with Reddit posts demonstrating more in-depth discussions compared with passive likes and reposts among Twitter users. Spikes in PFAS discussions were evident and connected to the discovery of contamination events, media coverage, and scientific publications. Thematic analysis revealed that social media users see PFAS as a significant public health concern and seek a trusted source of information about PFAS-related public health efforts. Conclusions: The analysis identified a prevalent theme-on social media, PFAS are perceived as an immediate public health concern, which demonstrates a growing sense of urgency to understand this emerging contaminant and its potential health impacts. Government agencies can continue using social media research to better understand the changing community sentiment on PFAS and disseminate targeted information and then use social media as a forum for dispelling misinformation, communicating scientific findings, and providing resources for relevant public health services. © 2022 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

AB  - Within the context of Instagram celebrity-based brand endorsement, this study investigates the effects of parasocial interaction, perceived ad message authenticity, and the match-up between brand and celebrity. An online survey was administered to 253 college students taking introductory advertising or PR courses. Respondents, in return, received course credits. As hypothesized, study results reveal that parasocial interaction positively influences perceived ad message authenticity, the match-up between brand and celebrity, and attitude toward ads. In addition, perceived ad message authenticity and the match-up between brand and celebrity have a positive impact on consumers’ attitudes toward ads. The current study provides advertising practitioners with implications when it comes to creating advertising campaign messages and selecting celebrity endorsers. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered an enormous number of discussion topics on social media Twitter. It has an impact on the global health system and citizen responses to the pandemic. Multiple responses (replies, favorites, and retweets) reflect the followers’ attitudes and emotions towards these tweets. Twitter data such as these have inspired substantial research interest in sentiment and social trend analyses. To date, studies on Twitter data have focused on the associational relationships between variables in a population. There is a need for further discovery of causality, such as the influence of sentiment polarity of tweet response on further discussion topics. These topics often reflect the human perception of COVID-19. This study addresses this exact topic. It aims to develop a new method to unveil the causal relationships between the sentiment polarity and responses in social media data. We employed sentiment polarity, i.e., positive or negative sentiment, as the treatment variable in this quasi-experimental study. The data is the tweets posted by nine authoritative public organizations in four countries and the World Health Organization from December 1, 2019, to May 10, 2020. Employing the inverse probability weighting model, we identified the treatment effect of sentiment polarity on the multiple responses of tweets. The topics with negative sentiment polarity on COVID-19 attracted significantly more replies (69±49) and favorites (688±677) than the positive tweets. However, no significant difference in the number of retweets was found between the negative and positive tweets. This study contributes a new method for social media analysis. It generates new insight into the influence of sentiment polarity of tweets about COVID-19 on tweet responses. © 2022 Yu et al.

AB  - People with locomotion difficulties encounter many barriers in a pedestrian environment. Pavement quality has been shown to substantially affect pedestrian satisfaction in general, and its optimal design may contribute to reducing the stigma put on people with impairments. Our research involved a survey assessing perception and attitudes towards pavement quality and characteristics for pedestrian comfort. The classic correlation of the variables based on contingency tables was used to analyse data and to test whether respondents’ perceptions depended on certain profile features. The completion of the statistical inference was the use of advanced algorithms of the correspondence analysis method. The relationships between the variables were assessed optionally using the chi2 test. The study results revealed desirable parameters and features of paving surfaces. People who use manual wheelchairs and declare limb loss prefer medium-and large-format concrete pavers with smooth finishing and no bevelling. People with skeletal abnormalities or peripheral neuropathy prefer concrete slabs and surfaces made of small-or medium-sized panels arranged in a regular pattern, made of smooth non-slip concrete with narrow joints. Further laboratory tests are necessary to investigate whether increased water permeability of pavements constructed on eco-friendly base layers can curb damage to the pavement surface and provide long-term durability. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This study investigated how sustainability-related messages of cotton textile and apparel products influence consumers’ attitudes toward the message and interaction with other consumers in social media. Three hundred and eighty-eight online survey data of US consumers investigated the effects of perceived information and emotion toward sustainability practice messages on attitude toward and social interaction with other consumers and the effects of attitude on social interaction in social media. The results confirm that emotion is an influential variable, and, specific, positive emotion is an influential variable for attitude, and attitude influences social interaction with other consumers of sustainability practice messages. Negative emotions influence both attitude and social interaction. The information does not influence attitude but directly impacts social interaction, which may bring the purchase intention of sustainable fashion products. Thus, apparel marketers should consider emotionally sustainable promotion messages when tailoring their brand communications on social media. This study helps clarify the relationships between emotion and social interaction for sustainable fashion products. It also contributes to the theoretical foundation and has implications for sustainable fashion marketing and management in social media. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Cooperation between government and social capital is an important starting point in the supply-side reform of public services. It is also an effective practice in public governance innova-tion. Based on policy diffusion theory and event history analysis (EHA), this study analyzes panel data from 282 mainland prefecture-level cities in China from 2004–2020 to explore public–private partnerships’ critical diffusion factors. The study reveals that motivation factors, resource/obstacle factors, and external factors affect government and social capital cooperation policies to different extents. The main driving forces for local governments to adopt these policies are population size, level of economic development, government financial resources, the learning mechanism, and the imitation mechanism. This study proposes the following arguments: firstly, that the ultimate goal of policy innovation is to solve social contradictions and meet public demand; secondly, that economic resources can help to adopt policy innovation and proper diffusion; thirdly, that the public–private partnership (PPP) model has been continuously developed by using experience from other projects or cities through a learning mechanism; and finally, that policy publicity and public opinion expressed via the mainstream media are not only an inducement for policy innovation and diffusion, but also a powerful guarantee. The experience of local governments in China can help to verify whether the “positive factors” that are traditionally considered to be conducive to the cooperation between the government and social capital are effective, and to reveal the internal logic of the innovation diffusion of public policies of local governments in China from a more multidimensional perspective. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Ageism refers to stereotyping (how we think), prejudice (how we feel), and discrimination (how we act) against people based on their age. It is a serious public health issue that can negatively impact older people’s health and quality of life. The present protocol has several goals: (1) adapt the Ambivalent Ageism Scale for the general Portuguese population and healthcare professionals; (2) assess the factorial invariance of the questionnaire between general population vs. healthcare professionals; (3) evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in the general population and evaluate the level of ageism and its predictors in healthcare professionals; (4) compare the levels of ageism between groups and the invariance between groups regarding the explanatory model of predictors of ageism. This quantitative, cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study will be developed in partnership with several Healthcare Professional Boards/Associations, National Geriatrics and Gerontology Associations, and the Universities of the Third Age Network Association. The web-based survey will be conducted on a convenience sample recruited via various social media and institutional channels. The survey consists of three questionnaires: (1) Demographic data; (2) Ambivalent Ageism Scale; (3) Palmore-Neri and Cachioni questionnaire. The methodology of this study will include translation, pilot testing, semantic adjustment, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and multigroup analysis of the Ambivalent Ageism Scale. Data will be treated using International Business Machines Corporation (IBM®) Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software and Analysis of Moment Structures (AMOS). Descriptive analysis will be conducted to assess the level of ageism in the study sample. The ageism levels between the two groups will be compared using the t-student test, and two Structural Equation Modeling will be developed to evaluate the predictors of ageism. Assessing ageism is necessary to allow healthcare professionals and policymakers to design and implement strategies to solve or reduce this issue. Findings from this study will generate knowledge relevant to healthcare and medical courses along with anti-ageism education for the Portuguese population. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This historical paper engages in a form of discourse analysis of international media reports on three murder trials in Botswana which involved a white person(s) as a victim or perpetrator. First, is the trial of Botswana Defence Force soldier, Sergeant Ompatile Tswaipe, after allegedly ordering his platoon to shoot three suspected white insurgents in the Tuli Block in 1978. Outrage and pressure from apartheid South African and British media and officialdom seems to have led to the prosecution of Tswaipe while public opinion in Botswana solidly stood behind him as a patriot. The second trial involved Clement Gofhamodimo in 1984 who had murdered and robbed a white Swiss tourist, and fled to the United States in 1978. The hierarchy at his alma mater, University of the District of Columbia, mobilized leading African-American civil rights activists and tried to plead with President Ronald Reagan and Pope John Paul II to entreat President Quett Masire of Botswana for clemency. Finally, is the trial of Mariette Bosch, a South African white woman who murdered her South African lady friend in 1996 to marry her husband. While Bosch was on death row in 2001, there was a spirited campaign in some Western and South African quarters for her clemency by President Festus Mogae of Botswana while blacks on death row with her were ignored. The paper observes that the international media reports put Botswana's internationally acclaimed respect for the rule of law and observance of human rights on the spotlight which was challenged by the local public opinion. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Over-the-counter (OTC) medicine is defined as safe and effective for the general public to use, without seeking therapy from a health professional. As primary social media and internet users, university and college students are more likely to be exposed to unverified sources of health information. This study aims to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviour of students at institutions of higher learning in Brunei with regard to the safe use of OTC medicines. A cross-sectional study was performed using a self-administered online questionnaire, adapted from the literature with additional information from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the educational resources in understanding OTC medicine for consumers. The questionnaire consisted of 4 sections: demographic information, knowledge of OTC medicines, attitudes, and practice. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used for data analysis. A total of 335 students returned a completed questionnaire. The students had a mean knowledge score of 7.1 out of 9, with more than half (53.4%) having good knowledge (knowledge score > 7), and only a small percentage (5.7%) with poor knowledge. Almost all of the students (99.7%) had a positive attitude toward OTC medicine use. Few of the students practiced improper habits in terms of OTC medicine use, such as not reading the instructions or taking more than the recommended dose. Awareness of proper OTC medicine use among students in institutions of higher learning is necessary to prevent the rise of inappropriate user practices. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - As the most important global news distributors, the big three international news agencies’ reports about COVID-19 vaccines have a great influence on people’s understanding of them. Based on the health belief model (HBM), we examined which constructs in the HBM were related to audi-ences’ Twitter engagement and the differences among the agencies. We content-analyzed 1162 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets from three international news agencies’ Twitter accounts (@AFPespanol, @AP, @Reuters) from 2 December 2020 to 31 January 2021. The results showed that the most-used HBM construct was barriers, followed by benefits, susceptibility, cues to action, se-verity, and self-efficacy. About half of the tweets used a positive tone and nearly half of the tweets used a neutral tone, while only 3.1% of the tweets used a negative tone. Reuters used a significantly more negative tone, more neutral tone, and less positive tone than was expected. AFP used a significantly more positive tone and less neutral tone than was expected. The effectiveness of utilizing HBM constructs for vaccination promotion strongly depends on the audience context. The use of HBM constructs for vaccination was generally effective for Reuters but seems to have backfired for AFP. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Plastic pollution through small particles, so-called microplastics, is acknowledged as an environmental problem of global dimension by both politicians, and the public. An increasing number of environmental studies investigate the exposure and effects of microplastics. Although there are many open questions, current scientific evidence does not confirm a high risk for the environment. At the same time, the issue receives great public attention, which in turn motivates various political and policy actions. So far, little research has examined the underlying social dimensions, i.e., the factors explaining individual risk perception of microplastics. This paper studies the perception of risks associated with microplastics concerning the environment and human health using data from a representative online survey conducted in Germany (n = 1027). We particularly examine the role of socio-demographics, individual awareness, knowledge factors, and the media's influence on risk perception. Our results show that a majority of the respondents rates the risks through microplastics very high for both the environment and human health. Regression analyses demonstrate that environmental awareness and knowledge of media narratives are the strongest predictors for this risk perception. Our study illustrates the incongruence between scientific knowledge, media framing, and the public opinion concerning the risk posed by microplastics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this article, we review existing research on the complementarity of social media data and survey data for the study of public opinion. We start by situating our review in the extensive literature (N = 187) about the uses, challenges, and frameworks related to the use of social media for studying public opinion. Based on 187 relevant articles (141 empirical and 46 theoretical) - we identify within the 141 empircal ones six main research approaches concerning the complementarity of both data sources. Results show that the biggest share of the research has focused on how social media can be used to confirm survey findings, especially for election predictions. The main contribution of our review is to detail and classify other growing complementarity approaches, such as comparing both data sources on a given phenomenon, using survey measures as a proxy in social media research, enriching surveys with SMD, recruiting individuals on social media to conduct a second survey phase, and generating new insight on “old” or “under-investigated” topics or theories using SMD. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages associated with each of these approaches in relation to four main research purposes, namely the improvement of validity, sustainability, reliability, and interpretability. We conclude by discussing some limitations of our study and highlighting future paths for research. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - William Randolph Hearst became editor and proprietor of the San Francisco Examiner in 1887, and by 1935, he had assembled a media empire consisting of nearly 30 major newspapers, 13 magazines, 8 radio stations, 3 news wires, and 2 motion picture companies. Most scholarship about Hearst has focused on his newspapers; less studied have been the magazines he acquired early in the 20th century. This monograph examines immigrant representations in Hearst magazines published between 1905 and 1945, focusing on how magazine fiction, nonfiction, and “fact-fiction” articles presented immigrants and immigration as social and political issues. Like Hearst himself, the publications favored immigrants from Germany and the Scandinavian countries of northern Europe and tended to disfavor those from China and Japan and, to a lesser extent, Mexico. According to the magazines, immigrants from the Far East and Mexico were “undesirables” who threatened society by, allegedly, importing, selling, and using hazardous drugs. Newspaper advertisements, news articles, and editorials extended these portrayals to wider audiences. Hearst also applied cross-media promotion to motion pictures, with writers converting fiction from his magazines into screenplays for Cosmopolitan Productions and MGM. The monograph contains examples of how magazine content and iconic covers have informed contemporary films and television series. In recent years, stylized representations have glamorized lifestyles but have also perpetuated cultural stereotypes that may contribute to anti-immigrant attitudes. © 2022 AEJMC.

AB  - Background: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has greatly affected health care priorities. Objective: To explore and analyse trends in public online search for urological cancers. Design, setting, and participants: We performed a retrospective analysis using the Google Health Trends online tool. Data related to urological cancer terms (“prostate cancer”, “kidney cancer”, and “bladder cancer”) were extracted. We analysed trends for the whole world and for five countries: Italy, the UK, France, Sweden, and the USA. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: A join-point regression model was used to define significant changes in trends over time. Week percentage changes (WPCs) were estimated to summarise linear trends. The Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the search volume during the COVID-19 pandemic period (from January 2020 to April 2021) and the equivalent period of 2018 and 2019. Results and limitations: During COVID-19, worldwide online interest decreased significantly for all urological cancers, especially prostate cancer (WPC: –13.9%, p = 0.004; WPC: –5.4%, p < 0.001; and WPC: –4.3%, p < 0.001, for prostate, kidney, and bladder cancers, respectively). The most important decline was observed in the USA. The interest for all cancers was significantly less during the COVID-19 pandemic than in the same periods of 2018 and 2019. Conclusions: Online interest in urological cancers decreased significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies will tell us whether this will translate into worse oncological outcomes. Patient summary: Patients are increasingly searching the Internet to get information on cancer. We explored Google queries during the COVID-19 pandemic and found that online interest decreased significantly for all urological cancers, especially prostate cancer. We do not know yet whether this will translate into worse prognosis for patients. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Social media platforms are part of everyday life, allowing the interconnection of people around the world in large discussion groups relating to every topic, including important social or political issues. Therefore, social media have become a valuable source of information-rich data, commonly referred to as Social Big Data, effectively exploitable to study the behavior of people, their opinions, moods, interests and activities. However, these powerful communication platforms can be also used to manipulate conversation, polluting online content and altering the popularity of users, through spamming activities and misinformation spreading. Recent studies have shown the use on social media of automatic entities, defined as social bots, that appear as legitimate users by imitating human behavior aimed at influencing discussions of any kind, including political issues. In this paper we present a new methodology, namely TIMBRE (Time-aware opInion Mining via Bot REmoval), aimed at discovering the polarity of social media users during election campaigns characterized by the rivalry of political factions. This methodology is temporally aware and relies on a keyword-based classification of posts and users. Moreover, it recognizes and filters out data produced by social media bots, which aim to alter public opinion about political candidates, thus avoiding heavily biased information. The proposed methodology has been applied to a case study that analyzes the polarization of a large number of Twitter users during the 2016 US presidential election. The achieved results show the benefits brought by both removing bots and taking into account temporal aspects in the forecasting process, revealing the high accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed approach. Finally, we investigated how the presence of social bots may affect political discussion by studying the 2016 US presidential election. Specifically, we analyzed the main differences between human and artificial political support, estimating also the influence of social bots on legitimate users. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Pharmaceutical firms are striving to find potential treatments to prevent and treat COVID-19. One of the gold standards to evaluate treatment is a clinical trial; however, the difficulty in patient recruitment could act as a determinant. It is evident from the registry data that very few studies have been conducted involving the population of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Aim: To document knowledge, perception, and attitude of the public from Two large countries in the MENA region (Egypt and Saudi Arabia) towards participation in clinical trials focused on evaluating potential COVID-19 treatments. Method: A cross-sectional study was conducted that used a snowball sampling strategy for recruitment. General population 18 years old or older, who lived in Saudi Arabia or Egypt were invited. The survey was adopted from literature and was approved by an ethics committee. Results: Out of 800 participants in the survey, 407 participants were from Egypt, and 393 were from Saudi Arabia. Most participants (48%) had moderate knowledge, i.e., >60% <80%. The results revealed poor attitude (88.5%) and poor perceptions (45.8%) regarding participation in COVID-19 clinical trials. Education and residence were identified as determinants of participants’ knowledge, attitude, and perceptions. Participants' knowledge and understanding of COVID-19 trials did not impact their willingness to participate. This coupled with a poor attitude and perception among the masses drastically affects any potential for participation in future clinical trials. Conclusion: A relatively small proportion of participants were interested in enrolling in COVID-19 studies. Increased collective engagement through social media and healthcare professionals can help improve attitudes and perceptions toward trial participation. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Achieving the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as scheduled puts forward new demands for the green transition of low-carbon lifestyle in Chinese society. In-depth practice of green consumption (GC) behavior can effectively promote the supply-side and consumption-side emission reduction work, but the phenomenon of “high awareness, low practice” is widespread in GC. The causes of consumers' low practice of GC need to be analyzed from the perspective of time and space from the actual media data. Furthermore, this process assists policymakers and stakeholders to understand the general attitude of the public towards GC, clarifying the propagation path of public emotions and the source of negative emotions. Based on the data from Sina Weibo, this paper applied text mining, a hybrid model of convolutional neural network and long and short-term memory neural network to analyze the public's attention, sentiment tendency and hot topics on GC. The results show that the vast majority of the Chinese public has a positive attitude toward GC; women and economically developed regions are more concerned about GC; the drivers of positive public sentiment toward GC include environmental awareness education, air pollution prevention and control, and online shopping; high green product prices, excessive time costs, chaotic sharing economy and one-size-fits-all solutions lead to negative public sentiment toward GC. By providing public sentiment analysis of GC, this research would assist decision-makers to understand the dissemination mechanism of public will in social media and clarify targeted solutions, which is of great significance for policy formulation and improvement. © 2021

AB  - The article describes the results of teachers using a critical language lens to analyze linguistic stereotypes in TV series, movies, cartoons, and social media posts. I share the key questions teachers asked about language use in texts as well as the results of their analysis. Based in a cultural modeling pedagogy (Lee, 2007), teachers examined the texts of their everyday lives and increased their Critical Language Awareness. They identified linguistic tropes in nostalgic movies and TV shows, and uncovered patterns of associations between kinds of language use and kinds of people. Teachers emphasized the value of the activity for deepening their linguistic awareness and increasing a desire to disrupt linguistic prejudice. They developed multiple options for bringing a critical language lens to their own classrooms and students. © 2022 International Literacy Association.

AB  - With the advent of the era of “we media,” many people's opinions have become easily accessible. Public health emergencies have always been an important aspect of public opinion exchange and emotional communication. In view of this sudden group panic, public opinion cannot be effectively monitored, controlled or guided. This makes it easy to amplify the beliefs and irrationality of social emotions, that threaten social security and stability. Considering the important role of opinion leaders in micro-blogs and users’ interest in micro-blog information, a SIR model of public opinion propagation is constructed based on the novel coronavirus pneumonia model and micro-blog's public health emergencies information. The parameters of the model are calculated by combining the actual crawl data from the novel coronavirus pneumonia epidemic period, and the trends in the evolution of public opinion are simulated by MATLAB. The simulation results are consistent with the actual development of public opinion dissemination, which shows the effectiveness of the model. These research findings can help the government understand the principles that guide the propagation of public opinion and advise an appropriate time to control and correctly guide public opinion. © 2021

AB  - The Ghana National Single Window has become the focus of attention over its potential to move goods swiftly. However, since its inception in 2002, the controversies surrounding the implementation suggest issues beyond trade facilitation. The Information Systems literature primarily ascribes the controversies to resistance to technology. By adopting the Soft Systems Methodology (SSM) as a learning process for understanding port stakeholders' relations and attitudes, we explore the controversies to determine the meanings port stakeholders attribute to them. We combined SSM with interviews, media content analysis and focus groups made possible by snowballing. The responses were analyzed using rich pictures and validated through a conceptual model. The results reveal a fragmented government where ministries, agencies, and personalities assert power in single window implementation through I.T. vendor contracts. The situation results in a high cost of doing business at the port for shippers due to non-transparent and questionable contracts. The public's attitude towards the controversies reflects fears, hopes and expectations and legitimate concerns about important political and social goals. Using SSMs focus on relations and attitudes, we can document how controversies attributed to new technology is not a question of technology but of perceived political interference. © 2021 World Conference on Transport Research Society

AB  - In authoritarian regimes, without voting as a channel to gather public preferences, online public expression may become a major type of public opinion the government collects. However, online information can be biased and thereby mislead decision-makers. Combining data from a survey of judges and a national population survey, this article provides evidence that i) Chinese judges rely on online public opinion to infer public attitudes toward the death penalty, ii) online information is biased – online opinion is more punitive than the general public opinion, and, iii) biased online information seems to have a strong influence on judges’ perception of strong public support for the death penalty, and this may explain why Chinese scholars, lawyers, and other practitioners have persistently overestimated public punitiveness. The findings reveal a less discussed peril of the internet echo chamber: its misleading effect on the information collection process of the government, especially in autocracies. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This article views appraisal as co-selection patterns of target, source and evaluative parameters and investigates the ways in which news discourse retells news stories and reproduces truthful reality. We combined the corpus-assisted method and quantitative/qualitative analysis of the data, i.e., 904 sentences which were extracted from the corpus of German 5G news reports by selecting the top 5 items from each of the noun keywords lists of the three subcorpora of economics, politics and technology news reports. It was found that the German media restage the necessity and desirability to promote the development of German communication facilities/technology through international cooperation, particularly Germany-Sino cooperation. In addition, a hesitant image was evoked as to the high-profile 5G development in Germany with an awareness of the potential security risks and economic losses. On the intersubjective dimension, our findings suggest that journalists make full exploitation of different dialogistic positioning strategies for closing down or opening up the dialogic space to a greater or lesser degree. More specifically, they tend to acknowledge and endorse the positive/negative attitudes attributed to the non-authorial voices towards particular targets in the fields of economics, politics or technology. A future comparison with the genre of news comments or editorials would deepen our understanding of the performativity of media. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - This special issue focuses on the consequences of the heightened conflict between member states and increased politicization of European affairs for electoral politics in the European Union. In this introduction we begin by outlining three important developments that fuelled the politicization: (a) the common currency; (b) the increased pushback on the EU’s open border policies; and (c) the inability of the EU to prevent democratic backsliding in some countries. We then discuss their consequences for EU elections, particularly campaigns, public opinion on Europe and voter behaviour, which are investigated against the backdrop of the 2019 European Parliament elections in the individual articles in this special issue. This introduction provides a contextual framework for these contributions and reflects upon some of its main findings. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Introduction: News media representation of preventive health policies can influence public discussion and political decision making, impacting policy implementation and sustainability. This study analysed news media coverage of the contested ‘last drinks’ alcohol laws in Sydney, Australia, to understand the arguments made by different ‘actors’ (stakeholders) regarding the laws and provide insights on how preventive health policies are positioned within media discourse. Methods: We identified print and online news media articles discussing the laws from 2014 to 2020. Content analysis was used to quantify the arguments made to justify support or opposition to the laws. Results: A total of 445 articles were included for analysis. Four hundred and thirty-five actors were identified, with industry actors mentioned most (213 times) followed by health actors (136 times). There were more quotes from opponents of the laws compared to supporters of the laws (57% vs. 25%). The proportion of media mentions reduced for supporters (34% in 2014 to 14% in 2020) while mentions increased for opponents (47% in 2014 to 73% in 2020). Supporters used arguments about crime, safety and health. Opponents of the laws focused on issues such as Sydney's ‘night time economy’ and negative impacts of the laws. Discussion and Conclusions: Opponents of the laws strategically used the media to influence public debate. Opponents, including industry actors, also ignored the health impacts of alcohol and utilised campaign groups to advocate against the laws. These findings have implications for how governments and advocates communicate and build support for contested preventive health policies. © 2021 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs.

AB  - This article provides the first comprehensive analysis of how parties across 28 countries use digital political marketing on Facebook by drawing on the example of the 2019 European Parliament election. We introduce a theoretical model of political Facebook marketing and compare the paid media activity (sponsored posts, ads) of 186 parties to their owned media (posts) and earned media (user reactions, comments, shares). Our results concerning cross-country patterns indicate that differences in European parties’ paid media activity exist and only a few parties leverage sophisticated targeting strategies. Regarding temporal dynamics, we find that paid media is used to supplement owned media during similar campaign phases. In terms of engagement-triggering effects, we show that sponsoring posts is a suitable tool to increase earned media. Overall, paid media activity on Facebook is largely embedded into parties’ overall marketing strategy and national countries’ regulatory settings. Our results have implications for the understanding of public opinion, voting behaviour and the regulations of elections in modern European democracies. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - We investigate, using concepts from social psychological theories of the determinants of environmental behavior that might be affected by video media, the impact of viewing a short YouTube video about waste reduction while controlling for pre-existing environmental attitudes and beliefs, which is the greatest challenge in evaluating the impact of video media. The experimental design splits respondents approximately evenly between those who viewed the video and those who viewed just a text summarizing the points made in the video. Comparing results for the two subsamples is a way of identifying the impact of the video itself. For the sample as a whole, the video seemed to affect some beliefs and norms more than did the text alone. But for many measures of attitudes and intended behavior, there was no difference between the video and text samples, and sometimes neither sample had a significant change. We present suggestive evidence, though, that both video and text treatments have stronger effects on people who were not already strongly pro-environmental before the experimental treatment. © 2021, AESS.

AB  - Purpose: This mixed-methods study delved into the relationship between orthorexia nervosa (ON) and Instagram. Methods: Two quantitative data sources were used: content analysis of pictures using #orthorexia (n = 3027), and an online questionnaire investigating the experience of ON and the use of Instagram of people sharing ON-related content on Instagram (n = 185). Following, interviews (n = 9) were conducted with people posting ON-related content on Instagram and self-identifying as having (had) ON. Results: People who share ON-related content on Instagram were found to be primarily young women (questionnaire = 95.2% females, mean age 26.2 years; interviews = 100% females, mean age 28.4 years), who were found to be heavy social media users and favor Instagram over other platforms. Questionnaire respondents agreed in defining ON as an obsession with a diet considered healthy, with bio-psycho-social negative consequences, though those who self-identified as having (had) ON were more likely to point out the negative impairments of ON. Interviewees deemed Instagram partially responsible for the development of ON. Instead, they agreed that Instagram encourages problem realization. Content analysis showed that ON is encoded in pictures of ‘food’, ‘people’, ‘text’ and ‘other.’ Interviewees revealed that they started posting to recover, share information, help others, and they felt inspired to post by other accounts. A sense of belonging to the #orthorexia community emerged, where people share values and ideals, and seek validation from others. Conclusion: Conversations around #orthorexia on Instagram generate supportive communities aiding recovery. Individuals use Instagram for helping others and themselves recovering from ON. Understanding how people help each other, manage their health, cope with symptoms, and undertake recovery can inform the implementation of therapeutic interventions for ON. Level of evidence: Level III, evidence obtained from well-designed cohort or case–control analytic studies. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Mass-media coverage is one of the most widely used government strategies on influencing public opinion in times of crisis. Awareness campaigns are highly influential tools to expand healthy behavior practices among individuals during epidemics and pandemics. Mathematical modeling has become an important tool in analyzing the effects of media awareness on the spread of infectious diseases. In this paper, a fractional-order epidemic model incorporating media coverage is presented and analyzed. The problem is formulated using susceptible, infectious and recovered compartmental model. A long-term memory effect modeled by a Caputo fractional derivative is included in each compartment to describe the evolution related to the individuals’ experiences. The well-posedness of the model is investigated in terms of global existence, positivity, and boundedness of solutions. Moreover, the disease-free equilibrium and the endemic equilibrium points are given alongside their local stabilities. By constructing suitable Lyapunov functions, the global stability of the disease-free and endemic equilibria is proven according to the basic reproduction number R. Finally, numerical simulations are performed to support our analytical findings. It was found out that the long-term memory has no effect on the stability of the equilibrium points. However, for increased values of the fractional derivative order parameter, each solution reaches its equilibrium state more rapidly. Furthermore, it was observed that an increase of the media awareness parameter, decreases the magnitude of infected individuals, and consequently, the height of the epidemic peak. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The article investigates news coverage and media framing of the Syrian refugee debate as a public opinion issue in US local news in 2015. The sheer number of refugees created an unprecedented humanitarian crisis as millions of civilians settled in neighboring countries, and a significant number of them embarked on a perilous journey to seek refuge in European countries. The political response to the Syrian refugee crisis was divided, but public attitudes shifted after the terrorist attacks on Paris in November 2015 with calls for more restrictive immigration policies and smaller refugee quotas. In the US, GOP leaders demanded “extreme vetting” and “screening” of refugees and many opposed resettling the modest number of refugees the Obama administration promised to let in. The study analyzes local news coverage variation across the States that welcomed, not welcomed or did not commit to accepting Syrian refugees at the height of the Syrian refugee crisis in 2015 and 2016. The findings of the study demonstrate that the editorial framing of the Syrian refugee crisis downplayed the global responsibility and international commitment of the US, highlighted the administrative costs and framed them as security threats. The implications of these frames are discussed. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This study examined Israeli public perceptions of institutional child sexual abuse (CSA) in the Malka Leifer case. Leifer is a Jewish ultra-Orthodox former Melbourne school principal who is wanted in Australia on CSA charges, after fleeing to Israel. Based on a qualitative analysis of 2,451 reader comments retrieved from four Israeli news websites and six public Facebook pages, the findings indicated diverse attitudes toward the alleged perpetrator, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, state authorities, and victims. All parties involved were criticized, but less so the victims. Criticisms included sociopolitical and gender stereotypes, and demonic attributions. Positive comments were directed at all involved, even the alleged perpetrator, and especially the victims. The results demonstrate the need to better understand CSA portrayals in cyberspace, as they affect both public and policymaker attitudes, and the importance of fighting prejudicial discourse about the ultra-Orthodox community, especially in light of its changing attitudes regarding CSA. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article explores Angela Merkel’s decision to open Germany’s borders to refugees in September 2015 and her support for the EU-Turkey statement in March 2016. While the first policy offered relief to refugees, the second was designed to significantly reduce the number of refugees coming to Europe. Besides the seemingly contradictory rationale behind these two foreign policy decisions, the role that domestic media played in Merkel’s decision to open the borders was remarkable. The connection between media reports and public opinion has long been established, whereas the connection between foreign policy and the media is more recent. However, the link between all three and how they operate together is yet to be studied. By exploring these connections, we show how foreign policy decisions can be accepted by locals within a language context that fosters identification with outsiders. Similarly, a shift in the discourse, which contributed to the perception of a divergence of interests between the local population and the refugees, helps to understand the subsequent change in foreign policy. In short, we show how this shift provides an insight into the parallels between domestic media discourses, public opinion and foreign policy decisions. We apply deductive qualitative content analysis to demonstrate this connection. © The Author(s) 2021.

This study investigates media representations of Islam and Muslims in the American media, drawing upon an analysis of reports in the New York Times over a 17-year period (from Jan.1, 2000 to Dec. 31, 2016) within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. It examines how Islam and Muslims are represented in media coverage and how discursive power is penetrated step by step through such media representations. Most important, it investigates whether Islam and Muslims have been stigmatized through stereotypes, prejudice, and discrimination. The findings reveal that the New York Times’ representations of Islam and Muslims are negative and stereotypical: Islam is stereotyped as the unacclimatized outsider and the turmoil maker and Muslims as the negative receiver. The stereotypes contribute to people’s prejudice, such as Islamophobia from the “us” group and fear of the “them” group but do not support a strong conclusion of discrimination. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The aim of this cross-sectional study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes and prevention practices (KAP) among the garment factory worker population in Bangladesh regarding a historical dengue outbreak in 2019. A total of 400 participants were selected by simple random sampling, and questionnaire-based interviews were conducted. The average score of knowledge, attitude and prevention practice was 8.33 ± 2.35, 6.32 ± 1.20 and 6.31 ± 1.50, respectively. Only 76 out of 400 participants (19%) scored above 10 (all university-educated). Participant workers reported both negative and positive attitudes regarding dengue fever (DF). Negative attitudes included an expectation of increased mortality and strained family finances from DF attacks. A significantly high number of participants (92%) believed that death from DF was inevitable. Positive attitudes included optimism about DF eradication potentials and eagerness to help and donate blood to sick relatives. Participants primarily learned about the DF prevention from mass media (244/400; 61.0%) and social media (97/400; 24.25%). The most popular prevention measures adopted were mosquito repellent incense (344/400; 86.0%) and mosquito nets (389/400; 97.25%). While most participants (358/400; 89.5%) cleaned areas where mosquitos lay eggs, only 169 out of 400 (42.25%) regularly treated with chemical sprays. Only 182 out of 400 (45.5%) reported receiving DF prevention training in the factory. Correlation between DF knowledge and education was statistically significant (r =.38, p <.01, n = 398). Correlation between DF knowledge and work experience was insignificant (r =.01, p >.01, n = 398). Age and DF knowledge were not correlated (r = 0.07, p >.01, n = 398). In conclusion, gaps in KAP for dengue could be addressed by government-sponsored educational programmes that utilize the power of mass/social media for dengue prevention and control. More KAP surveillance studies are needed for other sectors of the society. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH.

AB  - Media coverage of HIV criminal cases has deployed sexualized and racialized tropes, and portrayed defendants as villains. Several media analyses of HIV criminal trials have been conducted, though only one was in the US, and none involved young Black gay men, who are disproportionately impacted by HIV. We conducted content and textual analyses of 91 media stories focused on the 2015 case of Michael Johnson, a Black gay college student living with HIV who was convicted under Missouri’s HIV non-disclosure laws. To capture both dominant and resistant meanings in news stories, we included mainstream news outlets, as well as HIV-related, African American and GLBT community-oriented outlets. Open and axial coding were carried out by a team of four researchers and thematic analysis was used to explore how media framed Johnson, his sexual activities, condom use, and alleged nondisclosure. Results showed that media stories portrayed Johnson as dishonest and sexually predatory by drawing on narratives of deception and framing him as the sole agentic actor in his sexual encounters. We argue that these media frames, coupled with what is included and excluded in media coverage negatively impacts public opinion of PLWH, reinforces HIV criminalization ideologies, and performs a disciplinary function in the lives of PLWH. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The goal of this study was to examine weight stigma experiences during medical visits as related to provider-patient relationship factors and adherence among individuals with hypothyroidism. A total of 362 participants recruited via social media participated in an online survey. Regression and mediation analyses indicated that weight stigma was negatively associated with adherence; this relationship was mediated by decreased trust in provider, less perceived provider empathy, and lower provider-patient depth-of-relationship. Structural equation modeling with BMI controlled revealed that weight stigma is associated with worsened provider-patient relationship and adherence. Findings suggest the importance of eliminating weight stigma experiences for patients. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Whether powerful media outlets have effects on public opinion has been at the heart of theoretical and empirical discussions about the media's role in political life. Yet, the effects of media campaigns are difficult to study because citizens self-select into media consumption. Using a quasi-experiment - the 30-year boycott of the most important Eurosceptic tabloid newspaper, The Sun, in Merseyside caused by the Hillsborough soccer disaster - we identify the effects of The Sun boycott on attitudes toward leaving the EU. Difference-in-differences designs using public opinion data spanning three decades, supplemented by referendum results, show that the boycott caused EU attitudes to become more positive in treated areas. This effect is driven by cohorts socialized under the boycott and by working-class voters who stopped reading The Sun. Our findings have implications for our understanding of public opinion, media influence, and ways to counter such influence in contemporary democracies. © The Author(s), 2021.

AB  - The pervasiveness of partisan media and the 24/7 news cycle allow ample opportunity for partisan-motivated reasoning and selective exposure. Nonetheless, individuals still frequently encounter out-party media outlets and expert pundits through mainstream news and social media. We seek to examine the effects of cross-cutting partisan outlet cues (e.g. Fox News, MSNBC) and direct party cues (e.g. Republican, Democrat) on citizens’ perceptions of ideology, source credibility, and news consumption. Using an experiment that pits outlet cues against direct party cues, we find that cross-cutting outlet and direct party cues lead citizens to perceive pundits as more ideologically moderate. As a result, respondents find out-party pundits on in-party outlets to be less biased, increasing interest in the pundits’ perspectives. However, while cross-cutting pundits gain among the out-party, they lose among the in-party. This trade-off holds important normative implications for individual news consumption and the ability of outlets and pundits to appear unbiased while garnering the largest possible audience. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: This study aims to evaluate the knowledge and attitudes of dairy farmers about climate change in dairy farms in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted following a cross-sectional research design (Bryman, 2012). The study was conducted mainly on dairy farms located on the south-eastern part of the Eastern Cape province in five districts out of the province’s six districts (Figure 1). These districts include Amathole, Chris Hani, OR Tambo and Cacadu; these regions were not included in a recent surveying study (Galloway et al., 2018). Findings: In all, 71.7% of dairy farm workers heard about climate change from the television, and 60.4% of participants reported that they gathered information from radio. Eighty-two out of 106 (77.4%) correctly indicated that climate change is a significant long-term change in expected weather patterns over time, and almost 10% of the study participants had no clue about climate change. Approximately 63% of the respondents incorrectly referred to climate change as a mere hotness or coldness of the day, whereas the remainder of participants correctly refuted that definition of climate change. Most of the study participants correctly mentioned that climate change has an influence on dairy production (92.5%), it limits the dairy cows’ productivity (69.8%) and that dry matter intake of dairy cows is reduced under higher temperatures (75.5%). Research limitations/implications: The use of questionnaire to gather data limits the study, as respondents relied on recall information. Also, the sample size and study area limits use of the study as an inference for the excluded parts of the Eastern Cape Province. Also, it focused only on dairy farm workers and did not request information from beef farmers. Practical implications: This study imply that farmers without adequate knowledge of the impact of climate change keep complaining of a poor yield/ animal productivity and changing pattern of livestock diseases. Hence, a study such as the present one helps to bridge that gap and provide relevant governing authority the needed evidence for policy changes and intervention. Social implications: Farmers will begin to get help from the government regarding climate change. Originality/value: This a first study in South Africa seeking to document the knowledge of dairy farm workers about climate change and its impacts on productivity. © 2021, Yanga Simamkele Diniso, Leocadia Zhou and Ishmael Festus Jaja.

AB  - This study explores the impact of repression of foreign protests and the media source reporting the news upon American foreign policy preferences for democracy promotion abroad. We use two survey experiments featuring carefully edited video treatments to show that even short media clips presenting foreign protests as violently repressed increase American support for targeted sanctions against the hostile regime; however, these treatments alone do not inspire respondents to political action. Furthermore, we do not find evidence that mobile treatment magnifies the effects of violence. ©

AB  - Objective: This study aimed to explore topics and sentiments using tweets from Ontario, Canada, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Tweets were collected from December 5, 2020, to March 6, 2021, excluding non-individual accounts. Dates of vaccine-related events and policy changes were collected from public health units in Ontario. The daily number of COVID-19 cases was retrieved from the Ontario provincial government’s public health database. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for unsupervised topic modelling. VADER was used to calculate daily and average sentiment compound scores for topics identified. Results: Vaccine, pandemic, business, lockdown, mask, and Ontario were six topics identified from the unsupervised topic modelling. The average sentiment compound score for each topic appeared to be slightly positive, yet the daily sentiment compound scores varied greatly between positive and negative emotions for each topic. Conclusion: Our study results have shown a slightly positive sentiment on average during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, along with six topics. Our research has also demonstrated a social listening approach to identify what the public sentiments and opinions are in a timely manner. Copyright © 2022 Tsao, MacLean, Chen, Li, Yang and Butt.

AB  - There are increasingly strict regulations surrounding the purchase and use of combustible tobacco products (i.e., cigarettes); simultaneously, the use of other tobacco products, including e-cigarettes (i.e., vaping products), has dramatically increased. However, public attitudes toward vaping vary widely, and the health effects of vaping are still largely unknown. As a popular social media, Twitter contains rich information shared by users about their behaviors and experiences, including opinions on vaping. It is very challenging to identify vaping-related tweets to source useful information manually. In the current study, we proposed to develop a detection model to accurately identify vaping-related tweets using machine learning and deep learning methods. Specifically, we applied seven popular machine learning and deep learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perception, Transformer Neural Network, and stacking and voting ensemble models to build our customized classification model. We extracted a set of sample tweets during an outbreak of e-cigarette or vaping-related lung injury (EVALI) in 2019 and created an annotated corpus to train and evaluate these models. After comparing the performance of each model, we found that the stacking ensemble learning achieved the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.97. All models could achieve 0.90 or higher after tuning hyperparameters. The ensemble learning model has the best average performance. Our study findings provide informative guidelines and practical implications for the automated detection of themed social media data for public opinions and health surveillance purposes.

AB  - Nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry is a branch of chemistry that has high experimental risks, has high research costs, and is subject to certain prejudices. However, it has an extremely important influence on the development of human life. It is particularly important to emphasize the general education of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry without compromising the quality of the teaching. The introduction of the general education mode into nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry overcomes the shortcomings of narrow audiences. However, single theoretical courses are limited to a slide-based lecture. Although the audience for general education is wide, it is difficult to carry out related experiments because of safety responsibility and teaching funds. In this work, VR technology was first applied to the general education of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry, and the audiences of the course were not limited to students who major in chemistry. The research results showed that not only did the VR platform effectively improve students' learning confidence, but also the effect of teacher-student interaction and the usability of VR equipment were recognized. This work may bring enlightenment to the popularization of nuclear chemistry and radiochemistry through new media technology. © 2022 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Telemedicine is rapidly growing to meet the increased needs for high-quality health care during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, telemedicine is still a sensitive issue as it is related to medical privatization. The use of telemedicine after the COVID-19 outbreak might be influenced by public opinion, and this may be an important key in implementing telemedicine. In this study, we aimed to assess if telemedicine-related newspaper articles and comments changed positively during the COVID-19 pandemic. From January 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020 (before COVID-19), a total of 1073 telemedicine-related articles were found in the Korean news network. Although the post-COVID-19 article collection period (from March 2, 2020, to September 30, 2020) was about half that of the pre-COVID-19, about twice the number (1934) of telemedicine-related articles were collected. And telemedicine-related news articles had a more positive tone post-COVID-19 than pre-COVID-19 (52.9% after vs 40.4% before). In conclusion, this study presented the association between the COVID-19 outbreak and changes in the media’s perception of telemedicine in Korea. This study presented that, as telemedicine begins to be utilized due to COVID-19, news media and readers who embrace it are beginning to view telemedicine positively, suggesting that COVID-19 has a positive foundation for the spread of telemedicine. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Purpose: Voice assistant (VA) technology is one of the fastest-growing artificial intelligence applications at present. However, the burgeoning scholarship argues that there are ethical challenges relating to this new technology, not the least related to privacy, which affects the technology’s acceptance. Given that the media impacts public opinion and acceptance of VA and that there are no studies on media coverage of VA, the study focuses on media coverage. In addition, this study aims to focus on media coverage in Indonesia, a country that has been underrepresented in earlier research. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used critical discourse analysis of media texts, focusing on three levels (text, discourse practice and social practice) to study how VA technology was discussed in the Indonesian context and what power relations frame the representation. In total, 501 articles were collected from seven national media in Indonesia from 2010 to 2020 and the authors particularly focus on the 45 articles that concern ethics. Findings: The ethical topics covered are gender issues, false marketing, ethical wrongdoing, ethically positive effects, misuse, privacy and security. More importantly, when they are discussed, they are presented as constituting no real critical problem. Regarding discursive practices, the media coverage is highly influenced by foreign media and most of the articles are directed to well-educated Indonesians. Finally, regarding social practices, the authors hold that the government ideology of technological advancement is related to this positive portrayal of VAs. Originality/value: First, to provide the first media discourse study about ethical issues of VAs. Second, to provide insights from a non-Western context, namely, Indonesia, which is underrepresented in the research on ethics of VAs. © 2021, Anisa Aini Arifin and Thomas Taro Lennerfors.

AB  - Introduction: Physician–patient conflicts in China have increased more than ten times from the 2000s to the 2020 and arouse heated discussions on microblog. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is believed to have brought a turnaround in the physician–patient relationship. However, little is known about the similarities and differences among the views of opinion leaders from the general public, physicians, and media regarding physician–patient conflict incidents on microblog, and whether the outbreak had an impact on this. Objective: This study aims to explore how opinion leaders from the physicians, general public, and media framed posts on major physician–patient conflict incidents on microblog, and compare the microblog post frames before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings will provide more objective evidence of the attitudes and perspectives of the health professionals, general public, and media on physician–patient conflicts, and the influence of pandemics on physician–patient relationship. Methods: A comparative content analysis was conducted to examine the posts (n = 941) of microblog opinion leaders regarding major physician–patient conflicts in China from 2012 to 2020. Results: Post-pandemic microblog posts used more cooperation, positive and negative frames, but mentioned less health-related knowledge; no difference was found in the use of conflict and attribution frames. Results on the use of frames by opinion leaders from different communities found that the media used more conflict, cooperation, attribution, and positive frames, but used fewer negative frames and mentioned less health-related knowledge than general public and physicians. Results on the use of frames for different incidents found that incidents of violence against physicians used more cooperation, positive and negative frames and mentioned less health-related knowledge; in the contract, incidents of patient death used more attribution frames and mentioned more health-related knowledge. Conclusion: The physician and general public opinion leaders share some similarities in their post frames, implying that no fundamental discrepancy between them regarding physician–patient conflict incidents. However, the imbalanced use of frames by media microblogger would cultivate and reinforce the public perception of physician–patient contradictions. After the COVID-19 pandemic, more cooperation and positive frames were used in the posts, indicating an improvement in the physician–patient relationship in China. Copyright © 2022 Gong and Guo.

AB  - Since the end of 2019, the COVID-19 outbreak worldwide has not only presented challenges for government agencies in addressing public health emergency, but also tested their capacity in dealing with public opinion on social media and responding to social emergencies. To understand the impact of COVID-19 related tweets posted by the major public health agencies in the United States on public emotion, this paper studied public emotional diffusion in the tweets network, including its process and characteristics, by taking Twitter users of four official public health systems in the United States as an example. We extracted the interactions between tweets in the COVID-19-TweetIds data set and drew the tweets diffusion network. We proposed a method to measure the characteristics of the emotional diffusion network, with which we analyzed the changes of the public emotional intensity and the proportion of emotional polarity, investigated the emotional influence of key nodes and users, and the emotional diffusion of tweets at different tweeting time, tweet topics and the tweet posting agencies. The results show that the emotional polarity of tweets has changed from negative to positive with the improvement of pandemic management measures. The public's emotional polarity on pandemic related topics tends to be negative, and the emotional intensity of management measures such as pandemic medical services turn from positive to negative to the greatest extent, while the emotional intensity of pandemic related knowledge changes the most. The tweets posted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration of the United States have a broad impact on public emotions, and the emotional spread of tweets’ polarity eventually forms a very close proportion of opposite emotions. © 2021 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Background The current development of vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is unprecedented. Little is known, however, about the nuanced public opinions on the vaccines on social media. Methods We adopted a human-guided machine learning framework using more than six million tweets from almost two million unique Twitter users to capture public opinions on the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. After feature inference and opinion mining, 10,945 unique Twitter users were included in the study population. Multinomial logistic regression and counterfactual analysis were conducted. Results Socioeconomically disadvantaged groups were more likely to hold polarized opinions on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccines, either pro-vaccine (B=0.40,SE=0.08,P<0.001,OR=1.49;95%CI=1.26–1.75) or anti-vaccine (B=0.52,SE=0.06,P<0.001,OR=1.69;95%CI=1.49–1.91). People who have the worst personal pandemic experience were more likely to hold the anti-vaccine opinion (B=−0.18,SE=0.04,P<0.001,OR=0.84;95%CI=0.77–0.90). The United States public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political issues regarding vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience increases the vaccine acceptance level. Conclusion Opinion on COVID-19 vaccine uptake varies across people of different characteristics. © 2021

AB  - In 2020, men in Turkey murdered 300 women, and 171 women were found suspiciously dead. The dominant narrative around suspicious death cases involves a faulty assumption that women are prone to committing suicide. Women’s organisations and cause lawyers unite against all kinds of violence to challenge this dominant narrative, which grants impunity to perpetrators. Drawing on resource mobilisation theory, this article investigates how women’s organisations become involved in femicide and suspicious death cases to articulate counter-narratives and advance women’s access to justice. It focuses on Şule Çet’s case, which raised intense public reactions due to the lack of procedural fairness at the investigation stage. It relies on semi-structured interviews with Şule’s lawyer and the members of the We Will Stop Femicide Platform (Kadın Cinayetlerini Durduracağız Platformu) and the Gelincik Centre (Gelincik Merkezi) to illustrate how women’s organisations made Şule’s story visible and countered the dominant narrative surrounding suspicious death cases. The findings illustrate that women’s organisations’ ongoing struggle to encourage courts to hear women’s stories demands co-operation between different social and legal mechanisms. It includes a combination of several strategies, such as following femicide cases and forming public opinion through social media. The article concludes by arguing that women’s organisations’ use of counter-narratives transforms femicide cases from being only a statistic to a public cause, contributing to women’s struggle in accessing justice. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Climate change remains one of the most important challenges of the 21st century, both for organizations as well as for society. While many corporates around the globe embed sustainability goals into their strategies, inclusive research on the public perceptions of the same is limited. Aiming to fill this gap, we apply an innovative natural language processing approach to determine the persuasiveness of corporate climate agendas. Based on public opinion data from various online platforms (n=5284), research is conducted to understand whether stakeholders structurally support or oppose the sustainability agendas. For this purpose, reactions and statements of users were mined, subjected to a sentiment analysis and have been examined concerning their polarity both platform-specific and cross-platform. While on the one hand the research helps company representatives to better understand the effectiveness of their proposed agenda and strategic positioning, our approach also challenges traditional ways of collecting data and measuring public opinion through interviews, questionnaires or surveys. Compared to other studies dealing with opinion research, our analysis sets new academic impulses by analyzing the very topical and demanded issue of evaluating sustainability campaigns. The study does not only provide evidence of an overall optimistic attitude towards corporate sustainability targets, but also sheds light on the polarity of public opinion and the share of perceptions. We were able to show that with an overarching average ratio of 4:1, sustainability ambitions are supported, whereby concerns on average can only be found in 1 of out 10 reactions, which contributes significant insights for steering transitioning companies as well as for the corresponding management by campaign leaders. © 2022 WITPress.

AB  - The (purely) relative definition of poverty remains influential as an evaluative yardstick for various government policies. Left-wing social policy scholars and anti-poverty campaigners' strong commitment to it contrasts sharply with public attitudes. Regression models using British Social Attitudes data found that ideological orientation was the most consistently powerful predictor of how people define poverty. Evidence suggests anti-poverty organisations' campaign failures might be due to ideological opposition or to the conceptual weakness of purely relative poverty rather than (as campaigners have claimed) ineffective campaign tactics or the influence of the mass media. Conservative politicians have little to fear in opposing the Marxist concept. © 2021 The Author. Economic Affairs published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Institute of Economic Affairs.

AB  - Shopping behaviour in response to extreme events is often characterized as “panic buying” which connotes irrationality and loss of control. However, “panic buying” has been criticized for attributing shopping behaviour to people’s alleged psychological frailty while ignoring other psychological and structural factors that might be at play. We report a qualitative exploration of the experiences and understandings of shopping behaviour of members of the public at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews with 23 participants, we developed three themes. The first theme addresses people’s understandings of “panic buying”. When participants referred to “panic buying” they meant observed product shortages (rather than the underlying psychological processes that can lead to such behaviours), preparedness behaviours, or emotions such as fear and worry. The second theme focuses on the influence of the media and other people’s behaviour in shaping subsequent shopping behaviours. The third theme addresses the meaningful motivations behind increased shopping, which participants described in terms of preparedness; some participants reported increased shopping behaviours as a response to other people stockpiling, to reduce their trips to supermarkets, or to prepare for product shortages and longer stays at home. Overall, despite frequently using the term ‘panic’, the irrationalist connotations of “panic buying” were largely absent from participants’ accounts. Thus, “panic buying” is not a useful concept and should not be used as it constructs expected responses to threat as irrational or pathological. It can also facilitate such behaviours, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. © 2022 Ntontis et al.

AB  - This paper aims to analyze the divergent perspectives of Indian and Pakistani English print media on opening the Kartarpur corridor. It is a four-kilometer-long cordoned-off strip from the Indo-Pak international border to the Gurdwara Darbar Sahib Kartarpur located in Pakistan. The basic purpose of establishing this corridor is to give easy access to the Indian Sikh community. The initiative was taken into account in August 2018, which resulted in the appearance of a vast quantity of contemplations in the national print media of both countries, especially until the opening of the corridor in November 2019. Print media plays a key role in building knowledge and framing the general public’s opinion through interpreting an issue. The data were taken from Dawn, The News International (Pakistan), The Times of India, and Hindustan Times (India) from August 2018 to March 2020 using Lexus Nexus Library. The corpus analysis was carried out by applying the lexical study of Natural Language Processing (NLP) through its Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) tool to find out the general patterns or topics in the print media of both countries. It was found that Pakistani print media terms the Kartarpur corridor as a sign of regional peace, religious tourism, mediation, and diplomatic efforts. In contrast, Indian print media focuses on apprehensions related to traveling modalities, pilgrimage facilities, and tensions between the two states. © 2022 Ahmed et al.

AB  - Authenticity is an increasingly important factor in citizens’ evaluations of political candidates and their voting decisions. As citizens value political authenticity, politicians attempt to appear true to themselves in the public eye. However, little research has examined how these perceptions of politicians as more or less authentic are constructed. This study examines how citizens form perceptions of politicians’ authenticity and particularly sheds light on the relationship between political media exposure and perceived political authenticity. Drawing on the literature on performed authenticity in social media, personalized media coverage, and information processing, we examine the effects of exposure to political information in different media on perceptions of political authenticity and its subdimensions. Results from an online quota survey in Germany (N = 1,210) show that differences in perceived political authenticity are not simply determined by citizens’ political attitudes but can also be explained by their frequency of exposure to political information in different media types. When citizens use private TV news, political accounts on social media, and follow candidate profiles, they perceive politicians as more authentic. Our analyses also suggest that some effects of media exposure on perceived political authenticity are conditioned by citizens’ party identification and their tendency to select ideologically congruent political information. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The #MeToo movement, from its creation by activist Tarana Burke back in 2006 to its explosion on social media during the 2017 Harvey Weinstein sexual assault allegations, has continuously propagated images of gendered resistance from around the globe. In South Korea, Poland, Mexico, Bangladesh, and more, large numbers of women protest a variety of gendered topics: From unjust rulings in cases of domestic violence, to the lack of reproductive rights, to femicide, to inaction by law enforcement on cases of stalking, harassment, or sexual assault, and more. These images clearly demonstrate that public resistance is dominated by women, even in societies that are seen to traditionally subjugate women—though this is not new, and women have always been involved in resistance even when there was no way to document their participation. However, in countries where conservative institutions, public opinion, and government policy that contribute to gender inequality are paired with punitive action for opposition, women face a higher risk of being punished, ostracized, or brutalized for their resistance. In Thailand, a military state with perhaps the strictest lèse majesté laws in the world, activists are frequently fined, imprisoned, kept under surveillance, disappeared, or forced to flee. Despite this, Thailand experiences frequent surges of public resistance, dominated by youth and overwhelmingly by women. Since February 2020, a large portion of the Thai population, consisting primarily of students, has taken to public demonstrations demanding a fair democracy and constitutional reform, joined together in exasperation over an uncertain future, a crippling economy, an untouchable elite, and a rigged election. In this now years-long movement, fueled by global support and sophisticated protest tactics learned from watching Hong Kong, we observe the inclusion of gendered protest topics and demands by Thai women and girls. This paper demonstrates how Thai women utilize the movement to demand progress in gendered areas by examining examples taken throughout the 2020 pro-democracy protest movement, with the overall objective of contributing to understanding the relationship between public resistance and feminism. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The rise of cyberbullying has been of great concern for the general public. This study aims to explore public attitudes towards cyberbullying on Chinese social media. Cognition and emotion are important components of attitude, and this study innovatively used text analysis to extract the cognition and emotion of the posts. We used a web crawler to collect 53,526 posts related to cyberbullying in Chinese on Sina Weibo in a month, where emotions were detected using the software “Text Mind”, a Chinese linguistic psychological text analysis system, and the content analysis was performed using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic model. Sentiment analysis showed the frequency of negative emotion words was the highest in the posts; the frequency of anger, anxiety, and sadness words decreased in turn. The topic model analysis identified three common topics about cyberbullying: Critiques on cyberbullying and support for its victims, rational expressions of anger and celebrity worship, and calls for further control. In summary, this study quantitatively reveals the negative attitudes of the Chinese public toward cyberbullying and conveys specific public concerns via three common topics. This will help us to better understand the demands of the Chinese public so that targeted support can be proposed to curb cyberbullying. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the dynamics of sentiment polarisation in the active online discussion communities formed around a controversial topic—immigration. Using a collection of tweets in the Swedish language from 2012 to 2019, we track the development of the communities and their sentiment polarisation trajectories over time and in the context of an exogenous shock represented by the European refugee crisis in 2015. To achieve the goal of the study, we apply methods of network and sentiment analysis to map users’ interactions in the network communities and quantify users’ sentiment polarities. The results of the analysis give little evidence for users’ polarisation in the network and its communities, as well as suggest that the crisis had a limited effect on the polarisation dynamics on this social media platform. Yet, we notice a shift towards more negative tonality of users’ sentiments after the crisis and discuss possible explanations for the above-mentioned observations. © 2022 Kopacheva, Yantseva.

AB  - During major public health emergencies, a series of coupling problems of rumors getting out of control and public psychological imbalance always emerge in social media, which bring great interference for crisis disposal. From the perspective of social psychological stress, it is important to depict the interactive infection law among distinct types of rumor engagers (i.e., advocates, supporters, and amplifiers) under different social psychological stress states, and explore the effectiveness of rumor intervention strategies (i.e., hindering and persuasion) from multiple dimensions, to scientifically predict the situation of public opinion field and guide the public to restore psychological stability. Therefore, this paper constructs an interactive infection model of multiple rumor engagers under different intervention situations based on a unique user‐aggregated dataset collected from a Chinese leading online microblogging platform (“Sina Weibo”) during the COVID‐19 in 2020. The simulation result shows that (1) in the period of social psychological alarm reaction, the strong level of hindering intervention on the rumor engagers leads to more serious negative consequences; (2) in the period of social psychological resistance, the persuasion and hindering strategies can both produce good outcomes, which can effectively reduce the overall scale of rumor supporters and amplifiers and shorten their survival time in social media; (3) in the period of social psychological exhaustion, rumor intervention strategies are not able to have a significant impact; (4) the greater the intensity of intervention, the more obvious the outcome. Experimental findings provide a solid research basis for enhancing social psychological stress outcomes and offer decision‐making references to formulate the rumor combating scheme. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The objective of this study is to evaluate food wastage attitudes and the impact of social media among the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population. A questionnaire was distributed via social network applications (n = 525). The majority of the respondents were females (84%) and social media users (99%). Most of the respondents were well aware of the problem of food wastage (96%). Half of the respondents (53.7 and 48.8%) reported taking some form of action on an ‘often’ basis to reduce food wastage, and buying food as per their needs, respectively. Two-thirds (66.7%) of the respondents stated that their family did not throw away anything from their last meal. A majority (82.3%) felt uncomfortable upon discarding food. A mixed response was observed in terms of food wastage and social media usage. On one hand, using social media was significantly (p < 0.05) associated with measuring the exact quantity of ingredients prior to preparation, lower overall family wastage, eating leftovers, and composting. On the other hand, less-frequent social media users significantly (p < 0.05) had fewer leftovers, checked expiry dates, were more serious about food wastage, and planned to minimize it. Social media should be used with prudence as it may not have a very significant impact on food wastage reduction. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - User-generated content (UGC) is a relatively young field of research; however, it has been proven useful in disciplines such as hospitality and tourism, to elicit public opinions of place usage. In landscape architecture and urban planning, UGC has been used to understand people’s emotions and movement in a space, while other areas and additional functions are yet to be discovered. This paper explores the capability of UGC in revealing city-scale park management problems and the applicability of social media as a future tool in bridging visitor feedback to city parks and recreation department staff. This research analyzed the spatial characteristics and patterns of Google Maps review quantity, rating score, and review comments. The results of this pilot study indicate the spatial and structural features of the Chicago parks and demonstrate distribution problems, financial investment priority concerns, park usage characteristics, and user preferences of the park attributes. Findings affirm that user-generated online reviews can be used as an alternative and self-reporting data source to effectively assess the natural performance and users’ experience of city parks and can potentially serve as an evaluative tool for public park management. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Plastic pollution is one of the most significant environmental issues in the world. The rapid increase of the cumulative amount of plastic waste has caused alarm, and the public have called for actions to mitigate its impacts on the environment. Numerous governments and social activists from various non-profit organisations have set up policies and actively promoted awareness and have engaged the public in discussions on this issue. Nevertheless, social responsibility is the key to a sustainable environment, and individuals are accountable for performing their civic duty and commit to behavioural changes that can reduce the use of plastics. This paper explores a set of topic modelling techniques to assist policymakers and environment communities in understanding public opinions about the issues related to plastic pollution by analysing social media data. We report on an experiment in which a total of 274,404 tweets were collected from Twitter that are related to plastic pollution, and five topic modelling techniques, including (a) Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), (b) Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP), (c) Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI), (d) Non-Negative Matrix Factorisation (NMF), and (e) extension of LDA—Structural Topic Model (STM), were applied to the data to identify popular topics of online conversations, considering topic coherence, topic prevalence, and topic correlation. Our experimental results show that some of these topic modelling techniques are effective in detecting and identifying important topics surrounding plastic pollution, and potentially different techniques can be combined to develop an efficient system for mining important environment-related topics from social media data on a large scale. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Previous scholarly literature has documented a pronounced increase in the prevalence of prejudice-denoting terms in American news media content. Some have referred to this shift in journalistic discourse and related public opinion trends signaling increasing perceptions of prejudice severity in U.S. society as The Great Awokening. This work analyzes whether the increasing prevalence of prejudice themes in American news media outlets has been replicated in the news media ecosystem of a Spanish-speaking country. Thus, we computationally analyzed the prevalence of words denoting prejudice in five million news and opinion articles written between 1976 and 2019 and published in three of the most widely read newspapers in Spain: El País, El Mundo and ABC. We report that within the studied time period, the frequency of terms that denote specific prejudice types related to gender, ethnicity, sexuality and religious orientation has also substantially increased across the analyzed Spanish news media outlets. There are, however, some notable distinctions in the long-term usage dynamics of prejudice-denoting terms between the leading Spanish newspaper of record, El País, and its U.S. counterpart, The New York Times. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Background: Flavored electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) have become popular in recent years, especially among youth and young adults. To address the epidemic of e-cigarettes, New York State approved a ban on sales of most flavored vaping products other than tobacco and menthol flavors on September 17, 2019. Objective: This study aims to examine the attitude of Twitter users to the policy on flavored e-cigarettes in New York State and the impact of this policy on public perceptions of e-cigarettes. This study also compares the attitudes and topics between New York Twitter users and Twitter users from other states who were not directly affected by this policy. Methods: Tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes were collected using the Twitter streaming application programming interface from June 2019 to December 2019. Tweets from New York State and those from other states that did not have a flavored e-cigarette policy were extracted. Sentiment analysis was applied to analyze the proportion of negative and positive tweets about e-cigarettes or the flavor policy. Topic modeling was applied to e-cigarette-related data sets and New York flavor policy-related data sets to identify the most frequent topics before and after the announcement of the New York State policy. Results: We found that the average number of tweets related to e-cigarettes and the New York State policy on flavored e-cigarettes increased in both New York State and other states after the flavor policy announcement. Sentiment analysis revealed that after the announcement of the New York State flavor policy, in both New York State and other states, the proportion of negative tweets on e-cigarettes increased from 34.07% (4531/13,299) to 44.58% (18,451/41,390) and from 32.48% (14,320/44,090) to 44.40% (64,262/144,734), respectively, while positive tweets decreased significantly from 39.03% (5191/13,299) to 32.86% (13,601/41,390) and from 42.78% (18,863/44,090) to 33.93% (49,105/144,734), respectively. The majority of tweets related to the New York State flavor policy were negative both before and after the announcement of this policy in both New York (87/98, 89% and 3810/4565, 83.46%, respectively) and other states (200/255, 78.4% and 12,695/15,569, 81.54%, respectively), while New York State had a higher proportion of negative tweets than other states. Topic modeling results demonstrated that teenage vaping and health problems were the most discussed topics associated with e-cigarettes. Conclusions: Public attitudes toward e-cigarettes became more negative on Twitter after New York State announced the policy on flavored e-cigarettes. Twitter users in other states that did not have such a policy on flavored e-cigarettes paid close attention to the New York State flavor policy. This study provides some valuable information about the potential impact of the flavored e-cigarettes policy in New York State on public attitudes toward flavored e-cigarettes. © Li Sun, Xinyi Lu, Zidian Xie, Dongmei Li.

AB  - The potential of games in empowering underrepresented groups is a central theme in the field of media studies. However, to ensure that everyone can benefit from them, it is necessary to ensure that they are inclusive and accessible. In the present work, we have implemented a Participatory Action Research (PAR) approach to target this problem, right at the stage of training new game designers and game developers. Thus, through a game-design-based or experimental game design pedagogical approach, we intended to promote inclusive and accessibility-driven game design and development skills in students, while decreasing their negative attitudes towards people with Intellectual Disability (pwID). A protocol with a Non-Governmental Organization in the field was established and, during two semesters, students were challenged to develop 10 accessible games and physical interfaces for pwID and motor disabilities, through participatory processes. Pre and post assessment was conducted, through a mixed-method approach. After participating in this process, students reported satisfaction and increased knowledge of cognitive and motor accessibility, and inclusive game design in general. Moreover, the attitudinal assessment showed significantly lower levels of prejudiced beliefs towards pwID (p < 0.05). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Instagram is used as an effective and visual marketing channel for building brand equity in the minds of consumers. Therefore, this study aims to classify Instagram marketing activities and analyze the associated effects on customer-based brand equity (brand awareness, brand image, perceived quality, brand love, and Instagram re-usage intention) formation through Instagram marketing activities. To this end, data were collected from 358 coffee consumers who had visited any of the five coffee brand Instagram accounts used in this study and analyzed using SPSS and AMOS. The results showed that four sub-dimensions (interaction, entertainment, customization, and trendiness) of Instagram marketing activities affect brand equity (brand awareness, brand image, and perceived quality), which in turn led to attitudinal loyalty (brand love) and behavioral loyalty (Instagram re-usage intention) towards the brand. This research comprehensively illustrates the influences of Instagram marketing activities on customer-based brand equity. The findings of this study will enable coffee brands to more accurately forecast the future purchasing behaviors of their customers through Instagram marketing activities and provide a guide to managing brand equity as well. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, social media analysis is arousing great interest in various scientific fields, such as sociology, political science, linguistics, and computer science. Large amounts of data gath-ered from social media are widely analyzed for extracting useful information concerning people’s behaviors and interactions. In particular, they can be exploited to analyze the collective sentiment of people, understand the behavior of user groups during global events, monitor public opinion close to important events, identify the main topics in a public discussion, or detect the most frequent routes followed by social media users. As an example of the countless works in the state-of-the-art on social media analysis, this paper presents three significant applications in the field of opinion and pattern mining from social media data: (i) an automatic application for discovering user mobility patterns, (ii) a novel application for estimating the political polarization of public opinion, and (iii) an application for discovering interesting social media discussion topics through a hashtag recommendation system. Such applications clearly highlight the abundance and wealth of useful information in many application contexts of human life that can be extracted from social media posts. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The mobile internet has resulted in intimate partner violence (IPV) events not being viewed as interpersonal and private issues. Such events become public events in the social network environment. IPV has become a public health issue of widespread concern. It is a challenge to obtain systematic and detailed data using questionnaires and interviews in traditional Chinese culture, because of face-saving and the victim’s shame factors. However, online comments about specific IPV events on social media provide rich data in understanding the public’s attitudes and emotions towards IPV. By applying text mining and sentiment analysis to the field of IPV, this study involved construction of a Chinese IPV sentiment dictionary and a complete research framework. We analyzed the trends of the Chinese public’s emotional evolution concerning IPV events from the perspectives of a time series as well as geographic space and social media. The results show that the anonymity of social networks and the guiding role of opinion leaders result in traditional cultural factors such as face-saving and family shame for IPV events being no longer applicable, leading to the spiral of an anti-silence effect. Meanwhile, in the process of public emotional communication, anger often overwhelms reason, and the spiral of silence remains in effect in social media. In addition, there are offensive words used in the IPV event texts that indicate misogyny in emotional, sexual, economic and psychological abuse. Fortunately, mainstream media, as crucial opinion leaders in the social network, can have a positive role in guiding public opinion, improving people’s ability to judge the validity of network information, and formulating people’s rational behaviour. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act granted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authority to regulate tobacco advertising and promotion, including at the retail level, and preserved state, tribal, and local tobacco advertising and promotion authorities. Public health experts have proposed prohibiting point-of-sale tobacco advertisements and product displays, among other tobacco advertising restrictions. We examined the prevalence and correlates of public support, opposition, and neutrality toward proposed tobacco product placement and advertising restrictions at point-of-sale and on social media utilizing the National Cancer Institute's 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) (N = 3865), a cross-sectional, probability-based postal survey of U.S. addresses conducted from Feb 24, 2020 to June 15, 2020 (Bethesda, MD). Frequencies and unadjusted, weighted proportions were calculated for support, neutrality, and opposition toward the three policies under study, and weighted, adjusted multivariable logistic regression was employed to examine predictors of neutrality and opposition. Tests of significance were conducted at the p < 0.05 level. Sixty-two percent of U.S. adults supported a policy prohibiting tobacco product advertising on social media; 55% supported a policy restricting the location of tobacco product advertising at point-of-sale; and nearly 50% supported a policy to keep tobacco products out of view at the checkout counter. Neutrality and opposition varied by sociodemographic characteristics including age, sex, education, rurality, and presence of children in the household. Understanding public opinion toward tobacco product placement and advertising restrictions may inform policy planning and implementation. © 2021

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has generated a new reality worldwide and reconfigured identities, behaviors and interests. It has called for heroic representations and highlighted the role of social media in efficient communication. All of the above considered, the current article focuses on the representation of the COVID-19 pandemic generated by the undergraduate students enrolled in the Social Work study program in Transilvania University of Brașov (Romania) by indicating the main connotations of the pandemic and drawing a comparison between students’ representation and the early representations of the same pandemic produced by specialized literature on the topic. The thematic analysis of the essays produced by students highlights their frustration with the havoc brought about by the pandemic to their graduation plans and with the lack of interaction with colleagues and academic staff, as well as their gratitude for the efforts undertaken by their professors to make online education functional, their availability to adapt and support the restrictive measures imposed by authorities, and their optimism about the evolution of the pandemic. The content analysis of 60 bibliographic sources on the topic of COVID-19, indicated by the Anelis+ network as the most relevant in the spring of 2020, highlights a thematic convergence between the aforementioned sources and students’ representation of COVID-19, and thus their responsible attitude toward meeting the challenges of the pandemic. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The National Examination (UN) is a system of evaluation of education standards for elementary and secondary schools conducted nationally and is also used to equalize the quality between education levels. The national examination aims to determine graduation, national education quality mapping, and also for selection to higher education levels. Over the years the UN has become a benchmark for the standardization of education in Indonesia, meaning that the UN is very much needed to find out the size of the quality of student education and the quality of teaching of a school. The government’s policy regarding the plan to remove the UN system has received public attention. The removal of the UN is planned to be replaced with a competency assessment and character survey. In order to know the public’s sentiments regarding this policy, research needs to be done, one of which is to analyze public sentiment through social media Twitter. In text mining tasks such as text classification and sentiment analysis, careful selection of a term weighting scheme (TWS) can have a significant impact on effectiveness. We tested the effectiveness of six classification algorithms by varying the TWS in the dataset obtained from Twitter. The experimental results showed that overall TF-IGM outperformed TF-IDF on four classification algorithms. Finally, the sentiment analysis of the discourse on the removal of the UN is expected to provide a general picture to the government regarding public opinion from the point of view of data coming from social media. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Does a large influx of asylum seekers in the local community lead to a backlash in public opinion towards foreign populations? We assess the effects of asylum seeker presence using original survey and macro-level municipality data from Austria, exploiting exogenous elements of the placement of asylum seekers on the municipality level. Methodologically, we draw on entropy balancing for causal identification. Our findings are threefold. First, respondents in municipalities receiving asylum seekers report substantially higher exposure on average, but largely without the stronger contact that would allow for meaningful interaction. Second, hostility towards asylum seekers on average increased in areas that housed them. Third, this backlash spilt over: general attitudes towards Muslims and immigrants are less favourable in contexts with local asylum seeker presence, while vote intention for the main anti-immigration party is higher. Our findings go beyond existing work by examining contact directly as a mechanism, by showing a backlash effect in the medium term, and by focusing on a broad set of attitudinal and behavioural measures. Our results point to a need to design policy interventions that minimise citizen backlash against rapid migration inflows. © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - Research Summary: This study investigates the role of the news media in shaping attitudes toward the protests of 2020. Using data from a nationally representative election survey, it examines the association between news consumption and support for law-and-order policies to address protest violence, with perceptions that the protesters were violent as a potential mediator. Findings indicate that viewers of online news are less likely to support law-and-order policies. This relationship is mediated by perceived protester violence, with perceived violence enhancing support for law-and-order policies. Further examination shows that political bias plays a role: viewers of left-leaning sites are less likely to support law-and-order policies to address protest violence, while viewers of right-leaning sites are more likely. These relationships are also mediated by perceived violence. Policy Implications: A slight majority of respondents indicate that they lean toward solving problems of racism and police violence, indicating that much of the American public is open to criminal justice reform. Perceived violence helps to shape the association of online news media with support for law-and-order policies. Activists should avoid violence in their protests and use Internet-based media sources to publicize their peaceful activities and demands. Law enforcement agencies should use the Internet and social media to keep the public informed of the reality of protests, especially of any violence that occurs, in an effort to justify forceful tactics. © 2021 American Society of Criminology

AB  - Sustainability is one of the major challenges that societies are facing. The question of why and how consumer food sustainability related issues (e.g., food waste, sustainable food shopping behavior, among others) are placed on the public agenda is therefore of high interest to food policy makers. Drawing from media agenda setting theory, this study provides the first analysis of how relationships between consumer food sustainability-related frames appear in the media. Focusing on the COVID-19 crisis, it is examined how the media framed food sustainability issues in 2019 and 2020. 271 newspaper stories are investigated through a rather new approach to quantitative content analysis that incorporated binary coding, optimal scaling, and path analysis. The study's findings point to various significant relationships between frame contents and implications and similarly bring to light the moderating effects of the COVID-19 crisis and ‘article authorship’ on a number of these relationships. The findings contribute to the understanding of how public opinion regarding food sustainability develops and can help food policymakers and authorities seeking to develop, position, and address issues relevant to food sustainability. © 2021 The Author(s)

AB  - The scope of cyberspace weapons is expanding from the physical network domain to the cognitive information domain. Technologies such as network penetration, public opinion guidance and attacks, cognitive intervention and control will become the main development directions. Controlling public opinion and controlling audiences will become the cyberspace cognitive domain. In recent years, emerging network media such as social networks and mobile communication networks have played an important organizational and planning role in a series of significant events, which are likely to cause severe threats to national security and even the international community's stability. We analyzed and clarified social network actors, environment, scene, manipulation and ethical framework. We conclude that social public opinion weapons are mainly divided into six categories: Bot, Botnet, Troll, Manipulate real people and events, Cyborg, and Hacked or stolen. Since social network warfare is a brand new war situation in the context of great powers, in social media, the confrontation of camps can be observed. States use social media platforms to penetrate and media war, and its Internet space monitor and build defenses. A digital wall has been placed horizontally on the boundary of the virtual space. In recent years, as the trend towards weaponization of social media has become increasingly apparent, military powers such as the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia have taken the initiative to take the lead in the field of social media. All countries continue to strengthen the research on fundamental cognitive theories. Many basic research projects that integrate information, biology, network, and cognition have been launched one after another. The combat practice shows that the effectiveness of social media even exceeds some traditional combat methods. With the prominent role of social media in modern warfare, its combat use has become increasingly widespread and has gradually become a force multiplier in modern warfare. At present, the deployment of weapons directed by social network users in significant countries is mainly focused on incident and public opinion reconnaissance, sentiment analysis, and active intervention. Our research enumerates the social weapon component model and software architecture. In short, all countries are using social media to spread political propaganda and influence the digital information ecosystem. This article enhances our understanding and development trend of public opinion wars in the social network, and proposes an architecture system for the social weapon arsenal. The technical means, scale, scope, and precision of social media weapons have been continuously improved. It is gaining momentum to reshape the cyberspace security pattern of various countries fundamentally. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Based on role congruity theory, we investigated how gender bias may influence public attitudes toward the vaccine in Turkey. Using a between-subjects design, we tested whether an emphasis on the female versus the male scientist as the vaccine’s inventor in a news story influenced attitudes about the BioNTech vaccine and vaccination intentions. Partly confirming role congruity theory, three-way interaction results from 665 participants demonstrated that among male participants with a stronger belief in traditional gender roles (compared to males with lower belief), the presence of the female inventor, either by herself or together with the male inventor, decreased the perceived efficacy and safety of the vaccine and reduced intentions to be vaccinated by the BioNTech vaccine. We did not observe such differences for women. These findings highlight how gender bias may influence individuals’ information processing and decision making in a way that may have negative consequences for public health. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Purpose: COVID-19, a causative agent of the potentially fatal disease, has raised great global public health concern. Information spreading on the COVID-19 outbreak can strongly influence people behaviour in social media. This paper aims to question of information spreading on COVID-19 outbreak are addressed with a massive data analysis on Twitter from a multidimensional perspective. Design/methodology/approach: The evolutionary trend of user interaction and the network structure is analysed by social network analysis. A differential assessment on the topics evolving is provided by the method of text clustering. Visualization is further used to show different characteristics of user interaction networks and public opinion in different periods. Findings: Information spreading in social media emerges from different characteristics during various periods. User interaction demonstrates multidimensional cross relations. The results interpret how people express their thoughts and detect topics people are most discussing in social media. Research limitations/implications: This study is mainly limited by the size of the data sets and the unicity of the social media. It is challenging to expand the data sets and choose multiple social media to cross-validate the findings of this study. Originality/value: This paper aims to find the evolutionary trend of information spreading on the COVID-19 outbreak in social media, including user interaction and topical issues. The findings are of great importance to help government and related regulatory units to manage the dissemination of information on emergencies, in terms of early detection and prevention. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Twitter has emerged as outstanding and most prominent social media in today’s technological age. The data proliferates in quick and words with its activities trigger get fast responses from the users. This platform is perfect for promoting political perspectives, particularly when election campaigns are on its peak. Political trends on Twitter media has been contemplated in the course of recent years. In the past research, both supervised and unsupervised methodologies have been used to analyze the Twitter trends. Most of the Tweet classification approaches utilized built in Dictionaries, Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), decision tree and Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers. However, in case of democratic election these trends can be mined to predict the winning party. However, all such approaches produce poor results due to language issues, low accuracy, limited access to internet and lower literacy rate in less developed countries such as Pakistan. This research study, find the best possible way for collection of tweets related to different political parties and build a prediction model that may analyze sentiments and opinions expressed by peoples in their Tweets. In this research work, a prediction based model along with novel similarity measure has been proposed to predict the election results of political parties in Pakistan. The proposed work is composed of data collection, preprocessing, aspect extraction, aspect refinement and final prediction using Bayesian theorem. Form the experimental results, it is concluded that proposed approach perform better than existing techniques by obtaining almost 98% accuracy and efficiently cover the limitations of existing studies. © 2021, Korean Spatial Information Society.

AB  - Environmental protection issues are at the forefront of the vast majority of the media and public opinion. The study in question revealed the life cycle of a product commonly used in the home, the bottle of fresh pasteurised milk. The materials used for the manufacturing of the bottles are PET (PolyEthylene Terephthalate), plastic derived from fossil resources, and PLA (PolyLactic Acid), bioplastic derived from sugar cane, therefore from renewable resources. The life cycle of the bottles was carried out by highlighting the extraction phase of raw materials, the production of polymer, bottle, other packaging and distribution of milk and lastly, final disposal, excluding the phase of use, not significant for the purposes of this study. The studies were focused on two disposal scenarios, the current scenario and the one that is likely to take place in 10 years. In the current disposal scenario, there is no clear reduction in environmental impact from the comparison of the materials examined. With reference to the 2030 disposal scenario, the PLA turns out to be much more environmentally friendly. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Given the profound role that media play in public opinion, there exists an ongoing necessity to understand the portrayal of mental illness by journalists. There is a plethora of studies that have examined how mental illness is portrayed in the media, but few studies have sought to understand what journalist opinions about mental illness are, and none could be found regarding journalism students’ opinions. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining journalism student’s attitudes towards mental illness using the Social Distance Scale (SDS). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate journalism students (n = 172) completed the SDS with findings suggesting that students had moderate stigmatizing attitudes, with varying degrees of stigma present depending on the social context. Positively framed reporting and constructive media coverage surrounding mental illness may be improved by shared communication and education with health professionals who specialize in mental health: mental health nurses. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - With the rapid development of social media, reliable information released by the public on social media can provide important decision-making support. Therefore, the consideration of the public as another decision-making body participating in large-scale group decision-making (LSGDM) problems has become an extensively researched topic. However, the participation of the public as a decision-making body with decision-making experts faces several issues, such as the acquisition of public opinion, the reliability of public opinion, the integration of public and expert opinions, etc. Given this, this paper proposes a public and large-scale expert information fusion method that considers public dynamic reliability via sentiment analysis and intuitionistic fuzzy number (IFN) expressions. First, sentiment analysis technology is used to process public social media data and obtain IFNs as the opinions of the public decision-making body. Second, the concept of public dynamic reliability is defined to measure the degree of integration of public opinion. Third, a novel information entropy measure of IFNs is proposed, and a new method is introduced to determine the criteria weights under the two different decision-making bodies. Finally, an optimization model that considers the consensus levels of expert subgroups is proposed to determine the weights of different decision-making bodies. The public and expert opinions are then aggregated to obtain collective decision-making information. A case study is proposed to illustrate the application of the proposed method, and the comparative analysis reveals the features and advantages of this model. © 2021

AB  - As the Environmental Protection Law was revised and media public opinion supervise them, enterprises need to not only undertake more environmental protection responsibilities but also alleviate the contradiction between development and environment. By applying a multiple regression model, this paper studies the impact of air pollution on the management behavior of enterprises using the panel data of China’s A-share polluting enterprises listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets between 2014 and 2019. The results of this study are as follows: First, air pollution produces a positive impact on the behavior of corporate green management. Second, media reports have brought more attention to corporate pollution and increased the positive impact of air pollution on corporate green management efforts. By further considering the internal and external heterogeneity of enterprises, the impact of air pollution on corporate green management varies when the degree of enterprise pollution and the degree of local governance differ. Moreover, this paper highlights the fact that air pollution can play a significant role in corporate green management, while media attention, as a third party, plays a regulating role in environmental supervision. This provides suggestions for strengthening green management behavior of enterprises and building comprehensive environmental supervision system. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - While the scientific community presents a relatively uniform conclusion on the ongoing global warming and the policies that are essential for sustainable development and the mitigation of the negative effects of climate change, the public opinion on the topic is far from uniform. This article studies the factors related to public awareness of climate change and environmental policy, public ideas on the supposed effects of climate change, the belief on whether climate change is caused by human activities, and the perceived possibilities to alleviate climate change by humans. We employ a set of ordinal multinomial regression analyses with spline corrections for ordinal predictors on a representative sample of 1021 respondents (aged 15–86 years, M ± SD: 47.15 ± 17.46; 19.4% with higher education, 50.60% women) from the Czech Republic. Our results suggest that life satisfaction, belief in God, interest in climate-related issues, and the attitude to the European Union were the most relevant factors. Older people were less interested in climate, less aware of sustainable development and climate change, and less willing to take action. Women were more concerned with climate change compared to men. The effect of traditional mass media, Internet-based social networks, and discussion forums, and personal discussions outside of the internet were less significant than expected. The article provides policy suggestions for enhanced stakeholder engagement as well as suggestions for further research on the topic. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Previous research posits that individual predispositions play an essential role in explaining patterns of selective exposure to political information. Yet the contextual factors in the political information environment have received far less attention. Using a cross-national and quasi-experimental design, this article is one of the first to investigate how political information environments shape selective exposure. We rely on a unique two-wave online survey quasi-experiment in five countries (Switzerland, Denmark, Italy, Poland and the United States) with 4349 participants to test the propositions that (a) the level of polarization and fragmentation in information environments and (b) the type of media source used affect selective exposure. Our results reveal that selective exposure is slightly more frequent among regular social media users but is less common among users of TV, radio and newspapers; crucially, it is more common in information environments that are highly fragmented and polarized. Nevertheless, news users from less fragmented-polarized media landscapes show one surprising yet intriguing behaviour: in a quasi-experimentally manipulated setting with more opportunities to self-select than they may be accustomed to, their coping strategy is to pick larger amounts of congruent news stories. All our findings imply that contextual factors play a crucial role in moderating individuals’ tendency to select information that aligns with their political views. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - This article explores the significance of sports sponsorships by small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Due to limited resources, and the high-intensity competition among sponsors for the recipient’s attention, SMEs have to look for alternative ways to exploit the potential of their sponsorships. With the help of an experimental research design, two studies examine the effects of integrating existing sporting rivalries between sports teams into the leveraging of sponsorships. Among both fans (study 1) and local residents (study 2), the reference to a sporting rivalry in sponsorship leveraging has positive effects on sponsorship-fit, attitudes towards sponsorship and brand attitudes towards the sponsor. Negative attitudes of rival fans on this type of sponsorship leveraging are mostly irrelevant for SME sponsors due to their limited market scope. This type of sponsorship leveraging offers SMEs the opportunity to differentiate themselves as sponsors in contrast to large enterprises with a supra regional, national or international sponsorship scope. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - In the present world, we are not only the consumers of information but creators as well. The virtual world of social media, which is considered a free open forum for discussion; provides its participants a chance to shape or re-shape the digital information by expressing opinions. These opinions generally contain different types of sentiments. Sentiment analysis is a tool that performs the computational study of identifying and extracting sentiment content of textual data that can be used to classify those public opinions posted on various topics in social media. In this paper, a sentiment polarity detection approach is presented, that detects the polarity of textual Facebook posts in Bangla containing people's point of views on Bangladesh Cricket using three popular supervised machine learning algorithms named Naive Bayes (NB), support vector machines (SVM), and logistic regression (LR). Comparative result analysis is also provided between classifiers, where LR performed slightly better than SVM and NB by considering n-gram as a feature with an accuracy of 83%. © 2021, Korean Spatial Information Society.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual’s behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India. © 2021, Korean Society for Informatics and Computational Applied Mathematics.

AB  - Right-wing populists are gaining ground in Western democracies. Surveys show that they often distrust established media and public service media (PSM) in particular, claiming that they are biased against them. This paper examines how they have challenged PSM and proposes some potential responses to these challenges. The paper is based on an analysis of a number of recent and long-standing surveys of public attitudes towards the media, combined with an analysis of support for right-wing populists. It focuses on three purposively sampled national case studies: Austria, Germany and Sweden. We show several commonalities among PSM in these three countries, including similar right-wing populist attacks on PSM. The findings crystallise around two points: First, the impartiality and objectivity of news media has generally become less taken-for-granted in a ‘high-choice’ media environment offering various news products of different quality. Secondly, historical left-right distinctions have become less clear-cut, also because right-wing populists challenge them. Consequently, the role of PSM in creating a shared national conversation which represents the diversity of society has also come under siege. At the same time, partisan websites and social media platforms enable certain groups to showcase content that is more aligned with the perspectives of right-wing populists. The paper concludes by asking if right-wing populists are a growing threat to PSM and whether this threat is isolated or potentially indicative of a broader and more sustained pattern. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - At present, there have been a number of studies examining the sexualization of female characters in various media. However, most studies to date have not clearly delineated whether sexualized images or the presence of assertive versus passive female characters influences negative attitudes toward women in viewers, as well as female viewer anxiety. The present study investigated whether the inclusion of powerful female characters in movies with sexualized content influences both male and female viewers’ attitudes towards women as well as anxiety responses of female reviewers. Participants included 134 undergraduate students attending a private liberal arts university in the southern region of the United States. Participants were randomized to watch one of three movie conditions: first, movies that involve strong female lead characters, but which also include sexualized characters, Second, movies that involve strong female lead characters without sexualization and third, movies that involve sexualized female characters without strong portrayals (i.e. damsels in distress). Participants were measured on attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance and anxiety. Results indicated little support for the view that sexualized media impacted viewers’ attitudes toward women, rape myth acceptance or anxiety. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Interpersonal networks and traditional mass media are more intertwined than ever as evidenced by the proliferation of social media. However, it remains unclear how the interplay between the two shapes the way individuals monitor opinion climates, which play a critical role in public opinion dynamics. Using an agent-based modeling (ABM) approach, this study aims to explore the conditions under which social networks and mass media interact to facilitate or hinder the emergence of large-scale spirals of silence. The simulation results show that the spiral of silence in a networked environment may be locally observable, but not likely on a global scale—unless the opinion representation of mass media becomes extremely homogeneous, individuals are hyperconnected, or both, the majority-minority opinion gap found locally seldom escalates to the global silence of the minority. © The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - In the past three decades, scholars have frequently used the concept of framing effects to assess the competence of citizens' political judgments and how susceptible they are to elite influence. Yet prior framing studies have reached mixed conclusions, and few have provided systematic cumulative evidence. This study evaluates the overall efficacy of different types of framing effects in the political domain by systematically meta-analyzing this large and diverse literature. A combined analysis of 138 experiments reveals that when examined across contexts, framing exerts medium-sized effects on citizens' political attitudes and emotions. However, framing effects on behavior are negligible, and small effects are also found in more realistic studies employing frame competition. These findings suggest that although elites can influence citizens by framing issues, their capacity to do so is constrained. Overall, citizens appear to be more competent than some scholars envision them to be. Copyright © The Author(s) 2020. Published by Cambridge University Press.

AB  - In today’s vast digital landscape, people are constantly exposed to threatening language, which attracts attention and activates the human brain’s fear circuitry. However, to date, we have lacked the tools needed to identify threatening language and track its impact on human groups. To fill this gap, we developed a threat dictionary, a computationally derived linguistic tool that indexes threat levels from mass communication channels. We demonstrate this measure’s convergent validity with objective threats in American history, including violent conflicts, natural disasters, and pathogen outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the dictionary offers predictive insights on US society’s shifting cultural norms, political attitudes, and macroeconomic activities. Using data from newspapers that span over 100 years, we found change in threats to be associated with tighter social norms and collectivistic values, stronger approval of sitting US presidents, greater ethnocentrism and conservatism, lower stock prices, and less innovation. The data also showed that threatening language is contagious. In all, the language of threats is a powerful tool that can inform researchers and policy makers on the public’s daily exposure to threatening language and make visible interesting societal patterns across American history. © 2022 National Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Purpose: Approximately 75% of journalists in Western society maintain a Twitter account. This significant presence underscores Twitter's impact on the public agenda. The purpose of this paper is to gain an understanding of journalists' practices on Twitter, from the perspective of journalists in Israel, and explore whether journalists use Twitter's potential as a pluralistic platform of expression. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conducted in-depth interviews with leading journalists working on traditional media and those active on Twitter in Israel. Findings: Although Twitter is an open, inclusive platform for opinion exchange, in which journalists have a sense of unfettered freedom of expression, findings indicate that in Israel, Twitter effectively functions as an echo chamber used by a clique of journalists and politicians in a manner than reifies the hegemonic system. The majority of the public do not use Twitter to draw attention to contentious issues, and journalists almost exclusively continue to set and control the agenda on this platform. As a result, journalists become even more disconnected from society. Therefore, Twitter has been found to be a complementary platform to traditional media that helps to preserve the existing social order. Social implications: This paper offers not only a theoretical contribution but also social relevance, as the topics and issues discussed in the paper might concern citizens and policymakers. This paper contributes to the debate on freedom of the press, which is an important principle of pluralism and democracy. This study illustrates that the general public's opinions remain unheard-of on Twitter. Therefore, despite its potential to express a variety of opinions and voices, Twitter does not undermine the existing social order, but it is one of the cultural frameworks that help preserve the existing social order and reinforce it through uniform conformity thinking. Originality/value: The novelty of this research lies in its identification and analysis of the characteristics of the Twitter scene, its meanings and its implications from the perspective of journalists. In addition, this research investigates the relationships forged in the Twitter space between journalists and politicians and among journalists themselves.

AB  - Autocracies are widely assumed to have a counterterrorism advantage because they can censor media and are insulated from public opinion, thereby depriving terrorists of both their audience and political leverage. However, institutionalized autocracies such as China draw legitimacy from public approval and feature partially free media environments, meaning that their information strategies must be much more sophisticated than simple censorship. To better understand the strategic considerations that govern decisions about transparency in this context, this article explores the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) treatment of domestic terrorist incidents in the official party mouthpiece - the People's Daily. Drawing on original, comprehensive datasets of all known Uyghur terrorist violence in China and the official coverage of that violence, the findings demonstrate that the CCP promptly acknowledges terrorist violence only when both domestic and international conditions are favorable. The authors attribute this pattern to the entrenched prioritization of short-term social stability over longer-term legitimacy. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - To facilitate effective targeted COVID-19 vaccination strategies, it is important to understand reasons for vaccine hesitancy where uptake is low. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques offer an opportunity for real-time analysis of public attitudes, sentiments, and key discussion topics from sources of soft-intelligence, including social media data. In this work, we explore the value of soft-intelligence, leveraged using AI, as an evidence source to support public health research. As a case study, we deployed a natural language processing (NLP) platform to rapidly identify and analyse key barriers to vaccine uptake from a collection of geo-located tweets from London, UK. We developed a search strategy to capture COVID-19 vaccine related tweets, identifying 91,473 tweets between 30 November 2020 and 15 August 2021. The platform's algorithm clustered tweets according to their topic and sentiment, from which we extracted 913 tweets from the top 12 negative sentiment topic clusters. These tweets were extracted for further qualitative analysis. We identified safety concerns; mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies; and accessibility issues as key barriers limiting vaccine uptake. Our analysis also revealed widespread sharing of vaccine misinformation amongst Twitter users. This study further demonstrates that there is promising utility for using off-the-shelf NLP tools to leverage insights from social media data to support public health research. Future work to examine where this type of work might be integrated as part of a mixed-methods research approach to support local and national decision making is suggested.

AB  - In recent years, academic research and investigative reports have brought to light several cases of computational propaganda (i.e. orchestrated attempts to manipulate public opinion or the outcome of elections via social media), as well as proof that filter algorithms amplify right-wing conservative content on Japanese social media. Piecing together the scattered pieces of a puzzle, this article summarizes recent findings from various disciplines and provides an overview of the mechanisms and potential scope of computational propaganda in politics. Although there is no conclusive evidence of who is behind this anonymous activity, an analysis of these findings demonstrates increasing circumstantial evidence that certain factions of the LDP are actively using computational propaganda, either by commissioning external contractors or through its online support group, J-NSC, thereby condoning and appealing to anonymous Internet right-wingers (netto uyo). The concluding discussion assesses the effects and consequences of computational propaganda on the political sphere in contemporary Japan. © 2022, Japan Focus. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Innovation has not only modified routines and professional profiles, but also raises questions about public legitimacy and the institutional character of journalism as a political actor with the emergence of new actors, such as digital platforms and their algorithms, and the reconfiguration of the communicative space. This article aims to present the foundations of the relationship between journalism and politics today, along with future trends. Methodology: It does so through a study developed in February 2020–February 2021 in Spain based on methodological triangulation that includes, in addition to the literature review, a survey of journalists, a survey of citizens and a panel of experts with researchers in the area. Discussion: The results confirm journalists as a filter between society and politics, although the citizens are critical. Conclusions: Some dangerous trends for democracy are revealed: The choice of media agenda items in political parties, low audience participation, the concealment of the importance of algorithms and digital platforms, and the high automation of information to influence public opinion and generate disinformation. © 2022, University of La Laguna.

AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports. The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok’s campaign have been evaluated. The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok’s campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate–e.g. sweaty, tired–there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Several problems remain, despite the evident advantages of sentiment analysis of public opinion represented on Twitter and Facebook. On complicated training data, hybrid approaches may reduce sentiment mistakes. This research assesses the dependability of numerous hybrid approaches on a variety of datasets. Across domains and datasets, we compare hybrid models to singles. Text tweets and reviews are included in our deep sentiment analysis learning systems. The support vector machine (SVM), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and ghost model convolution neural network (CNN) are combined to get the hybrid model. The dependability and computation time of each approach were evaluated. On all datasets, hybrid models outperform single models when deep learning and SVM are combined. The traditional models were less trustworthy, and deep learning algorithms have recently shown their enormous promise in sentiment analysis. Linear transformations are used in feature maps to eliminate duplicate or related features. The ghost unit makes ghost features by taking away attributes that are both similar and duplicated from each intrinsic feature. LSTM produces higher results but takes longer to process, while CNN needs less hyperparameter adjusting and monitoring. The effectiveness of the integrated model varies depending on the work, and all performed better than the others. For hybrid deep sentiment analysis learning models, LSTM networks, CNNs, and SVMs are needed. Hybrid models are used to compare SVM, LSTM, and CNN, and we tested each method's accuracy and errors. Deep learning-SVM hybrid models improve sentiment analysis accuracy. Experimental results have shown the accuracy of the proposed model shown 91.3 percent and 91.5 percent for datasets type 1 and 8, respectively. Copyright © 2022 Mohammed Hasan Ali Al-Abyadh et al.

AB  - The growing need for more stringent methods of safe blood transfusion has engendered blood banks in Brazil. The transfusion appears, then, as an alternative path for blood-related pathologies and their components. Followed by the enforcement of altruistic principles, blood donation has become resistant within society due to its myths and prejudices. Thus, the implementation of public policies became more evident in tracing the social profile of blood donors, and the public power started regulating, supervising and controlling the rational use of blood and blood products. This way, the indices of blood donation in the Unified Health S ystem (SUS) result from various means of interaction with both the potential donor and with the loyal donor, through digital media, school lectures, symposia, congresses and visual media. This process hitched the recruitment to the peculiarities of potential donors, mostly promoted by Health professionals. There is a need to gradually increase such measures to facilitate the donation process, adapting it to the reality of these people, to amplify the number of loyal donors. © 2022 Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto - U.S.P..

AB  - The article focuses on the notion of fake information as a tool of psychological influence in the context of hybrid wars. Works of the prominent academicians in the area of manipulation studies constitute the theoretical framework of this research. Empirical research methods such as observation, comparison, generalization and expert evaluation are used. First of all, types and methods of psychological influences used by mass media and social networks with a view to manipulate public opinions are distinguished. Moreover, the impact of emotions on the critical perception of the news is highlighted. The indicators of manipulative influence are defined in order to resist them. Besides, the ways of creating and distributing false information are described. In addition, the development of fakes identification mechanisms is considered a priority for the governmental and other public institutions. This is illustrated by a range of technologies developed to automatically detect fake news. Apart from that, the degrees of the information reliability are explored. Furthermore, structural elements of fake messages, which include the source and the message itself, are discussed. Misinformation of the public, promotion of certain opinions, encouragement of aggressive actions and instalment of doubts are singled out as the main tasks of fake information. Additionally, stages of countering fakes are distinguished. Finally, the specific features of the forensic expertise procedure are determined in order to provide information security in Ukraine. The research demonstrates the importance of an efficient security system, which would identify fake information and limit its propagation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Desinfaketion Hub: a teaching proposal to conduct verification against political disinformation in the classroom The Gartner report (2017) predicted that in 2022 most citizens in developed countries will consume more hoaxes and misleading or inaccurate information than true information. It is becoming increasingly clear that disinformation has become a major global problem (European Commission, 2021), but so is misinformation, since it contributes, in equal measure, to nurturing the infodemic climate (WHO, 2020) in society. Given this social framework, therefore, the main task of universities, and more specifically of Faculties of Information and Communication Sciences, should be to educate students on the dangers of these informational disorders (Wardle & Derakhshan, 2017) and to train students’ skills so they can fight disinformation and misinformation autonomously. Based on this premise, this study presents an academic initiative linked to an innovative teaching project that aims to test the verification skills of undergraduate Communications students in Seville and Córdoba. To do this, through the Project-Based Learning (PBL) methodology, a verification platform has been designed and created, called Desinfaketion Hub, in which students taking courses in either digital journalism or public opinion (in the third and fourth year of the Communications degree, respectively) publish literacy news and denials of hoaxes each week that they detect in local or regional media and on social networks. © 2022

AB  - Background: The proliferation of information through social media and on other communication networks during the corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) era altered information transfer in many countries. The content of the messages from government officials, media coverage and alternative narratives, affected the level of compliance in adhering to the various health protocols amongst the public. Aim: This article aimed to determine the relationship between the message used, media coverage, alternative narratives, the public’s attitude towards staying at home and their commitment to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic campaign period in Ghana. Setting: A total of 352 respondents was sampled from the Kumasi metropolis. Methods: A survey sample strategy and a convenience sampling technique were used while structural equation modelling with Partial least square (PLS) version 3.0 was used for the analysis. Results: The study revealed that the nature of media coverage employed and the alternative narratives had a significant positive effect on the attitude of the respondents, whilst the content of the message had insignificant effects on the attitude of the public. Finally, the attitude of the people had a significant positive influence on their respective commitment to stay home. Conclusion: Developing countries in Africa need to fight pandemics using purely subsidised health officials or directorates rather than have government-appointed health experts and officials spearheading activities during a pandemic. Contribution: This study contributes to the clear understanding on some COVID-19 misinformation, the distinctive cost it poses to public health delivery in developing economies and the potential strategy of using neutral public health persons to curb the spread of the virus. © 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: to identify and analyze nurses' patterns of knowing and experiences with the preparation of families for disclosure to children living with HIV seropositivity. METHODS: thirteen pediatric nurses from Rio de Janeiro participated in the research using the sensitive creative method. Data were treated with Orlandi's discourse analysis and Carper's patterns of knowing. RESULTS: nurses' speeches revealed socioculturally constructed imaginary and ideological formations. The personal pattern of knowing, under the influence of negative media about the disease in the 1980s, generated stigma and prejudice. Empirical, esthetic, and ethical patterns were built on training and professional practice of the 1990s-2010s. They composed a context of (in)security about competence, to contribute to preparing families to disclose HIV to children. FINAL CONSIDERATIONS: nurses' experience demonstrates knowledge to intervene and many challenges for their practical appropriation.

AB  - Opinion polls regularly show that the vast majority of French people have a positive perception of the efficacy and safety of using medicines, including vaccines. Distrust or hostility towards them is only the fact of a small minority of the population, but active and noisy on social networks and overvalued by the media and public authorities. However, the pandemic due to Covid 19 (SARS-CoV-2) has confirmed to what extent the perception of drug risk by the public is unstable, sometimes irrational, how many and complex the determinants of this perception are and what role as a public resonance, fears play out in the media. We can even implicitly see the general underlying tendency of our society, which is to grant primacy to risk to the detriment of profit in the assessment of a technological innovation. The risk tree often masking the forest of efficiency. This polarization of minds on risks, associated with an overestimation of low probabilities, testifies to the impregnation of our mores by the ideology of precaution. To which are added distorting factors such as naturalistic prejudice, cultural relativism and the planetary extension of social networks which instantly spread false information that is more viral and better remembered than the true ones, hampering communication based on science data. Promoting the correct perception of drug risk requires recalling both the benefits and the risks linked to action but also those linked to inaction; to clarify institutional messages by making them as factual as possible; to limit the number of public broadcasters to achieve greater consistency in their messages; to have the frankness to sometimes say that we do not know, medicine by nature being practiced in a context of uncertainty. The Academy calls for an ambitious educational policy for young people: training in critical thinking and the acquisition of the basics of drug risk should be introduced from middle school. The Academy also believes that the public is entitled to expect quality-controlled information from the media, away from rumors, by calling on indisputable experts and by favoring objective data over subjective testimonies based on personal experiences. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine
Des enquêtes d'opinion montrent régulièrement que, dans leur grande majorité, les Français ont une perception positive de l'efficacité et de la sécurité d'emploi des médicaments, y compris des vaccins. La défiance ou l'hostilité à leur égard ne sont le fait que d'une petite minorité de la population, mais active et bruyante sur les réseaux sociaux ainsi que dans les médias et surévaluée par les médias et les pouvoirs publics. Pourtant, la pandémie due au SARS-CoV-2 (Covid 19) a confirmé combien la perception du risque médicamenteux par le public est instable, parfois peu rationnelle, combien sont nombreux et complexes les déterminants de cette perception et quel rôle de caisse de résonance des peurs du public ont pu jouer les médias. On peut y voir en filigrane la tendance générale de notre société qui est d'accorder la primauté au risque, au détriment du bénéfice, dans l'appréciation d'une innovation technologique. L'arbre du risque cache souvent la forêt de l'efficacité. Cette polarisation des esprits sur les risques, associée à une surestimation des faibles probabilités, témoigne de l'imprégnation de nos mœurs par l'idéologie de la précaution. A quoi s'ajoutent des facteurs de distorsion tels que le préjugé naturaliste, le relativisme culturel et l'extension planétaire des réseaux sociaux qui répandent dans l'instantanéité de fausses informations plus virales et mieux mémorisées que les vraies, entravant la communication fondée sur les données de la science. Favoriser la juste perception du risque médicamenteux impose de rappeler à la fois les bénéfices, les risques liés à l'action, mais aussi ceux liés à l'inaction; de tenir le plus grand compte de l’évolutivité des connaissances; de clarifier les messages institutionnels en les rendant les plus factuels possibles; de limiter le nombre des émetteurs publics en vue d'aboutir à une plus grande cohérence de leurs messages; d'avoir la franchise de dire parfois qu'on ne sait pas, la médecine s'exerçant par nature en contexte d'incertitude. L'Académie en appelle à une politique pédagogique ambitieuse auprès des jeunes: une formation à l'esprit critique et une acquisition des bases de la culture du risque médicamenteux devraient être instaurées dès le collège. Elle estime en outre que le public est en droit d'attendre des médias une information de qualité, prudente, contrôlée et indépendante des rumeurs, en faisant appel à des experts indiscutables et en privilégiant les données objectives par rapport aux témoignages subjectifs fondés sur des expériences individuelles. © 2022 l'Académie nationale de médecine

AB  - Media exposure for dark consumption products mostly shows glamorized and positive portrayals, rarely showing the negative consequences of consuming those products. However, the Netflix series Squid Game addresses the issue of gambling in its most extreme forms and shows the negative consequences related to it in a shocking manner, which begs the question whether watching the series could act as a preventive tool to increase risk perceptions, de-normalize gambling and reduce gambling behavior. A pre-registered survey study (N = 271) examined whether watching the Netflix series Squid Game affected young adults’ (18 to 35 years old) gambling intentions and play behavior through risk perceptions, subjective norms and attitudes toward gambling, and what role audience involvement plays. Although the results show that watching Squid Game increased young adults’ subjective norms of gambling (i.e. belief that significant others approve of the behavior in question) and further increased their positive attitudes toward gambling and gambling intention, the study also found an important impact of audience involvement. Audiences who were more involved with the series saw greater risks of gambling and perceived gambling to be less common. This resulted in more negative attitudes toward gambling and further less gambling intention and more motivation to change gambling behavior due to watching Squid Game. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Word embeddings provide quantitative representations of word semantics and the associations between word meanings in text data, including in large repositories in media and social media archives. This article introduces social psychologists to word embedding research via a consideration of bias analysis, a topic of central concern in the discipline. We explain how word embeddings are constructed and how they can be used to measure bias along bipolar dimensions that are comparable to semantic differential scales. We review recent studies that show how familiar social biases can be detected in embeddings and how these change over time and in conjunction with real-world discriminatory practices. The evidence suggests that embeddings yield valid and reliable estimates of bias and that they can identify subtle biases that may not be communicated explicitly. We argue that word embedding research can extend scholarship on prejudice and stereotyping, providing measures of the bias environment of human thought and action. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The increasing use of social media like YouTube as a news platform provides new opportunities for the public to react to news reporting. This convergence produces multi-narrative framings of police violence-related evidence that requires further attention, especially given the potential impact on state accountability processes. Using a frame analysis of news outlets and content analysis of comments on YouTube, we identify frames, responses, and the multi-narrative framing that results from this converging environment. Our findings suggest a triumvirate of competing frames around police brutality, with mistrust of media complicating the role news media plays in accountability. © 2022 AEJMC.

AB  - On October 15th, 2013 the Legislative Decree of August 14th, 2013, n. 93, passed, with amendments, into a Law (n. 119/2013), known in the media and the public opinion as “Law against Feminicide”, although the word feminicide is not to be found either in the title or the text. After a brief premise in which I contextualize the bill under discussion, in the first section I address the question concerning the reasons why it is possible to insert this law within the wider debate on femicide/feminicide. In the second section, I comment the single provisions, the deployed terms and the underlying assumptions of the law. Finally, in the third section, I present my theoretical criticism to the assumptions of the law, moving from the idea that this law reproduces heteronormative assumptions, mainly due to a mistaken definition of “gender”, understood as an equivalent term for “women”. © 2022

AB  - In the context dominated by Internet communication, people's various emotions can be clearly reflected through network public opinion, whether it is the view of political affairs, the preference for entertainment, or the demand for life. This also allows management or providers to meet their needs more specifically. Based on today's need to understand the trend of Internet public opinion, this paper describes a deep neural network (DNN). A deep neural network is a machine learning model that is the foundation of deep learning and has a strong ability to mine potential information in data. By improving the loss function of the neural network, this paper reduces the influence of unbalanced data on the classification results and improves the classification effect of the model on a small number of categories. Aiming at the different lengths of Internet text, a more robust model of text sentiment classification is proposed, which makes the HCB-Att model better extract the local information and contextual information of the text. Finally, through comparative experiments, the optimization model used in this paper is proved to be effective for the analysis of network public opinion sentiment. © 2022 Min Gong.

AB  - The tendency of world media to villainize of sharks has likely contributed to a disparity in the distribution of research and conservation resources among threatened marine megavertebrates, with elasmobranchs losing out. Increased public knowledge on elasmobranchs can shape public attitude and foster and gain support for elasmobranch conservation. Through an online survey, this study aimed to evaluate the drivers of public knowledge and examine linkages between awareness of elasmobranchs and attitude toward their conservation. To explore the relationships and effects between the different predicting variables and public elasmobranch knowledge and attitude indices, bi and multi-variate analysis and a partial least squares path model were used. The results indicated that the average public elasmobranch knowledge of the Cypriot population was moderate and the average public attitude towards elasmobranchs was relatively low. Marine-related activities and marine-related education were highly correlated with increased public elasmobranch knowledge and were the strongest predictors of the partial least squares path model which explained a high degree of variation in elasmobranch knowledge. Public elasmobranch knowledge was highly correlated with public attitude towards elasmobranchs. The findings of this study highlighted the importance of ocean literacy and education and provide insights into the mechanisms for developing and designing successful advocacy actions for elasmobranch conservation. © 2022.

AB  - In recent years, with the rapid development of information technology, the Internet has gradually become an interactive platform for people to exchange ideas, collide emotions, spread information, and release emotions. The openness, anonymity, and inclusiveness of the Internet have reduced the obstacles of information dissemination and triggered the conflict of public opinion on the Internet. In addition, students actively express their opinions, attitudes, and feelings on important topics in life and study on the Internet, forming a certain scale of online opinions reflecting students' unique political attitudes, moral concepts, and values. Because college students are immature physically and mentally and the network environment is full of phenomena, it is easy to arouse their emotional resonance. Therefore, the free and diverse network environment presents new challenges and higher requirements of the times for the stable operation of college network public opinion guidance. Therefore, how to form systematic education in universities combined with ideological and political network public opinions under big data has become an important problem to be solved. Based on this paper presents the communication pattern of network public opinion and model it, namely, the random network public opinion transmission model. By comparing the scope and influence of the two transmission paths of network public opinion, the paper draws the conclusion and strengthens the teaching practice of ideological and political courses. Finally, it is pointed out that the research of the ideological and political network public opinion communication path is a complex digital communication system project, which requires the government, the media, and the schools together to give suggestions in the guidance of the network public opinion. © 2022 Shengyu Xu et al.

AB  - Online social media are key platforms for the public to discuss political issues. As a result, researchers have used data from these platforms to analyze public opinions and forecast election results. The literature has shown that due to inauthentic actors such as malicious social bots and trolls, not every message is a genuine expression from a legitimate user. However, the prevalence of inauthentic activities in social data streams is still unclear, making it difficult to gauge biases of analyses based on such data. In this article, we aim to close this gap using Twitter data from the 2018 U.S. midterm elections. We propose an efficient and low-cost method to identify voters on Twitter and systematically compare their behaviors with different random samples of accounts. We find that some accounts flood the public data stream with political content, drowning the voice of the majority of voters. As a result, these hyperactive accounts are over-represented in volume samples. Hyperactive accounts are more likely to exhibit various suspicious behaviors and to share low-credibility information compared to likely voters. Our work provides insights into biased voter characterizations when using social media data to analyze political issues. © Copyright 2022 Yang et al. Distributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0

AB  - Background. Infertility impacts a lot of considerable negative social effects on the lives of infertile partners, especially females, who repeatedly experience the emotional sequelae of childlessness. The study's goal was to assess women of reproductive ages' awareness of IVF treatments, as well as their attitudes and misunderstandings about them in Cape Coast, Ghana. Methods. A total of 437 reproductive-age women in Cape Coast Metropolis were recruited using a simple random sampling approach for this Cross-Sectional Descriptive study. Data were collected with a semistructured interviewer-administered questionnaire and were analyzed using IBM SPSS version 26.0, and p≤0.05 was considered significant. Results. The mean age was calculated to be 25.33 ± 0.066 years with a greater proportion, 65.7% within 15-24 years, 76.5% had no or had never had a child before. 93.4% were of the Christian faith, 66.8% were aware of IVF, and 74.8% think IVF offers hope. Although 41.4% believe it is not a natural procedure and 44.6% believe IVF children are normal but not natural. While 72.1% believe the treatment is very costly, and 40.7% believe it is not affordable or accessible. The majority believe IVF kids are legitimate (76.9%), and so should be welcomed by society (86.5%). The overall opinion of IVF service acceptability was 81.7% good. Seventy-two and three percent did not know whether IVF services are available in Cape Coast. Also, 48.1% were aware that IVF may result in pregnancy failure, with fewer than half (43.5%) believing it could be linked to genetic problems in the baby. The majority (60.4%) were willing to use IVF services, and 82.8% will utilize just their husband's sperm technique. While others may not want to undergo any form of IVF technique because they desire to conceive naturally (51.0%) and 22.4% may be unable to pay for it. Educational status and awareness of the availability of IVF services were factors that were significantly associated with their overall good perception of IVF services. Also, age, marital status, number of live children, occupation, educational status, awareness, and their overall perception were factors that are significantly associated with their preparedness to utilize IVF services. Conclusion. Overall, women's opinions of IVF and their readiness to use them were favorable, and they think it offers hope for their condition since they were well-informed about its forms and that infertility may be a result of several factors, all of which may need IVF services. It does not matter if it is difficult to obtain, expensive, or unavailable. It is recommended that the government collaborates with healthcare providers to investigate ways through the mass media in the drive to clear the misconceptions and improve the public understanding of the IVF procedure towards its utilization, thereby reducing the burden of childlessness and the resulting psychological disorders among couples, this has implications for joyful homes and societal growth. © 2022 Samuel Kofi Arhin et al.

AB  - This paper sorts out and discusses the different methods used in the analysis of China-related public opinion, builds a theoretical system of public opinion analysis methods on this basis, conducts case analysis and research on hot public opinion combined with corpus, and selects the semantic analysis method from the technical level supporting the public opinion analysis method. From the perspective of related technologies involving intelligent analysis methods, comparative analysis and improved applications are given, which provides an effective analysis basis for government public management departments to fully grasp and guide China-related public opinion. Sentiment tendency analysis is also an important direction of Chinese-related public opinion research. This paper sorts and analyzes China-related public opinion from the characteristics, applications, and text processing methods of different granularities and builds and improves the annotation model for the smallest granularity. The frequency, trend, and evolution characteristics of China-related public opinion events are sorted out and analyzed, and the trend analysis method is used to analyze the evolution trend of attention of public opinion events. The distribution of individual opinion acceptance, trust threshold, and opinion leaders are simulated by experiments. The impact on the evolution of China-related public opinion was determined. The experimental results show that the effect of the method proposed in this paper is improved by about 10% compared with the direct use of statistical learning methods for emotional orientation analysis. The SVM method also has obvious advantages over the Bayesian method, especially the combination of the SVM method and the bigram method which gives the best results. © 2022 Xiulian Zhao.

AB  - This article focuses on the 2013–2016 exhibitions in Moscow Manege which were later transformed into a network of entertainment centres (“historical parks”) Russia–my (hi)story. The exhibitions are built on multimedia technologies and include no authentic artefacts/museum objects. There is a growing network of such centres all over Russia, all organized in a similar manner, appealing to the visitor’s emotions and creating a relation of affect through the unravelling of a nationalistic historical narrative. Claimed to present “the objective picture of the Russian history” the exhibitions are following the recent developments in Russian cultural policies and history curricula. By analysing narratives presented at the “historical park” exhibitions, in policy documents and in media, this article follows the changes in public attitude towards history, which heritage is perceived as ‘difficult’ and ‘contested’ and how the digital representations influence these perceptions. Based on this analysis I argue that the reduction of the museum mechanism to only digital and multimedia form can bring along very serious issues in different political contexts. Russian historical parks enterprise, which combines the methods of fostering patriotism by the means of historical narrative templates both from the 19th and the 20th centuries, enhanced with the 21st-century technology in a form of “multimedia museums,” is only one of such examples © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License

AB  - Sharks are often depicted in the media as violent killers that actively seek out opportunities to harm humans. This framing may impact human tolerance and support of shark conservation, underscoring the need to identify strategies that counteract these negative representations. Social media, given its widespread use, could be an effective platform for shaping public tolerance for sharks and other wildlife species. In this experimental study, we conducted an online pre-post survey in Spring 2020 to determine how viewing shark-related YouTube videos impacted tolerance for sharks among residents (n = 335) in the coastal state of North Carolina (NC), USA and neighboring states. The study employed framing theory, which suggests that the ways in which information is presented influence how it is processed and the actions that result from it. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two video treatments where sharks were framed positively or negatively. Each video treatment impacted tolerance for sharks in the direction of their framing: positive framing influenced positive changes in tolerance (70% more positive attitudes toward sharks, a 130% increase in acceptance of sharks and a 46% increase in intended shark conservation behaviors), and negative framing influenced negative changes (25% more negative attitudes toward sharks, a 18% decrease in acceptance of sharks and a 3% decrease in intended shark conservation behaviors). These findings suggest positive messages about sharks on social media promote tolerance of sharks and can be more impactful than negative messages. At least one form of social media, YouTube, appears to be a valuable tool for encouraging tolerance for sharks. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The watchdog role has been one of the most widely discussed normative functions of the press. In this study, we examine the public’s attitudes toward the news media’s watchdog performance and how they correlate with trust in news and news avoidance, two important phenomena for democracy and the health of the public sphere. We further examine how individual predispositions (e.g. political interest, ideology) and contextual variables (e.g. press freedom) moderate these relationships. Based on data from the 2019 Reuters Institute Digital News Report, and controlling for a range of factors, we find that across 38 countries, watchdog performance evaluations are positively associated with trust in news but that they are also positively associated with higher levels of news avoidance. Last, we find that evaluations of media in other functions like helping citizens understand the most important topics of the day and choosing relevant topics were more strongly associated to trust in news and lower news avoidance levels than watchdog performance evaluations. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Nativism is one of the defining phenomena of the contemporary era. Yet, we know little about how malleable citizen attitudes associated with nativism and nationalism are to priming effects when media frames which deal with key issues such as immigration are introduced. In this article, we present the findings from a survey experiment fielded to a nationally representative sample of voters in Australia in May 2019. In it, we explore whether the attitudes of voters for different political parties can be primed by introducing two contrasting media frames to measure these effects. We find positive and negative frames have no effect on the attitudes of voters for Australia’s populist radical right party, but that the former has an effect on centre-right voters in Australia. Such findings have important implications for our understanding of political communication and the malleability of political attitudes. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Social media platforms such as Twitter provide opportunities for governments to connect to foreign publics and influence global public opinion. In the current study, we used social and semantic network analysis to investigate China’s digital public diplomacy campaign during COVID-19. Our results show that Chinese state-affiliated media and diplomatic accounts created hashtag frames and targeted stakeholders to challenge the United States or to cooperate with other countries and international organizations, especially the World Health Organization. Telling China’s stories was the central theme of the digital campaign. From the perspective of social media platform affordance, we addressed the lack of attention paid to hashtag framing and stakeholder targeting in the public diplomacy literature. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Purpose: The deployment of vaccines is the primary task in curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. The purpose of this paper is to understand the public’s opinions on vaccines and then design effective interventions to promote vaccination coverage. Design/methodology/approach: This paper proposes a research framework based on the spatiotemporal perspective to analyse the public opinion evolution towards COVID-19 vaccine in China. The framework first obtains data through crawler tools. Then, with the help of data mining technologies, such as emotion computing and topic extraction, the evolution characteristics of discussion volume, emotions and topics are explored from spatiotemporal perspectives. Findings: In the temporal perspective, the public emotion declines in the later stage, but overall emotion performance is positive and stabilizing. This decline in emotion is mainly associated with ambiguous information about the COVID-19 vaccine. The research progress of vaccines and the schedule of vaccination have driven the evolution of public discussion topics. In the spatial perspective, the public emotion tends to be positive in 31 regions, whereas local emotion increases and decreases in different stages. The dissemination of distinctive information and the local epidemic prevention and control status may be potential drivers of topic evolution in local regions. Originality/value: The analysis results of media information can assist decision-makers to accurately grasp the subjective thoughts and emotional expressions of the public in terms of spatiotemporal perspective and provide decision support for macro-control response strategies and risk communication. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Purpose: Under the new media environment, while enjoying the convenience brought by the propagation of public opinion information (referred to as public opinion), learning the evolution process of public opinion and strengthening the governance of the spreading of public opinion are of great significance to promoting economic development and maintaining social stability as well as effectively resisting the negative impact of its propagation. Design/methodology/approach: Thinking about the results of empirical research and bibliometric analysis, this paper focused on introducing key factors such as information content, social strengthening effects, etc., from both internal and external levels, dynamically designed public opinion spreading rules and netizens' state transition probability. Subsequently, simulation experiments were conducted to discuss the spreading law of public opinion in two types of online social networks and to identify the key factors which influencing its evolution process. Based on the experimental results, the governance strategies for the propagation of negative public opinion were proposed finally. Findings: The results show that compared with other factors, the propagation of public opinion depends more on the attributes of the information content itself. For the propagation of negative public opinion, on the one hand, the regulators should adopt flexible guidance strategy to establish a public opinion supervision mechanism and autonomous system with universal participation. On the other hand, they still need to adopt rigid governance strategy, focusing on the governance timing and netizens with higher network status to forestall the wide-diffusion of public opinion. Practical implications: The research conclusions put forward the enlightenment for the governance of public opinion in management practice, and also provided decision-making reference for the regulators to reasonably respond to the propagation of public opinion. Originality/value: Our research proposed a research framework for the discussion of public opinion propagation process and had important practical guiding significance for the governance of public opinion propagation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Legislative policies aimed at curbing early exposure to smoking among youth are a crucial public health strategy. Yet little is known about US adults’ public opinion on restricting exposure of children to movies depicting smoking. This study sought to characterize US adults’ levels of support to restrict the exposure of children to smoking in movies and explore associations with sociodemographic characteristics. METHODS We used cross-sectional data from the 2020 Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS, n=3750) of adults in the United States to estimate the prevalence of opinions toward restricting the exposure of children to smoking in movies and examine correlates of support using weighted logistic regression. RESULTS In all, 48.2% of adults endorsed a supportive opinion. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, the odds of endorsing a supportive opinion were higher among Black/African American adults (OR=1.61; 95% CI: 1.04–2.49, p=0.033), and Hispanics (OR=1.78; 95% CI: 1.17–2.72, p=0.008) when compared to Whites. Similarly, compared to those aged 18–34 years, the odds of endorsing a supportive opinion were also greater among those aged 50–64 years (OR=2.15; 95% CI: 1.43–3.24, p<0.001) or aged ≥65 years (OR=3.83; 95% CI: 2.31–6.36, p<0.001). Higher odds for support were observed among those exposed to federal court-ordered anti-smoking tobacco messages (OR=1.37; 95% CI 1.06–1.78, p=0.018) and among those who reported using social media to share health information (OR=1.51; 95% CI: 1.02–2.23, p=0.041). CONCLUSIONS Only 48% of US adults endorsed support for restricting the exposure of children to smoking in movies. This study has identified subgroups of US adults for whom tailored communication interventions may increase support for policies that protect children from early initiation of smoking. © 2022.

AB  - The study assesses the extent to which the various sources of political information may influence the beliefs and values held by three groups of potential voters in the United States (Democrats, Republicans, and undecided). It interprets findings regarding the efficacy of the various sources of political information in the context of communication theories to explain the emerged group differences and suggests political marketing strategies to influence potential voters. The study findings suggest the possible powerful effects of social media relative to other sources in affecting the political views of undecided potential voters. © 2022, World Advertising Research Center.

AB  - The current rate of technological innovation makes it easier to convey data from one person to another. As technology progresses, it becomes easier for everyone to access social media, to the point where some news organisations seek to exploit it as a news source. Meanwhile, in order to avoid public panic, it is critical to educate society at a young age about the impact of fake news on social media. The purpose of this study is to explain the purpose of social media usage and to investigate whether the use of social media platforms to disseminate information has increased the spread of fake news in Malaysia, as well as the effect of information disseminated among university students during the COVID pandemic. Social media is well-known for its ease of use, particularly among young people, in sharing and expressing their opinions on domestic and international topics. Using social media has become second nature to us, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the strength of social media, the public's opinion of finding information during a lockdown is quite positive. The study was carried out in a qualitative manner. The researcher gathered all of the data by asking the participants general research questions. The method employed to obtain the results was an in-depth interview. The findings revealed that information disseminated via social media was successful in raising awareness during the pandemic, particularly among university students. According to the findings, certain scientific and technical advancements should benefit the global community rather than be manipulated in order to obtain accurate and true knowledge; society must be astute. False knowledge would have negative repercussions, and society would inevitably exist in a state of deception. Obtaining reliable information during the COVID-19 pandemic is critical to ensuring that individuals become social media literate in the future. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - In this time of pandemic, people engage with diverse narratives of infographics to make sense of their experiences. Scholars agreed that comics are graphic mediums and cultural artefacts that significantly contribute to the visual community of the COVID-19 pandemic. One of the comic artists in Malaysia, Ernest Ng, initially published his comics online and later converted them into three volumes of comic books entitled CovidBall Z Volume 1 (2020a), 2 (2020b) and 3 (2021). The objective of this paper is to undertake a content analysis of the portrayals of the various state machinery figures both from the government and opposition sides (i.e., ministers, politicians and government officers) in their roles in combating COVID-19. Additionally, the analysis wishes to uncover contemporary attitudes Ng uses such as symbolism, exaggeration and irony, among others, to convey his views on the current issue in obvious and subtle ways. In analysing the data, this study employed data analysis techniques in the form of descriptive content analysis. It was found that the social commentaries presented in Ng’s comics via the plot depict the existence of sexism, unfair treatment, and prejudice by several characters which lead to bully culture in the midst of the political metaphorical depiction of war and heroism among Malaysian state machinery figures. The images in his comics help people analyse, reflect on, and interpret our experiences by informing, providing meaning, and illustrating the COVID-19 outbreak narrative. © 2022, Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

AB  - Jeremy Lin, an Asian American basketball player, achieved his meteoric stardom by giving outstanding performances and leading the Knicks to constant wins. Intense media coverage and scholarly work about Lin had been done during this starring time, while this research focuses on media representations of Lin during regular seasons. This article employs textual analysis and examines 461 articles from the first and last NBA seasons Lin played. The thematic analysis shows media representations of Lin became more diverse while rarely using racialized narratives. However, untrust and low expectations of Asian American masculinity are discovered in the analysis. In addition, stereotypical narratives such as “see someone Asian, say something Asian,” and the model minority myth beautify stereotypical impressions of Asian Americans and exacerbate their “otherness.” Such flattering compliments embedded in media coverage obfuscate Asian American identity, making it more difficult for them to prove their personality and masculinity. Although the media create and maintain hegemonic masculinity and stereotypes, they are also powerful to break down prejudice and discrimination and reshape people’s impressions of Asian American athletes, and even their whole community. © 2022 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - Pride events challenge hegemonic notions of sexuality and gender within places they are held. This is particularly the case in rural communities that are perceived, rightly or wrongly, as prejudices towards individuals with a diverse sexuality or gender identity. However, although academic literature has extensively explored Pride events within an urban context, limited attention has been paid to the rural context, and still little to those in their infancy. This article examines how stakeholders responded to the cancellation of a Pride event in the Australian rural township of Wagga Wagga due to COVID19. The pandemic, in this context, provided an opportunity to understand attitudes towards the event and its cancellation. Through this process, eight topics were identified as: council funding, cancellation as homophobic, last-minute cancellation, cancellation regretted, cancellation supported, organizers acknowledged, LGBTIQI+, and Pride event. Based on these findings, implications for the cancellation of social contentious events in response to such circumstances are identified. These implications suggest the need for a more considered approach to communicating about the cancellation to prevent allegations of prejudice and demonstrate the value of such events © 2022.

AB  - The paper analyses popular geographical imageries of the European migrant crisis. It focuses on visualities that shaped discussions about the event among Czech Facebook users with anti-immigration attitudes. The paper elaborates on the co-production of migrants’ visibility and visualities that depict them in certain ways. Visuality influences visibility and shapes what it means for people (who are represented by images) to be visible in certain ways when seen by another people (who observe and consume the images). Here, we analyse how cartographic visualizations and the practice of montage of images produce meanings and affects that make migrants either visible only as abusers of the Czech social welfare system (linking migrants in a racist way to the Roma minority) or visible only as dehumanized raging Muslim invaders that resemble more machine-like beings. These interpretations are explained with references to historical specificities of the Czech context. A user-made, film-like sci-fi video of the crisis is also analysed carefully to demonstrate its imaginary of a collapsing Western Europe, where raging invaders dominate. Presenting migrants’ visuality as invaders links these racist and Islamophobic attitudes to migrants’ visibility as enemies and targets to be killed, not pitiable human beings to be helped. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the conditions that make adolescents open to their parents’ attempts at political socialization. Based on a reformulation of the perceptual accuracy argument, that parents’ messages are filtered through correct perceptions of these messages by adolescents, the study suggests that adolescents who accurately recognize their parents’ high political sophistication are particularly likely to attend to and be open to their parents’ political communication. This proposition was tested using cluster analysis of a sample of 505 Swedish upper-secondary students and their parents (51% girls; Mage = 16.56, SD = 0.67). The analysis yielded two clusters where adolescents correctly identified (26%) and failed to correctly identify (22%) their parents’ high political sophistication, and three clusters where both parents and adolescents reported low or medium parental political sophistication (10%, 11%, and 32%). In confirmation of the hypothesis, members of the cluster group of adolescents who correctly recognized their parents’ high political sophistication were particularly aware of parents’ political socialization attempts and receptive to parents’ political communication. Moreover, these youth considered their parents’ political views as important and, accordingly, seemed to perceive their parents as political role models. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Media scholars have long recognized the potential for falsely balanced reporting to distort public opinion, but existing empirical evidence is inconclusive. In this study, we examine the effect of falsely balanced reporting and explicit journalistic intervention on perceptions of voter fraud in U.S. elections through original internet survey experiments conducted in the United States shortly before and after the 2020 U.S. presidential election held on November 3, 2020. The results show that exposure to falsely balanced reporting largely has a null effect on perceptions of voter fraud, though we also find evidence of partisan-based heterogeneity in its effect. The results of the study also show that explicit journalistic intervention equally decreases belief in voter fraud among both Democrats and Republicans before the election, but among Republicans the corrective effect of intervention disappears in the post-election period, suggesting that there are sharp contextual limits on the effect of explicit journalistic intervention. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Do discussions in echo chambers break down barriers on the acceptance political violence? We know from research within political science, social psychology and communication that deliberation in echo chambers—called enclave deliberation—works as a driver for the amplification of existing political attitudes. Moreover, scholars of radicalization have argued that enclave deliberation can lead to extremist ideas and the acceptance of political violence in response to political grievances. Yet, amplification of attitudes, even into extremist ideas, is not the same as accepting violence. We still lack causal backing for the widespread claim that enclave deliberation fuels acceptance of political violence. Utilizing a novel laboratory experiment with 188 participants, this article delivers causal evidence suggesting that enclave deliberation increases politically aggrieved group members’ acceptance of violence. In addition, I find causal evidence supporting the claim that enclave deliberation amplifies existing political attitudes and makes group members’ opinions less diverse. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This paper affords an insight into an important phenomenon related to the current worldwide increase in xenophobic behavior. In the past as well as in the present, the issue of anti-Semitism was the topic to be discussed; we note the dangers of the return and growth of populist and racist political parties and social movements while observing similar discussions today, especially in Eastern Europe (including Slovakia). They are linked to the current anti-vaccination and anti-war movements. This study had three objectives: (1) To present the critical antiSemitic narratives that survived communism and were re-mediated after the establishment of an independent Slovakia in 1993; (2) to identify inherited mechanisms that continue to determine the forms of negative attitudes of Slovaks towards Jews; (3) to identify and analyze current narratives representing new forms of digital anti-Semitism in the current disinformation media in Slovakia. This paper employs a structured interview method with thirteen Slovak multi-disciplinary experts to research crucial inherited and current anti-Semitic narratives. Our research identified ten anti-Semitic narratives that remain in the current disinformation media. The research also points to two former mechanisms from the communist era that still influence the attitudes of Slovaks towards Jews. This also influences the nature of contemporary anti-Semitism: the generational influence, under which intolerant attitudes pass from generation to generation, and the influence of (inherited) power and economic “remorse”, accompanied by the common notion of the “exploitation” of countries (including Slovakia) by the Jewish community. Finally, four new and current narratives have been identified through structured interviews with experts, determining the nature of current digital anti-Semitism. © 2022 Hedviga Tkáčová

AB  - This research conducts a retrospective study of public opinion toward the Chinese online car-hailing policy, the first country to regulate the industry nationwide. In total, 41,303 microblogs are collected from the Weibo social media platform across the pre-release stage (policy agenda setting), peri-release stage (policy formulation), and post-release stage (policy implementation) of the policy cycle. A general text mining framework is proposed to extract valuable knowledge from social media text data. Topics and sentiment polarity evolutions are compared in the three policy-making stages. The findings show that citizens have always been concerned with the issues of safety, vehicle requirements, and drivers’ qualifications. During the three stages, negative sentiment recorded the highest proportion at the pre-release stage, while a decrease was observed at the peri-release stage, and then another increase was observed at the post-release stage. Additionally, opinions related to the policy stakeholders, including regulators, platforms, drivers, and passengers, were explored. Based on the results, the academic implications for policy opinion analysis and the policy implications for car-hailing regulation optimization that resolves citizens’ concerns are discussed. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society

AB  - This article offers an analysis of scholarly attempts to make sense of the nexus of race and migration in Brexit-era UK discourse. To illustrate my arguments that intend to challenge and extend existing scholarship, I discuss exemplary snapshots from news articles, blog posts and social media sources. Building on critical race and postcolonial studies as theoretical background, I trace the phenomenon of naming the discrimination against East Europeans – which is undeniably one of the driving forces of the Brexit discussion – ‘racism’. Sometimes, and this shows the pattern of the overgeneralization of the term, ‘racism’ gets extended to name the post-Brexit exclusion of any EU nationals. This use of ‘racism’, however, is based on methodological nationalism and conceptual whiteness as my analyses show. To make sense of the overlapping racist, anti-immigration and anti-EU rhetoric that marks the pre- and post-Brexit moment in the United Kingdom, this article introduces the concept of ‘migratism’ – a name for the power relation that ascribes migration to certain people, constructing them as migrants and discriminating against them. The terms ‘migratism’ and ‘migratization’ function grammatically in an analogue way to ‘racism’ and ‘racialization’. If racism is the power relation that racializes (=ascribes race to) people, migratism if the power relation that migratizes (=ascribes migration to) people. The terms are not symmetrical but have a complicated interdependent relationship. Racism and migratism are bound to each other and play a crucial role in organizing the Western nation state. The suggested concepts foreground a postcolonial understanding of race and racism and make it possible to analyse both migration-based discrimination and discrimination based on perceived migration in violence and hate crimes connected to the Brexit referendum. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the Indian context, women, especially Dalit women, have been subjected to scripturally and culturally sanctioned misogyny. These deep-rooted prejudices are manifested at both the societal and the institutional levels. In such a scenario, any assertion of justice by Dalit women is fraught with tensions. The sexual violence against them is routinized, normalized and invisibilized. For the victims, it is a lonely struggle as civil society scarcely registers such crimes; for the law and judiciary, it is another claim for meagre compensation. Their bodies are bereft of honour, and their sexuality is viewed with suspicion, easily accessible to any male of the dominant communities who can lay claim to it. This article explores two case studies—Khairlanji and Nirbhaya, geographically distinct spaces, where Dalit women were brutally raped and mutilated, and the perpetrators were let off lightly. The mainstream media largely ignored the developments. The article also focuses on the fissures within the feminist movement vis-à-vis caste and the politics of sexuality. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Recent gene editing tools and techniques continue to develop at a swift pace and gene-edited foods boast significant promise to create identifiable benefits for end-use consumers, although there are currently few publicly identifiable products in the commercial marketplace. While competing stakeholders are active in this space, few public-facing media stories have surfaced and there have been few studies of public opinion of gene-edited foods. This article reports findings of the first representative survey study of public opinion toward gene-edited foods in the United States. This work finds that Americans are divided on their perceptions of this new technology and provides robust and granular assessment and identification of socioeconomic and belief-based classifications to better describe the current state of public opinion in this area. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Presence of gay men in mainstream media may have a positive impact on viewers’ attitude change. However, gay male characters are often stereotypically portrayed as feminine, and no research has yet explored audiences’ reactions to counter-stereotypical gay characters. Heterosexual Italian men (N = 158) were exposed to a clip portraying (i) a stereotypical feminine gay male character, (ii) a counter-stereotypical masculine gay male character, or (iii) a nature documentary. Compared to the other conditions, exposure to the counter-stereotypical gay character increased discrimination toward gay men, in the form of anti-gay jokes, the higher the level of participants’ prejudice against gay men. Results further demonstrated that this effect was explained by reduced perceived stereotypicality of the character. Findings are in line with the social identity theory prediction that when gay men (outgroup) are perceived as too similar, and potentially threaten the group identity, heterosexual men would attempt to restore ingroup distinctiveness. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Recent gene-editing technologies are heralded by proponents as a revolution for developing gene-edited foods (GEFs) while critics demand increased governance and scrutiny of potential societal impacts. Governance of GEFs is different in the United States, where GEFs are entering the market, and Europe, which restricts GEF development. Definitive regulations for governing GEFs are not yet solidified in either region. We identify and compare how English-language media in the United States and Europe portray potential risks, benefits, and regulation of GEFs, and we explore how these portrayals may reflect their regulatory environments. Results show that the regions similarly prioritize benefit frames that emphasize the social and scientific progress GEFs may bring, and few articles express skepticism about potential benefits. Comparing samples across regions exposes differences between Europe and the United States in the risk and benefit portrayals and in governance initiatives. Both regions prioritize policy risks that are counter to their current oversight regimes: the US media sample focused on GEFs being underregulated while the European sample emphasize risks of too much regulation. This may demonstrate the power of media to reflect and even cultivate public opinion and may influence future policy revisions within these distinct regulatory environments. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In 2015 and 2016, European newspapers covered the Syrian migration into Europe in great detail, describing the path followed by millions of refugees as European authorities put up both physical and metaphorical obstacles to stop their advance. Water metaphors, a common resource in immigration discourse, were extensively used in the media during this period. Apparently neutral, expressions like the flow of refugees or a new wave of immigrants seemed to be devoid of ideological bias, and so an objective, factual way to present the news about it. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the contexts in which water metaphors were used in two ideologically opposed Spanish newspapers in this period. Results show that their descriptive function was surpassed by the evaluative one, as revealed by the high frequency of force dynamic schemas underlying the flow metaphor, the most frequent one in the sample. Negatively charged, the frequent use of flow to refer to Syrian refugees could have affected public opinion on the event. Also, a contrastive analysis suggests that there are subtle differences between the right and the left wing when using these metaphors, but they are not as significant as expected, since both newspapers tend to avoid overt negativity in their discourse on Syrian migration. Considering the relatively small size of the sample, further work needs to be done to confirm these results in the Spanish press and also to extend the analysis to other European media. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Since former U.S. President Trump took office, Chinese state media have generally painted a negative picture of him and formed a negative public opinion. However, in Chinese social media, Trump still enjoys a high reputation and has even gained a large number of supporters, including, of course, a large number of opponents. This article explored the popular evaluation of President Trump by young Zhihu netizens through a qualitative content analysis of a post on the Zhihu website, and analyzed the reasons for the formation of the opposing evaluations by netizens. The result showed that 43% of netizens positively evaluated Trump as the great president who saved the United States, while 40% condemned Trump as "The second Hoover." From a neutral point of view, Trump is seen as a president with first-class dreams but second-class political wisdom. Further analysis revealed that for netizens with positive comments, individualism, pragmatism, dissatisfaction with the social status quo, and the influence of the mode of public opinion confrontation are the main reasons why they praise Trump. Netizens who hold a negative evaluations are strongly influenced by China's traditional political culture and official public opinion, as well as the trend of the "rise of the East and decline of the West," which led them to follow the Chinese "Meritocracy Political Model" in evaluating Trump. This study revealed the current situation of ideological and value opposition among highly educated young in China. © 2022 the authors.

AB  - Monitoring the state of the economy in a short time is a crucial aspect for designing appropriate and timely policy responses in the presence of shocks and crises. Short-term confidence indicators can help policymakers in evaluating both the effect of policies and the economic activity condition. The indicator commonly used in the EU to evaluate the public opinion orientation is the Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI). Nevertheless, the ESI shows some drawbacks, particularly in the adopted weighting scheme that is static and not country-specific. This paper proposes an approach to construct novel composite confidence indicators, focusing on both the weights and the information set to use. We evaluate these indicators by studying their response to the policies introduced to contain the COVID-19 pandemic in some selected EU countries. Furthermore, we carry out an experimental study where the proposed indicators are used to forecast economic activity. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Previous research has neglected media audiences’ and citizens’ opinions on how the media should be organized, how they should function in society and what individual, corporate and state responsibilities should be in regard to these questions. In an attempt to understand the relationship between citizens’ broader political attitudes and their attitudes on media-related politics and responsibilities, this study uses a survey (n = 2003) of the adult Swedish population to investigate the distribution of a range of media political attitudes in the contemporary space of political positions. The results reveal overlaps between the space of media political attitudes and the broader political space, where support for a Nordic ‘media welfare state’ corresponds to leftist and GAL-oriented values, while TAN-oriented and right-wing attitudes link to scepticism towards state interventionism in the media landscape. A small but highly opinionated right-wing and TAN-oriented segment displays laissez-faire views on media policy that are reflected in current policy propositions from right-wing political parties in parliament. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: This survey of wound care specialists in the UK aims to be the first study to establish the prevalence of mobile wound app use and the perceived barriers to their implementation in wound care. This article presents the quantitative findings of the study. Method: A cross-sectional survey of UK-based wound clinicians was undertaken to explore the current use of mobile applications in the field of wound care. A 40 question SurveyMonkey survey was used and distributed via closed Facebook groups for clinicians working in UK-based wound care services. Data analysis included calculation of Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for attitude scales, summary statistics and thematic analysis of free text responses. Not reported in this paper The STROBE checklist was considered within the methodology of the study. Results: Overall, n=250 survey responses were received. Complete survey responses were received from n=153 wound clinicians. This included responses from 121 nurses and 29 podiatrists and from clinicians from all four devolved nations of the UK. Only 21–24% of clinicians reported using mobile applications for wound care at the time of this survey. Almost all (99.5%) of clinicians responding to the survey have access to a smartphone with most (58.7%) having both a personal and work smartphone Conclusions: It is evident that UK-based clinicians currently use mobile smartphones regularly, including within their clinical work, but do not currently use wound care focussed mobile applications. Barriers affecting the implementation of mobile applications in wound care services include a lack of interoperability between mobile applications and other IT infrastructure, poor Wi-Fi signal, negative attitudes towards technology, a lack of workforce diversity and bureaucratic obstructions. Implications for practice: Clinical leaders in wound care should consider the factors identified within this study when developing implementation strategies for new mobile application technologies into wound care services. © 2022, OmniaMed Communications Ltd.

AB  - Attitudes toward same-gender parenting are of timely relevance, given increasing recognition of LGBTQ+ rights around the world. Two studies examined the influence of 2 predictors of attitudes toward same-gender parenting. The first was informational influence, which was manipulated via a newspaper-style article dispelling misconceptions about gender identity of children reared by same-gender parents. The second was social influence via parasocial contact measured as prior exposure to a same-gender adoptive parents TV show. Religious fundamentalism (RF) was assessed as an individual difference moderator of informational or social influence. Outcome variables were beliefs about same-gender parenting, perceived problems with same-gender parenting, and social distance from same-gender adoptive parents. We studied these relationships in Canada (Study 1, where same-gender couples’ adoption is legal) and in Italy (Study 2, where same-gender couples’ adoption is not legal). RF moderated the results of informational and social influence in the Canadian context, such that those high in RF tended to be favorably influenced. In Italy, results of informational influence were typically observed among those low in RF, and social influence directly predicted favorable attitudes toward same-gender parenting. Informational and social influence can improve attitudes toward same-gender parenting, but RF and legal/cultural context are also important to consider. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper examines how public support affects interest groups’ advocacy success across three distinct stages in the legislative process. We hypothesize that public support is vital for advocacy success when coalition agreements are negotiated, and it has a weaker effect when legislation is introduced in parliament by the governing majority but becomes stronger again when legislation is adopted. We assess these expectations for 55 Belgian policy issues. We combine evidence on legislative outcomes with public opinion data and a mapping of interest groups’ positions in the news. The results indicate that public support is key for advocacy success in the coalition agreement. However, the positive effect of public support weakens when legislation is introduced in parliament – the effect only materializes for initiatives by the opposition – and public support has no significant effect on advocacy success in adopted legislation. Instead, aligning with other groups and political parties becomes more consequential for advocacy success in later legislative stages. Still, on average, interest groups attaining their preferences in adopted legislation enjoy considerable public support. Our results thus underscore the relevance of distinguishing between legislative stages when analyzing interest groups’ advocacy success. © 2022 European Consortium for Political Research.

AB  - In order to solve the problem of news communication innovation in the financial media environment, meet the update needs of news communication in the financial media environment, and make up for the shortcomings of the application of emerging media technologies in news communication, it is necessary to improve people's attention to news communication. With the advent of the era of integrated media, the application of emerging media technologies such as data news and robot news to the field of news communication has shaken the status of TV news in communication and affected its news production mode, but it will not replace traditional news, become the "forced mechanism"of traditional news production reform, and boost its reform and promotion. According to the social survey of 100 people, it is found that 88 people believe that under this competition mode, the development and challenges of TV livelihood news coexist. As Yu Guoming, a professor at Renmin University of China, said, "people's livelihood news is in the process of becoming a butterfly."TV people's livelihood news practitioners should reshape their news ideals and establish Internet thinking to face the ever-changing communication ecological environment. From channel expansion to content integration, from serving users to public opinion guidance, we are committed to building a new mainstream media with the guidance of traditional TV media, content advantages, equal communication, real-time interaction, and distinctive personality of new media. Only in this way can we obtain enough voice and influence in the highly competitive media environment. © 2022 Yu Wu.

AB  - The expanding profile of Chinese international development aid has generated strong academic and policy interests. A growing literature has emerged on Chinese foreign aid’s motivations, modalities, and impact. However, a significant lacuna remains in the domestic politics relating to this phenomenon. This gap is especially glaring in public opinion concerning China’s growing foreign aid programs. By analyzing empirical data gathered from a variety of sources, including a well-established online forum, social media sites of two influential media organizations, and multi-year surveys of residents of Beijing, this paper presents a nuanced picture of what the Chinese public thinks of Chinese foreign aid and tests two popular explanations of public opposition to foreign aid—perceived budgetary trade-offs and more general dissatisfaction with government policies. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Many scholars argue that the media can influence parliamentarians though the extent of that influence is hotly debated. There is some evidence that the relationship is two way, with politicians taking note of salient media stories but using the media to communicate with their constituents. It is also apparent that, whilst the media may have a role in drawing attention to specific issues, politicians in Kenya do not entirely trust it and thus use a wide range of other sources including government agencies as well as third party sources such as interest groups. This article addresses two gaps in our knowledge―the extent to which parliamentarians in Kenya turn to unofficial sources for information and public opinion, especially interest groups, and the extent to which the media in particular influences parliamentarians in Kenya. The results suggest that parliamentarians in Kenya rely to some extent on both the media and interest groups and that the media is good at raising awareness and stimulating action but that it has only a modest effect on political actions. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Background: Negative public perceptions of mental diseases and even therapists are among the most important obstacles to patients' therapeutic progress. Such attitudes are constructed by cultural and social structures. Through continuous reproducing and representing these attitudes, the media can strengthen the negative attitudes toward mental patients. On the other hand, the critical representation of social and cultural clichés in the media can reduce mental illness stigma. Psychiatrists should interact with the media regarding their concerns about mental illness stigma to achieve this goal; as a result, they must learn how to communicate with the media. Methods: A 5-day workshop was designed and implemented with the participation of 11 facilitators and 16 psychiatry residents from five universities in Iran. Then, a focus group session was held. Results: According to the results of the quantitative data analysis, the trainees prefer online media over traditional media, implying that they prefer interactive media platforms. Before the workshop, the trainees had believed that media coverage of psychiatry is biased and erroneous and that they should oversee the entire process of health content development by journalists. Besides, they were also interested in communicating with society. After the workshop, the focus group interview showed that the participating psychiatry residents felt that this activity improved their media literacy, enhanced their skills at interacting with the media, and encouraged them to interact more with the media in the future on health-related issues. Conclusion: Residents in psychiatry have a higher tendency for communicating with the media in the field of mental health in general. They stated that they needed to engage in the creation of popular mental health content. © Iran University of Medical Sciences

AB  - Purpose: Despite the established relationship between the public's trust in government and their adoption of preventive behaviour, lesser is known about the underlying mechanism that explains trust in government—preventive behaviour nexus. This study adopted the health belief model to propose five types of health perceptions as a mediator between trust in government and the public's voluntary adoption of recommended preventions for COVID-19. Design/methodology/approach: To collect primary quantitative data, a web survey was conducted using snowball sampling from Malaysia (N = 343) and Pakistan (N = 321). Measures were adopted from the existing studies. Structural equation modelling-partial least square through SmartPLS was used to analyse the proposed framework and hypotheses testing. Findings: Results revealed that trust is a significant predictor of perceived barriers, benefits and self-efficacy in both countries. Mediation analysis indicated that perceived benefits and self-efficacy to be mediators in both samples. In the Pakistani sample, perceived barriers were also a mediator. Importance-performance analysis showed that the Malaysian public has a greater trust in their government to tackle the pandemic issue, while the trust was a relatively more important predictor of voluntary precautionary behaviour in Pakistan. A full mediation model depicted that coping health belief are an imperative link between trust and prevention. Originality/value: Although developing the public's trust is related to good governance and public opinion, during a health crisis, authorities can effectively utilize the communication media and design interventions to influence health appraisals leading to higher adoption of prevention. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The COVID-19 vaccinations have reignited optimism in many cultures devastated by the pandemic's tremendous loss of lives and livelihoods. Vaccination hesitancy is a critical and growing international problem in the global effort to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. To successfully handle vaccination hesitancy concerns, it is necessary to understand the levels of knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors on COVID-19. The purpose of this study was to understand people’s knowledge, behaviors, and attitudes about COVID 19 and its related vaccines. Methods: In October 2021, a cross-sectional study with 232 participants was conducted. A standardized interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect data. Results: Most respondents in the present survey heard about COVID-19 between January and March 2020. Social media and newspapers are the most effective sources of information on COVID-19, reaching 34.48 % of the population. Basic COVID-19 knowledge was reported to be moderate. Nearly half of the respondents (48.3 %) thought SARSCOV-2 was man-made, while 36.21 % were unsure. Good preventive behaviors were indicated by 49.14 % of subjects. Overall, we find that around 65 % of people are reluctant to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Male gender, low education, and occupation were shown to be more hesitant about vaccination. In this study, healthcare workers were averse to getting the COVID-19 vaccine. The reasons for vaccination hesitation were "unknown safety" of the vaccines (17.4 %) and "unknown long-term consequences" of the vaccines (18.97 %). Almost a third (27.59 %) of those interviewed said they had no intention of being vaccinated. Conclusion: We report moderate knowledge on COVID-19, as well as effective preventive practices, but negative attitudes regarding COVID-19 vaccination, resulting in low vaccination rates of 6.9%. Misinformation regarding COVID-19 appears to play a key role in vaccination reluctance. © 2022, National Institute for Medical Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding when, to what extent, and in which contexts high-profile police actions influence trust in and legitimacy of the police is important because police perceptions are associated with cooperation, compliance and, eventually, trust in the state itself. The current study uses a quasi-experimental design to assess changes in public attitudes toward the police after the violent police dispersal of a protest movement against a new railway station project in Stuttgart on 30 September 2010. We found little to no change in several dimensions of perceptions of police and legitimacy, specifically measures of trust in police, moral alignment, procedural fairness, and obligation to obey the police. However, respondents interviewed after the event saw the police as more unduly influenced by political pressure. The results suggest that the impact of high-profile incidents of police violence may depend on institutional context, media response, and post-incident reconciliation strategies. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This study uses the Narrative Policy Framework to examine President Trump's tweets about immigration policy from 2011 to 2020. Based on a content analysis of 1733 tweets, I show that Trump's policy narratives centered on the villain character type, though the actual villains varied over time, and that the hero character became increasingly prominent throughout Trump's administration. While the characters, settings, and solutions in Trump's immigration policy tweets fluctuated, they were consistent with a narrative strategy of conflict expansion, focusing on threats from dangerous “outsiders” and the neutralization of those threats by Trump and his allies in the Republican Party and law enforcement. I demonstrate that tweets featuring villains and victims were positively associated with retweets and replies, while tweets featuring heroes were negatively associated with retweets and replies. This research suggests that Trump's immigration policy tweets were strategic, though his efforts to shape immigration policy may have been secondary to his political goals of securing electoral victories and amassing power.

AB  - Background: Levonorgestrel and ulipristal acetate are common emergency oral contraceptives (EOCs). Lack of knowledge and negative attitude toward EOCs pose barriers to the EOCs access and utilization. Aim: This study aimed to summarize the studies on the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare providers and patients on the use of EOCs. Method: A systematic search was conducted from conception to April 2022 using the following databases: CINAHL Complete, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Thai Journal Online. Data were extracted independently and were meta-analyzed using DerSimonian and Laird method for the binary random-effects model. Results: 121 articles with a total number of 92,484 participants were included. The awareness of levonorgestrel as an EOC was 66.7% while the awareness of ulipristal acetate as an EOC was 36.9%. EOCs users received EOC information mainly from the internet, media, and friends. We found that 32.2% of EOCs users and providers agreed that EOCs acted post-fertilization, and 39.8% of the prescribers know the correct time to take the pill postcoital. Negative attitudes toward EOC use were found in 25.4% of the participants. For example, 39.4% of the participants agreed that EOCs users had increased sexual activity. Conclusion: The awareness of EOCs was low and misunderstandings or negative attitudes towards the use or prescription of EOCs were still prevalent. Educating healthcare providers, using media as educational tools, and improving education and economics can be useful in improving EOC users' awareness, knowledge, and attitude towards EOCs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - While mainstream elite actors with the ability to shape public discourse (politicians, academics, and the media) generally oppose far-right politics, it is widely argued that such politics represent democratic populist grievances, whether cultural or economic: ‘this is what the people want’ and the mainstream should listen. Building on discourse theoretical approaches, this article uses opinion surveys on immigration to argue that rather than following ‘what the people want’, elite actors play an active part in shaping and constructing public opinion and legitimising reactionary politics. This article thus interrogates how public opinion is constructed through a process of mediation, how certain narratives are hyped and others obstructed. What this highlights is that rather than the result of a simple bottom-up ‘democratic’ demand, the rise of the far right must also be studied and understood as a top-down process: public opinion is not only a construction but also an agenda shaper, rather than a simple agenda tester. This article ultimately finds that ‘the people’ can be misrepresented in four principal ways: a people to be followed; a people to be blamed; a people to legitimise reactionary and elitist discourse and politics; and a circumscribed people. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Albania‟s national interest is the integration into the European Union. To fulfill this objective, every state component, public institutions, civil society, the media, and the citizens, play a very important role. The main focus of this paper is the public sphere, the attitudes of Albanian citizens toward the EU membership, and their role in the process. By applying qualitative and quantitative methods, the main theories of the field, global and regional indexes, studies, surveys, interviews, and personal observations, we aim to focus on the citizens' attitudes toward the EU membership process. Our in-depth analyses have shown that the Albanian institutions, CSOs, and media to inform and include the citizens in the Europeanization process have not been effective enough. Thus, there is a knowledge gap between sensitive groups and the other part of society. © 2022 The author/s.

AB  - With the advancement of technology and the arrival of the era of integrated media, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and virtual reality are gradually changing the ecology of public opinion. This will bring new challenges to the technical discovery, data analysis, and response of network disease dissemination to public opinion. Internet data barriers are still widespread. The specific requirements are to explore the application mode of blockchain technology to bring a better service experience to the people. Therefore, this paper focuses on the dissemination of disease public opinion information and risk management research in the blockchain environment. Furthermore, the application of advanced blockchain technology is used to seek breakthroughs in the field of risk management of network disease transmission and public opinion in terms of technology and data. This paper systematically sorts out the research results of domestic and foreign disease transmission network public opinion, public opinion risk management, and blockchain through comprehensive use of literature analysis, grounded research, empirical research, simulation research, and other research methods. Based on theories of the disease transmission network, public opinion, risk management, blockchain, and system dynamics, we conduct research on network public opinion and risk management of disease transmission in the block chain environment. At the theoretical level, the research in this paper can promote the risk management of disease transmission network public opinion in the blockchain environment and carry out the construction of the theoretical system to deepen the application of blockchain technology in the field of disease public opinion risk management. At the practical level, the research in this paper can guide the improvement of the effect of public opinion risk management. Then, blockchain technology is applied to manage the risk of disease public opinion. In future research, the theory of public opinion risk management will be further enriched. We will apply blockchain technology to develop the evolution of the risk of disease public opinion transmission, carry out research on public opinion management and other aspects, and at the same time, try the design and development of a blockchain public opinion system. In this way, the innovation of blockchain in the development and application of disease network public opinion research will be promoted. © 2022 Huilan Yang et al.

AB  - This article investigates how three media outlets (the digital written editions of CNN, Fox News, and the BBC), perceived as politically partisan, framed the news on Edward Snowden, who disclosed sensitive cybersecurity issues. As the media is an influential actor in domestic and international politics, how the news coverage on Internet security flaws framed the facts under narrative dispute matters. Sentiment analyses were conducted on hundreds of articles published on the free-access written news websites between 2013-2018. The results show positive or negative sentiments expressed in most headlines, while more neutral texts are found in the news cores. © 2022

AB  - As history shows, and contrary to modern western society’s feelings, sharks were once respected and worshipped. Sensationalized media coverage negatively impacts the public’s perception of sharks and lack of information about management and conservation options negatively impacts policy makers’ ability to keep shark populations healthy. Understanding that people’s attitudes about sharks will influence their willingness to find a way to coexist with them, it is essential to acknowledge these attitudes when developing conservation measures. Just as risk management policies must adapt to new evidence-based information, so must shark conservation efforts adapt to the realities of public opinion. This perspective review, focused on the psychological aspects of human-shark interactions, highlights some of the current research, mostly from Australia and other countries where those interactions are more salient, on the beliefs and attitudes people have toward sharks. With this review, we hope to help policymakers and stakeholders, such as Environmental Non-Governmental Organizations (ENGOs) and the zoological community to better address some of the shark conservation challenges ahead. © 2022.

AB  - From the mid-1940s to the fall of the Colonels’ Dictatorship in 1974, Greek society was defined by an official anti-communist discourse that divided it into ‘nationally-minded’ Ethnikofron citizens and left-wing ‘enemies of the nation’. The article shows how this power discourse deployed visual media to construct an emotional regime of fear around communism during and after the Greek Civil War. It uncovers a large volume of propaganda imagery, including posters, illustrations, book covers, photographs, newsreels and feature films, which was used alongside texts and corporeal practices to vilify the Greek left. The article argues that the visual language of Ethnikofrosyni patterned itself on older scripts of negative othering embedded in Greek popular culture, such as lycanthropy, teratology, witchcraft, Islamophobia and Orientalism to discredit communism without engaging with its twentieth-century ideas and policies. Communists were therefore portrayed as monsters, beasts, barbarians, Muslims, Turks, Jews and unfeminine women to arouse primordial fears that threatened the deepest symbols of Greek national identity. The article stresses the centrality and relative autonomy of images in the discourse of Ethnikofrosyni and uses comparisons to unveil the processes of circulation and domestication operating across different national strands of anti-communism in the Cold War. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: This study examines how characteristics of victims and types of incidents described in a media account of gun violence affect public support for three categories of policies that regulate firearms. Methods: A randomized experiment with a sample of US public (N = 3410). Results: Victim race, particularly if the victim was Black, was a strong predictor of less public support for all tested categories of firearm regulation. Respondents were less supportive of policies to address gun suicide or accidents and more supportive of policy solutions to mass shootings, compared to street-level gun homicides. Depictions of victim gender, mental illness, prior incarceration, and age were less salient to support across categories of firearm regulation, compared to race and type of incident. Conclusions: Media coverage of gun violence has heterogenous effects on public support for firearm regulation and may influence support for policies aimed at reducing specific types of gun violence. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Existing literature tends to analyse the long-term evolution of the far right’s world-view rather than how it responds to short-term events. This exploratory study, however, analyses how the far right in Norway framed the unprecedented global crisis of COVID-19. The data encompasses 149 Facebook posts, online op-eds, columns, letters to the editor and YouTube videos about COVID-19 published between 1 January and 31 May 2020 by two radical-right parties, three anti-immigration/anti-Islam groups, one neo-Nazi social movement, one long-time neo-Nazi solo activist and a leading alternative media website in Norway. They represent the full range of established and new, minor and leading, and radical and extreme far-right actors from the last four decades. Based on the material analysed, Mjelde identifies four overarching frames related to the world order, governance, immigration and conspiracies, as well as nine subframes. A main finding is that conspiratorial distrust of the government constitutes a master frame that both the radical and the extreme right combine with other frames that reflect key tenets of their world-view. The findings underscore, first, the rigidity of the far right’s world-view; second, contradictory views within the far right about the remedy for the pandemic and the state’s role; and, finally, that China is emerging as a bogeyman on the US/Trump-friendly far right. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The relationship between Islam and Portugal is intimately tied to processes of national formation and diverse in terms of the key protagonists, historical periods, and political conjunctures that it evokes – hence it is particularly suited for the contextualised study of Islamophobia. Drawing on a larger European study, and specifically on discourse analysis and empirical research on the Portuguese context, this article examines, on the one hand, narratives on Muslims and Islam circulating in the academic literature and in cyberspace (2000–20); on the other, different expressions of Islamophobia – individual and institutional (Sayyid 2014a): i) a case of mosque vandalism and practices of media reporting; ii) concerns regarding educational equality raised by research participants, namely regarding school organisation and history teaching. Engaging with the intrinsic instability of the category Muslim – across historical junctures, political contexts, and academic disciplines – this article calls for an engagement with Islamophobia beyond the national register (Vakil 2010), revealing how the wider circulation of public discourse and interventions constrains the possibility of articulating Muslim political subjectivities. © 2022 Universidade Federal de Goias.

AB  - Haze Internet rumors have caused a serious negative impact on people's daily life and social stability in recent years. Therefore, this paper proposes a new approach to identify and assess the Internet rumors by intuitionistic fuzzy linguistic set and Choquet integrals method. First, non-additive measures and Choquet integrals calculating the comprehensive assessments of Internet public opinion are applied to incorporate the interaction between attributes. Then, the attribute weight is determined by the generalized Shapley function. In addition, an example of haze network public opinion risk shows that the approach has good identification and assessment effect. The approach can be used to solve the problems of fuzziness and subjectivity in linguistic assessments, and it can be applied to identify the customer service framework with the linguistic assessments process in emergency management. From the results, it infers that the haze network public opinion risk is directly related to haze incidents, while the role of media and Internet users can only indirectly affect the public opinion dissemination. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Taiwan Fuzzy Systems Association.

AB  - National identity is the cognition of citizens regarding to which political community they belong, and the tendency to accept the political, cultural and ethnic values of the state. Previous studies have found that national identity is heterogeneous at the subnational levels. Why do people hold different degrees of nationalism and patriotism in the subnational units? In this paper, we offer a political economic explanation of national identity, which links the state capacity with political attitudes. We employ a nationalism-patriotism framework to decompose the concept of national identity, then use the supervised learning approach to measure nationalism and patriotism based on a massive number of Weibo posts dating from 2011 to 2017. Automated text analysis shows that the state capacity plays an important role preventing the national identity from being weakened by globalization and the diversity of social information. Specifically, with the progress of China’s globalization, multiculturalism and various information have crossed the national boundaries, which undermines China’s national identity. In order to maintain this identity, the Chinese government utilizes its redistribution capacity to reinforce both nationalism and patriotism, and also its information capacity to strengthen nationalism. © 2022, Journal of Chinese Political Science/Association of Chinese Political Studies.

AB  - Online public opinion is gradually becoming an important medium that influences society's mainstream direction in today's period of rapid development of new media and network oversight. The propagation of public opinion on the Internet has become a serious issue affecting economic and social development, as well as national security. As a result, this research investigates the evolution of public opinion and the evolutionary stability strategy of groups. Furthermore, a scale-free network is introduced to develop a network public opinion propagation model based on the scale-free network to tackle the problem that the existing public opinion propagation model cannot fully reflect the law of public opinion propagation in real life. The model incorporates components such as external environmental influences, individual personality characteristics, and interpersonal intimacy, in addition to the law of public opinion dissemination in real society. This study uses MATLAB to carry out simulation and comparison analysis in order to test the model's performance. Simulation findings reveal that this model's stability is around 95.6 percent, and its highest accuracy is 94.3 percent, which is greater than that of the Krause-Hegselmann and Deffuant models. The obtained forms of public opinion are richer, and the results of public opinion evolution are more in line with the process of public opinion evolution in real society, thanks to this model's ability to visually reflect the changes in individual opinions held over time in the process of public opinion evolution. It has practical implications for future studies. © 2022 Ming Li and Ali Li.

AB  - Objective: This study aims to examine the influence of Republican and Democratic partisan television news on attitudes toward candidates for president immediately following the 2016 general election. Method: Using two waves of the 2016 American National Election Study, we examine feelings toward Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton before and after the election. Results: Exposure to Republican partisan media did have a significant negative effect on feelings toward Hillary Clinton, even when controlling for party identification, ideology, and feelings toward Clinton before the election. Consumption of Democratic partisan television, however, had no influence on feelings toward Donald Trump. Conclusion: Further fragmentation and the expansion of partisan media has—and will continue to—benefit Republicans over Democrats. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - This study tests whether the consequences of cross-cutting exposure (CCE) to political news on affective polarization depend on the type of media individuals consume. Findings from the 2020 American National Election Studies panel data suggest that CCE to cable TV news, a medium frequently described as uncivil, may increase negative affect toward the out-party candidate, and that such effect may be mediated by feelings of anger and certainty in one’s political attitudes. These insights draw attention to elite incivility, in addition to citizens’ partisan predispositions, as a potential contributor to the growing affective divide in American politics. © 2022 Broadcast Education Association.

AB  - This study aims to conduct a framing analysis of Chinese and American media coverage of Chinese COVID-19 vaccine. Since 2021, China exports or donates vaccines to developing countries, arousing the attention of Chinese and American media. The competition between China and the USA over national image extends to the vaccine field. Media framing is a powerful tool to construct a national image. It is worth comparing how Chinese and American media use framings to construct national images on vaccine issues. This study conducts a framing analysis of news coverage in People’s Daily (PD) and The New York Times (NYT) on Chinese COVID-19 vaccine from January to March 2021 to determine how the media use specific framings to construct national images. The results show PD favors official action and cooperation frames, constructing the discourse of “public goods” and “cooperation” and shaping a fair and cooperative China image; while NYT favors official action, conflict and skepticism frames, constructing the discourse of “diplomatic tool” and “competition” and shaping a selfish and competitive China image. A positive image is helpful for China to reposition itself in global public opinion and enhance its soft power, while a negative discourse deconstructs the positive China image and counterbalances China’s vaccine diplomacy. © 2022 Asian Media Information and Communication Centre.

AB  - Although collective efforts are essential to fight COVID-19, public opinion in the United States is sharply divided by partisan attitudes and health beliefs. Addressing the concern that media use facilitates polarization, this study investigated whether social and traditional media use for COVID-19 information attenuates or reinforces existing disparities. This article focuses on two important areas where the public is highly polarized: partisan affect and vaccine attitudes. Contradicting the filter bubble claim, our survey (n = 1106) revealed that social media use made people less polarized in both partisan affect and vaccine hesitancy. In contrast, traditional media use made people more polarized in partisan affect. These findings corroborate the growing evidence that social media provide diverse viewpoints and incidental learning. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This qualitative study was conducted using a content analysis approach. Purposeful sampling was performed with 28 participants (21 mothers and seven fathers) through in-depth, semi-structured individual interviews, two focus group discussions, and five interviews with key informants. All interviews were recorded and typed. Data were analyzed using conventional content analysis and software MAXqda2010. Analysis of participants’ perspectives and experiences showed the three categories including (1) Challenges of sexual health education (challenge between tradition and modernity, poor parental self-efficacy, cultural resistance, inadequate parental sexual knowledge and matching with socio-cultural developments, lack of access to valid educational references and government counseling services, parents’ negative attitude towards sexual issues and poor parent-child interactions), (2) The necessity of sexual health education (strengthening of self-control skill in adolescents, reduction in high-risk behaviors, enhancement of sexual self-esteem, emotional and sexual damage, reduction in media and cyberspace and satellite misuse), and (3) Parents’ educational needs for sexual health (physical changes of puberty, psychological characteristics of puberty, cognition and ways to prevent high-risk behaviors, ways to manage offspring’s sexual behaviors, communication skills between parents and children, mutual perception and building trust, and commitment and responsibility of parents towards the sexual education of the offspring). © 2022 College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists.

AB  - Stereotyping has always permeated inter-ethnic understanding, conflating knowledge with prejudice. The seventeenth century European image of the Cape indigenous peoples was bound by a sustained ideological bias. The so-called “echo chamber of the discourse of the Cape” captured the Cape Khoi as primitive beasts in a negation of Christian values, and meant that knowledge about the Cape Khoi did not actually advance (Coetzee). In this paper I show that the Dutchman Jan Willem van Grevenbroek, VOC clerk at the Cape from 1684 to 1694, did in fact challenge the prevailing European image about the Khoi, then commonly called “Hottentots.” In a Latin letter, he positions himself against negative primitivism and interprets Khoi customs as authentically Christian. However, Grevenbroek thus risks being drawn into an oppositional discourse that limits the possibilities for renegotiating stereotypes (Hall; Matusitz). At the same time, he strategically demonstrates that the stereotype contains no inherent knowledge about the people and thus exploits one of the few possibilities to open ideological discourse up to renegotiation (Hall). Grevenbroek’s position challenges the very notion of there ever having been a single, colonial discourse (White), which makes Grevenbroek a valuable voice in Cape history, post-colonial discourse, and the history of knowledge in South Africa and beyond. © 2022 Critical Arts.

AB  - Social media platforms provide massive amounts of data that can be used to analyze social issues and forecast events in the future. However, it is a challenging task due to the biased and noisy nature of the data. In this work, we propose a method to predict election results via Twitter. In particular, we first detect the stance of social media accounts using their retweets. Subsequently, we develop four different counting methods for our prediction task. In the simple user counting (SC) method, we count labeled users without taking any further steps to reduce bias. In the city-based weighted counting (CBWC) method, we apply a weighted counting based on the number of electorate in each city. The closest-city-based prediction (CCBP) method utilizes sociological similarity between cities to predict results for cities with limited sample sizes. The using former election results (UFERs) method compares predictions for each city against former election results to detect data bias and uses them accordingly. We evaluate our proposed methods with the data collected for the presidential election of Turkey held in 2018. In our extensive evaluation, we show that utilizing domain-specific information and location-based weighted counting is effective in reducing bias. CBWC, CCBP, and UFER methods outperform tweet-counting-based baseline methods. Furthermore, UFER and CCBP outperform almost all traditional polls, suggesting that social media platforms are alternative mediums for conducting election polls. IEEE

AB  - The rapid development of different social media and content-sharing platforms has been largely exploited to spread misinformation and fake news that make people believing in harmful stories, which allow to influence public opinion, and could cause panic and chaos among population. Thus, fake news detection has become an important research topic, aiming at flagging a specific content as fake or legitimate. The fake news detection solutions can be divided into three main categories: content-based, social context-based, and knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid fake news detection system that combines linguistic and knowledge-based approaches and inherits their advantages, by employing two different sets of features: (1) linguistic features (i.e., title, number of words, reading ease, lexical diversity,and sentiment), and (2) a novel set of knowledge-based features, called fact-verification features that comprise three types of information namely, (i) reputation of the website where the news is published, (ii) coverage, i.e., number of sources that published the news, and (iii) fact-check, i.e., opinion of well-known fact-checking websites about the news, i.e., true or false. The proposed system only employs eight features, which is less than most of the state-of-the-art approaches. Also, the evaluation results on a fake news dataset show that the proposed system employing both types of features can reach an accuracy of 94.4%, which is better compared to that obtained from separately employing linguistic features (i.e., accuracy=89.4%) and fact-verification features (i.e., accuracy=81.2%). © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Fake news is a major threat to democracy (e.g., influencing public opinion), and its impact cannot be understated particularly in our current socially and digitally connected society. Researchers from different disciplines (e.g., computer science, political science, information science, and linguistics) have also studied the dissemination, detection, and mitigation of fake news; however, it remains challenging to detect and prevent the dissemination of fake news in practice. In addition, we emphasize the importance of designing artificial intelligence (AI)-powered systems that are capable of providing detailed, yet user-friendly, explanations of the classification / detection of fake news. Hence, in this article, we systematically survey existing state-of-the-art approaches designed to detect and mitigate the dissemination of fake news, and based on the analysis, we discuss several key challenges and present a potential future research agenda, especially incorporating AI explainable fake news credibility system.

AB  - Vaginismus is a sexual dysfunction occurring in females presented as a contraction of the muscles around the vagina as a reflex, causing the failure of vaginal penetration. Although many psychological, social, and cultural factors that may cause vaginismus have been suggested, its underlying mechanisms are not clear. The aim of this study was to determine the sexual attitude, sexual self-awareness, and sociocultural status of women with and without lifelong vaginismus. This is a case-control study. A total of 148 women were included in the study: 74 women with a lifelong vaginismus diagnosis and 74 women without a history of vaginismus/painful sexual activity controls. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire, the Sexual Self-Consciousness Scale, and the Hendrick Brief Sexual Attitudes Scale. Sexual shyness (OR = 0.854), sexual self-focus (OR = 0.888) and birth control (OR = 1.279), communion (OR = 1.198), and instrumentality (OR = 1.330; the sub-dimensions of the Sexual Attitude Scale) were associated with (χ2 = 96.130, p &lt;.001) vaginismus at the rate of 63%. Those who did not receive sexual information; those who obtained information about sexuality from the social media; those who had negative thoughts about sexuality due to religious reasons; those who found the genitals and sexuality as disgusting; and those having more feelings of fear and pain are more likely to have vaginismus. Some socio-cultural factors may negatively affect women and cause vaginismus. Women with vaginismus had low sexual self-consciousness and negative attitudes toward sexuality. It may be incomplete to consider vaginismus only as a vaginal entry problem. Therefore, in the treatment of vaginismus, women’s sexual attitude, sexual self-awareness, and sociocultural factors should be evaluated in a holistic manner. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - We surveyed transportation students and the U.S. public to explore consensus and divergence in policy preferences. We find considerable agreement among planning students, which may be a strength—it is easier to pursue shared goals—or a weakness—too much consensus can lead to echo chambers and disconnection. Engineering students and the public shared some planner-preferred views (like expanding transit) but disagreed with planning students about the role of transportation and appropriate policy tools, especially road widening. Our results suggest that diverging policy preferences are, at least in part, a reflection of planning’s signature pedagogy. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Supporters of American Indian mascots claim that these mascots honor American Indians. If this is the case, then those who have more contact with, and are more supportive of, these mascots would logically demonstrate support for American Indian Peoples in other ways. In this study, we break new ground by employing a cultivation and social learning approach to examine possible associations between greater exposure to American Indian mascots and prejudice toward American Indians, as well as support for their rights. We used an online survey of 903 White Americans to examine associations between long-term exposure to American Indian mascots, attitudes toward Native appropriation, and support for American Indian Peoples. We found that greater exposure to sport media and more contact with American Indian mascots were associated with more prejudice toward and less support for American Indian rights, via double mediators—first via less opposition to American Indian mascots, and second via less opposition to other types of Native appropriation. These findings provide further evidence that American Indian mascots are harmful to American Indians, in this case via their association with higher levels of modern prejudice, less feelings of warmth, and less support for American Indian Nation sovereignty and trust relationship with the United States government. Further, our findings suggest that this harm may be related to lessons learned from the general phenomenon of Native appropriation, which includes acceptance of objectification and dehumanization of American Indians, disregard for their feelings, and legitimation of White settler colonial power. © 2022, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study examines the Twitter network discussing the inclusion of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans woman Olympian, during the 2020 Tokyo Games. By analyzing the Twitter reactions, top opinion leaders, and the modularity of the network, this study uncovers that (a) the majority of the top 10 most-liked tweets and the top influential social actors hold a negative attitude toward Laurel Hubbard’s participation in the women’s category; (b) compared to traditional news agencies, social media influencers and newly launched digital media agencies play a more important role in facilitating the flow of information in this network; and (c) the observed Twitter network is highly clustered, indicating that individuals tend to interact with people more frequently within their segregated subgroup, whereas information diffusion across clusters is more restricted. This research contributes to the understanding of how Twitter users perceive the inclusion of trans athletes at international sporting events by empirically exploring the Twitter network of Laurel Hubbard, the first out trans female athlete in Olympic history. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The rapid demographic shift toward a greater percentage of the elderly population increases the need for welfare services. Welfare technology and especially care robots can be regarded as an important measure to counteract such demographic challenges. However, when implementing new technologies, structured information is of immense importance to develop societal trust. Frequently, research addresses trust solely at the level of the end-user. However, trust at the level of opinion leaders and political decision-makers is also relevant as they are catalysts for trust. This study aims to detect the perceived trust level of users from the viewpoint of opinion leaders (politicians, insurance organizations, and media) in the Swedish, Finnish, and German society. Furthermore, this study uses qualitative expert interviews and identifies four trust categories: trust in the health care system, trust in regulations, trust in technology, and interpersonal trust. The findings stress that targeting only the end-users is not sufficient for developing technology trust in society. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: Vaccination programs are effective only when a significant percentage of people are vaccinated. Social media usage is arguably one of the factors affecting public attitudes toward vaccines. Objective: This study aims to identify if the social media usage factors can predict Arab people’s attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: An online survey was conducted in the Arab countries, and 217 Arab nationals participated in this study. Logistic regression was applied to identify what demographics and social media usage factors predict public attitudes and behavior toward the COVID-19 vaccines. Results: Of the 217 participants, 56.2% (n = 122) were willing to get the vaccines, and 41.5% (n = 90) were hesitant. This study shows that none of the social media usage factors were significant enough to predict the actual vaccine acceptance behavior. However, some social media usage factors could predict public attitudes toward the COVID-19 vaccines. For example, compared to infrequent social media users, frequent social media users were 2.85 times more likely to agree that the risk of COVID-19 was being exaggerated (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 0.86–9.45, p =.046). On the other hand, participants with more trust in vaccine information shared by their contacts were less likely to agree that decision-makers had ensured the safety of vaccines (OR = 0.528, 95% CI = 0.276–1.012, p =.05). Conclusion: Information shared on social media may affect public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines. Therefore, disseminating correct and validated information about the COVID-19 vaccines on social media is important to increase public trust and counter the impact of incorrect misinformation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Overestimation of the level of democracy is prevalent among citizens in nondemocracies. Despite such prevalence, no research to date has systematically documented this phenomenon and examined its determinants. Yet given the renewed interest in the role of legitimacy in authoritarian survival, studying whether and why this phenomenon arises is important to our understanding of authoritarian resilience. I argue that, even in the absence of democratic institutions in nondemocracies, autocrats exercise media control in order to boost their democratic legitimacy. This façade of democracy, in turn, benefits their survival. Combining media freedom data with individual survey response data that include over 30,000 observations from 22 nondemocracies, I find that overestimation of the level of democracy is greater in countries with stronger media control. But highly educated citizens overestimate less. These findings shed light on media control as a strategy for authoritarian survival, and have important implications for modernization theory. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to explore perceptions of the Digital Twin (a three-dimensional digital representation of an anatomical body) on a mobile health application, and the potential mechanisms that are important for behaviour change, with a focus on health and weight management. An explorative and participant-led approach was taken using semi-structured online interviews to explore the experiences of people, in this case non-users and users wanting to independently manage their health. An opportunity sample of forty participants from the United Kingdom (20 who had not used digitally assistive technology and 20 who had) were recruited from social media platforms (22 females and 18 males; mean age was 30). The interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using Thematic Analysis. Two main themes were elicited: Initiators of behaviour change (i.e., autonomous choices, social influences, and personalisation) and Barriers to behaviour change (i.e., adverse reactions, weight management norms and negative attitudes). Overall, it was suggested that the Digital Twin should be representative of a user’s personalised health information and BMI. These results can inform an intervention designed to use the Digital Twin to initiate and maintain lifestyle behaviour change. It can also develop our understanding of how such technology can be applied as a tool for health management. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The spillover of racism towards welfare opinions has previously been studied in several countries. This paper analyses how racism and welfare are formed intertwined in Austria. This remains an important topic, as the welfare state not only distributes material resources but is also seen as a site of socialization–at least within the German-speaking literature. Besides identifying a potential spillover effect within survey data for Austria, the article also discusses how the topics of the racialized, especially in the form of the migrant “other” and welfare state and support, are rhetorically linked within newspaper articles. Four rhetorical strategies are distinguished within the empirical material using the notion of the undeserving “other” to argue, among others, for general welfare state cutbacks. These strategies also introduce arguments for extreme cases of social exclusion within the welfare state that affect existing views on, and possibly also, society and social life itself. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - This article postulates broadening as well as deepening the agenda for critical research on the role of discursive practices in media, journalism and the wider public sphere/s in normalization of far-right populism and nativist authoritarianism. Our argument is that, on the rise since the early 2000s and especially from the 2010s onwards, authoritarian and nativist populism has posed some very significant challenges to contemporary media and journalism. This has made necessary the calls for in-depth, critical discussions about the norms and practices of journalism as well as for the systematic analyses of the sometimes obviously active role that news and opinion discourse have played in normalizing the nativist as well as radically-nationalist and authoritarian status quo. Through a set of empirically-based studies which outline how media carry as well as normalize far-right political and other discourse and ideology, but also how they become the tool and the target of far-right politics, we show that the entanglement between far-right ideas and actions on the one hand, and media and journalism on the other, has become ever stronger as well as ever more complex. At the same time, we also point to the practices in the wider public spheres where, inter alia, the pervasive presence of alternative far-right media and uncivil society and its news sources has posed wider and indeed numerous challenges. These have become evident in the ongoing radicalization of both online/offline media and journalism and of wider public opinion and imagination wherein the normalization of undermining of values and norms of liberal democracy has become increasingly prevalent and widespread. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Media coverage plays an important role in shaping public opinion and approaching solutions to homelessness in the United States and beyond. Scant prior research has shown that stories often highlight individual rather than structural causes and solutions to the issue, while also perpetuating anti-homelessness stigma and stereotypes. However, few studies have looked specifically at the role of photography in media stories about homelessness. In this study, we used content analysis methodology to assess features of 226 photographs accompanying stories about homelessness from U.S. news media outlets in 2019. Our analysis found that presumably homeless people were frequently photographed without eye contact and were not identified by name in captions, and that photographs often featured homelessness paraphernalia (e.g. tents, shopping carts) but rarely depicted affordable housing. These findings affirmed the dehumanizing nature of news photographs about homelessness, and underscore the importance of partnering with the media to raise awareness of stigma and ultimately bring about policy change. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand why some US Senators have more low-quality followers than others and the potential impact of low-quality followers on understanding constituent preferences. Design/methodology/approach: For each US Senator, data on Twitter followers was matched with demographic characteristics proven to influence behavior. An OLS regression model evaluated why some Senators attract more low-quality followers than others. Then, observations on the impact of low-quality followers were discussed along with potential effects on information gathering and constituent representation. Findings: This study finds that total followers, ideology and length of time on Twitter are all significant predictors of whether a Senator might attract low-quality followers. Low-quality followers can have wide-ranging implications on Senator’s use of social media data to represent constituents and develop public policy. Research limitations/implications: The data set only includes Senators from the 115th Congress (2017–2018). As such, future research could expand the data to include additional Senators or members of the House of Representatives. Practical implications: Information is essential in any decision-making environment, including legislatures. Understanding why some users, particularly public opinion leaders, attract more low-quality social media followers could help decision-makers better understand where information is coming from and how they might choose to evaluates its content. Social implications: This study finds two practical implications for public opinion leaders, including Senators. First, accounts must be actively monitored to identify and weed-out low-quality followers. Second, users need to be wary of disinformation and misinformation and they need to develop strategies to identify and eliminate it from the collection of follower preferences. Originality/value: This study uses a unique data set to understand why some Senators have more low-quality followers than others and the impact on information gathering. Other previous studies have not addressed this issue in the context of governmental decision-making or constituent representation. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - For many years, media and political discourses in Austria have claimed that the Muslim population rarely takes pluralist positions, but instead adopts a negative attitude towards other faiths and people of another religion. The Islamist terror act that took place in Vienna on 2 November 2020 fuelled this stereotype. In order to approach this debate objectively, this article examines Muslims' attitudes towards the religious other in an evidence-based manner. For this purpose, an empirical data set has been reprocessed and reanalysed. The present article reveals the ways in which exclusivist, inclusivist and pluralist attitudes are taken by Muslims; which religious schemes they prefer; and how they interact with non-Muslims in their social environments. In this way, the article sheds light on the diversity of Muslims' positions regarding the religious other and people of another faith; the impact of contextual conditions; and the role of media and its reception. © 2022 Jonas Kolb.

AB  - Prior research suggests that Twitter users in the United States are more politically engaged and more partisan than the American citizenry, who are generally characterized by low levels of political knowledge and disinterest in political affairs. This study seeks to understand this disconnect by conducting an observational analysis of the most popular accounts on American Twitter. We identify opinion leaders by drawing random samples of ordinary American Twitter users and observing whom they follow. We estimate the ideological leaning and political relevance of these opinion leaders and crowdsource estimates of perceived ideology. We find little evidence that American Twitter is as politicized as it is made out to be, with politics and hard news outlets constituting a small subset of these opinion leaders. Ordinary Americans are significantly more likely to follow nonpolitical opinion leaders on Twitter than political opinion leaders. We find no evidence of polarization among these opinion leaders either. While a few political professional categories are more polarized than others, the overall polarization dissipates when we factor in the rate at which the opinion leaders tweet: a large number of vocal nonpartisan opinion leaders drowns out the partisan voices on the platform. Our results suggest that the degree to which Twitter is political has likely been overstated in the past. Our findings have implications about how we use Twitter and social media, in general, to represent public opinion in the United States. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Media portrayals of sex offenders are often negative, suggesting that public attitudes share a one-dimensional portrait. But past scholarship has regularly relied on a single newspaper or combined national-regional newspapers when investigating the media framing of sex offenders, which has possibly masked the disparate discourse of sex crimes across geographies and outlets. Our qualitative content analysis of sex crime depictions in articles published between 2012–2016 from six daily newspaper outlets of major metropolitan areas demonstrates that the media framing of sex offenders is varied and multidimensional. Our analysis indicates four salient sex offender frames: the monstrous sex offender, the psychotic sex offender, the sex offender versus the victim, and the humanized sex offender. Each frame is constructed by distinctive scripts, or a sequence of events and actions to describe sex offenders and their offenses. As parts of the interpretative repertoire, sex offender frames and scripts are connected to specific policy initiatives from a conservative to a progressive orientation. © 2022 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - There is a negative approach and perception of the black South African accent in Drama Departments of higher education institutions in South Africa. The purpose was to discover the experiences of being an actor-in-training at a Drama Department at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and The South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance (AFDA). The research method was a qualitative design, and the sampling method was purposive. The inclusion criteria considered participants who could speak at least one South African language other than English. In other words, the researcher selected black South African natives from the Nguni language groups (isiZulu, isiXhosa, Siswati, isiNdebele) and Bantu language groups (Sesotho, Northern Sotho or Sepedi, Setswana). The exclusion criteria considered anyone registered at UCT or AFDA or already graduated with a degree certificate from those institutions. The researcher analysed the data using the Tesch analysis method. The study has communicated the effects of a voice-training syllabus that ignores authentic black South African vocal abilities. The participants’ experiences have shown a lack of interest in honing and encouraging black South African accents in the voice-training syllabus at Drama Departments in South African universities. It was concluded that there is more emphasis and attention given to British and American accents in the voice-training syllabus in South African universities and that black actors-in-training are encouraged to perform in these accents. The participants expressed that they do not feel prepared to perform characters with black South African accents because of this training. © 2022 South African Theatre Journal.

AB  - The market size of the Internet audiovisual industry is expanding continuously, which has profoundly affected the ecology of public opinion and the development of the digital culture industry. During the epidemic of Covid-19, it is witnessed that a surge of active online audiovisual users. However, several issues happening in the Internet audiovisual industry, such as spreading rumors, engaging in vulgar performances, which seriously damaged the network environment and social order. For this reason, a tripartite evolutionary game model of Internet audiovisual space governance was established to simulate and analyze the behavior strategies of administrative departments of radio and television, the Internet audiovisual program service agencies, and network audio and video content creators. Moreover, the game model is verified by empirical analysis. Results demonstrate that: only driven by the administrative department of broadcasting and television can the tripartite evolutionary game of Internet audiovisual space governance reach the expected evolutionary equilibrium point. Therefore, administrative departments of radio and television should give full play to the driving role in the process of Internet audiovisual space governance, strengthen the publicity of regulating the creation of Internet audiovisual content and the warning of vulgar creation through government regulation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In an era of multiplatform journalism and the extraordinary ease of presenting views online, democracies face a key challenge, namely convincing citizens of the rightness of the solutions put forward. The concepts of “deliberative communication” offer a seemingly simple solution to the search for social consensus. However, citizens are much more exposed than in the past to disinformation, misdirection and purposeful manipulation. This study examines the quality of public debate in the adoption of major health legislation in the Slovak Republic. The aim is to highlight the different attitudes of the participants to the debate and the different motivations of the participants in the broad public debate. The study presents an analysis of the outputs of professional organisations and political representatives at national and regional level. It highlights the biased coverage of local media and the level of debate involving an exceptionally large range of speakers. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This study uses a novel approach to identifying local contextual conditions conducive, alone or in combination to far-right political violence. The studied case is asylum housing attacks occurring in Sweden 2015–16. Using a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis of eighty-six Swedish municipalities, forty-two of which have experienced arson attacks against refugee housing facilities, we operationalize and test four hypotheses derived from the literature. These assumed the causal impact of (1) objective grievances, (2) mediated grievances combined with lack of political opportunities, (3) independent alternative media effects, and (4) broader far-right mobilization. In contrast to a number of previous studies, none of the three first hypotheses received support. No operationalization of objective grievances, such as influxes of immigrants, poverty, or unemployment distinguished the municipalities where attacks had occurred. Nor did the local level of discursive or political opportunities. Only one of our expected causal pathways—arson attacks as an extension of a broader local far-right mobilization in the context of a supportive local public opinion—was a sufficient condition for a large proportion of our positive cases. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Faith communities support a variety of public health initiatives as conduits of information and service distribution points. However, with the onset of the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19), there is concern that religious communities may be echo chambers for misinformation and conspiracy theories that are undercutting the adoption of precautions to prevent transmission and the use of COVID-19 vaccines. The purpose of this study is to identify the receptivity to and spread of misinformation about COVID-19 by faith communities and whether embracing these inaccuracies constitutes a uniquely religious effect. This study conducted three small analyses approach. First, we engaged in the automated text mining of approximately 2.3 million discussion posts from discussion forums noted for their conspiracism and extremism. Next, secondary quantitative analysis of two recent surveys from the American Trends Panels by Pew Research conducted in April 2020 (N = 9482) and February 2021 (N = 9429) were conducted to determine whether sources of information and preventive behaviors related to the pandemic were associated with uniquely religious effects or possibly mediated by other factors such as sociodemographic characteristics or political views. The association of White evangelicals with politicized misinformation was consistent across all three small studies. Prior to the availability of vaccines, religious themes consistently appeared in 15–19% of COVID-19 social media posts and were higher in subsets of the discourse tied to misinformation. The framing of COVID-19 using religious language was associated with the Christian right in about half of the religiously-themed posts. Religious themes fell below the 15% threshold once the vaccine was available. In the survey research, small, uniquely religious effects were found with White evangelical receptivity of COVID-19 information from Donald Trump and less reliance on information from public health experts, and small, uniquely religious associations were found with preventive measures. Among White nonevangelical Protestants and non-Hispanic Roman Catholics, there was found the same combination of a higher likelihood of reliance on messages from the Donald Trump Presidency and a lower likelihood for news-media use. Black Protestants showed a higher level of use and trust in state and local government officials. The study confirmed higher use of social media among non-Hispanic Roman Catholics but did not find this relationship among Hispanic Protestants. Faith communities are not always receptive to public health messages that promote the public good. This study indicates that the religion effects can appear early, giving time for health education specialists to address them, and that these effects can diminish once preventive measures are available. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objectives: Using the Health Belief Model as a conceptual framework, we investigated the association between attitudes towards COVID-19, COVID-19 vaccinations, and vaccine hesitancy and change in these variables over a 9-month period in a UK cohort. Methods: The COPE study cohort (n = 11,113) was recruited via an online survey at enrolment in March/April 2020. The study was advertised via the HealthWise Wales research registry and social media. Follow-up data were available for 6942 people at 3 months (June/July 2020) and 5037 at 12 months (March/April 2021) post-enrolment. Measures included demographics, perceived threat of COVID-19, perceived control, intention to accept or decline a COVID-19 vaccination, and attitudes towards vaccination. Logistic regression models were fitted cross-sectionally at 3 and 12 months to assess the association between motivational factors and vaccine hesitancy. Longitudinal changes in motivational variables for vaccine-hesitant and non-hesitant groups were examined using mixed-effect analysis of variance models. Results: Fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to COVID-19, and perceived personal control over COVID-19 infection transmission decreased between the 3- and 12-month surveys. Vaccine hesitancy at 12 months was independently associated with low fear of the disease and more negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Specific barriers to COVID-19 vaccine uptake included concerns about safety and efficacy in light of its rapid development, mistrust of government and pharmaceutical companies, dislike of coercive policies, and perceived lack of relaxation in COVID-19-related restrictions as the vaccination programme progressed. Conclusions: Decreasing fear of COVID-19, perceived susceptibility to the disease, and perceptions of personal control over reducing infection-transmission may impact future COVID-19 vaccination uptake. © 2022 The British Psychological Society.

AB  - In this paper, we examine social media-based participation and public deliberation in land-use planning. We use the Deweyan theory of the public, the Habermasian theory of the public sphere, and the recent theories of the digital public sphere as our framework, asking what should be the relation of public planners to the digital public sphere: should they try to manage self-organising participation, or should public opinion formation be free from the influence of public authorities? The empirical part of the study reflects on this question by investigating Finnish planners’ experiences of the role of social media in planning in the light of two recent surveys. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Distilling lessons from the author’s book, The Media Offensive: How the Press and Public Opinion Shaped Allied Strategy during World War II, this article provides applicable suggestions for the US military today. As in World War II, the press is both a weapon and a possible vulnerability in modern warfare. Consequently, this article offers practical suggestions for how the press can be used by public affairs officers, commanders, and policymakers to achieve victory in coming conflicts. © 2022 Alexander G.

AB  - In many Arab countries, political and media discourse about the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) tended to blend discussions of root causes with conspiratorial narratives about the perceived malign actions and motives of external actors. Investigating the role which conspiratorial narratives play in (de)stabilizing political order across the Arab world, this analysis demonstrates that distrust in the political system and support for Islamist ideas are associated with the willingness to blame external actors such as the United States and Israel for the creation of the Islamic State. The results thus demonstrate how closely intertwined the production and spread of conspiracy theories are with the crisis of Islamist ideology and authoritarian governance in the Arab world. © 2022 British Society for Middle Eastern Studies.

AB  - This article examines the factors that predict affective polarization and political engagement in the United States. Using an original survey dataset (N = 1,100) of a fairly representative national sample, this study explored some factors (e.g., age, gender, political ideology, and partisan news media and social media) to see how they predict affective polarization and political engagement. The results could be helpful to further study widening affective polarization, which is reportedly affecting democracy itself, in this current political and public opinion atmosphere “Trumpfied” in the last couple of years. The insights found in this research could also help devise political and social campaign strategies that minimize polarization gaps. The results might enable corporate entities to better classify their consumers based on relevant issues associated with polarization and political engagement. Future research is encouraged to combine survey data and social media data for a more refined outcome. © 2022 Atlantic Journal of Communication.

AB  - Bounded Generalized Reciprocity (BGR) hypothesizes that expectations of reciprocity provide the foundation for ingroup favoritism and outgroup derogation. These expectations can be influenced by interaction with outgroup members, including vicarious interaction through media. This analysis examines how non-Black participants view helping behavior by Black individuals, and how their interpretations of helping scenarios influence intergroup attitudes. Participants (n= 211) were randomly assigned to view a news clip in which a Black or White hero saves someone White, or whose race was not portrayed. When viewing a clip with an ambiguous victim, participants were significantly more likely to report that the victim was not White when the hero was Black–indicating an expectation of helping behavior between Whites and Blacks. However, when a Black hero saved an unambiguously White victim, participants were more accurate in their recall. Victim race recall and hero race interacted to predict future reciprocity expectations, such that Black heroes saving a victim recalled as White (regardless of accuracy) resulted in increased positive reciprocity expectations. Positive reciprocity then predicted motivation to avoid prejudice and prejudiced attitudes. These results have implications for how media depictions of helping behaviors may impact intergroup beliefs and attitudes. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of smartphone addiction in young adults, and to investigate the relationship between smartphone use, depression, anxiety, and social appearance anxiety. Materials and Methods: Sociodemographic data form, Smartphone Dependence Scale-Short Form, Beck Depression Inventory for Primary Care-Short Form, Beck Anxiety Scale, and Social Appearance Anxiety Scale were applied face to face in this cross-descriptive study. Results: A total of 259 subjects, 128 (49.4%) female and 131 (50.6%) male, were included in the study. 25.9% of the participants were smartphone addicts. There was a high positive correlation between smartphone usage time and smartphone addiction score. The social appearance anxiety average scores of the social media users (30.8±13.9) were higher than those of subjects who do not use social media (28.8±11.3). Smartphone addiction scale had a positive correlation with anxiety and social appearance anxiety scores, while not with depression. Conclusion: Our results revealed that the purpose of smartphone usage affects people more than smartphone usage or smartphone addiction. The internet, and especially programs related to sharing one’s appearance and lifestyle and applications that create an unrealistic appearance that conforms to virtual norms, can add hard-to-repair prejudices to the mind. This situation should be seen as a threat, especially for the younger generation, and is a new sociological problem worth investigating. © 2022 Istanbul University Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Introduction: Substantial distribution of information, education, and communication related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) are the most cost-effective means to deliver desirable behavioral changes to stop/diminish the spread of the disease. Material and methods: In the present study, a cross-sectional study was conducted, and the sample size was determined using a single population proportion formula. Collected data was processed with SPSS version 22.0 statistical software, and descriptive method of data analysis was used. A total of 363 participants were included from March to June 2020, using stratified sampling followed by a simple random sampling technique. Results: The findings revealed that, major source of information used by university students on HIV/AIDS was radio (52.3%), followed by television (47.1%). From the study subjects, 60.3%, 39.4%, and 31.9% of them labeled currently available information sources as group specific, fear arousing, and boring, respectively. Students from College of Medicine and Health Sciences showed a better understanding of the virus. Moreover, a small number of the study subjects, i.e., 66 (18.2%), had a negative attitude towards people living with HIV/AIDS. Conclusions: Most participants had fair knowledge about definition, transmission, and prevention of HIV/AIDS. However, knowledge by itself could not guarantee a change in behavior, as students were involved in different risky activities. In nearly all the cases, academic years of the participants and their field of study had an influence on the magnitude of behavioral changes delivered. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - Scholars have used the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF) to explain public opinion on a variety of policy issues and across venues. Recent work in the NPF has expanded the application of the framework beyond textual formats to accommodate policy narratives that are visual in nature. This article asks whether individuals respond differently to visual versus text-based narratives. The research argues that visuals are more easily understood, dramatic, and memorable than text, suggesting that visual narratives may have a greater influence on policy attitudes. I explore these possibilities using Twitter narratives related to the Dakota Access Pipeline in the United States. Exposure to visual narratives significantly increased perception of issue importance, but contrary to expectations, visual narratives were no more effective at enhancing information recall, shifting attitudes, and encouraging activism than textual narratives. The article discusses possible reasons for these findings, the implications for narrative persuasion, and suggestions for future avenues of research.

AB  - Many of the individuals charged in the January 6, 2021, attack on theU.S. Capitol did not have ties to far-right extremist groups, leading some pundits and researchers to speculate that extremism has become mainstream and much more common in the current political environment. In this article, we discuss events before and during January 6 that affected extremism and pushed people toward polarization. Specifically, we discuss the role of the media, especially social media, in developing like-minded content sharing and polarizing, extremist group norms. The role of groups to drive people toward protest is discussed within research on social movements. The role of identity and acceptability of prejudice toward outgroup political members and how this identity fed into increasing extremist rhetoric are also discussed. Then, we discuss conditions of the day of January 6, including establishment of norms through rhetoric and the social proof of extremist action, and also, the easy exit of those who could leave an increasingly escalating situation. Finally, we address the implications for the current political climate, including the potential for increased violence and extremism © 2022 American Psychological Association

AB  - The EU and China are both pioneers in energy transition and are major energy consumers. However, we know little about the attitude of the Chinese public toward EU's energy role or EU–China energy cooperation. The paper contributes to the study of relationship between agenda-setting and public opinion in the context of Chinese social media. Using empirical data, it finds that energy cooperation, energy trading, energy politics, and energy technology&service are the four co-occurrence networks of Chinese public discussion on the topic. Yet the opinion leaders differ on these issues. While verified media accounts are key opinion leaders setting the agenda in EU energy politics and trade issues, in energy technology and service issues, verified individual accounts lead opinions. The study helps understand the role of online opinion leaders in EU–China energy relations and argues that key opinion leaders need to play more active roles in communicating the issues and guiding public discussions. © 2022 University Association for Contemporary European Studies and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The COVID-19 outbreak has created effects on everyday life worldwide. Many research teams at major pharmaceutical companies and research institutes in various countries have been producing vaccines since the beginning of the outbreak. There is an impact of gender on vaccine responses, acceptance, and outcomes. Worldwide promotion of the COVID-19 vaccine additionally generates a huge amount of discussions on social media platforms about diverse factors of vaccines including protection and efficacy. Twitter is considered one of the most well-known social media platforms which have been widely used to share a public opinion on vaccine-related problems in the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of research work to analyze the public perception of COVID-19 vaccines systematically from a gender perspective. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the coronavirus vaccine-related tweets to understand the people's sentiment towards various vaccine brands corresponding to the gender level. The proposed method focuses on the effect of COVID-19 vaccines on gender by taking into account descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analytics on the Twitter dataset. We also conduct experiments with deep learning models to determine the sentiment polarities of tweets, which are positive, neutral, and negative. The results reveal that LSTM performs better compared to other models with an accuracy rate of 85.7%. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - There are few questions of greater significance in African international relations than China's actions in and engagement with other states. Chinese infrastructure, businesses, and people have blanketed the continent and revolutionized lifestyles, transportation, and political economies. The advantages and detractions of such developments, in turn, have shaped local attitudes. African attitudes towards China, nevertheless, remain largely the subject of conjecture. This article explores the contemporary attitudes of Kenyan university students to China through surveys and contributes empirical data to the literature. Combined with a comparative textual analysis of the main Kenyan newspaper, the article sheds light on largely unknown—but generally assumed—attitudes of Kenyans towards China. The findings question a stereotype of China in Kenya and, by extension, the actions and reactions of other Africans and African states towards it. They also uncover nuanced attitudes that confound the mostly negative Western narrative about China in Africa. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as debt, perceived racism and unfair labour practices, Kenyan university students' attitudes and discourse in the elite media have become less positive. There is, in addition, the broad perception that it is Kenya's leadership that benefits from the relationship and not so much its ordinary citizens. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Perceived variability is a relatively unexplored prejudice reduction approach. We developed a new intervention and tested it in two pre-registered experiments—in field and online laboratory settings. Across both experiments, we found that the intervention did not reduce prejudice. As expected, higher perceived variability correlated with lower prejudice. However, the correlations were weak and markedly lower in the higher-powered online laboratory trial. Overall, these results indicate that perceived variability may have limited scaling potential due to low adaptability and effectiveness. Exploratory analyses indicated that effects of the intervention did not substantially differ across age, gender, and education. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Current policies to manage ethnic minority unrest in Xinjiang are not working, and do not address the core root causes behind ethnic tensions. Drawing upon lessons learned from global approaches to improving inter-ethnic relations, and factoring in China’s institutional behaviour and norms, this essay looks at policy responses that could be entertained by the state to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It suggests that in the short-term (under a year) the state could be more responsible in using the big data it collects for targeted surveillance, in tandem with a community engagement approach. In the medium-term (one to three years), the state could employ practices to reduce ethnic prejudice by encouraging increased meaningful intergroup contact, and promoting a positive media portrayal of ethnic minorities. In the long-term (three years plus), improving the relative socioeconomic ethnic inequalities is paramount. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The online public opinion of colleges and universities, which utilizes social opinion, is a type of college student’s individualism that exists on campus and is a societal hot concern. With the advancement of Internet skills and uses, public perception of the network has changed significantly in terms of data quantity, sophistication, and production speed. The current public opinion assessment and monitoring system is hard to adapt to the variations occurring in this situation. It must be created under the guise of big data investigation. Furthermore, with the use of social opinion by colleges and universities, the problem of online public opinion is becoming more serious. The academic community has also been very interested in the college's early warning research on online public opinion. This manuscript examines the role of big data in guiding network public opinion in colleges as well as in universities. It is based on the analysis of the current state of college online public opinion. Our proposed model builds multi-level and comprehensive guidance metrics for new media through dynamic monitoring. It will help colleges and universities prevent early warning, processing, and analysis of online public opinion. Besides, it will promote the professionalism of online public opinion management in colleges and universities accurately and effectively. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The main focus of the present research is to investigate the media discourse about foreign coaches. This study explores the perspectives of host and donor countries through their media discourse, using the theoretical lens of established and outsiders. A media analysis was used to investigate how foreign coaches were represented in the media. Multiple sources were cross-referenced to capture the media and public opinions prior to, during and after national and international sport events. We found 257 media texts published between April 2012 and August 2014, in four different languages. The results showed the polarisation of the media discourse with foreign coaches either portrayed as instrumental for sport development and success, or stigmatised as unsuccessful mercenaries with no attachment to the host country. These results highlight the importance of cultural awareness and media training especially for coaches dealing with the media of a host country. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - We designed and conducted a (virtual) deliberative forum in the Republic of Ireland (N=50) on issues relating to potential Irish unification. We found that our participants, both before and after deliberation, preferred an integrated model of Irish unity in which Northern Ireland would be dissolved (the ‘integrated model’) to a model of unity in which Northern Ireland persists as a devolved entity but now within a united Ireland (the ‘devolved NI model’). We found that deliberation on procedural matters produces a substantial increase in support for specify-ing the particular model of a united Ireland on offer before any referendum. We also found that deliberation results in a very substantial decrease in support for holding an immediate referendum (within two years), and substantially increased support for a five-to-ten-year time frame. Overall, our findings suggest that public attitudes to models of Irish unity do not change upon learning and deliberation (with robust public preference for the integrated model), implying that if an Irish government’s preferred Irish unity model is not in line with Irish public opinion it faces a challenge in shaping the public’s views; however, attitudes to process do change as a result of deliberation (in the direction of favouring pre-referen-dum specification and a non-immediate referendum), implying that the more the public think about these issues, the more likely they are to favour the government providing clarity on the choice before any medium-term referendum. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Though India is no stranger to either epidemics or hate speech, the COVID-19 crisis brought to the surface many of the pre-existing schisms and prejudices that subsequently led to both the Muslim minority community and the Dalit community being cast as miasmic and constant agitators against the central government. In the case of hate speech against the Muslim community, it has led to a peculiar situation wherein the invisible but pervasive Islamophobia that has been plaguing the country from the colonial times has risen it ugly head particularly across regional news channels and social media networks, making the phenomena hyper-visible. The Hindutva1 politicians from the extreme right parties have been indulging in spreading anti-Muslim propaganda, moulding the image of the Muslim community as not only disease-bearers and super-spreaders of COVID-19 virus but also as being anti-national, as the central government has proclaimed ‘a war against the COVID virus’ (The Print, 2020, 26 April). During the initial spread of the virus throughout the country, there was an increasing tendency to show the Muslim community as intentionally spreading the disease or as being ignorant of current medical practices, with multiple TV channels airing the views that the Tablighi Jamaat event (a religious congregation held in March 2020) was marked as a super-spreader event, and with multiple politicians engaging in rumour-mongering and hate-speech against the Muslims, framing the community as a miasmic community that needs to be cleared from India. On the other hand, the hate speech against Dalits in India is much more nuanced, indirect and layered. It began as WhatsApp and Facebook messages extolling the caste system and justifying the discriminatory practice of untouchability2 using the logic of social distancing and progressed to painting Dalits and Dalit spaces as unhygienic disease-scapes. This consequently led to the denial of livelihoods to thousands of domestic workers and unskilled workers who belonged to lower caste groups as they found themselves without jobs as most middle caste upper caste families and business owners fired their employees without notice. The study involves a hermeneutical analysis of news reports of the spread of COVID from newspapers and electronic media in English as well as interviews with at least 100 members of groups on social media (WhatsApp and Facebook) that propagate extremely communal and casteist material. © 2022 Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad.

AB  - Linguistic Explorations of Societies (LES) is an interdisciplinary research project with scholars from the fields of political science, computer science, and computational linguistics. The overarching ambition of LES has been to contribute to the survey-based comparative scholarship by compiling and analyzing online text data within and between languages and countries. To this end, the project has developed an online semantic lexicon, which allows researchers to explore meanings and usages of words in online media across a substantial number of geo-coded languages. The lexicon covers data from approximately 140 language–country combinations and is, to our knowledge, the most extensive free research resource of its kind. Such a resource makes it possible to critically examine survey translations and identify discrepancies in order to modify and improve existing survey methodology, and its unique features further enable Internet researchers to study public debate online from a comparative perspective. In this article, we discuss the social scientific rationale for using online text data as a complement to survey data, and present the natural language processing–based methodology behind the lexicon including its underpinning theory and practical modeling. Finally, we engage in a critical reflection about the challenges of using online text data to gauge public opinion and political behavior across the world. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Polarization of public opinion is a major issue for societies, as high levels can promote adverse effects such as hostility. The present paper focuses on the polarization of opinions regarding COVID-19 prevention measures in survey data and on Twitter in the German-speaking regions of Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The level of polarization is measured by dispersion and bimodality in the opinions based on the sentiment in Twitter data and the agreement in the survey data. Our paper, however, goes beyond existing research as we consider data from both sources separately and comparatively. For this purpose, we matched individuals’ survey responses and tweets for those respondents who shared their Twitter account information. The analyses show that vaccination is more polarizing compared to mask wearing and contact tracing in both sources, that polarization of opinions is more pronounced in the survey data compared to the Twitter data, but also that individuals’ opinions about the COVID-19 measures are consistent in both sources. We believe our findings will provide valuable insights for integrating survey data and Twitter data to investigate opinion polarization. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Grounded in the international image theory (Herrmann and Fischerkeller, 1995), this study argues that individuals maintain general images of foreign nations that shape perceptions of foreign policy issues. Based on two identical national online surveys conducted in the United States (N = 1250) and China (N = 1311) in early 2019, the study explores the structure and composition of these national images among American and Chinese citizens and tests whether they influence perceptions of the U.S.–China trade war. The findings suggest that cognitive and affective components of national image are associated with the perceived favorability of the other nation and support for the U.S.–China trade war among the American and Chinese public. While media exposure played a more prominent role among U.S. respondents, personal traits such as cosmopolitanism, patriotism, cultural affinity, and personal contact with people from the other nation were significantly associated with people's overall favorability of the other nation and their support of the U.S.–China trade war. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Influencing and framing debates on Twitter provides power to shape public opinion. Bots have become essential tools of ‘computational propaganda' on social media such as Twitter, often contributing to a large fraction of the tweets regarding political events such as elections. Although analyses have been conducted regarding the first impeachment of former president Donald Trump, they have been focused on either a manual examination of relatively few tweets to emphasize rhetoric, or the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) of a much larger corpus with respect to common metrics such as sentiment. In this paper, we complement existing analyses by examining the role of bots in the first impeachment with respect to three questions as follows. (Q1) Are bots actively involved in the debate? (Q2) Do bots target one political affiliation more than another? (Q3) Which sources are used by bots to support their arguments? Our methods start with collecting over 13M tweets on six key dates, from October 6th 2019 to January 21st 2020. We used machine learning to evaluate the sentiment of the tweets (via BERT) and whether it originates from a bot. We then examined these sentiments with respect to a balanced sample of Democrats and Republicans directly relevant to the impeachment, such as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, senator Mitch McConnell, and (then former Vice President) Joe Biden. The content of posts from bots was further analyzed with respect to the sources used (with bias ratings from AllSides and Ad Fontes) and themes. Our first finding is that bots have played a significant role in contributing to the overall negative tone of the debate (Q1). Bots were targeting Democrats more than Republicans (Q2), as evidenced both by a difference in ratio (bots had more negative-to-positive tweets on Democrats than Republicans) and in composition (use of derogatory nicknames). Finally, the sources provided by bots were almost twice as likely to be from the right than the left, with a noticeable use of hyper-partisan right and most extreme right sources (Q3). Bots were thus purposely used to promote a misleading version of events. Overall, this suggests an intentional use of bots as part of a strategy, thus providing further confirmation that computational propaganda is involved in defining political events in the United States. As any empirical analysis, our work has several limitations. For example, Trump's rhetoric on Twitter has previously been characterized by an overly negative tone, thus tweets detected as negative may be echoing his message rather than acting against him. Previous works show that this possibility is limited, and its existence would only strengthen our conclusions. As our analysis is based on NLP, we focus on processing a large volume of tweets rather than manually reading all of them, thus future studies may complement our approach by using qualitative methods to assess the specific arguments used by bots. © 2022.

AB  - This study explores the effect of priming gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis and Germans. It aims to contribute a new theoretical perspective on the importance of gendered stereotypes in media discourses. Drawing on previous research, which suggests a theoretical model for examining the indirect effect of stereotypical gendered stereotypes in predicting emotions and attitudes toward outgroups during political conflicts, this study aims to explore the effect of stereotypical gendered priming on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees. It uses three online experiments conducted among Germans and Jewish-Israelis: the first two studies examine the effect of gendered stereotypes on emotions toward immigrants and attitudes toward refugees among Jewish-Israelis; the third replicates this model in Germany in order to explore the effect of gendered stereotypes on attitudes toward refugees there. Such empirical examination can promote a better understanding of the role of exposure to gendered stereotypes in shaping public opinion toward marginalized groups. It may also contribute to attempts to promote constructive political debate and media coverage by specifically addressing the societal constructs—gendered stereotypes—that can potentially advance positive political attitudes and behavior. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Twitter, as is well known, is one of the most active social media platforms, with millions of tweets posted every day, in which different people express their opinions on topics such as travel, economic concerns, political decisions, and so on. As a result, it is a useful source of knowledge. We offer Sentiment Analysis using Twitter Data for the research. Initially, our technology retrieves currently accessible tweets and hashtags about various types of covid vaccinations posted on Twitter through using Twitter's API. Following that, the imported Tweets are automatically configured to generate a collection of untrained rules and random variables. To create our model, we're utilizing, Tweepy, which is a wrapper for Twitter's API. Following that, as part of the sentiment analysis of new Messages, the software produces donut graphs. © 2022

AB  - Rumors are an important factor affecting social stability in some special times. Therefore, the dissemination and prevention and control mechanisms of rumors have always been issues of concern to the academic community and have long been highly valued and widely discussed by experts and scholars. However, in combination with the Internet as a new type of media, although people have begun to pay attention to online rumors, research on it is still relatively fragmented, especially in the cross-domain research specific to the social influence of online rumors, and there is no clear indication of online rumors. The specific definition also did not analyze in detail the internal connection between its influence and group behavior. Therefore, this article will combine actual cases to explore and analyze the spread and influence process of online rumors and show its social influence, hoping to enrich the research of online rumors. Nowadays, the Internet has become the most important carrier to reflect the public grievances. Internet users have expressed their opinions on hot issues such as enterprises, people's livelihood, and government management, which has formed a powerful public opinion pressure, which has far exceeded the traditional media. The hidden dangers of security cannot be ignored. Therefore, how to monitor network public opinion from a large amount of network data is a difficult problem that needs to be solved urgently. Firstly, this consists of four modules: information collection, web page preprocessing, public opinion analysis, and public information report. Secondly, text clustering, the core technology of network public opinion, is optimized, and single-pass algorithm based on double threshold is proposed. Then the dual-threshold single-pass algorithm is optimized based on the MapReduce parallel computing model, and finally a network public opinion collection technology is formed under the background of big data. Simulation results can greatly improve the performance of text clustering and can effectively optimize the design using the parallel computing model based on MapReduce. The average miss rate after optimization is 0.7569 times, the average false alarm rate is 0.5556 times, and Cdet is 0.5714 times. It proves that the collection technology based on machine learning under the background of big data is effective and has good performance. © 2022 Suhong Yang et al.

AB  - Journalists, pundits, and pollsters critiqued President Donald J. Trump’s fixation on his crowds—often suggesting they were smaller than he boasted or meaningless in connection to electoral or legislative outcomes. This project takes a qualitative rather than a quantitative stance to interpreting the meaning of Trump’s crowds. In doing so, we find messages presented his rallies as (1) engaging multiple audiences, (2) eliciting feedback from his base to sharpen his talking points, and (3) enraging his devotees to act on his behalf. These types of communications did two things that traditional polling data are unlikely to do: they garnered attention and vast recirculation in the contemporary media environment and have been linked to the insurrection of the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. This article draws from scholarship on Trump, news coverage, and social media posts to advance these themes, invites a more nuanced look at crowds as a complement to traditional understandings of public opinion, and closes by posing paths for future discussions of them. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - We examine the relationship between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians by proposing a conceptual model explaining the role of key mediating variables such as identification, narrative transportation, enjoyment, and political self-efficacy in influencing the attitude of the viewers of international TV drama towards female role models (politicians). We investigated the direct and indirect effects between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians by recruiting 359 students from two large public universities in the Southeastern United States. The hypothesized model supported the evidence presented in extant scholarship, suggesting that a meaningful entertainment experience could foster an appreciation of the fictional televisual entertainment and positively change attitudes toward female lead characters playing the role of a viable and competent politician. This study resonates with politicians, academics, and activists’ concerns that a positive media portrayal could promote the acceptability of female leaders in powerful positions. Our study clarifies the direct and indirect effects between media use motivations and attitudes toward female politicians and the role of crucial mediating variables such as identification, narrative transportation, enjoyment, and political self-efficacy in influencing the attitude of the viewers of international TV drama towards female politicians. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) developed a ‘Working Definition of Antisemitism’ in 2016. Whilst the definition has received a significant amount of media attention, we are not aware of any comprehensive philosophical analysis. This article analyses this definition. We conclude that the definition and its list of examples ought to be rejected. The urgency to do so stems from the fact that pro-Israel activists can and have mobilised the IHRA document for political goals unrelated to tackling antisemitism, notably to stigmatise and silence critics of the Israeli government. This causes widespread self-censorship, has an adverse impact on freedom of speech, and impedes action against the unjust treatment of Palestinians. We also identify intrinsic problems in the way the definition refers to criticism of Israel similar ‘to that leveled against any other country’, ambiguous wording about ‘the power of Jews as a collective’, lack of clarity as to the Jewish people’s ‘right to self-determination’, and its denial of obvious racism. We consider alternative definitions and prefer one like the Oxford English Dictionary (OED) definition, ‘hostility to or prejudice against Jews’, with the addition of the words ‘as Jews’. We recognise that the Jerusalem Declaration on Antisemitism (JDA) can play a useful purpose in illustrating the shortcomings of the IHRA definition. However, we do not advocate promoting it as the prime international definition. Indeed, we question the efficacy of using complex new definitions to combat racism against Jews or other groups, and instead advocate combatting it through collective action across societies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - During major epidemics, monitoring vaccine quality can ensure the public health and social stability. Considering that social media has become an important way for the public to obtain external information during the epidemic. We developed a dual regulatory system of vaccine quality with the government in the leading role and the participation of We Media, and constructed a four-party evolutionary game model (government regulatory agency, We Media, vaccine industry groups, and the public) and analyzed the stability of each game player's strategy choice. The system's possible equilibrium points are identified using Lyapunov's first law. Then the game trajectory between stakeholders is simulated by MATLAB, the effects of initial intention and parameters on the evolution process and results are analyzed. The results show that to ensure the quality and safety of vaccines and stabilize network public opinion during epidemics, the government should invest in an effective supervision mechanism. By strengthening responsibility, increasing penalties, and reducing supervision costs, the probability of vaccine industry groups providing high-quality vaccines is effectively enhanced. Restricting the behavior of We Media and supervising vaccine industry groups to reduce speculation reduces the cost of government supervision and improves its efficiency. © 2022 - IOS Press.

AB  - This article discusses the political relations between construction of Brazil’s national health system (SUS) and communication. Understanding communication as an underdeveloped field of citizens’ rights in Brazil, it proceeds on the hypothesis that the democratic formation of public opinion regarding the SUS is hindered by a media oligopoly in the telecommunication and journalism system. This affects relations between the forces in dispute over construction of the SUS. Drawing on analysis of opinion polls and studies of Brazilian media coverage of the SUS, it argues that communication is a key political determinant in building a social base in support of the SUS and overcoming the impasses identified by the literature. It concludes that the relationship among communication, politics and democracy challenges the SUS to dispute the formation of a public health awareness in the daily lives of Brazilian citizens, as expressed by Giovanni Berlinguer to Brazil’s nascent health sector reform movement in the 1970s. © 2022, Associacao Brasileira de Pos - Graduacao em Saude Coletiva.

AB  - Background: It is imperative to ensure optimal vaccine uptake at the population level to combat the deadly COVID-19 pandemic disease. However, refusal of the COVID-19 vaccine, poor knowledge, and a negative attitude towards vaccination are the challenges of the world. College students are among the high-risk subgroups of the population to COVID-19 infection and the main source of information and trust in vaccines to the society. Also, their judgement on vaccine affect the public attitude towards vaccination. Therefore, this study aimed to assess knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination and associated factors among college students in Gondar city, northwest Ethiopia. Methods: An institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 626 study participants in Gondar city. A multistage sampling technique was used to recruit the study participants. A pretested self-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data. Bivariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess factors associated with knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. The level of significance was claimed based on a p-value < 0.05. Results: In this study, 46.8% (95% CI: 43.3, 50.6) of study participants had good knowledge and 50% (95% CI: 45.9, 53.7) had a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Having comorbidity disease and being male were significantly associated with good knowledge. In addition, being married, being a health science student, being exposed to mass media, having a good knowledge of COVID-19 vaccination, and having paternal primary education were significantly associated with a positive attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination. Conclusion: In general, knowledge and attitude towards COVID-19 vaccination among college students are low. Comorbidity disease and sex were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination knowledge, whereas, marital status, category of college students, mass media, paternal education and knowledge about COVID-19 vaccination were predictors of COVID-19 vaccination attitude. Alleviating participants’ concerns and improving their confidence through health education is crucial. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In 2019, the HBO limited television series Watchmen aired to critical acclaim. A contemporary extension of the world established by the 1986-87 Watchmen comic, viewers and commentators alike have viewed the show as a critical commentary on racial politics in the United States. Using Nexis Uni’s News Database, we conducted an inductive qualitative content analysis of 31 news articles written by mainstream television critics and/or writers about the show. Across reviews, three primary themes emerged—White supremacy, revisionist history (specifically pertaining to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921), and the power of masks. The role of critics/writers in engaging audiences with themes about race is discussed. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article focuses on how exposure to different media genres relates to two components of attitudes, Muslims as a group and Islam as a religion. It also highlights how these components mediate the relationship between media exposure and behavioral intention, namely voting intention towards banning veiling in public spaces. The analysis builds on an online survey conducted in Switzerland. We found that exposure to specific media genres is not equally associated with attitudes towards Muslims versus attitudes towards Islam. Contrary to our expectation, we did not find the association to be stronger when it came to influencing attitudes towards Muslims as compared to influencing attitudes towards Islam. However, our findings clearly showed that it matters whether people consume news via television or newspapers, especially mass-market (commercial television and tabloids) versus upmarket news (public television and quality newspapers). Attitudes towards Muslims living in Switzerland are more negative among those consuming mass-market news than those consuming upmarket news. Anti-Islam attitudes, however, were only associated with reading newspapers - both tabloids and quality newspapers. The findings provided only partial support for the mediating role of attitudes towards Muslims and Islam concerning the indirect relation between media exposure and voting intention towards banning veiling. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.

AB  - Digital disinformation, such as those occurring on online social networks (OSNs), can influence public opinion, create mistrust and division, and impact decision- and policy-making. In this study, we propose a disinformation diffusion trend analysis and identification method, which uses social situation analytics and a multilevel attention network. First, we present a division and feature representation approach of social user circle based on the content sequence (internal driving factor) and social contextual information (external driving factor) of users associated with disinformation. Second, disinformation content feature, crowd response feature, and time-series feature are represented using embedding layer and bidirectional long short-term memory neural networks (Bi-LSTMs). We also present an attention mechanism model based on multifeature fusion, which can dynamically adjust the weight of each feature. On this foundation, the fused features are fed into the multilayer perceptron to identify the propagation quantity trend. According to the experimental results of real-world OSNs and social situation metadata, we conclude that while disinformation occurs across OSN platforms, the disinformation is more likely to spread widely in the original OSN platform. We also identify four typical disinformation propagation trends based on propagation patterns and propagation peak times. Findings from our experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach accurately identifies and predicts the diffusion trend of disinformation, which can then be used to inform mitigation strategy.

AB  - StyleLikeU is a hugely successful online social media platform that presents itself as a social justice movement related to body acceptance. Presenting moving personal stories, it offers a site for what it calls ‘diverse individuals’ to share their experiences as part of promoting individual self-acceptance in the face of a world that prioritizes one kind of body over another, which take the form of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, sizeism and prejudice against disfigurement. Drawing out the discursive script carried across the platform, we show how, beneath the rhetoric of progressiveness, social justice becomes a kind of personal therapy, related to empowerment and transformation, which erases actual differences in personal circumstances and the very forces of injustice. We place StyleLikeU into broader scholarly concerns about the neoliberal colonization of identity politics, diversity and intersectionality in institutions and in branding, drawing attention to how this can form one part of what are now presented as social justice movements. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Hostile attitudes toward refugees are on the rise, yet individuals who hold negative beliefs toward out-groups are the most difficult to persuade. Is an explicit persuasive appeal effective for such groups, or should fictional narratives with implicit messages be used instead? An online experiment (N = 1, 749) was conducted to test this possibility with three possible media-based interventions: a fictional sympathetic portrayal, a fictional hostile portrayal, or a documentary-based portrayal. Hostile portrayals increased negative attitudes toward refugees, while documentary portrayals increased positive attitudes and promoted stereotype reversal. These effects were observed regardless of nationalism or social dominance orientation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Muslims constitute about one percent of the U.S. population. Ten percent of U.S. media stories on domestic violence (DV) focus on American Muslims, implying a higher-than-average rate of DV in the American Muslim community. Our study estimates the prevalence of DV among Muslim women in greater Boston and compares it to DV rates among American women as a whole. The study also examines the effect of education, income, and employment status on DV in both samples in comparison with each other. We anonymously surveyed 332 American Muslim women over the age of 18 at five mosques in the greater Boston area and found the DV rate among our study participants to be comparable with that among American women in general. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (AddHealth) as a surrogate for the U.S. as a whole. Our study participants experienced less intimate partner violence and more aggression from parents and siblings than the women in AddHealth. Also, rising socioeconomic and employment status were not buffers against DV in our study as they were for the AddHealth participants. Ethnicity or country of birth had no impact on DV risk among the women in our study. These results are important because they counter the bias in U.S. media that implies DV is more prevalent among American Muslims than in the U.S. population at large. Our data also suggests measures to ameliorate DV in American Muslims need to target the whole family (i.e., parents and children of both genders). © 2022 Michigan Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - Whether Chinese grassroots environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) have played a significant role in Chinese environmental decision-making remains a subject of debate. Like companies, ENGOs seek ways to apply social internet of things to deliver quality services in increasingly complex environments, enhance capabilities, engage partners, and thereby influence governments. This research reanalyzes two ant-dam movements in Sichuan and Yunnan Provinces to assess which strategies ENGOs deploy, how they exert their influence, and to what extent they have influenced Chinese environmental decision-making. We identify three strategies adopted in the two cases. The first is a bottom-up (public) strategy that involves mobilizing the media and celebrities to exert public opinion pressure on the Chinese government. The second is a top-down (international) strategy that involves gaining the sympathy and support of the international community to exert international pressure on the government. The third is a flank-attack (political) strategy that involves winning over deputies of the Chinese NPC and CPPCC and members of Chinese democratic parties to exert political pressure on the government. However, all of the pressure exerted only catalyzes and accelerates the process of Chinese environmental decision-making: Its influence is secondary and represents an external cause. The will and determination of the central and local governments are the leading factor and represent the internal determinant of environmental decision-making. © 2022 Ying Wang.

AB  - With the rapid development of Internet technology, new media is more and more favored by people and has become an important medium to control online public opinion. Social public opinion caused by new media is also more and more concerned by all walks of life. New media has the characteristics of fast information dissemination, wide dissemination range, and strong arbitrariness of news release. Positive online public voice or negative online public voice will have a very different impact on people's lives. Some negative online public voice may even constitute a social crisis and seriously affect social public security. In order to analyze and predict the development trend of new media network public opinion, this paper presents a design of improved BP neural network model based on genetic algorithm, which is used to analyze public opinion in new media network. Experimental results show that this way has stronger processing ability and higher warning accuracy for online public opinion event index data. It can provide certain theoretical basis and data support for relevant departments to effectively prevent and manage new media network public opinion events. © 2022 Shi Yang.

AB  - Background: The prevention of anaemia among under-fives is largely contributed by the caregiver's knowledge, attitude, and practice in the preparation of foods and feeding practices. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of anaemia and caregiver's knowledge, attitude, and practices towards its prevention among under-fives in Zanzibar. Methods: A hospital-based analytical cross-sectional study was conducted which included 594 caregivers and their under-fives from April to June 2020 in Zanzibar. Data were collected using an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Predictors of knowledge, attitude, and practice were determined using binary logistic regression. Multivariate analysis was done to control all other variables. SPSS version 23.0 was used to analyse the data. P-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The overall prevalence of anaemia among under-fives was 69.1%, 43.8%, 22.9%, and 2.4% of the under-fives had mild, moderate, and severe anaemia, respectively. Caregivers’ knowledge, attitude and practice were 36.7%, 43.4%, and 49.8%, respectively. Having low family income, receiving information from family members, and mass media were the predictors of low level knowledge (AOR = 0.54, 95% CI = 0.32 – 0.92, p = 0.022, AOR = 0.53, 95% CI = 0.32–0.90, p = 0.018, and AOR = 0.34, 95% CI = 0.15 – 0.76, p = 0.009, respectively). Living in rural part of North Pemba district had a protective effect against negative attitude (AOR = 0.37, 95% CI = 0.23–0.66, p = 0.000). Having more than four under-fives and receiving information from media were the predictors of reduced chance of caregivers’ good practice (AOR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.28 – 0.91, p = 0.024, AOR = 0.40, 95% CI = 0.17–0.96, p = 0.041, respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of anaemia among under-fives in this study was quite high and alarming. This was reflected by low knowledge, attitude, and poor feeding practices. This study has shown that living in the rural area was associated with less chance of having good knowledge, a positive attitude, and good feeding practices for the prevention of anaemia. Emphasis should be made on raising the level of knowledge, attitude, and feeding practice, particularly for caregivers residing in rural areas. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Social media is Internet-based by design, allowing people to share content quickly via electronic means. People can openly express their thoughts on social media sites such as Twitter, which can then be shared with other people. During the recent COVID-19 outbreak, public opinion analytics provided useful information for determining the best public health response. At the same time, the dissemination of misinformation, aided by social media and other digital platforms, has proven to be a greater threat to global public health than the virus itself, as the COVID-19 pandemic has shown. The public's feelings on social distancing can be discovered by analysing articulated messages from Twitter. The automated method of recognizing and classifying subjective information in text data is known as sentiment analysis. In this research work, we have proposed to use a combination of preprocessing approaches such as tokenization, filtering, stemming, and building N-gram models. Deep belief neural network (DBN) with pseudo labelling is used to classify the tweets. Top layers of the base classifiers are boosted in the pseudo labelling strategy, whereas lower levels of the base classifiers share weights for feature extraction. By introducing the pseudo boost mechanism, our suggested technique preserves the same time complexity as a DBN while achieving fast convergence to optimality. The pseudo labelling improves the performance of the classification. It extracts the keywords from the tweets with high precision. The results reveal that using the DBN classifier in conjunction with the bigram in the N-gram model outperformed other models by 90.3 percent. The proposed approach can also aid medical professionals and decision-makers in determining the best course of action for each location based on their views regarding the pandemic. © 2022 Jatla Srikanth et al.

AB  - The development of big data technology and the popularity of we-media platforms make the prediction of news public opinion more complicated, which means that the complexity and dynamic nature of news public opinion require higher accuracy of prediction. With the rapid popularization of we media technology, traditional single-model algorithm is difficult to effectively predict network public opinion under the current background. Therefore, this paper proposes an algorithm based IGA-RBF neural network to deal with the complicated news public opinion prediction. Firstly, the ARMA (autoregressive moving average model) prediction model is constructed and the BRF neural network is combined. Then IGA is introduced to optimize BRF neural network, and the column vector of output matrix of hidden layer is optimized globally. The algorithm uses k-means clustering to select parameters in RBF network. The experimental results demonstrate that the model algorithm makes up for the shortcomings of the single prediction algorithm, improves the accuracy of prediction, and has better prediction results of public opinion trends. © 2022 Shan Chen and Guang Li.

AB  - In an era of rapid mobile Internet development, students are increasingly expressing their views on specific events through campus comments. In the Web 2.0 era, the concept of public media participation is widely used by students, and it is important to effectively analyze online campus public opinion comments and present the findings in a rationalized form for the management of campus public opinion. In the new era of education governance modernization, the level of public opinion management in universities has become a key indicator to improve the standard of education management in higher education institutions; therefore, this paper focuses on proposing an innovative deep learning-based research method for topic management of university public opinion. Firstly, through the improved LDA module with sentiment discrimination learning capability, the sentiment of the main arguments in the campus commentary is extracted, and then the statistical sentiment intensity of the in-depth learning module is used to analyze the sentiment intensity of the thematic arguments of different events in time series, so as to achieve the long-Term tracking of the trend of the sentiment intensity of the whole event. © 2022 Zhaofeng Weng.

AB  - In this study, a survey was conducted to determine the public opinion regarding the acceptance of using home composters as an alternative approach for household organic waste management. This approach is introduced as a method to replace the landfilling of organic municipal solid waste, which is the main solid waste management currently employed in Palestine, considering Anabta town as a case study. The results showed that people in the target area are welcoming of the home composting idea, and about 99% of participants are interested in owning home composters at their properties, which is regarded as a good reference for implementing the proposed home composting scheme in this area. The results showed that people are interested in the new proposed scheme for organic household waste despite their minimal knowledge and understanding about the composting process’s importance and effects. The survey tested the people’s expectations and thoughts about the home composting concept and found that the main motives for home composting were reducing the cost of house gardening and using the produced compost in soil nutrition, besides being part of environmental sustainability. On the other side, obstacles were due to people’s inexperience of the home composting method, as almost half of participants were expecting an exhausting, long process to produce compost, with the related bad smell and insects during composting progression. Hence, the study found that it is important to spread awareness about the right procedures to apply home composting among participants, in line with environmental awareness campaigns through social media, and provide personalized follow-up with participants. © 2022 the Author(s), licensee AIMS Press.

AB  - Western countries have witnessed increased hostility towards Muslims among individuals, and structurally in the ways that the media covers stories related to Islam/Muslims and in policies that infringe on the rights of Muslim communities. In response, practitioners have created media interventions that aim to reduce Islamophobia. However, it is unclear what causal effects these interventions have on reducing Islamophobia. Here, we test the effects of 11 media interventions developed by practitioners with an intervention tournament among U.S. samples. In Study 1, we identified three videos that most effectively reduced Islamophobia both immediately after watching and 1 month later. In Studies 2–4, we examined the psychological mechanisms of these successful videos and found an indirect effect of the interventions on reduced support for anti-Muslim policies through recognition of media bias against Muslims. This research highlights that drawing attention to structural biases, including biased media coverage of Muslims, is one potential strategy for ameliorating Islamophobia. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - In the first half of the 21st century, it is clear that racism and prejudice are prevalent worldwide and begin in childhood—as children can be perpetrators, victims, and bystanders of racism and prejudice. Reducing racism in youth is a critical step toward improving the society we all live in. This special issue reviews and synthesizes the latest research on racism and prejudice in childhood and adolescence, examining the role of families, schools, media, and friendships in reducing prejudice in youth and highlighting how to enhance collective well-being. By focusing on research over the past two decades, and including a range of international perspectives, this special section helps make theoretical, conceptual, and methodological advances on the topic of reducing and protecting children from racism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Sentiment analysis techniques have a long history in natural language processing and have become a standard tool in the analysis of political texts, promising a conceptually straightforward automated method of extracting meaning from textual data by scoring documents on a scale from positive to negative. However, while these kinds of sentiment scores can capture the overall tone of a document, the underlying concept of interest for political analysis is often actually the document's stance with respect to a given target - how positively or negatively it frames a specific idea, individual, or group - as this reflects the author's underlying political attitudes. In this paper, we question the validity of approximating author stance through sentiment scoring in the analysis of political texts, and advocate for greater attention to be paid to the conceptual distinction between a document's sentiment and its stance. Using examples from open-ended survey responses and from political discussions on social media, we demonstrate that in many political text analysis applications, sentiment and stance do not necessarily align, and therefore sentiment analysis methods fail to reliably capture ground-truth document stance, amplifying noise in the data and leading to faulty conclusions. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Monitoring the internet media opinion information quickly triggered by the implementation of the "double reduction"policy, and identifying the hot spots, tendencies, communication trends, and characteristics of media opinion are of great significance to government departments to grasp the dynamics of media opinion in time and assist them in decision-making. This paper uses the web crawler to dynamically collect the internet media opinion big data related to the "double reduction"of main media and utilizes text analysis and data mining technologies to dynamically monitor the hot spots, topic tendencies, and communication characteristics of media opinion. Taking the internet media opinion data on the implementation of the "double reduction"policy from January 1, 2021 to November 15, 2021 as the sample, the paper analyzes the media opinion of the implementation of the "double reduction"policy. The high incidence period of media opinion is consistent with the opening of primary and secondary schools, holidays, and the introduction of relevant policies. The topics of internet media opinion are highly targeted and cover a wide range. The media focuses on the implementation measures, new problems, new phenomena, effects, and evaluation of the "double reduction"policy in education. Strong provinces of education, large provinces of education, and difficult provinces of education are the main areas for media public opinion monitoring. The media opinion is in the fermentation stage, and there is no sign of heat reduction. The propagation of media opinion is in line with the theoretical characteristics of information propagation life cycle. This paper only takes the internet media opinion of the main network media as the monitoring object. Whether it is suitable for the media opinion of the whole network media needs to be further tested. © 2022 Jiling Li et al.

AB  - The Uyghur people of China's far west are at the centre of a propaganda war between the United States and China. Western media claims about their treatment may well be exaggerated, but the oppression of the Uyghurs is real. In linking its actions to the war on terror, China has created an increasingly violent spiral of repression and resistance. The United States is cynically using this to justify measures that are really about economic competition. Freedom for the Uyghurs can only come as part of a China-wide movement for change. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This project examines news coverage of public opinion polls and explores whether journalists and readers are familiar with best practices in this domain. Study 1 tests the effects of related errors on readers’ perceptions, and Study 2 asks journalists to reflect upon this kind of coverage. Readers (N = 495) only noticed errors when they were very frequent, and many did not assess stories differently based on the presence of errors. Journalists (N = 51) acknowledged that this coverage often contains errors, and many identified individual and structural causes. Taken together, this suggests the need for additional training in polling and numeracy for journalists and audiences. Such efforts could improve news articles about public opinion polls, as well as readers’ ability to recognize and seek out stronger coverage. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Scholarly works on judicial populism tend to concentrate on the landmark judgments of constitutional courts and apex courts. Nonetheless, the examination of the activities of ordinary courts is of great importance as they shape the lives of citizens and can strengthen or curb populist politics. In this paper I analyze a phenomenon emerging in the adjudication of Hungarian ordinary courts which can be labelled 'everyday judicial populism'. Based on case studies and empirical scrutiny I argue that the political populism of the Hungarian government has both a direct and an indirect, but clearly detectable, impact on judicial practice. As regards the latter, the government can manipulate (through its media) public opinion in certain court cases, and judges take this opinion - as the 'vox populi' - into consideration in their decision-making. At the end of the paper I examine the institutional conditions that have facilitated the emergence of judicial populism. 2022 © Mátyás Bencze, 2022

AB  - This study explores shifts in political trust during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in Switzerland, examining the role that media consumption and threat perceptions played in individuals’ trust in politics. We combine panel surveys taken before and during the first nation-wide lockdown with webtracking data of participants' online behaviour to paint a nuanced picture of media effects during the crisis. Our work has several findings. First, political trust, an attitude known for its stability, increased following lockdown. Second, consumption of mainstream news on COVID-19 directly hindered this increase, with those reading more news having lower over-time trust, while the relatively minor alternative news consumption had no direct effect on political trust. Third, threat perceptions a) to health and b) from the policy response to the pandemic, have strong and opposite effects on political trust, with threats to health increasing trust, and threats from the government policy response decreasing it. Lastly, these threat perceptions condition the effect of COVID-19 news consumption on political trust: perceptions of threat had the power to both exacerbate and mute the effect of media consumption on government trust during the pandemic. Notably, we show that the expected negative effect of alternative news on political trust only exists for those who did not think COVID-19 posed a threat to their health, while public service news consumption reduced the negative effect produced by government threat perceptions. The paper therefore advances our understanding of the nuanced nature of media effects, particularly as relates to alternative media, especially during moments of crisis. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Social media is fast becoming a key instrument to manipulate or influence social perception. Digital platforms are having a serious effect on the manipulation of public opinion through the spread of political propaganda and message amplification via coordinated campaigns. As one of the most used social platforms among politicians and democratic governments, Twitter plays a critical role in how information flows through trending topics. The main purpose of this study is to explore how coordinated campaigns, in this case astroturfing, were used to influence and manipulate public opinion during the coronavirus health crisis in Mexico. Our research provides new insights into the early detection of astroturfing and artificial amplification, in order to expose the efforts to manipulate online discourse in Mexico. In the pages that follow, it will be argued that Mexico is currently experiencing online manipulation through malicious strategies that may threaten its democracy. The following hashtags were used to explore and compare our approach in Mexico: #GatellOrgulloMexicano (Gatell Mexican Pride) and #AMLOPresidenteDeLaSalud (AMLO President of Health). This study intends to build awareness and to improve the public’s understanding coordinated behavior on Twitter. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The paper seeks to develop new avenues for a study of the Ukrainian press in the West European languages in Europe during the first quarter of the twentieth century. For the first time ever, we employ here the framing perspective for the study of the victimization grand-narrative of Ukrainians in their foreign-language print media in Europe. We examine the victimization of the Ukrainian people in terms of ‘human interest’, ‘conflict’ and ‘morality’ frames in the press discourse of the respective historical periods: colonial (1901–1918), postcolonial (1919–1921), and neo-colonial (1921/1922–1926). We argue that victimization grand-narrative in the press was used purposefully to evoke compassion and empathy from the West European public opinion for the Ukrainian nation as ‘collective’ victim (‘oppressed nation’). Additionally, this research proves that victimization of Ukrainians geared at securing support and solidarity for their nation-state aspirations from the European opinion leaders. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has a tradition for being among the most respected national police organisations globally. More recent political events in Hong Kong have however placed the HKPF in highly visible public order situations. A wide array of political factions have emerged as a consequence of the handover of control in Hong Kong, many of which have involved young people protesting the curtailment of democratic rights. In this paper, we utilise Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (n = 2075). We utilise Inglehart’s (1971. The silent revolution in Europe: intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. American political science review, 65 (4), 991–1017) concept of postmaterialism to examine how far young people’s more negative attitudes to the police can be underpinned by cohort-based (or generational) explanations. Our findings identify associations between postmaterialist values and lower confidence in the police. Those that favoured stricter immigration controls, experienced higher fear of crime, perceived drug selling in their area, and consumed certain types of media (notably television and new media) were also less likely to have confidence in the HKPF. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Purpose: Social media (SM) is a new communication tool that substantially contribute to facilitating online hate speech (OHS). In emphasis of the question “what role can SM play in an individual’s life?”, this study aims to understand Bangladeshi university students’ personal experiences and opinions of OHSs related to SM. Design/methodology/approach: The authors used an online survey method to collect data and retrieved responses from 410 students. Mann–Whitney U test, Kruskal–Wallis test and Spearman’s rank correlation analysis were used to test the hypotheses. Findings: This study found that hate speech is a familiar term among students. Students’ political views or opinions, religion and gender have become the most targeted instruments for OHSs. Comparing students’ use of SM, the authors found that Facebook was the most used SM site to spread hate speech in Bangladesh. In terms of personal experiences, the findings indicated that 45.6% of students became victims of OHSs at least once or more times, and the majority of students tended to simply avoid OHSs. Another significant finding was that OHS has real-life effects on the students, resulting in various personal and psychological distress. Originality/value: Although some research has been conducted on hate speech at the local level, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, no study has focused on the student community. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, this study is the first attempt in Bangladesh to focus on OHSs from a student’s personal viewpoint. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Iran lies in an earthquake belt, and many Iranians have highlighted memories of natural disasters. While visiting Bam, a city destroyed by a severe earthquake, my team and I realized that some inhabitants attribute the disaster to nuclear tests. These rumours were also heard from the survivors of the earthquake in Sarpol-e Zahab in 2018. Looking deeper into the roots of nuclear rumours, I found the origin of rumours about the unnatural cause of the earthquake many years earlier, before the 1979 revolution and in the Tabas 1978 disaster. In this article, the nuclear folklore around earthquakes in Iran has been investigated. Analysing public opinion about disasters without considering their perceptions, rumours, and folklore is not complete. The current study reveals an overlooked mechanism based on the long-term dictatorship and untrustful media have made understanding the disasters complicated in the country. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Societally salient issues, like migration, stimulate user engagement with political parties on social media. This user engagement, in turn, is associated with political behavior, such as voting. Nonetheless, few studies so far have investigated the interaction between these factors. We examine how anti-immigration attitudes are associated with user engagement with political parties on social media. In this study, user engagement is understood as following political parties on social media. Through online data that were collected in October 2019 among adults (N= 1,000) in Belgium, we investigate how attitudes and user engagement are associated with voting behavior. Results suggest that attitudes towards migration are associated with user engagement with both left and right-wing parties on social media. Moreover, these attitudes and user engagement - and the interaction between the two - are related to voting behavior: being against (being in favor of) migration and following right-wing (left-wing) parties on social media is associated with a higher likelihood of voting for a right-wing (left-wing) party. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2022.

AB  - The public and political debate about immigration now play a big role in all European elections, and there is a trend increasing an anti-immigrant sentiment that receives important media attention. This work, based on the European Social Survey (ESS) round 9 data for 27 European countries, contributes to such debate by introducing a new method in the field, a Fuzzy-Hybrid Approach (FHA), that complements other methodological methods that have been used to measure citizens’ attitudes towards immigrants. The novel approach in the field provides a synthetic indicator that measures openness towards immigrants (OTISI). Then, we analyse the relationship that exists between some specific sociodemographic variables and the new index. Results show that country, political orientation, age, religion, economic situation, gender, birthplace, employment, education, universalism, and conformity are key drivers that explain different attitudes towards immigrants. Our findings concur with other previous studies showing that the results are robust and that the method can be applied in future social science studies. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - How do cultural norms, ideologies, and beliefs shape public opinion and media framing of race-based athletic activism? This paper uses media coverage of and commentary on the 1968 American ‘revolt of the Black athlete’ to explicate the deep cultural structures that help explain both support and opposition. The paper begins with a brief, schematic overview of the proposal for a Black Olympic boycott that was the centrepiece of 1968 organising and how it was reported by sports journalists and in the mainstream media. The second section identifies the reasons American reporters were, on the whole, so opposed to the proposed boycott: the inherent lack of support for the athletes’ racial change agenda and the far-more-familiar arguments that sports were not the proper venue for activism. The third section argues that a whole constellation of cultural norms and beliefs—about sport culture, colour-blind visions of racial justice, and liberal democratic ideals about politics and social change—coalesced to make race-based sport protest appear both unnecessary and inappropriate. The conclusion summarises the implications for understanding both public reception of and media responses to contemporary, race-based athletic activism as well as for tracking institutional changes and cultural shifts unfolding in the Black Lives Matter era. © 2022 The British Society of Sports History.

AB  - Though there is evidence of an historical exclusion of trans women from lesbian feminist separatist spaces supported by radical feminist lesbian anti-trans discourse as well as modern examples of anti-trans perspectives promoted by feminists sometimes described as Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists, it remains unclear as to if there is a significant association between being a lesbian cis woman feminist and harboring negative attitudes toward trans women or alternatively, if the recent proliferation of exclusionary tactics directed toward trans women’s rights (especially via social media) has been the result of loud voices among a minority who have been successful anti-trans mouthpieces as of late. The current study utilizes survey data (N = 1461 cis women; n = 331 lesbian cis women) to investigate the following research questions: (1) do lesbian cis women feminists express greater levels of negativity toward trans women than other cis women (heterosexual, bisexual, pansexual, and asexual) do? and (2) is there a relationship between feminist identity among lesbian cis women and the stigmatization of trans women (as undeserving of rights, as incapable parents/mothers, as excluded from the military, and as sexually problematic)? Results provide ample evidence of anti-trans perspectives among some lesbian cis women feminists. Overall, the findings provide a starting point to begin to understand how to dismantle the complexities embedded in the relationships between feminism, lesbian identity, and trans negativity and work toward a trans-inclusive future of feminism. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate through free word association the perception of Brazilian consumers regarding the possibility of infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus through food. One thousand individuals answered the questionnaire via an online platform. Most cited terms (hygiene—8%, fear—8%, caution—5%) and categories (negative attitudes and feeling—72% and sanitization—60%) were related to overall COVID-19 infection rather than their specific infection through the food. The perception of the possibility of risk of this type of cross-contamination was greater for male participants, within the food field, with high income (>10 minimum wages), and from the midwest region. Nonetheless, there are still doubts regarding this possibility, especially for participants with low income (≤10 minimum wages), females, higher education (≥secondary school), who exercise professional activity outside the food sector and from most regions of Brazil. Practical applications: Although the SARS-CoV-2 virus was discovered 2 years ago, the emergence of new variants such as Omicron has increased infection and mortality rates worldwide. A possible way of COVID-19 infection is cross-contamination through food handling and contact surfaces if preventive measures are not applied. In this context, understanding the consumer perception from a continental-size country such as Brazil, with a wide variety of socioeconomic profiles, is crucial to minimize the severe impacts of the pandemic. Our study demonstrates the need to disseminate scientific information in different media to reduce misinformation, especially social media because most Brazilian consumers had doubts and uncertainties about the possibility of COVID-19 infection from cross-contamination through food. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - This paper focuses on metaphorical representation of coronavirus in medical myths on the example of the British media. To attain this goal, the descriptive metaphor theory is used for the analysis of metaphorical models for the conceptualization of coronavirus. The information about the virus transmitted by the media correlates with background knowledge of the recipient, acquires new conceptual characteristics. Our hypothesis is that metaphorical actualization of coronavirus in medical myths is represented by the descriptive metaphor, the content of which changes depending on the specifics of the spread of the virus over the country as well as the political situation in the country. The research is based on the assumption that metaphorical implications in medical myths influence the representation of the disease, which reflects not only general beliefs about this disease, but also molds the public opinion on political situation in the linguocultural society. The objective of this research is to analyze the titles and leads of the British press about coronavirus and interpret the metaphorical models for the conceptualization of coronavirus, used in medical myths. The objective of the research determined the choice of research methods: content analysis of titles and leads that contain metaphorical models for the conceptualization of coronavirus in medical myths; sampling analysis aimed at identifying and describing the functions of metaphorical models in the representation of the disease in medical myths. The notions of metalanguage such as the signification descriptor and the denotation descriptor are used to describe the functioning of metaphors. The research findings reveal that for the conceptualization of coronavirus in medical myths the following metaphorical models are used: ‘Coronavirus-military rival’, ‘Coronavirus-natural disaster’ and ‘Coronavirus-silver lining’. © Stepanova E.S., 2022.

AB  - How can authoritarian regimes effectively control information to maintain regime legitimacy in times of crisis? We argue that media framing constitutes a subtle and sophisticated information control strategy in authoritarian regimes and plays a critical role in steering public opinion and cultivating an image of competent government during a tremendous crisis. Using structural topic models (STM), we conduct a textual analysis of more than 4,600 news reports produced by seven Chinese media outlets during the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that Chinese media, instructed by the propaganda authorities, used a heroism frame to feature frontline medics' sacrifices when saving others in need and resorted to a contrast frame to highlight the poor performance of the United States in the fight against COVID-19. We also show that both state and commercial media outlets used these two frames, though the tone of commercial media coverage was generally more moderate than the state media version. © 2022 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Artificial Intelligence has guided technological progress in recent years; it has shown significant development with increased academic studies on Machine Learning and the high demand for this field in the sector. In addition to the advancement of technology day by day, the pandemic, which has become a part of our lives since early 2020, has led to social media occupying a larger place in the lives of individuals. Therefore, social media posts have become an excellent data source for the field of sentiment analysis. The main contribution of this study is based on the Natural Language Processing method, which is one of the machine learning topics in the literature. Sentiment analysis classification is a solid example for machine learning tasks that belongs to human-machine interaction. It is essential to make the computer understand people emotional situation with classifiers. There are a limited number of Turkish language studies in the literature. Turkish language has different types of linguistic features from English. Since Turkish is an agglutinative language, it is challenging to make sentiment analysis with that language. This paper aims to perform sentiment analysis of several machine learning algorithms on Turkish language datasets that are collected from Twitter. In this research, besides using public dataset that belongs to Beyaz (2021) to get more general results, another dataset is created to understand the impact of the pandemic on people and to learn about public opinions. Therefore, a custom dataset, namely, SentimentSet (Balli 2021), was created, consisting of Turkish tweets that were filtered with words such as pandemic and corona by manually marking as positive, negative, or neutral. Besides, SentimentSet could be used in future researches as benchmark dataset. Results show classification accuracy of not only up to ∼87% with test data from datasets of both datasets and trained models, but also up to ∼84% with small "Sample Test Data"generated by the same methods as SentimentSet dataset. These research results contributed to indicating Turkish language specific sentiment analysis that is dependent on language specifications. © 2022 Cagla Balli et al.

AB  - The role of young people in the virtual world tends to be an all-consuming one. Indeed, they play a role as actors in various aspects of the digital age. This study therefore sought to analyze the construction of religious messages related to doctrine, religious practice, and identity politics. Methodologically, this study implemented ethnomedia for young people who upload content to social media, specifically Instagram. The practice of religious deconstruction was explored through a multimodal analysis of the content these people share on Instagram. The findings of this study reveal how young people, as actors, produce items of content that are interrelated. The religious practices of these young people potentially trigger resistance to being moderate due to the seemingly infinite range of online religious sources. Online-mediated religious understanding, however, cannot be fully understood through the reductionist lens of binary opposites, such as moderates and radicals or positive and negative attitudes. This article illustrates that young people’s experiences without guidance and emotional expression online are affected more than by their knowledge and abilities of the digital world, and that their attitudes and the interrelated complexities need to be considered. © 2022, Association for Social Studies Educa.

AB  - The massive use of social media causes rapid information dissemination that amplifies harmful messages such as fake news. Fake-news is misleading information presented as factual news that is generally used to manipulate public opinion. In particular, fake news related to COVID-19 is defined as 'infodemic' by World Health Organization. An infodemic is a misleading information that causes confusion which may harm health. There is a high volume of misinformation about COVID-19 that causes panic and high stress. Therefore, the importance of development of COVID-19 related fake news identification model is clear and it is particularly important for Turkish language from COVID-19 fake news identification point of view. In this article, we propose an advanced deep language transformer model to identify the truth of Turkish COVID-19 news from social media. For this aim, we first generated Turkish COVID-19 news from various sources as a benchmark dataset. Then we utilized five conventional machine learning algorithms (i.e. Naive Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) on top of several language preprocessing tasks. As a next step, we used novel deep learning algorithms such as Long Short-Term Memory, Bi-directional Long-Short-Term-Memory, Convolutional Neural Networks, Gated Recurrent Unit and Bi-directional Gated Recurrent Unit. For further evaluation, we made use of deep learning based language transformers, i.e. Bi-directional Encoder Representations from Transformers and its variations, to improve efficiency of the proposed approach. From the obtained results, we observed that neural transformers, in particular Turkish dedicated transformer BerTURK, is able to identify COVID-19 fake news in 98.5% accuracy. © TÜBİTAK

AB  - A profound political tension between Turkey and Germany has gained an overall dimension on the political agenda of the intra-European migration discussion since 2016. As close trade partners, Turkey and Germany became gradually political adversaries on different issues. 2016 and the following years marked a turnover in the already worsened mutual relations. A series of political issues such as recognising the Armenian genocide in 1915, open allegations and critical views against the Turkish President and prohibition of election campaigns for Turkish government politicians in Germany had driven political relations between the two countries to nadir. This obscure situation led the Turks of Germany (The phrases “Turks of Germany” or “Turkish migrants” are persons with migration background from Turkey who still bear Turkish citizenship or formerly were Turkish citizens. This group's ethnic or confessional identity is not recognised; their legal status and country of origin are preponderant.), who have close ties to their ancestors’ homeland and consider Germany as the centre of their lives, nolens volens into a limbo situation. Within the “guest-worker program” framework in the second part of the 20th century, highly industrialised countries of Western Europe recruited migrant workers from different countries. This workforce should perform mostly blue-collar labour in the receiving countries. After six decades of Turkish presence in Germany, the grandsons and granddaughters of the former guest workers are well-represented in almost every sector of the society. However, their loyalty and integrability to the receiving country are challenged by German politics, especially by the governments of conservative chancellor Angela Merkel (2005–2021). If Turks of Germany feel closely connected to Turkey and Turkish culture (Workers from Turkey brought with them to the country of immigration their own “cultural assets”. Those are, language, religious and customary beliefs, social habits, dress, music, literature, social codes and manners, shared history, food, etc. However, migrants in the receiving country undergo a process of hybridity under the influence of the new cultural environment. (Please see: Bhabha [The location of culture, New York, NY: Routledge, 1994]) Culture within the framework of post-colonialism has also been discussed in Edward W. Said's book “Culture and Imperialism” (Said [Kültür ve Emperyalizm. Kapsamlı Bir Düşünsel ve Siyasal Sorgulama Çalışması. Hil Yayın: İstanbul, 1998]). If Turks of Germany feel closely connected to Turkey and Turkish culture, they are not recognised as integrable members of the society. Identity-based and culture-oriented policies inexorably influence the willingness of migrants to feel like equal members in the host society, and it applies even to the new generations with migration backgrounds. The question of migrant integration is the most emotionally debated issue in Germany and seems to be the greatest challenge in the political agenda. Beyond the bilateral Turkish–German issues, the growing xenophobic sentiments, islamophobia and Europe-wide political populism may cause a persistent bilateral tension in the medium term between the countries and among the transnational and native communities. Anti-Turkish rhetoric in the media alienates the Turkish community and has a value to jeopardise integration efforts more and more. © 2022 The Authors. International Migration © 2022 IOM.

AB  - The public's desire to protect their own interests has increased in recent years. As information technology advances, the number of Internet users grows, the penetration rate improves, and the number of self-media users of network new media grows. Using historical data to predict future behavior and learn from massive amounts of data, humanity has entered the new media age, thanks to the rapid advancement of mobile Internet technology. It solves the problem that traditional database management systems cannot find hidden relationships and rules in data and cannot predict the future based on the data they have. This paper investigates the use of DM technology to intelligently govern network public opinion. Finance, telecommunications, network-related industries, retailers, manufacturing, medical care, pharmaceutical industry, and scientific fields have all made extensive use of it. Data mining (abbreviated as DM) is a type of data analysis that extracts credible, novel, effective, and understandable patterns from large amounts of data. It is closely related to database knowledge discovery. © 2022 Jingyi Wang.

AB  - Rapid development of the Internet has contributed to the widespread adoption of social network platforms. Network media plays an important role in the process of public opinion dissemination and bears significant social responsibility. Public opinion mining is of great significance for online media to improve the quality of content provision and enhance media credibility. How to make full use of user-generated content is the key to improving the accuracy of position detection tasks. In this paper, we proposed a stance detection model based on user feature fusion by using comments of netizens in false news events on Weibo as research content. The method of feature fusion is adopted to integrate vectors including user sentiment, cognitive features, and text feature at the feature layer for model training and position prediction. The model is evaluated on a dataset of related microblog comments in false news. The result shows that our proposed method has a certain improvement in the effect of stance detection. © 2022 Weidong Huang et al.

AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research. © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Background/Aim: The first case of COVID-19 in Turkey was officially recorded on March 11, 2020. Social media use increased worldwide, as well as in Turkey, during the pandemic, and conspiracy theories/fake news about medical complications of vaccines spread throughout the world. The aim of this study was to identify community interactions related to vaccines and to identify key influences/influencers before and after the pandemic using social network data from Twitter. Materials and methods: Two datasets, including tweets about vaccinations before and after COVID-19 in Turkey, were collected. Social networks were created based on interactions (mentions) between Twitter users. Users and their influence were scored based on social network analysis and parameters that included in-degree and betweenness centrality. Results: In the pre-COVID-19 network, media figures and authors who had anti-vaccine views were the most influential users. In the post-COVID-19 network, the Turkish minister of health, the was the most influential figure. The vaccine network was observed to be growing rapidly after COVID-19, and the physicians and authors who had opinions about mandatory vaccinations received a great deal of reaction. One-way communication between influencers and other users in the network was determined. Conclusions: This study shows the effectiveness and usefulness of large social media data for understanding public opinion on public health and vaccination in Turkey. The current study was completed before the implementation of the COVID-19 vaccine in Turkey. We anticipated that social network analysis would help reduce the “infodemic” before administering the vaccine and would also help public health workers act more proactively in this regard. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Anti-tobacco propaganda media (Television, radio, print media and internet media) messages promote knowledge regarding the ill effect of tobacco on the human body as well as increase the negative attitude towards tobacco. However, their role in maintaining tobacco abstinence is not explored much. This review summarizes the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on the maintenance of tobacco abstinence; the influence of different types of anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages on tobacco users and non-users. Tobacco users and recent quitters are not benefiting from these anti-tobacco propaganda and media messages. The graphic pictorial warnings were found to have more influence over increasing knowledge, changing attitude, enhancing quit attempts, quit intentions, and motivation to quit. However, it is also noticed that these anti-tobacco propaganda media messages have a boomerang effect on tobacco users. These media propaganda messages sometimes act as a cue for tobacco users and make them relapse. Many studies in the past have shown that these media messages positively impact the quitting process but, again, remained significant to the first attempt only. Hence, these messages have not been found to be very effective in maintaining tobacco abstinence among tobacco users. The exposure and frequency of the anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages matter. Pro-tobacco advertisements can neutralize the effect of anti-tobacco propaganda messages. Although, anti-tobacco propaganda (media) messages play a crucial role in modifying tobacco-related behaviour. © 2022 Universiti Putra Malaysia. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2018, the Australian Government adopted an ‘opt-out’ strategy to increase participation in My Health Record (MHR), the national digital patient record system. Opt out was rationalised through discourse on the universal right to health. Media controversy ensued due to privacy fears, security and commercial exploitation of patient information. LGBT community organisations warned that people with complex health needs should consider their privacy and legal situation when deciding whether or not to opt out of MHR. With reference to the health needs of sexuality and gender diverse people, we examine MHR’s rights universalism, possessive individualism, and state-based rationalisation of health governance. MHR hails all but no-one in particular, erasing diversity and straightwashing data medicine. It is a technological solution to state-based imperatives for health governance, an emphasis that does not serve minority communities or address health needs that attract stigma and prejudice. We counterpose these effects with citizenship framings seated in critical approaches to data assemblages and sexuality and gender diversity. We suggest ways in which data medicine, of which MHR is but one example, can be made more relevant and effective for individuals and communities whose healthcare is poorly served by mainstream health systems. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The environmental sector is an interesting realm in Chinese politics to observe factors such as the contributions of new media activism in bottom-up communication and decision-making processes, especially during the 40 years of reform and opening up. Top-down efforts to curb environmental issues are primarily to address increasing pubic discomfort due to pollution and related problems. However, environmental movements are increasingly visible in China despite their application of stability maintenance mechanisms such as Environmental Police. It is therefore noteworthy to deeply analyse the factors that contribute to the increasing scale of movements in the country. This study examines the role of new media activism (occurring due to the public’s interactions through WeChat, Weibo, QQ, etc.) in shaping the trajectory of environmental movements in China. How are these avenues supporting alternative communication channels outside the mainstream policy making apparatus? Is the government willing to incorporate the interests developed in these channels to policymaking realms? How these behavioural changes are influencing the state–society relations in contemporary China in the context of increasing environmental concerns. The study employs agency-structure framework to analyse the interactions between new media activism and the single party ruling political structure with the support fieldwork data from China. The study examines policy documents, official declarations of the communist party, public attitude towards new media activism, and so on, in order to present a comprehensive understanding on the politics of ecology in the PRC. © 2022 SAGE Publications.

AB  - A focus on political consensus in the United States in the early 1950s has created a false sense of a period of national unity and of the press in that period as a trusted institution. This article uses listener hate mail to radio reporters during a divisive moment—President Harry Truman’s removal of General Douglas MacArthur from his command in the Korean War in April 1951—to identify a politically rancorous discourse, aimed at the press. This period of high emotion for Americans provides a case study in audience members’ sometimes hostile relationship with journalists and does so at an early moment in the creation of a truly mass national news audience. I analyze hundreds of unpublished, archival letters, from a time when public opinion polling was relatively new and still problematic, to rethink what our baseline measurement is for media trust and better contextualize claims about its trajectory. I find three tropes that are especially resonant in the present day and became more visible parts of the public discourse with the presidency of Donald Trump: anti-press attitudes, isolationism, and antisemitism. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This paper analyzes representations of Simone Biles in media coverage of two major gymnastics events in 2019. It asks which, if any, gendered and racial stereotypes identified in previous scholarship about media coverage of Black and women athletes are also present in coverage of Biles. It also interrogates in what ways these stereotypes intersect as distinct forms of representation of Biles as a Black woman. Employing the tenets of feminist theory and Black feminist thought through an intersectional lens, a qualitative textual analysis of 34 articles revealed that both gendered and racial stereotypes were present in coverage of Biles. The most prominent stereotypes include feminized emotions, lack of mental fortitude, negative attitudes, and physicality. These intersecting representations underscore the persistence of these stereotypes in contemporary discourse. This paper contributes to, and advances, the literature on media representations of women athletes, Black athletes, and Black women athletes. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Human–wildlife interactions generate public interest and attract substantial media attention. This becomes particularly interesting in regions where different languages are used by media reports, creating the opportunity to investigate associations between language and the perspectives presented in the reports. In this article, we used 207 English articles (from 2006 to 2019) and 721 Chinese articles (from 2016 to 2019) on human-wild boar interactions in Hong Kong to analyze the gaps and differences in how the interactions are presented in the Chinese and English language media. Although English and Chinese news reporting on interactions follow similar geographical patterns, they differed significantly in terms of the content included, the identity of interviewees, the management strategies mentioned and the reported causes of “conflict.” The distinct presentation of human-wild boar interactions in English and Chinese news has the potential to contribute to diverging public attitudes toward the wild boar and policy development. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Existing research has shown that the media can influence public attitudes to immigration. The adoption of a mixed-methods approach to audiences of immigration news, combined with a comparative design and a focus on Eastern Europe–a region scoring lowest in the world in terms of migrant acceptance–can bring significant advances to knowledge in this area, leading to a more rounded understanding of how media come to shape immigration attitudes. To demonstrate this, we draw on a comparative, mixed-methods data set comprising representative population surveys (N = 4,092), an expert survey (N = 60), and qualitative interviews (N = 120) conducted in four Eastern European countries. In contrast to existing research on Western Europe, we found significant variation in the links between attitudes to immigration and use of Public Service Media (PSM), with PSM consumption linked with more negative attitudes to immigration in some countries, and with more positive attitudes in others. Second, our results confirm that different attitudes to immigration are embedded in different qualitative understandings of immigration: while participants with more positive attitudes often adopted a more inclusive understanding of immigration, those with more negative attitudes adopted a narrower understanding. Third, we demonstrated the importance of family and acquaintances as trusted sources of information. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Digitally tampered images or fake images when propagated across the Web and social media, have the power to mislead, emotionally distress and influence public attitudes and behavior. Copy-Move tampering is one of the most commonly used attacks for damaging the semantics of an image. Keypoint-based methodologies are one of the effective ways of identifying a copy-move attack on an image. Existing key-point based methodologies fails to obtain a sufficient number of points on the small-smooth tampered region. Thus, for obtaining a good number of features this paper presents Hybrid Feature Detection (HFD) methodology employing Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF) and Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) descriptor. Further, hierarchical clustering optimization and an improved mismatch elimination model is presented for detecting and demarking tampered segments. Experiments are conducted on standard datasets such as Dataset (D0, D1-2 and D3), GRIP, MICC-F600 and MICC-F8Multi. Better results are achieved from the proposed HFD methodology when compared with existing state-of-art tampering detection methodologies in terms of Recall, F1-score, Precision and False Positive Rate (FPR). © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The presence of linguistic metaphors characterizing the COVID-19 pandemic in the media is believed to be conditioned by conceptual metaphors. They tend to collate the features of the threat-imposing virus with an enemy through the cognitive comparison “COVID-19 is an Enemy”. The lexical field operating in the production of this metaphor is linked to the all-out war with an invisible foe. Nonetheless, other competing conceptual metaphors tend to emerge viewing the alarming virus as a biological entity that we have to live and compete with at the same time. The latter may indicate the process of reframing COVID-19 pandemic through substituting the source domain of War by, for example, Peace, Sport and Fire source domains. A versatility of source domains has its pragmatic value. Since the conceptual metaphors tend to influence public opinion formation (framing effect), adoption of certain cognitive metaphors is crucial. Therefore, the present paper investigates the dynamic of the conceptual metaphors in the worldwide discourse represented in the coronavirus corpus of web-published news created by Brigham Young University as well as proposing viable suggestions regarding more beneficial conceptual metaphors for the public welfare. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Low levels of media literacy in Bulgaria have provided fertile soil for anti-vaxxers and spawned disinformation campaigns as a major means of influencing the public opinion. Bulgaria has gained a reputation as the poorest and most corrupt country in the European Union (EU) and the fastest-shrinking nation in the world. The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated some of the well-known, long-standing problems in the healthcare system in Bulgaria–rising morbidity, an insufficient number of hospital beds, a low rate of COVID-19 vaccination, and, above all, a high mortality rate. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background: The childhood adverse experiences (CAEs) are common in the general population and very common among help-seekers. Particularly, sexual and physical abuse have received a great attention in research and public media. Prevalence of CAEs and their association with attitudes towards others and psychiatric disorders were investigated. Methods: The Trauma And Distress Scale (TADS) was fulfilled by people of the general population (GP; n = 692) and by patients attending primary (PrC) and psychiatric outpatient (PsC) care (n = 415). Results: In GP, 51% reported emotional and 50% physical neglect, and 37% emotional, 23% physical 23% and 6% sexual abuse. In PsC, the corresponding figures were 82%, 73%, 68%, 37% and 17% respectively. The CAEs had a strong tendency to cumulate into same participants: 30% of GP and 66% of PsC reported three or more CAEs. In GP, participant who reported emotional neglect felt that other people had a negative attitude towards them. In the combined PrC and PsC sample, emotional neglect had a specific effect on depression, anxiety and substance abuse. Conclusions: Emotional neglect is the most frequently reported CAE and associates with attitudes towards other people and the occurrence of psychiatric symptoms and disorders in adulthood. The findings received support the attachment theory launched by Bowlby and emphasise the importance of understanding emotional atmosphere that individuals are facing in their childhood and adolescence. © 2022 The Nordic Psychiatric Association.

On the other hand, the author shows how these conservative stereotypes about the environmental movement affect the opinions of Polish society. The author defends the thesis that the anti-ecological phobias of the right-wing Law and Justice (PiS) government have politicised environmental issues and revived ecological conflicts. The results presented show the importance of cultural, political and spatial dimensions for the development of the environmental movement in Poland. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study advances and tests the notion that the phenomenon of guilt by association— whereby innocent organizations are penalized due to their similarity to offending organizations— is shaped by two distinct forms of generalization. We analyze how and why evaluators’ interpretative process following instances of corporate misconduct will likely include not only inductive generalization (rooted in similarity judgments and prototype-based categorization) but also deductive generalizing (rooted in evaluators’ theories and causal-based categorization). We highlight the role and relevance of this neglected distinction by extending guilt-by-association predictions to include two unique predictions based on deductive generalization. First, we posit a recipient effect: if an innocent organization falls under a negative stereotype that causally links the innocent firm with corporate misconduct, then that innocent firm will suffer a greater negative spillover effect, irrespective of its similarity to the offending firm. Second, we also posit a transmission effect: if the offending firm falls under the same negative stereotype, then the negative spillover effect to other similar firms will be lessened. We also analyze how media discourse can foster negative stereotypes, and thus amplify these two effects. We find support for our hypotheses in analyses of stock market reactions to corporate misconduct for all U.S. and international firms using reverse mergers to gain publicly traded status in the United States. We discuss the implications of our theoretical perspective and empirical findings for research on corporate misconduct, guilt by association, and stock market prejudice.

AB  - Public opinion supervision is an important part of the national security supervision system. In the Internet era, especially with the rapid development of mobile social media, the position of online public opinion supervision in public opinion supervision is becoming more and more prominent. Internet public opinion supervision has a wide range of subjects, diverse objects, multiple channels, instant and efficient communication speed, and two-way interaction and has its distinctive features, but at the same time there are phenomena such as online rumors, invasion of others' privacy, and venting private anger. The existence of these problems requires strengthening the legal system of public opinion supervision, enhancing the network literacy of Internet users, government management departments, website operators, and other subjects of online public opinion supervision, continuously improving the technical level of online public opinion monitoring, and public opinion guidance ability of network supervision departments, and strengthening the regulation of online public opinion supervision through the improvement and improvement of legal system and coordinated promotion of cyberspace governance. Meanwhile, mobile Internet is the soil for social opinion dissemination. With the development of technology, cognitive wireless network is becoming an important infrastructure in the mobile Internet. Therefore, this paper studies social opinion dissemination and cyber law management in cognitive wireless networks and proposes a cognitive engine model based on artificial intelligence algorithms for cognitive wireless networks for enhancing opinion dissemination and law management. The extended experiments demonstrate the advanced performance and effectiveness of the proposed method in this paper and provide a new technical approach for enhancing public opinion dissemination and legal management. © 2022 Heju Bai.

AB  - About 17 million people participated in candlelight protests from October 2016 to April 2017 in South Korea calling for the president’s impeachment. In this episode, the president was, indeed, impeached through constitutional procedures for the first time in Korean history, and an early presidential election was held after the contentious episode was over. How can we explain this massive mobilization of candlelight protests in South Korea? Using a dynamics of contention approach, this article decomposes the mobilization process of candlelight protests into three mechanisms–attribution of political opportunities, shift in elite alignment, and expansion of mobilization networks. These mechanisms interacted and reinforced one another in the mobilization process of candlelight rallies for six months. This article traces these mechanisms by using various sources, including protest event data, public opinion data, documents by the national coalition for candlelight protests, and news media accounts. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This article explores the effectiveness of photographs as instruments of public diplomacy through an analysis of China's visual storytelling during the Covid-19 outbreak. Beijing considered the pandemic an existential threat to its image and responded with a communications offensive that was designed to highlight the regime's success in containing the Coronavirus - both at home and abroad - and to safeguard the wider 'China story' of a 'peace-loving and responsible global leader'. By combining scholarship on public diplomacy and strategic narratives with the 'visual turn' literature in international relations, this article focuses on the non-verbal dimension of China's storytelling and explores the impact of photographs - distributed by the regime's news agency, Xinhua - on international public opinion. Through a survey experiment among 1,000 US adults, we demonstrate that such photographs had a positive effect on China's international image, but that this effect was moderated by levels of political knowledge among the target audience. © 2022 Brill Nijhoff.

AB  - The Great War transformed propaganda as, indeed, it transformed warfare. Over the course of the conflict, from 1914 to 1918, propaganda became, for the first time, a pervasive, systematic instrument of every government that threw troops into battle. The belligerent governments employed similar approaches to shaping mass opinion. This study identifies nine laws of propaganda–that is, seminal characteristics and consequences–that emerged from the war and continue today. We draw on primary sources and unpublished materials located in political archives in the United States, Germany and Britain to explore the relationship between media, war, intelligence, and government publicity activities during 1914–1918. © 2022 Journal of Intelligence History.

AB  - The paper aims to determine how cultural taste and social tolerance coincide and which symbolic boundaries they relate to. The empirical analyses scrutinise three taste orientations – omnivorousness, univorousness and ‘categorical tolerance’ (Lizardo & Skiles 2016) – to answer the following questions using two nationally representative surveys on cultural taste in Finland: (1) How did the cultural taste orientations change between 2007 and 2018 when considering musical like, dislike and ambivalence? (2) How do socio-political attitudes associate with cultural taste orientations and socio-economic factors, and can we observe change in these dynamics between 2007 and 2018? A longitudinal research design is used to explore whether there are changes in taste that tap to symbolic exclusion, inclusion or ambivalence. The results show that the omnivores and the univores are on many accounts situated on the opposite ends of the liberal-conservative axis. Their views deviate from each other, although the polarization in this sense has diminished in a decade. In addition to their wide-ranging taste and advantageous social position, we found the omnivores’ social attitudes to be very liberal, postmaterialist and more tolerant than the average. The absence of ambivalence among the univores suggests very rigid symbolic boundary-drawing by them. The social indistinctiveness of the categorical tolerants was quite visible, and it indeed increased over time. However, the categorical tolerants’ responses, particularly in 2018, were in most part inflated by their inability to neither agree nor disagree with the socio-political statements. Through a systematic analysis of various taste orientations over time, the study contributes to the understanding of cultural taste and symbolic boundaries by way of providing a gauge of the social, political and moral ambience in the society. The findings suggest growing tolerance in general, and decreasing polarization between the extreme taste orientations, omnivorism and univorism. However, the increased symbolic inclusion and ambivalence (of the categorical tolerants especially) are perhaps engendered by the features of modern social (media) reality, whose ubiquitous presence potentially affects how willingly people make judgements, whether social or cultural, and how much of personal values and tastes are communicated publicly in general. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - Although the emergence of soft masculinity has incited much controversy in China, little research attention has been given to the discussion about the effeminate Chinese masculinity in the news media featuring public opinions at the national level. To fill this gap, this study employed critical discourse analysis to investigate the dominant discourses surrounding the “Prevention of Feminisation of Male Teenagers” debate and its ideological implications in the Chinese-language news media. The findings show that the media constructed anti-feminine discourse, nationalistic discourse, and anti-gender stereotype discourse with ideological implications for patriarchy, nationalism, and egalitarianism via various discursive strategies, specifically abstraction, authorisation, categorisation, morality, and rationalisation. This study sheds light on the diverse voices and concerns of the emergence of soft masculinity that have not been given much attention in the literature. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Digital media provide individuals platforms to express political views. Despite the significant scholarly attention to how and why political expression occurs through technologies and to what effect, research remains fragmented in its theoretical frameworks. The present work synthesizes research on computer-mediated communication and political communication to offer a framework that describes theoretically (a) which technological affordances lead (b) to which psychological processes with (c) which politically relevant actions. We address these questions in the context of four different technological affordances. In doing so, we emphasize the psychological cost-benefit calculations that occur when deciding whether to engage in political expression online. © 2022 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Data and methods development are key to improve our ability to forecast conflict. Relatively recent data sources such as mobile phone and social media data or images have received widespread attention in conflict research. Oftentimes these do not cover substantial parts of the globe or they are difficult to obtain and manipulate, which makes regular updating challenging. The sometimes vast amounts of data can also be computationally and financially costly. The data source we propose instead is cheap, readily and openly available, and updated in real time, and it provides global coverage: Wikipedia. We argue that the number of country page views can be considered a measure of interest or salience, whereas the number of page changes can be considered a measure of controversy between competing political views. We expect these predictors to be particularly successful in capturing tensions before a conflict escalates. We test our argument by predicting changes in battle-related deaths in Africa on the country-month level. We find evidence that country page views do increase predictive performance while page changes do not. Contrary to our expectation, our model seems to capture long-term trends better than sharp short-term changes. El desarrollo de datos y métodos es fundamental para perfeccionar nuestra habilidad de previsión de conflictos. Las fuentes de datos relativamente nuevas, tales como los datos o las imágenes de los teléfonos celulares y de las redes sociales, han recibido una atención generalizada en la investigación de conflictos. A menudo, dichas fuentes no cubren las partes primordiales del mundo o son difíciles de obtener y manejar, lo que hace que la actualización periódica sea un desafío. Las cantidades de datos, en ocasiones enormes, también pueden ser costosas desde el punto de vista informático y financiero. En su lugar, la fuente de datos que proponemos es económica, está disponible fácil y públicamente, se actualiza en tiempo real y proporciona una cobertura global: Wikipedia. Planteamos que la cantidad de páginas vistas por país puede considerarse una medida de interés o prominencia, mientras que el número de cambios de página puede considerarse una medida de controversia entre las opiniones políticas rivales. Esperamos que estos indicadores tengan especial éxito a la hora de captar las tensiones antes de que el conflicto se intensifique. Ponemos a prueba nuestro argumento prediciendo cambios en las muertes relacionadas con las batallas en África a nivel mensual y por país. Encontramos pruebas de que esas páginas vistas por país aumentan el rendimiento predictivo, mientras que los cambios de página no lo hacen. Al contrario de lo que esperábamos, nuestro modelo parece registrar mejor las tendencias a largo plazo que los cambios bruscos a corto plazo. Les données et le développement des méthodes sont essentiels à l’amélioration de notre capacité à prévoir les conflits. La recherche sur les conflits a étudié avec application des sources de données relativement récentes, telles que celles fournies par les téléphones portables ou les médias sociaux. Néanmoins, dans de nombreux cas, les données obtenues n’englobent pas l’ensemble de la planète. Elles sont parfois difficiles à obtenir et sont délicates à manipuler, ce qui rend difficile toute mise à jour régulière. En outre, du fait de leur quantité, l’analyse de ces données peut être chronophage et coûteuse. Au contraire, la source de données que nous proposons est bon marché, publique et immédiatement disponible, mise à jour en temps réel, et inclut l’ensemble de la planète : Wikipédia. Nous soutenons que le nombre de pages vues par pays permet de mesurer l’intérêt ou l’importance d’un sujet, tandis que le nombre de changements apportés aux pages permet de mesurer le niveau de controverses entre des opinions politiques concurrentes. Nous estimons que ces éléments permettent d’identifier avec succès des tensions avant qu’un conflit n’éclate. Nous vérifions la justesse de nos hypothèses en prédisant des changements en ce qui concerne le nombre de victimes dans des combats en Afrique, par pays et par mois. Nous apportons la preuve que le nombre de pages vues par pays a une valeur prédictive, mais que le nombre de changements apportés aux pages n’en a pas. Contrairement à nos attentes, notre modèle semble permettre d’identifier des tendances de long terme, et non des changements soudains de court terme. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Background. The obesity epidemic is considered one of the main challenges for modern medicine. It has been proven that bariatric surgery is more effective than nonsurgical interventions to manage weight-related comorbidities. The general surgeon needs to understand how tooth erosion advances in gastroesophageal reflux in people who have had bariatric surgery. Dental erosion caused due to gastric reflux begins with the enamel, which is the tough, protective coating that covers our teeth. While it is tough, it is prone to an extremely acidic environment with a low pH, where it begins to soften and demineralize, gradually wearing away and exposing the more sensitive areas of the tooth. Because of the growing popularity of this subspecialty, general surgeons should develop a basic clinical and surgical understanding of these standard procedures and complications, regardless of their interest in obesity surgery. Aim. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess the awareness and attitude of surgeons regarding dental erosion on patients who underwent bariatric surgery. Materials and Methods. This cross-sectional study was conducted on general surgeons from different regions of Saudi Arabia who perform bariatric surgeries. Data collection was done by sending the questionnaire to the general surgeons by different means of social media (WhatsApp, e-mail, Facebook, etc.), and it was also distributed through the Saudi Arabia Society of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. Results. A total of 25 general surgeons responded to the survey. Half of the respondents know what dental erosion is, 52%. Most of them, 72%, are not aware of the relationship between dental erosion and acid reflux or vomiting. They reported that 52% of patients complain of gastroesophageal reflux disorder. Conclusion. The general surgeons had inadequate awareness and attitude regarding dental erosion on bariatric surgery patients. Our findings suggest that a lack of adequate awareness and a negative attitude among general surgeons are grounds for concern and that more should be done to avoid oral health complications. © 2022 Omir Aldowah.

AB  - background In France, despite fear-based communication by the authorities and the media, vaccination against COVID-19 has received little support from the population. For a young population often convinced that severe forms of the disease affect older people, we hypothesized that communication based on the idea of love would be more effective than communication based on fear of vaccination. participants and procedure In a convenience online French sample (N = 480, Mage = 19.4), vaccination intention was asked after fear priming, love priming, no love/prejudice priming, or a control condition. Participants also reported their fear of vaccination against COVID-19, and the recommendation they would make regarding vaccination of a loved/unloved person. results Vaccination intention was higher in the love condition than in the fear and no love/prejudice conditions. Surprisingly, fear of vaccination was lower in participants who were presented with fear-inducing questions. conclusions Implications of these results are discussed in relation to the fear of vaccination and the transpersonal value of the idea of love. The results suggest that COVID-19 is experienced as a threat both to oneself and to those one loves most. Therefore, calls for fear in the media and on social networks seem less likely to motivate a young population to vaccinate than the reminder of intense emotional ties to loved ones. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - Attention given to the environment by the British public has fluctuated over recent decades. Having peaked in 2007 it declined, yet has recently risen dramatically. This raises questions about why public attention to the issue changes over time and to what extent this is driven by other actors and exogenous forces. This article examines these processes at the monthly level through a system of simultaneous equations. Methodologically, protest is an important confounding factor when analysing the relationship between media and public salience. Substantively, protest itself can be predicted by prior public attention, but in turn, can be successful in increasing broader environmental salience. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Viral content on the internet has become part of our everyday lives. It has even made its way into defamation litigation. This article explores how viral content is changing the legal definition of limited-purpose and involuntary public figures. The article argues that courts should not consider having access to social media alone as having “access to media” under the test for deciding when an individual is a limited-purpose public figure. Additionally, courts should focus the analysis on determining whether plaintiffs voluntarily injected themselves into a controversy to sway public opinion or to resolve the controversy either via the viral content or with other behavior. More importantly, we argue courts should no longer recognize involuntary public figures. Although some authors have suggested that in the age of the internet it makes sense to require more individuals to prove actual malice, we suggest courts should use a lower standard for some individuals to better compensate for injury to reputation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study examines the use of the ideograph territorial sovereignty by the Times of India (TOI; U.S./New Delhi editions) in its reports on China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Using McGee's (1980) notion of ideograph and Entman’s (1993) framing theory, it uncovers a discursive strategy used by elite media for swaying public opinion regarding international and domestic information flow when promoting its preferred “Indian” understanding of the BRI. This study reviews historical uses of the ideograph territorial sovereignty to establish an analysis of the TOI's use of it. Then, following framing theory and a synchronic structure, I explore the ideograph in 40 collected TOI reports by contextualizing relationships supporting and surrounding it. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Using Chinese provincial data from 2000 to 2016, this paper investigates the effect of informal environmental regulation (IER) on industrial structure upgrading. We find that IER in the form of environmental media coverage acts as an external binding force and spurs the upgrading of industrial structure through increasing the dual pressure of local government supervision and public opinion. A mechanism test shows that IER can boost regional innovation, thereby promoting the upgrading of industrial structure. Moreover, the positive association between IER and industrial structure upgrading is more prominent in regions with stronger environmental law enforcement and higher public environmental awareness. We also document that IER has a significant informational spatial-diffusion effect and has characteristics of a double-threshold effect. Overall, our results highlight that it is necessary to establish a system for disclosing environmental information and to improve the mechanism whereby independent third parties such as the media participate in environmental governance. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

With a web-based experiment, the present study examined how user-generated anti-panic buying messages online could be leveraged to combat panic buying. It was found that user comments discussing how panic buying affects the lives of less advantaged social groups on social media, as well as high social endorsement of the comment, significantly reduced readers’ derogation of the comment, thereby increasing negative attitudes toward panic buying and lowering intention to engage in it. The message format (narrative vs. non-narrative), however, did not influence the amount of impact it had on participants’ attitude and purchase intentions. The findings contribute to research on message-based and heuristic-based persuasion processes in reading reactance-inducing messages online and guide the design of persuasive messages to reduce panic buying during health pandemics. © 2022 National Communication Association.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of exposure to news frames on attitudes toward Syrian refugee admissions and anti-immigrant sentiment. Findings show that framing Syrian refugees, ranging from benefits, victims to a security threat did invoke changes of attitudes toward admitting Syrian refugees. Participants reading a benefit frame story expressed more favorable opinions on accepting Syrian refugees than participants in the threat frame condition. In contrast to the extant literature, arguing victim frame enhances positive attitudes, the findings suggested that participants, who were exposed to a victim frame story yielded stronger anti-immigrant sentiment than participants who read a threat frame story. These findings advance scholarship on media framing of refugees and its effect on anti-immigrant sentiment and have important refugee admission policy and advocacy implications. © 2022 NOND of AEJMC.

AB  - Assessing the public opinion on food safety events constitutes an important job of government regulators. To optimize the government's management of food safety affairs, a promising way is to use artificial intelligence to improve the efficiency of food safety public opinion assessment. In this paper, we model the assessment of public opinion influence as a text classification task. The whole model adopts the ensemble learning framework, and it integrates naive Bayes, support vector machine, extreme gradient boosting, convolutional neural network, long- and short-term memory network, FastText, and BERT classification methods into the framework to form an ensemble learner. The ensemble learner is able to classify textual public opinion into high, medium, and low influence levels by learning from the samples assessed by human experts. To overcome the problem of unbalanced samples, we propose a sample generation method consisting of synonym replacement and semantic filtering to increase the number of high-influence samples. Real public opinion data collected from the Food Safety Department of the Chinese government are used for experiment. Extensive comparison of the proposed method with baseline methods proves the effectiveness of the ensemble learner and the sample generation steps. © 2022 Bo Song et al.

AB  - This article examines the reception and dissemination of ‘malign information influence’ (MII) in a liberal democracy; information sponsored by authoritarian regimes or other hostile actors and projected through international broadcasting outlets across borders. The study contributes to the scarce research on the reception of narratives transmitted by the Russian state-supported media platforms RT and Sputnik, exposing characteristics, political attitudes, and sharing behaviors of RT/Sputnik consumers. A nationwide, representative survey (n: 3033) from November 2020 revealed a surprisingly high number of Swedish RT/Sputnik consumers (7%), with an overrepresentation of young, men and supports of non-parliamentarian parties and the right wing, nationalist Sweden Democratic Party. These consumers are somewhat more willing than non-consumers to disseminate news on social media and in real life despite being distrustful of the sources. The findings strengthen previous research in demonstrating the attractiveness of identity grievance narratives among alternative media consumers, yet the results show that RT/Sputnik consumers also aligned with narratives that contrasts with national security policy. They state less trust in politicians, institutions, the media, news, and journalism, yet are comparatively prone to share unreliable or untrue news content on social media and in real life. The analysis thus identified a section of media consumers who can function as vehicles for the dissemination of MII. The article contributes to the under-researched problem of the potential of MII to take root and provides a basis for future qualitative research that can refine and provide nuance to the knowledge of reception of MII. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - In the context of increasing concerns about false and deceptive information in public opinion, this research note explores which causes and sources news users associate with the dissemination of misinformation. Based on representative survey data collected in the Netherlands (N = 1,994), we found that news users distinguish unintentional causes related to uncertain evidence and lacking expert knowledge from politically or financially motivated falsehoods. People on the left-wing of the political spectrum associate falsehoods more with the radical-right, whereas those on the right-wing tend to associate misinformation with the radical-left. Right-wing participants, however, are most likely to perceive misinformation as driven by a deliberate attempt to hide reality. Our findings point to an ideological bias in information credibility that could foster polarization along epistemic lines. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Since Donald Trump’s political campaign, Americans have appeared increasingly divided over public opinion issues and U.S. policies with the media seemingly reflecting these divisions. One of Trump’s early initiatives was the “Muslim ban,” which restricted visitors from seven Muslim-majority countries. Focusing on the portrayal of Muslims in over 900 hand-coded articles, our study uses multilevel modeling techniques to examine how newspapers changed their frames and claimsmakers in discussions about Muslims before and after Trump was elected. After the election, newspapers were more likely to include government claimsmakers and an immigration frame and were less likely to mention a radical terrorist leader or portray Muslims as violent. Trump’s election and the ban may have ushered in a more sympathetic view of Muslims with more articles focused on them as victims of violence and negative expressions. Across counties, states, and newspapers and between the national versus local presses, we find almost no significant differences in how Muslims were portrayed. © 2022 Alpha Kappa Delta: The International Sociology Honor Society.

AB  - Media coverage of Muslims has been repeatedly shown to be negative, and attitudes toward Muslims in American society are typically more negative than attitudes toward other social groups. Does the tone of media coverage directly affect public attitudes? This relationship is not well established with respect to Muslims, nor as a proposition about social groups in general. We use an online between-subjects experiment to examine whether exposure to articles of quantifiably different valences about Muslims or Catholics affects reported attitudes toward each of those groups. We find clear support for this proposition. Our additional tests demonstrate that this effect persists but is attenuated when money is at stake. We also identify anxiety as a key mediator between exposure to articles of different valences and attitudes about each group. Our findings suggest that articles of a particular tone can influence views of social groups. Copyright © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - This paper argues that the emergence of social media as a new public sphere has shaped masculine identity in the cyber platform. Such masculinity in Assamese society (the Assamese-speaking community), based on the images of the ideal Assamese man is linked with a form of Assamese nationalistic masculinity that gathered momentum during the Assam Movement (1979–1985). Politics of identity in Assam is basically trapped in the world of appearances, fighting real and imaginary enemies, and drawing strength from prejudices and misconceptions of groups, about themselves and others. This process of identity creation also shaped the identity of the “ideal” Assamese man in the recent socio-political history of Assam. This article is an attempt to define how masculinity works in the cyber world by focusing attention on Assamese nationalistic masculinity which is based on the image of the “RealAssamese Man.” The “Real Assamese Man,” in turn, draws inspiration from a socio-cultural context which started with the creation of Assamese iconographies of masculinity which were later transformed and appropriated to serve the purpose of identity-politics. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - There is a remarkable gap between scientific experts and the nonscientific public regarding the safety of food imported from nuclear-contaminated areas in Japan. How socio-scientific issues such as post-Fukushima food imports are framed in media discourse may have effects on the way people perceive and reason about potential threats, and, in turn, influence government-initiated policies and regulations. In this study, semantic network analysis is performed to examine the diverse media representations of post-Fukushima food imports across information-seeking sources (mass media and search-based media) and three Chinese societies (Hong Kong, Mainland China, and Taiwan). We found that media representation of the crisis differs across sources and sociopolitical contexts. It is also discussed how these channel-specific and contextual factors may affect public opinion. This knowledge can enhance regulatory authorities’ informed decision-making about food safety issues, guide crisis professionals’ communication efforts, and call for a more context-sensitive approach to public health crisis management. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Objective: We examine individuals’ ability to detect social bots among Twitter personas, along with participant and persona features associated with that ability. Background: Social media users need to distinguish bots from human users. We develop and demonstrate a methodology for assessing those abilities, with a simulated social media task. Method: We analyze performance from a signal detection theory perspective, using a task that asked lay participants whether each of 50 Twitter personas was a human or social bot. We used the agreement of two machine learning models to estimate the probability of each persona being a bot. We estimated the probability of participants indicating that a persona was a bot with a generalized linear mixed-effects model using participant characteristics (social media experience, analytical reasoning, and political views) and stimulus characteristics (bot indicator score and political tone) as regressors. Results: On average, participants had modest sensitivity (d’) and a criterion that favored responding “human.” Exploratory analyses found greater sensitivity for participants (a) with less self-reported social media experience, (b) greater analytical reasoning ability, and (c) who were evaluating personas with opposing political views. Some patterns varied with participants' political identity. Conclusions: Individuals have limited ability to detect social bots, with greater aversion to mistaking bots for humans than vice versa. Greater social media experience and myside bias appeared to reduce performance, as did less analytical reasoning ability. Application: These patterns suggest the need for interventions, especially when users feel most familiar with social media. © 2022, Human Factors and Ergonomics Society.

AB  - Under the network public opinion ecology in the Omni-media Era, corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance can provide important internal and external environmental support for improving corporate development quality. Based on the data of Chinese listed companies from 2010 to 2019, this paper evaluates the impact and mechanism of CSR on corporate high-quality development. The results show that CSR significantly promotes the improvement of corporates’ development quality. The results remain robust in altering variables, controlling more urban and corporate-level variables, and solving endogeneity. Mechanism analysis indicates that CSR can promote the high-quality development of corporates by improving green innovation, environmental investment, and corporate governance. Heterogeneity analysis shows that the incentive effect of CSR on corporate high-quality development is more obvious in non-state-owned corporates and when the market is in a “bull market.” This paper provides feasible ideas for adjusting the operating behavior of Chinese listed companies and government policy orientation. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the structure of the social network of people living with HIV and AIDS. Method: Exploratory and descriptive research with a qualitative approach, developed through interviews with twenty-two people living with HIV and AIDS, from November to December 2019. For analysis, the theoretical-methodological framework of social network was used. Results: The primary networks were of medium size and low density, formed by family members, relatives, friends, neighbors, and colleagues. The secondary networks were characterized by public, private, third sector institutions, workplaces, and by the informal network, which provided support according to the need for care. Conclusion: The family was considered the center of the primary social network structure; however, weaknesses in these social relationships were evidenced. The family relational context of the person with HIV and AIDS was influenced by the secrecy of the diagnosis due to the fear of prejudice and discrimination for being HIV-positive. There was a predilection for the services of the secondary social network that took on the role of specific care for the disease. © 2022. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Late in 2019, massive protest demonstrations rocked both Chile and Colombia. They were an expression of discontent with the economic model and social policies implemented in both countries in recent decades. The purpose of this study is to investigate how Chilean and Colombian news websites framed these social protests and what aspects of the social movements promoted these media to public opinion. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology of this research is empirical; the authors use quantitative and discourse analysis techniques to study the news published by the top three most visited main news websites in each country and deduce the main frameworks emerging from them. After analyzing the framing of reality by media in 4,252 news items, the authors suggest that the main news portals in these Latin American countries not only portrayed the collective actions but also promoted interpretations that did not necessarily reflect the demands of the demonstrations. Findings: The findings were that in the 2019 protests in Chile and Colombia, the media approach to collective action was not necessarily positive for the activists. This was mainly because framing in the Chilean and Colombian websites had to do with negative aspects of the movements, such as violence or economic costs. Originality/value: The originality and value of this research is that despite the fact that there are abundant case studies on the relationship between social movements and media framing in the literature, this study adds to the current knowledge because it compares two Latin American countries and focuses on Web news portals. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Rural Revitalization is a systematic and complex strategic project that must keep up with the times while also taking into account the times' characteristics and social development. The media should be at the forefront of rural revitalization efforts. The interaction of various "forces"is required for the successful implementation of the rural revitalization strategy. The county-level financial media center, as a "force of the media,"will encourage mainstream media to overcome their own development challenges, become an important mainstream public opinion publicity platform, and aid in the realization of the great cause of rural revitalization. For rural comprehensive revitalization, big data provides new means and tools. It is not only a powerful support for rural comprehensive revitalization, but also an important means of realizing the integrated development of the digital economy and rural revitalization, as well as improving the quality and level of rural revitalization. We need to accelerate the realization of agricultural and rural modernization to implement the rural revitalization strategy, and the construction of smart countryside is an important embodiment of agricultural and rural modernization. Mobile edge computing technology has become ingrained in many aspects of social production and daily life. With the power of MEC, urban radio and television must accelerate the pace of multiscreen and multifrequency interaction, as well as online and offline integration; create an all-media instant communication and interactive platform; make new media products suitable for rural audiences; realize integrated development of urban and rural areas; and improve the influence and credibility of new media on agricultural communication. From the perspective of rural revitalization, this paper will investigate the development path of financial media under the influence of data mining (DM) and mobile edge computing technology. © 2022 Siyu Xiong.

AB  - The paper focuses on Facebook's shaping of communication regarding the European migrant crisis in the Czech Republic. Topological spaces in communication with entanglements of inclusion and exclusion were produced by practicing the communication, with the mutual influence of two kinds of the collective unconscious, the technological and the Orientalist unconscious. The paper is based on a participant observation of Czech-language Facebook groups and pages where discussions about the European migrant crisis proliferated. Due to the technological unconscious, algorithm-induced “filter-bubbles” helped to separate discussions of different opinions about migration so people with anti-immigration attitudes could be building European free-thinking people identities who distrust mainstream media, and people with pro-migration attitudes were excluded and considered trustful “sheeple”. Due to the Orientalist unconscious, European free-thinking people identities were strengthened by the sharing of ideas about uncivilized, irrational, and barbaric imaginative spaces of migrants' origin, which were entirely Other to Europe. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - In 1960, Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann and her husband published a new edition of the seminal Marienthal Study by Marie Jahoda, Hans Zeisel, and Paul F. Lazarsfeld that had first appeared in Germany in 1933 but had largely been forgotten ever since. In the wake of this publication, which sparked a discovery of Lazarsfeld’s pioneering work in German-speaking countries, a mutually inspiring relationship developed between Lazarsfeld and Noelle-Neumann. On the basis of previously unpublished correspondence, the exchange of ideas between the two is retraced in this article. The topics of discussion included methodological issues, such as panel studies; theoretical issues, such as the function of opinion leaders; and institutional issues, such as the respective role of public and private opinion research. The two authors also reflected upon the complementarity of American and European traditions in social research that is exemplified in their collaboration. It may be gathered from the correspondence that Lazarsfeld’s research program provided a blueprint for Noelle-Neumann’s endeavor to transform German Publizistikwissenschaft [science of public communication] from a humanistic into an empirical social scientific discipline. © 2022 (Ralph E.

AB  - Hate speech recognizers (HSRs) can be the panacea for containing hate in social media or can result in the biggest form of prejudice-based censorship hindering people to express their true selves. In this paper, we hypothesized how massive use of syntax can reduce the prejudice effect in HSRs. To explore this hypothesis, we propose Unintended-bias Visualizer based on Kermit modeling (KERM-HATE): a syntax-based HSR, which is endowed with syntax heat parse trees used as a post-hoc explanation of classifications. KERM-HATE significantly outperforms BERT-based, RoBERTa-based and XLNet-based HSR on standard datasets. Surprisingly this result is not sufficient. In fact, the post-hoc analysis on novel datasets on recent divisive topics shows that even KERM-HATE carries the prejudice distilled from the initial corpus. Therefore, although tests on standard datasets may show higher performance, syntax alone cannot drive the ‘‘attention“ of HSRs to ethically-unbiased features. © 2022 Mastromattei et al.

AB  - Prejudices against minorities are amplified by distorted media coverage that highlights these groups disproportionally in crime coverage. But while the specifications of alleged criminals’ affiliations to minority groups—so-called minority signification—has been studied after key events and between outlets, no research has yet investigated changes over a longer time, including different key events and outlets. Using a partly automated content analysis, our research fills this gap with a case study of minority signification in Germany from 2014 to 2019. We show that first, culturally more distant nationalities are slightly overrepresented while European nationalities are underrepresented in crime news compared with German crime statistics. Second, some spikes in the data could be linked to key events but others remain unexplained. Third, the political-right newspaper mentions minority affiliations most, the tabloid second, and the political-left outlet mentions them least. Surprisingly, this pattern changes over the years. © 2022 (Azade Esther Kakavand and Damian Trilling).

AB  - The freedom of media is an essential component for democratic settings; however, in some contexts, citizens experience several barriers to enjoy this right in full. Replacing conventional media channels, social media is becoming an indispensable medium to express and discuss politics in such environments. Yet, there is little consensus in the literature about how social media relates to offline political participation, especially in settings where citizens do not experience media freedom in full. By using survey data that has been collected after the Turkish general election of 2018, this article aims to display the relationship between social media use and offline political participation. The analysis reveals offline political participation is related to sharing political views online and exposure to alternative political ideas. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Voting resulted in pioneering knowledge about the political attitudes and behaviors of ordinary people, as well as of methods for study of political process. Paul Lazarsfeld and his team found that voters were not the rational decision makers of economic theory, but neither were they puppets manipulated in mass society. Voters are social beings as influenced by their social milieu and peers as they are with regard to other social and cultural preferences and behaviors. The 1948 election in U.S. politics was fought on longstanding and stable socioeconomic cleavages. Multiculturalism, identity politics, and racial justice were not on the political agenda. Lazarsfeld was mindful that ideological issues might lead to antidemocratic tendencies, as in 1930s Europe. Since the 1950s there have been major changes in the political media and in political culture. This forum article explores the extent to which Lazarsfeld’s findings about the electoral process are applicable in the present time. © 2022 (Anthony Oberschall, tonob@live.unc.edu).

AB  - Introduction: The main entry point for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) prevention, care, and treatment is through HIV testing services. Despite undeniable benefits and increased availability of HIV testing services, uptake remains low among students. The purpose of the study was to determine factors contributing to low HIV testing services uptake among tertiary students in a university in South Africa. Material and methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among tertiary students to determine factors contributing to low HIV testing services uptake. A total of 306 eligible students from the School of Health Sciences in a South African university were selected through a systematic random sampling technique. Data collected were analyzed using SPSS version 24. Ethical considerations were ensured throughout the study. Results: Findings of the study showed that out of 306 respondents, 204 (67%) were females and 102 (33%) males. The majority (68%, n = 208) of the students were between the age of 18 and 24 years. About 135 (44%) respondents were tested for HIV as compared to 171 (56%) who were not tested. Respondents showed good knowledge about HIV testing services (HTS), and their attitude was positive. HIV and AIDS-related stigma, fear of potential HIV-positive results, and negative attitude of healthcare service providers were cited as contributory factors to low uptake of HTS. Conclusions: Despite the adequate knowledge about HTS and high awareness campaigns, HIV uptake of HTS remained low among the respondents. Therefore, the use of various forms of media, including campus radio and newsletters to promote uptake of HTS among university students is recommended. © 2022 Termedia Publishing House Ltd..

AB  - Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) are important to most economies, but the laws of close corporation entities used by SMEs are underrepresented in comparative corporate law scholarship. This Article critically analyses ‘withdrawal’ regimes in Germany's GmbH (Austritt aus wichtigem Grund) and the UK's private company limited by shares (unfair prejudice remedy) that respond to shareholder conflicts in close corporations. Comparative analysis reveals how the two jurisdictions differ in treatment of ‘non-fault’ scenarios and their underlying visions of shareholder protection. Potential reform of the UK's withdrawal regime based on German and Singapore law is also explored. © 2022 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - With police facing constant negative publicity, concerns have been raised that officers working the street will draw back on their efforts. Prior research relying on official data has not found increases in crime as a result of this so-called Ferguson or de-policing effect. In the present study, it is argued that officers’ own reported willingness to initiate proactive enforcement activities should be added to this body of research. If there is a Ferguson effect, it most likely exists in the realm of high-discretion, low-visibility decision making. Data are from surveys administered in-person to officers in a large, urban department. Results show that officers who perceive higher levels of negative publicity feel that police are less likely to self-initiate stops. Those who feared being filmed unfairly also reported reluctance among their colleagues. Perceptions of being supported by top management appeared to be a protective factor, with those experiencing strong support from managers reporting less concern about self-initiated enforcement. Findings support the existence of a de-policing or Ferguson effect insofar as intense scrutiny from the public and media appear to discourage some officers from initiating proactive stops. This indicates that when de-policing occurs, it is likely concentrated among high-discretion, low-visibility decisions. © 2022 Midwestern Criminal Justice Association.

AB  - This article analyses the influence of the local and national press on the shape of the Polish comic publishing industry in the Polish People’s Republic (1947–1989). It discusses how the negative attitude of the authorities towards comics gradually changed, leading in the 1970s to the use of this medium both as propaganda and a didactic tool as well as an equivalent of Western popular culture, anchored in the policy of economic stabilisation in Edward Gierek’s era. We describe the main newspaper and magazine series of comics and their authors, examine the national and transnational patterns of visual narration, and show the links between ideology and entertainment. The essential part of our analyses is the political and economic factors that shaped the Polish publishing industry, especially between 1956 and 1989. The article also explores the first political and academic commentaries on comics in communist Poland and indicates the evolution of views on them–from an evil, capitalist medium to a useful (or even fashionable) mode of artistic expression. Finally, our research examines how comic books, their characters and authors from the 1970s and 1980s survived in free and democratic Polish culture. We also investigate some international careers of Polish authors. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social scientists have documented rapid polarization in public opinion about COVID-19 policies. Such polarization is somewhat unsurprising given experimental studies that show opinions on novel issues can diverge quickly in the presence of partisan frames. In this paper I describe a different process that operates alongside polarization: Not centrism but a lack of opinion formation. Drawing on four rounds of in-depth interviews with 86 Midwesterners, conducted between June 2019 and November 2020, I take an inductive approach to understanding variation in the processes by which people gathered and interpreted information about COVID-19. I find that those with universal distrust in all media struggled to adjudicate between conflicting interpretations of reality, particularly if they also had low political knowledge. The result was that they felt little confidence in any opinions they formed. These findings suggest that deteriorating trust in media is an important and understudied factor shaping trajectories of opinion formation. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - The implementation of the Mother Tongue-Based Multilingual Education (MTB-MLE) policy in the Philippine basic education has gained traction among educators. Skepticism as to its effectiveness is evident especially in mathematics class where English is the universally recognised medium. This study explored how elementary teachers from a rural school in the Philippines appropriate the MTB-MLE policy in a mathematics classroom. Their attitudes toward the policy and the challenges met in the implementation were examined. An instrumental case study was conducted with documentary analysis, non-participant observation, in-depth interview, and focus group discussion as methods of data collection. Five Grades 1–3 teachers served as participants. Results showed that teachers do not fully observe the policy. They code-switch during discussion and do not religiously use the prescribed teaching guide. Fidelity to the policy is only apparent in the presence of authority. Teachers generally have negative attitudes towards the policy which is due to their colonial thinking, perceived complexity, and non-utilitarian view of the local language. Mismatch in the students’ language and the language of instruction, lack of equivalent local terms for some mathematics terms, and haphazardly done teaching and learning materials are the challenges that impede teachers’ effective implementation of the policy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - INTRODUCTION Effective pandemic management requires understanding the level of community knowledge, attitudes of people, and preparedness towards COVID-19. This study aimed to assess gender differences regarding knowledge, attitudes and preparedness toward the COVID-19, among Bangladeshi adults. METHODS A cross-sectional survey was conducted March– April 2020 among 1050 Bangladeshi adults. A convenience sampling strategy was utilized, and the data were collected online through a self-administered questionnaire. Chisquared tests were used to identify the gender differences regarding knowledge, attitudes and preparedness towards COVID-19. RESULTS Respondents predominately used social media to inform themselves about COVID-19 (68.1%), and females used social media more than males (p<0.001). Females had higher levels of correct knowledge about staying home with sickness and symptoms to prevent the COVID-19 transmission (p=0.02). Males had a more negative attitude about staying out during the pandemic than females (p<0.001); men were less likely to take preventative measures than their female counterparts. Some people believed in misinformation like ‘COVID-19 can transmit via mosquitos’ (9.1%), and males had more incorrect knowledge regarding this (p<0.001). Moreover, 17.8% of the respondents thought that COVID-19 could spread in warm weather. CONCLUSIONS Males showed a higher tendency to believe the myths about COVID-19 than their female counterparts, which is alarming. Awareness programs should be emphasized, focusing on gender-specific pertinent information to ensure effective preventative measures. © 2022 Sultana M. S. et al.

AB  - Islamophobia is a sentiment against the Muslim community; recently, atrocities towards Muslim communities witnessed this sentiment globally. This research investigates the correlation between how news stories covered by mainstream news channels impede the hate speech/Islamophobic sentiment. To examine the objective mentioned above, we shortlisted thirteen mainstream news channels and the ten most widely reported Islamophobic incidents across the globe for experimentation. Transcripts of the news stories are scraped along with their comments, likes, dislikes, and recommended videos as the users’ responses. We used a word embedding technique for sentiment analysis, e.g., Islamophobic or not, three textual variables, video titles, video transcripts, and comments. This sentiment analysis helped to compute metric variables. The I-score represents the extent of portrayals of Muslims in a particular news story. The next step is to calculate the canonical correlation between video transcripts and their respective responses, explaining the relationship between news portrayal and hate speech. This study provides empirical evidence of how news stories can promote Islamophobic sentiments and eventually atrocities towards Muslim communities. It also provides the implicit impact of reporting news stories that may impact hate speech and crime against speciﬁc communities. Copyright 2022 Ali et al.

AB  - The new era of the 21st century is characterized by the rapid pace of digitalization of society and the development of information and communication technologies (ICTs). ICTs are transforming the basics of educational activities from the physical environment to the virtual one. There is a similarity between technology and media in content and strategic context. The media actively influence the public opinion, and information and communication technologies are used to increase the impact on academic performance. Therefore, there is a need for a critical analysis of information reality in order to develop the competence in future generation. The article provides the study of the process of development of innovative media education styles, which are effective in educational activities for the formation of a competent future generation capable of critical analysis of the information. The study of the formation of innovative media education styles was based on the Synyavsky’s communicative and organizational skills measurement methods in order to diagnose the main aspects of educational activities in the innovative context, Milman’s personal motivation technique, survey to determine the competency criterion of media education. A pedagogical experiment was conducted as part of the study. The results of the study became the ground for determining the content of innovative media education styles as an alternative to modern forms of education. Innovative media education styles are formed due to the influence of ICTs on educational activities. The obtained data were processed in SPSS 18.0.1. © 2022 Sciedu Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: COVID-19 vaccines are one of the most effective preventive strategies for containing the pandemic. Having a better understanding of the public’s conceptions of COVID-19 vaccines may aid in the effort to promptly and thoroughly vaccinate the community. However, because no empirical research has yet fully explored the public’s vaccine awareness through sentiment–based topic modeling, little is known about the evolution of public attitude since the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Objective: In this study, we specifically focused on tweets about COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca, and Johnson & Johnson) after vaccines became publicly available. We aimed to explore the overall sentiments and topics of tweets about COVID-19 vaccines, as well as how such sentiments and main concerns evolved. Methods: We collected 1,122,139 tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines from December 14, 2020, to April 30, 2021, using Twitter’s application programming interface. We removed retweets and duplicate tweets to avoid data redundancy, which resulted in 857,128 tweets. We then applied sentiment–based topic modeling by using the compound score to determine sentiment polarity and the coherence score to determine the optimal topic number for different sentiment polarity categories. Finally, we calculated the topic distribution to illustrate the topic evolution of main concerns. Results: Overall, 398,661 (46.51%) were positive, 204,084 (23.81%) were negative, 245,976 (28.70%) were neutral, 6899 (0.80%) were highly positive, and 1508 (0.18%) were highly negative sentiments. The main topics of positive and highly positive tweets were planning for getting vaccination (251,979/405,560, 62.13%), getting vaccination (76,029/405,560, 18.75%), and vaccine information and knowledge (21,127/405,560, 5.21%). The main concerns in negative and highly negative tweets were vaccine hesitancy (115,206/205,592, 56.04%), extreme side effects of the vaccines (19,690/205,592, 9.58%), and vaccine supply and rollout (17,154/205,592, 8.34%). During the study period, negative sentiment trends were stable, while positive sentiments could be easily influenced. Topic heatmap visualization demonstrated how main concerns changed during the current widespread vaccination campaign. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate public COVID-19 vaccine awareness and awareness trends on social media with automated sentiment–based topic modeling after vaccine rollout. Our results can help policymakers and research communities track public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines and help them make decisions to promote the vaccination campaign. ©Luwen Huangfu, Yiwen Mo, Peijie Zhang, Daniel Dajun Zeng, Saike He.

AB  - Prior studies have examined NGOs’ accounting practices and the implications of such practices within the social media realm. However, we know little about how NGOs use social media to disseminate counter accounts and the impacts of such dissemination beyond social media platforms. This paper examines whether NGOs’ dissemination of counter accounts can mobilise stakeholder support in a campaign against corporate actions. Drawing on Castells’ network-making perspective and the notion of dialogic accounting, I argue that social media dissemination of counter accounts strengthens NGOs’ network-making power so that a wide range of corporate stakeholders can be engaged, and a strong network can be potentially formed to increase the effectiveness of NGOs’ campaigns. Drawing on a unique dataset of Greenpeace “Save The Arctic” (STA) global petition signatories and stakeholder interactions from a sample of 8,336 Greenpeace Facebook messages related to the STA campaign, I find that stakeholder support is positively associated with stakeholder interactions with disseminated counter accounts and the number of Facebook accounts connected in disseminating such information. Additional analyses also reveal that Greenpeace disseminates counter accounts via social media to attract policymaker attention and the disseminated counter accounts are associated with public opinions towards climate change. Overall, this study sheds light on the implications of NGOs’ dissemination of counter accounts on social media in initiating social activism and accumulating power against irresponsible corporate practices. © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - As a rising power, China has realized that it is an urgent task to improve its national image among foreign publics. In the era of Xi Jinping, China has invested a substantial amount of resources in its foreign-language media to present a more favorable national image to an international audience. This study provides a novel approach to examine the content of China’s Japanese-language media and its dissemination. The study found that the Chinese state media promotes China’s soft power using two main strategies: (1) highlighting China’s culture and economic achievements, and (2) providing positive stories of China. A comparative content analysis of Chinese and Japanese media shows that Chinese media’s narratives are not well circulated in Japan’s public opinion ﬁeld. This study has both substantive and methodological signiﬁcance. Substantively, this investigation enhances our understanding of China’s strategic use of state-owned media for public diplomacy. Methodologically, this research contributes to the employment of quantitative text analysis methods on Japanese-language data. © AMIC/WKWSCI-NTU 2022.

AB  - In an effort to stave off racial and geographic prejudices, The World Health Organization (WHO) has advised against naming pathogens for geographic regions. Despite this, some media reports, and prominent politicians, have persisted in calling the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus,” or some variant thereof. In this pre-registered online experiment (N = 614), we examined the effect media frames and individual factors (i.e., political affiliation and party) had on perceptions of COVID-19, prejudice against Chinese- and Asian-Americans, and attributing blame to China for the coronavirus. We found that articles that labeled the coronavirus the “Chinese Virus” (versus the “COVID-19 Virus”) were perceived less favorably by Democrats and liberals, in comparison to Republicans and conservatives, who were also more likely to express greater racial prejudice against Chinese- and Asian-Americans and to blame China for the pandemic. Findings from this study suggest that amongst a host of other variables, media framing has an effect on the public’s attitudes and feelings of blame for the pandemic. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Two survey studies, one with a college sample (Study 1, n = 245) and one with a national U.S. adult sample (Study 2, n = 590) examined how media messages can influence attitudes toward Black people in the U.S. A novel contribution is the role of Bounded Generalized Reciprocity, or the belief that members of an outgroup are likely to return a favor (positive), or enact retribution for a wrong (negative) as a factor in the relationship between television use and attitudes. Study 1 (college student sample) found support for a relationship between lifetime television exposure and negative attitudes, mediated by negative reciprocity beliefs. Study 2 (U.S. adult sample) found support for an ambivalence effect, where lifetime television exposure was associated with increases in both positive and negative reciprocity beliefs. This indicates that reciprocity beliefs can be cultivated similarly to other kinds of beliefs (e.g., crime frequency, mean world), and that these beliefs have downstream relationships with racial attitudes. The direction in which they are influenced by television use remains an open question, and likely depends on TV content patterns over time. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Covid-19 pandemic has ushered in new behaviors and digital practices. This study explores how digital media has advanced safer behavior among ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults during the pandemic in authoritarian societies. We explored the level of adherence to government-issued health guidelines during the Covid-19 pandemic by conducting a public opinion survey among a representative sample of ultra-Orthodox Israeli adults (N = 500) during the second Covid-19 wave (Autumn 2020). The results show that digital media usage significantly contributes to higher levels of adherence to health guidelines. This offers new insight into the field of new media research, revealing the significant role of digital media in promoting safer behavior in times of emergency in authoritarian communities, possibly because it bypasses Internet censorship and disinformation. It also emphasizes the need for adapting risk communication to the media habits and cultural beliefs of different social groups, in turn contributing to well-being and life itself. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Opinion target classification of microblog comments is one of the most important tasks for public opinion analysis about an event. Due to the high cost of manual labeling, opinion target classification is generally considered as a weak-supervised task. This article attempts to address the opinion target classification of microblog comments through an event graph convolution network (EventGCN) in a weak-supervised manner. Specifically, we take microblog contents and comments as document nodes, and construct an event graph with three typical relationships of event microblogs, including the co-occurrence relationship of event keywords extracted from microblogs, the reply relationship of comments, and the document similarity. Finally, under the supervision of a small number of labels, both word features and comment features can be represented well to complete the classification. The experimental results on two event microblog datasets show that EventGCN can significantly improve the classification performance compared with other baseline models. © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - This article focuses on a particular group in capitalist society that is disabled, demeaned and denied by capitalism itself, through processes of economic exploitation, systematic and systemic class exclusion, and discrimination/ prejudice-that is-the working class. In doing so I recognise that the working class (defined as all those who sell their/our labour power) is segmented horizontally into `layers’, or strata (for example, the dispossessed, unemployed, unskilled, though to the supervisory. managerial level/stratum) and also vertically, for example, by `race’and by gender, with particular ethnic groups, and women in general, disabled and oppressed and exploited to a greater degree than their/ our white, male sisters and brothers). Analysing from a Classical Marxist perspective I address the structures of the capitalist state through which this exclusion and `subalternising’ is imposed, through formal state structures such as education, media, the panoply of state force and class law, as well as through the material power of the capitalist class, expressed through, for example, wage suppression and enforced immiseration of the majority of the working class. In doing so I address two types of neo-Marxist analysis-`Structuralist neo-Marxism’ and ‘Culturalist neo-Marxism’, and the dialectical relationship between them. They differ on such matters as: the degree of `relative autonomy' for resistant agency; the relative impact and import of cultural-ideological as against structural-material analysis; and the salience or not of social class analysis, the Capital-Labour relation, vis-a vis other forms of oppression such as `race; and gender', and their implications for political resistance and organisation at the cultural-ideological level and at the level of power, the material power to reform and revolutionise economic and social relations of Capital. I propose an activist programme of resistance at two levels. Firstly, societal level, looking at Marxists such as Marx and Engels, Rosa Luxemburg, Lenin, Trotsky and the dialectical relationship between Reform and Revolution. Secondly, at the level of Education, both formal and informal (through social movements, political parties, trade unions, through public pedagogy for example). Within the formal education structures, I advance specific proposals regarding schooling and teacher education. This is a panoptic paper-the issues above are linked in terms of Classical Marxist analysis of capitalism, class exploitation and oppression, and the implications of such analysis for the praxis and politics of resistance. © 2022, Institute for Education Policy Studies.

AB  - Vaccine hesitancy is listed as one of the top 10 global health threats by the WHO. Existing studies investigating the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and social media have found that misinformation and vaccine concerns on social media can cause significant declines in vaccine coverage rates. The objective of this study was to provide insight into the dynamics of vaccine messages on Twitter in Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden), by analyzing tweets in local languages during 2019. A validated measure, the 5C scale, was used to map relevant predictors of vaccination behavior, capturing the factors confidence (in vaccines and the system that delivers them), complacency (not perceiving diseases as high risk), constraints (structural and psychological barriers), calculation (engagement in extensive information searching) and collective responsibility (willingness to protect others). A total of 1794 tweets met the inclusion criteria (DK: 48%, NO: 15%, SE: 37%), predominantly tweeted by private users (86%). The HPV vaccine was mentioned in 81% of tweets. Tweets were classified as expressing confidence (61%), complacency (18%), constraints (15%), calculation (15%), and collective responsibility (4%). Confidence in vaccines and the system that delivers them was expressed in 57%. A lack of confidence was expressed in 4% of all tweets, in combination with calculation in 39%. Analyzing public sentiment toward vaccination on Twitter is a useful tool to leverage for better understanding of the dynamics behind vaccine hesitancy. This analysis could provide actionable information for healthcare professionals and public health authorities to mitigate online misinformation and public vaccine concerns. © 2022 Merck & Co., Inc.

AB  - This paper explores if televised deliberations constitute the public sphere in Ethiopia, analysing the public service and commercial TV stations focussing on the EBC’s ETV Medrek, FBC’s Zuria Meles and LTV’s Sefiw Mihdar programs. It has drawn on content analysis of the mediated deliberations of the three TV programs and an in-depth interview with hosts of the programs. The study found that these television stations have created permanent elitist platforms where experts, the academia and other prominent figures discussed and debated that did not exist previously. In contrast, these programs did not create forums for ordinary citizens and other marginalised groups, including women. Indeed, these programs created limited space as platforms for different views, opinions, perceptions and diversity of participants in their discussions. These programs anticipated to covering event-oriented issues that kept changing each week. The program hosts faced internal and external influence mainly from political leaders in the daily routines of producing the programs in their respective media houses. Overall, the role of these TV stations in creating a platform for public sphere, setting the public agenda consistently and promoting public opinion formation endured minimal. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - It is commonly viewed that violence against politicians increases support for the victim’s party. We revisit this conjecture drawing on evidence from an assassination of an opposition politician in Poland. First, we analyze engagement with Twitter content posted by opposition and government politicians using a difference-in-differences framework. Second, we use a public opinion survey collected in the days around the attack and compare party preferences of respondents interviewed just before and respondents interviewed just after the attack. Our results reveal decreased support for the victim’s (opposition) party relative to support for the government. To explain this finding, we show that the opposition antagonized the public by engaging in negative campaigning against the government over their politician’s assassination. Content analysis of tweets and news media confirms that citizens punished the opposition for their negative campaigning after the violence. Tentative evidence suggests that these effects could have had long-run political consequences. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The red, yellow, and green three-colored health code apps (HCAs) have been credited as an effective tool for the COVID-19 response in China, with a golden color added indicating vaccination status in spring 2021. Although the success of HCA as a public health intervention might have legitimized government or corporate surveillance, the scope and contour of post-pandemic HCA use remain unclear. Both officials and tech firms have been promoting broader post-pandemic HCA use for purposes beyond pandemic control. This research draws on theories on privacy, trust, and media engagement to investigate factors affecting Chinese public opinion on HCA's post-pandemic use. Original survey data were collected in 2021 from adult HCA users in two major Chinese cities: Wuhan where COVID-19 cases were first identified and Hangzhou where the first HCA was deployed. Results point to a majority for moderate post-pandemic HCA use, while almost four out of ten users support expansive HCA use and the voice for restricted or terminated use is tiny. Greater acceptance of HCA data use by various institutional stakeholders, greater institutional trust, greater engagement with COVID-19 related social media content increased the support for expansive use. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The number of multiracial candidates seeking office is growing in an increasingly diverse America. This raises questions about how the media frame candidates with potentially complex racial backgrounds and how voters respond to these frames. We investigate the impact of media frames that emphasize race and gender attributes using survey experiments on Kamala Harris - the first Black woman and first Asian woman vice president. Our findings are mixed. In a survey experiment conducted after her nomination, headlines emphasizing different elements of Harris's race or gender had no impact on public attitudes. In an experiment conducted after Harris was inaugurated, however, headlines that cued her gender only or both her gender and her Black racial background boosted popular support. Taken together, these findings suggest that some types of identity-based cues may matter, but the effects are sensitive to experimental settings and contexts. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The aim of this study is to better understand stigma towards individuals with mental illness who commit violent offences, and examine ways to mitigate the negative impact of social media news stories of schizophrenia and violent offending. Psychology undergraduate students (N = 255) were exposed to Instagram images and captions of recent real news stories of violent offending by individuals with schizophrenia. In the experimental condition, contextual clinical explanatory information was integrated. Pre- and post-measures of stigma were completed. There was a significant increase in negative attitudes towards individuals with mental illness who committed violent offences following the no-context condition, which was clearly mitigated in the experimental condition where context was provided. In both conditions, there were significant increases in intended social-distancing behaviours towards and perceptions of dangerousness of individuals with schizophrenia, and negative beliefs about mental illness more generally. There appears to be utility in incorporating knowledge-based clinical information to mitigate some facets of stigma. © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Opinion dynamics models based on the multi-agent method commonly assume that interactions between individuals in a social network result in changes in their opinions. However, formation of public opinion in a social network is a macroscopic statistical result of opinions of all expressive individuals (corresponding to silent individuals). Therefore, public opinion can be manipulated not only by changing individuals' opinions, but also by changing their states of expression (or silence) which can be interpreted as the phenomenon "spiral of silence"in social psychology. Based on this theory, we establish a "dual opinion climate"model, involving social bots and mass media through a multi-agent method, to describe mechanism for manipulation of public opinion in social networks. We find that both social bots (as local variables) and mass media (as a global variable) can interfere with the formation of public opinion, cause a significant superposition effect when they act in the same direction, and inhibit each other when they act in opposite directions. © 2021 Chinese Physical Society and IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A large portion of the global population generates various multimedia data such as texts, images, videos, etc. One of the most common categories which influences the public at large is visual multimedia content. Due to the different social media platforms (e.g., Whatsapp, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube), these materials are passed without censorship and national boundaries. Multimedia data containing any violent or vulgar objects could trigger public unrest, and thus, it is a serious threat to the law and order of the land. Children and teenagers use social media like never before in previous generations and create lots of multimedia data. It is important to assess the quality of multimedia content without any bias and prejudices. Although the mainstream social media platforms use different filters and moderation using human experts, it is impossible to verify the terabytes of uploaded images and videos. Thus, it is inevitable to automate the content assessment phase without incurring an increase in upload time. This study aims to prevent uploading or to tag an image/video with a reasonable percentage of a gun as content. In this paper, object detection architectures such as Faster RCNN, EfficientDet, and YOLOv5 have been used to demonstrate how these techniques can efficiently detect human faces and different types of guns in given multimedia data (images/videos). The models are tested on various test images and video clips. A comparative analysis has also been discussed based on mean average precision and frames per second metric. The YOLOv5 provides the best-performing results as high as 80.39% and 35.22% at mAP 0.5 and mAP [0.50 : 0.95], respectively. A face recognition task requires thousands of samples and the usual deep learning models are data-driven. On the contrary, a few-shot learning approach has been implemented to recognize the detected faces categorizing the content as real or reel. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - PURPOSE: Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Social media platforms such as Twitter are extensively used to communicate about cancer care, yet little is known about the role of these online platforms in promoting early detection or sharing the lived experiences of patients with CRC. This study tracked Twitter discussions about CRC and characterized participating users to better understand public communication and perceptions of CRC during the COVID-19 pandemic. METHODS: Tweets containing references to CRC were collected from January 2020 to April 2021 using Twitter's Application Programming Interface. Account metadata was used to predict user demographic information and classify users as either organizations, individuals, clinicians, or influencers. We compared the number of impressions across users and analyzed the content of tweets using natural language processing models to identify prominent topics of discussion. RESULTS: There were 72,229 unique CRC-related tweets by 31,170 users. Most users were male (66%) and older than 40 years (57%). Individuals accounted for most users (44%); organizations (35%); clinicians (19%); and influencers (2%). Influencers made the most median impressions (35,853). Organizations made the most overall impressions (1,067,189,613). Tweets contained the following topics: bereavement (20%), appeals for early detection (20%), research (17%), National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month (15%), screening access (14%), and risk factors (14%). CONCLUSION: Discussions about CRC largely focused on bereavement and early detection. Online coverage of National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month and personal experiences with CRC effectively stimulated goaloriented tweets about early detection. Our findings suggest that although Twitter is commonly used for communicating about CRC, partnering with influencers may be an effective strategy for improving communication of future public health recommendations related to CRC. © 2022 American Society of Clinical Oncology.

AB  - Objectives: In the early stages of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, chloroquine and its derivatives such as hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) were widely commented upon both within the scientific community and in the media. This paper explores the different factors that influenced public perceptions in France of the efficacy of HCQ as well as their evolution between April 2020 and June 2021. Methods: This article draws on 5 surveys conducted among representative samples of the French population (projects COCONEL and TRACTRUST; quota method, n = 1006; 1004; 2006; 1014 and 1005). We asked questions on the effectiveness of chloroquine against COVID-19. We also collected sociodemographic variables and attitudes toward politics and science. Results: Between April and June 2021, the proportion of respondents who believed in the efficacy of HCQ decreased rapidly from 35% to 14%. The proportion of respondents who believed that HCQ is ineffective rose gradually from 6% to 21%. After adjusting for the temporal effect, the logistic regression showed a very strong association between political orientation and the belief in the efficacy of HCQ. Respondents who felt closest to the more radical parties (far-right and far-left) were more likely to believe in the efficacy of HCQ than those who felt closest to the political center (O.R. 2.48 [1.95–3.15] and 1.87 [1.44–2.43]). The role of trust in the government and in science and of the degree of political engagement were investigated in the two waves conducted after the scientific consensus was established during the summer of 2020. High levels of trust in the government and in science and of politicization are associated with belief of HCQ proven inefficacy. Across the whole period, a majority of respondents were uncertain. Even in 2021, 41.5% stated that the data were insufficient to decide whether or not HCQ is effective and 25.2% stating that they did not know. Conclusion: Because media coverage of scientific controversies is higher in times of uncertainty than after these controversies have died down, the publicization of therapeutic promises can have lasting consequences on attitudes towards science and medicine. © 2022 The Author(s)

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to explore if the learning of biographical writing contributes to the positive views and attitudes towards others of different groups. The paper used the Research and Development approach by designing and implementing a learning model of biographical writing. The subjects of this study were 200 seventh-grade students having different ethnic and religious backgrounds from nine junior high schools. The data-collecting method was pretest-posttest. The results of the study demonstrated that the average scores of the aspects of student empathy, student positive attitudes towards ethnic differences, and student positive attitudes towards religious differences increased in all the schools investigated. The increase of average score in the aspect of student empathy, positive attitudes towards ethnic differences, and positive attitudes towards religious differences could be classified into three categories: High, medium, and low. Most of the schools under study experienced medium and low increases of average score in all aspects. © 2022 Eurasian Society of Educational Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Social media represent an important source of news for many users. They are, however, affected by misinformation and they might be playing a role in the growth of political polarization. In this paper, we create an agent based model to investigate how policing content and backlash on social media (i.e. conflict) can lead to an increase in polarization for both users and news sources. Our model is an advancement over previously proposed models because it allows us to study the polarization of both users and news sources, the evolution of the audience connections between users and sources, and it makes more realistic assumptions about the starting conditions of the system. We find that the tendency of users and sources to avoid policing, backlash and conflict in general can increase polarization online. Specifically polarization comes from the ease of sharing political posts, intolerance for opposing points of view causing backlash and policing, and volatility in changing one's opinion when faced with new information. On the other hand, it seems that the integrity of a news source in trying to resist the backlash and policing has little effect. © 2022 Coscia, Rossi.

AB  - This article explores an emerging strategy by sections of the British radical right towards the LGBTQ+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) community, who the radical right claim are existentially threatened by the alleged violent homophobia of Islam and their ostensible betrayal by ‘the left’. Consequently, parts of the radical right present themselves as the ‘true’ protectors of LGBTQ+ individuals through what we term alter-progressivism. By analysing recorded speeches, discussions and interviews by and with key British radical right figures, we demonstrate three themes: (1) the broad radical right discourse of a ‘Great Replacement’ specifically tailored towards LGBTQ+ anxieties, (2) a narrative in which the radical right portray themselves as the defenders of (some) minorities and (3) an emerging distinction between the far-right and radical right concerning LGBTQ+ rights. We conclude that these themes represent a significant rhetorical shift and reveal the flexibility of radical right narratives in an attempt to appeal to diverse communities. This represents a serious challenge, which compels social scientists to adapt their understandings of radical right ideologies, objectives and strategies. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - As a conduit of knowledge for the general public, news media inform the development and maintenance of attitudes and beliefs about a range of topics, including mental health and related behaviors. News mediaportrayals of such topics can, therefore, contribute to stigma—the culmination of harmful stereotypes,prejudice, and discrimination. A topic of increasing media and research interest is self-harm, a behavior thatis still poorly understood and highly stigmatized. Despite the potential for news media to be a source of selfharmstigma, few investigations of such portrayals have been conducted. To understand how news mediaportrays self-harm, a qualitative media framing analysis was conducted on 545 news articles published inAustralia during 2019. Six frames were identified: Inevitably Suicidal, A Tragic Outcome, Mentally Unwell,An Epidemic, Threatening and Dangerous, and A Manipulative Tactic, each drawing on a broader narrativeof pathology, instability, and damage. Use of problematic language and a lack of definitional clarityreinforced these frames. While the analyzed articles are limited to an Australian context, findingsdemonstrate continued misrepresentations of self-harm, which arguably contribute to ongoing self-harmstigma.

AB  - Even though social investment is highly popular, welfare state recalibration remains an uphill battle. When resources are scarce in times of austerity, welfare recalibration involves multidimensional trade-offs. Existing research primarily studied preferences toward individual policies or trade-offs in specific policy fields, failing to capture citizens' overall social policy priorities. Using two novel survey experiments in three European countries, we show that citizens have clear social policy priorities: pensions and education enjoy a high, family policies a medium, and labor market policies a low priority. However, policy constituencies differ in their relative priorities. Our findings suggest that welfare state recalibration is difficult because trade-offs are unpopular, and distributive conflicts in mature welfare states are mainly about distributing resources to specific social groups. © The Author(s), 2022.

AB  - Using the five waves of Russian data in the World Value Survey, this study compares the late USSR with the Russian Federation from Russian people’s perceptions against several key social indicators and explores factors predicting Russian people’s commitment to the new nation. The transformation from the USSR to the Russian Federation is found enhancing Russian people’s social well-being, although beginning with bitterness. Social trust, confidence in the press and television, and personal political discourses have not been revived yet. Television news consumption appears to build people’s national pride and willingness to fight for the country. Russian peoples’ identification with, and pride of, the new federation are positively associated with their awareness of being a part of the CIS or the world. Their national identity, national pride, and willingness to fight for the country also show a form of the traditional cognitive-affective-conative hierarchy. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The recent rise of political extremity and radicalization has presented unique challenges to contemporary politics, governance, and social cohesion in many societies in the world. In this study, we propose an imagined audience approach to understand how social media’s expanded expression capabilities are related to users’ political extremity and reduced network interaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one’s political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample. We conclude by discussing the significance of our imagined audience approach and its relevance to today’s technology-mediated self-presentation. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Microblogging websites and social media platforms serve as a potential source for mining public opinions and sentiments on a variety of subjects including the prevailing situations in war-afflicted countries. In particular, Twitter has a large number of geotagged tweets that make the analysis of sentiments across time and space possible. This study performs volume analysis and sentiment analysis using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) and text mining over two datasets collected for different periods. To increase the adequacy and efficacy of the sentiment analysis, a hybrid feature engineering approach is proposed that elevates the performance of machine learning models. Geotagged tweets are used for volume analysis indicating that the highest number of tweets is originated from India, the US, the UK, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Analysis of positive and negative tweets reveals that negative tweets are mostly originated from India and the US. On the contrary, positive tweets belong to Pakistan and Afghanistan. LDA is used for topic modeling on two datasets containing tweets about the current situation after the Taliban take control of Afghanistan. Topics extracted through LDA suggest that majority of the Afghanistan people seem satisfied with the Taliban’s takeover while the topics from negative tweets reveal that issues discussed in negative tweets are related to the US concerns in Afghanistan. Sentiment analysis over two different datasets indicates that the trend of the sentiments has been shifted positively over three weeks. © 2022 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - Tremendous efforts will be required in the coming decades to limit the harmful effects of climate change. This includes travel behavior, which not only has a significant impact on climate but also affects the perceived justice and trust necessary to manage the transition to net zero successfully. Technologies such as social media can promote behavioral change; unfortunately, also for the negative. Drawing on social comparison theory, social identity theory, and the theory of planned behavior, this study uses a PLS-SEM model to investigate if and under which circumstances exposure to travel-related content posted by professional influencers affects their followers’ travel intentions. It extends previous studies by explicitly focusing on influencers that use Instagram to make a living and considers the effect of pro-environmental attitudes. On the one hand, it shows that influencers are not only responsible for their travel behavior. Their content stimulates their audiences’ wanderlust through benign envy. On the other hand, the study suggests that reinforcing pro-environmental attitudes can help mitigate the negative climate effects of imitating influencer travel behavior. © 2022 by the author.

AB  - Responding to disruptions and crises are challenges public leaders face as they strive to lead responsibly for the good of the community. The last two years have been especially challenging for public leaders and institutions. In Australia, the federal government battled natural disasters (bushfires) and COVID-19 within the span of only a few months, beginning in late 2019. These events provided the opportunity for a natural experiment to explore public perceptions of leadership in times of crises, with both a natural disaster and health crisis in quick succession. In this study, we develop, validate, and test a scale of perceptions of leadership for the greater good, the Australian Leadership Index, throughout different crisis contexts. We hypothesize and find support for the drivers of perceptions of public leadership and shifts in these perceptions as a function of the bushfire disaster response, a negative shift, and the initial COVID-19 response, a positive shift. Comparisons of the crisis periods against a period of relative stability are made. We discuss the implications of differential media coverage, how the crises were managed, and the resulting public perceptions of leadership for the greater good. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - This article uses thematisation theory (Luhmann, 1996; Pissarra Esteves, 2016) and frame analysis (Entman, 1993) to analyse externalisations to world situations (Schriewer, 1990) in the Portuguese print media’s discussion of education. Our data constitutes news and opinion articles collected after each PISA cycle’s results was published. The analysis demonstrates that the education themes discussed in the media between 2001 and 2017 are consistent, despite occasionally being discussed more intensively, frequently following the themes highlighted by PISA reports and OECD media communications. The frames used for these themes are more diverse, changing according to the speaker’s agenda and viewpoints. Externalisations (frequently PISA, OECD, and other participants in the survey) serve as sources of authority that help in thematising and framing education. This process works as a mechanism of double reduction for the complexity of the social world, narrowing the possibilities of how education is seen and interpreted by the public. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - For the second time in history, England was announced as the host for the 13th edition of the UEFA Women’s Euro by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). This study aims to analyse media coverage and public opinion of England’s host bid and the country’s choice as hosts of the UEFA Women’s Euro 2022. This research was based on a content analysis of the English newspapers The Guardian, The Sun, and The Times regarding the media, and the social media Twitter to analyse public opinion. After applying filters, we analysed 65 news reports and 480 Twitter interactions. Thus, investigating these two different views on the same subject, we noted a relative consonance of positions: expectations for the organisation of the tournament, the success of the English team and the development of women’s football, and criticism of the regional distribution of the games and the use of modest stadiums. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Religion can determine how people perceive socio-political reality, especially in a cultural context in which religious affiliation is an important part of national identity. This has a special significance in the Polish cultural context, in which Catholicism is considered the national religion, and its institutional dimension plays an important role in the Polish socio-political domain. The purpose of this study is to analyse how religion affects the socio-political attitudes of Poles abroad. This analysis focuses directly on evaluating the influence of the spiritual leaders of Polish community organisations in the UK on the knowledge and opinions of Brexit among Polish post-accession emigrants to the UK. The study was conducted on a sample of 620 Poles living in the UK (62.6% male) using a group-administered questionnaire. The study found that the Polish Catholic clergy did not play an important role in opinion-forming, i.e., in shaping what Polish emigrants to the UK know and think about Brexit. What proved to be the most powerful factor in terms of opinion-making was the British mass media. The influence of the Catholic clergy on the knowledge of—and opinions on—Brexit among Polish emigrants was only evident among elderly people who did not know English very well, and who regularly participated in religious activities. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs—often called misinformation or disinformation—through a population has never seemed so urgent. Network science researchers have often taken a page from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model of an individual’s set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important for their adoption or rejection. Some computational social science modelers analyze agent-based models where individuals do have simulated cognition, but they often lack the strengths of network science, namely in empirically-driven network structures. We introduce a cognitive cascade model that combines a network science belief cascade approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents as in opinion diffusion models as a public opinion diffusion (POD) model, adding media institutions as agents which begin opinion cascades. We show that the model, even with a very simplistic belief function to capture cognitive effects cited in disinformation study (dissonance and exposure), adds expressive power over existing cascade models. We conduct an analysis of the cognitive cascade model with our simple cognitive function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging patterns. We argue from our results that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively match what has been reported in COVID-related public opinion polls, and that the model dynamics lend insights as to how to address the spread of problematic beliefs. The overall model sets up a framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter, the spread of disinformation and “alternative facts.” © 2022 Rabb et al.

AB  - Context: A law legalizing the farming of medical cannabis for the international market was passed in Lebanese parliament in April 2020. Thus, this makes Lebanon the first Arab country to legalize medical cannabis, a law which can hold potential public health consequences. The advocates of legalization of medical cannabis in society and in the media influence the public opinion. A community of Lebanese physicians was the first to be asked about this subject. Objective: This study aims to assess a sample of physicians’ opinions, knowledge and experiences with medical and non-medical cannabis. Method: All physicians of every speciality working at the Hôtel Dieu de France-Beirut hospital (450) received by email a 33-question-online survey in French between November 2020 and December 2020. The survey was designed based on similar studies published outside of Lebanon. Results: Eighty-five Lebanese physicians responded to the survey and 80% of them supported the decriminalization of medical cannabis in Lebanon. But only 16% reported knowing the indications of medical cannabis, and only 24% stated that they have adequate knowledge of its secondary effects. Eighty-eight percent of them felt that they might be more comfortable discussing the option of medical cannabis if they had formal education on the subject. Conclusion: Even though the majority of the sample who participated in this study seemed to approve the use of medical cannabis, they lacked the knowledge and confidence to do it. Therefore, this study highlights the need of physician training in the subject of medical cannabis. Future well-conducted university studies will produce evidence-based-guidelines for medical cannabis indications and side effects. © 2021 L'Encéphale, Paris

AB  - To grasp the current status of network public opinion (NPO) research and explore the knowledge base and hot trends from a quantitative perspective, we retrieved 1385 related papers and conducted a bibliometric mapping analysis on them. Co-occurrence analysis, cluster analysis, co-citation analysis and keyword burst analysis were performed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace software. The results show that the NPO is mainly distributed in the disciplinary fields associated with journalism and communication and public management. There are four main hotspots: analysis of public opinion, analysis of communication channels, technical means and challenges faced. The knowledge base in the field of NPO research includes social media, user influence, and user influence related to opinion dynamic modeling and sentiment analysis. With the advent of the era of big data, big data technology has been widely used in various fields and to some extent can be said to be the research frontier in the field. Transforming big data public opinion into early warning, realizing in-depth analysis and accurate prediction of public opinion as well as improving decision-making ability of public opinion are the future research directions of NPO. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background and aims: The development of vaccines against COVID-19 has been a global purpose since the World Health Organization declared the pandemic. People usually use social media, especially Twitter, to transfer knowledge and beliefs on global concerns like COVID-19-vaccination, hence, Twitter is a good source for investigating public opinions. The present study aimed to assess Persian tweets to (1) analyze Iranian people's view toward COVID-19 vaccination. (2) Compare Iranian views toward a homegrown and imported COVID-19-vaccines. Methods: First, a total of 803278 Persian tweets were retrieved from Twitter, mentioning COVIran Barekat (the homegrown vaccine), Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/Oxford, Moderna, and Sinopharm (imported vaccines) between April 1, 2021 and September 30, 2021. Then, we identified sentiments of retrieved tweets using a deep learning sentiment analysis model based on CNN-LSTM architecture. Finally, we investigated Iranian views toward COVID-19-vaccination. Results: (1) We found a subtle difference in the number of positive sentiments toward the homegrown and foreign vaccines, and the latter had the dominant positive polarity. (2) The negative sentiment regarding homegrown and imported vaccines seems to be increasing in some months. (3) We also observed no significant differences between the percentage of overall positive and negative opinions toward vaccination amongst Iranian people. Conclusions: It is worrisome that the negative sentiment toward homegrown and imported vaccines increases in Iran in some months. Since public healthcare agencies aim to increase the uptake of COVID-19 vaccines to end the pandemic, they can focus on social media such as Twitter to promote positive messaging and decrease opposing views. © 2021

AB  - Introduction: This study aimed to review themes and methodological strategies of the Brazilian scientific literature regarding families headed by gay and lesbian parents. Methods: We performed the searches in November 2019 and January 2020 in the Web of Science, EBSCOHost, PUBMED/MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases, from 2009 to 2019, in Portuguese and English languages, and yielded 20 eligible articles. We followed PRISMA protocol guidelines and we carried out a thematic analysis in NVivo. Results: Four broad themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the data available in the articles retrieved: (a) Family conceptions: the historical importance of the biological bond and the idea of affection as a means by which these parents and their children co-construct a sense of family; (b) parenting routes and their repercussions for the couple and/or in family relations; (c) prejudice against sexual diversity, social support, and the impact on family relationships; (d) literary and media representations and expectations regarding gay and lesbian parenting. Conclusions: The results showed that most Brazilian research focuses on families headed by lesbian parents that had access to parenthood through reproductive technologies. The most used methodological strategies were cross-sectional designs, snowball sampling, individual semi-structured interviews, and content analysis. The quality assessment indicated that most studies did not describe researchers’ positionality. Policy Implications: Theoretical and empirical research in Brazilian is required to better address family-based stigma and discrimination. However, the present study’s findings can also guide future research and interventions in health care and promotion designed to minimize risks or exposure to adversities and strengthen resilience processes in such family configurations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world since the beginning of 2020. In Brazil, over 70% of the population rely on the Brazil's Unified Health System (SUS). Knowing public opinion related to SUS is very important for the improvement of services and assistance provided by such an entity. Sentiment analysis has been used in several applications including social networks and blogs to extract public opinion. Despite the fact that other papers have already worked with sentiment analysis, none of them have focused on SUS. Therefore, the goal of this paper is to analyse the sentiments shown by Brazillian Twitter users about SUS before and during COVID-19 pandemic. To reach this goal, a database of portuguese tweets regarding SUS posted between december 2019 and october 2020 was created. The tweets were pre-processed, classified and then analysed. The results show that, in most cases, users are in favor of SUS. © 2003-2012 IEEE.

AB  - Parents play a vital role in mediating children’s media use, especially at a young age. We examined the link between the media use of younger children and the media use, attitude toward media, and parenting styles of parents. One thousand and twenty parents of children between 4 and 6 years of age completed a questionnaire on their media use, positive and negative attitudes on media, parenting styles, and the media use of their children. Multigroup structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. The results showed that there was a significant positive relation between the parent’s media time and the child’s daytime and nighttime media use. Additionally, the parent’s positive attitude toward media use was positively related to the child’s daytime media use, but not the child’s nighttime media use, while the parent’s negative attitude toward media was not associated with the child’s daytime and nighttime media use. Further, among the seven parenting styles, material rewards and autonomy were positively associated with the child’s daytime media use. Discipline was negatively related to the child’s nighttime media use, whereas material rewards were positively associated with the child’s nighttime media use. Collectively, the parent’s positive attitude toward media use was the strongest predictor of the child’s daytime media use, and material rewards were the strongest predictor of the child’s nighttime media use. These results can be of significant use to inform policymakers, researchers, and parents regarding the development of parental guidelines on children’s media use. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the use of social media by students in the Faculty of Education, University of Kuwait. The study was conducted within the context of the socio-cultural characteristics of Kuwait, and was underpinned by Alsaied’s (2017) Social Media-Learning Performance model, designed for female Arab students. A volunteer sample of 35 Kuwaiti undergraduate students (88.6% female) was interviewed. Students reported frequently using social media informally for socialization and entertainment, but less frequently as a formal educational tool. Most of the students perceived that social media facilitated interaction with peers, interaction with faculty, engagement, and collaborative learning. However, technical difficulties, and certain negative attitudes towards women using social media, were identified. We recommend that Kuwait University needs to harness the full benefits of social media for teaching and learning and to formulate official guidelines to control the use of social media by all faculty members and students. © 2022 by the authors; licensee CEDTECH by Bastas.

AB  - Purpose: The authors sought to unpack the paradox between increasing demand for probiotics products against inconclusive scientific evidence about the effectiveness. This paper investigated public understanding of the composition and benefits of probiotic products, measured trust in news media and scientists as sources of information about probiotic products and informational and attitudinal predictors of consumer trust in the news media and scientists. Design/methodology/approach: A cross-sectional survey was conducted amongst a representative sample of 2000 UK consumers. Participants responded to multiple-choice questions and psychometric scales capturing probiotics knowledge, consumption, information seeking behaviour, attitudes to and confidence in the news media and probiotics scientists. Descriptive statistics, one-way ANOVA and hierarchical regression modelling were performed. Findings: Information exposure to probiotics content was highest from traditional media followed by online channels. Levels of confidence in probiotics scientists were higher than in the news media, even though these levels were highest amongst current consumers and lowest amongst non-consumers. Conflicting information, health consciousness and trust in nutrition stakeholders were identified as important predictors of trust in news media and scientists. Originality/value: This study provides a large-scale nationally representative overview of public attitudes and sentiments related to probiotic products with a focus on attitudes towards the news media and the scientific establishment. The findings suggest a need for better consumer awareness about the state of science around probiotic products, interventions that could enable consumers to discern conflicting evidence or news reports, and critical skills that can render them more resilient to online misinformation. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Between 2010 and 2015, as Myanmar transitioned from authoritarian rule to a more liberal and democratic state, its Muslim population increasingly faced hate speech and violence. This article goes beyond analyses that regard the growing anti-Muslim sentiment as a consequence of a liberalized media environment, enabling people to voice long-standing grievances and prejudice. Rather, the notion of a “Muslim threat” to Myanmar’s Buddhist population is approached as the outcome of a dynamic process of securitization in which an alliance of political and religious elites was forged whose discourse changed the rules of the political field, forcing the reform-oriented opposition into strategic silence. It is argued that in the early period of liberalization, anti-Muslim frames were normalized and thus shaped the securitization of Muslims. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The Internet, specifically social media, is among the most common settings where young people encounter hate speech. Understanding their attitudes toward the phenomenon is crucial for combatting it because acceptance of such content could contribute to furthering the spread of hate speech as well as ideology contamination. The present study, theoretically grounded in the General Aggression Model (GAM), investigates factors associated with online hate acceptance among young adults. We collected survey data from participants aged 18–26 from six countries: Finland (n = 483), France (n = 907), Poland (n = 738), Spain (n = 739), the United Kingdom (n = 959), and the United States (n = 1052). Results based on linear regression modeling showed that acceptance of online hate was strongly associated with acceptance of violence in all samples. In addition, participants who admitted to producing online hate reported higher levels of acceptance of it. Moreover, association with social dominance orientation was found in most of the samples. Other sample-specific significant factors included participants’ experiences with the Internet and online hate, as well as empathy and institutional trust levels. Significant differences in online hate acceptance levels and the strength of its connections to individual factors were found between the countries. These results provide important insights into the phenomenon, demonstrating that online hate acceptance is part of a larger belief system and is influenced by cultural background, and, therefore, it cannot be analyzed or combatted in isolation from these factors. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Despite a campaign of effective educational interventions targeting knowledge, atti-tudes, and prevention, Human Immunodeficiency-Virus/Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) continues to be a significant public health issue in India, with Mizoram reporting the highest HIV/AIDS cases in 2018–2019. In this study, we extracted Mizoram state from the National Family Health Survey Fourth Series (NFHS-4) 2015–2016 datasets and investigated factors associated with respondents’ knowledge, attitudes, and prevention towards HIV/AIDS. The sample included 3555 adults aged 15–49 years residing in Mizoram, North-east India. Respondents who reported having ever heard of HIV/AIDS was 98%. Multivariate analysis indicated that the probability of having inadequate knowledge of HIV/AIDS was higher among those with no schooling, who were illiterate, of non-Christian faiths, belonging to backward tribes or caste, from poor households, and those who lived in rural areas, not exposed to media. The odds of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV/AIDS transmission was high among females (AOR = 3.12, 95% CI 2.34–4.16), respondents aged 35–39 years (AOR = 1.74, 95% CI 1.05–2.87) and those belonging to other backward class. The HIV/AIDS knowledge of respondents was found to be encouraging as the majority (98%) were considered to have a good level of understanding of the condition. An educational intervention to reduce the number of adults 15–49 years infected with HIV/AIDS in Mizoram should target those from low socioeconomic groups, those from non-Christian religions, and those from other backward classes. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Non-conventional terrorism (NCT) incorporates an extended dimension of uncertainty that can lead to fear among the public. Health officials have an unsubstantiated assumption that thousands will seek treatment in hospitals following NCT. This study aims to examine public behavioral intentions in the case of NCT and the effect of risk communication on intents. An online randomized controlled trial was conducted among 1802 adult participants in Israel. Threat perception and behavioral intent before and after exposure to hypothetical NCT scenarios were assessed stratified to the type of media, exposure to rumors, and risk communication. The majority (~64%) of participants are aware of the NCT threat. Almost half (45%) of participants indicated a “high” or “very high” chance of seeking medical attention following an NCT incident. Regression analysis suggests that the odds of participants exposed to risk communication to report an elevated intent of seeking medical attention were 0.470 (95% CI: 0.359, 0.615) times that of participants not exposed to risk communication, χ2 = 30.366, p &lt; 0.001. The findings demonstrate the importance of effective risk communication in reducing undesired public behavior during NCT crises. Efforts must be invested to create a robust risk communication infrastructure to allow the proper management of possible NCT incidents. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Assumptions about dogs’ personality are influenced by their appearance, which may lead to differences in ownership styles and subsequent canine welfare. The influence of canine appearance on observers’ emotion attributions to dogs remains largely unexplored. This study investigated whether canine head shape is related to how both dog owners and non-dog owning adults in the U.K. attribute emotions to still images of dogs, and in the case of dog owners, to their own dogs. Attachment, respondent personality and dog trainability were assessed as potential influences on emotional attribution in owners. Overall, 2451 participant responses were received. Still images of mesocephalic dogs were attributed primary and positively valenced emotion with more strength and frequency than other groups. Mesocephalic images were also attributed negatively valenced emotions less frequently and with less strength than other groups. Apart from empathy, no significant differences were found in emotional attribution to owned dogs of different head shapes; however, human personality influenced attribution of emotions to owned dogs. The finding that some dogs are attributed emotions more readily based on their appearance alone has applied importance, given, for example, the potential for misattribution of positive emotions to dogs in negative emotional states, and potential prejudice against dogs considered in negative emotional states. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In July 2021, breakthrough cases were reported in the outbreak of COVID-19 in Nanjing, sparking concern and discussion about the vaccine’s effectiveness and becoming a trending topic on Sina Weibo. In order to explore public attitudes towards the COVID-19 vaccine and their emotional orientations, we collected 1542 posts under the trending topic through data mining. We set up four categories of attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccines, and used a big data analysis tool to code and manually checked the coding results to complete the content analysis. The results showed that 45.14% of the Weibo posts (n = 1542) supported the COVID-19 vaccine, 12.97% were neutral, and 7.26% were doubtful, which indicated that the public did not question the vaccine’s effectiveness due to the breakthrough cases in Nanjing. There were 66.47% posts that reflected significant negative emotions. Among these, 50.44% of posts with negative emotions were directed towards the media, 25.07% towards the posting users, and 11.51% towards the public, which indicated that the negative emotions were not directed towards the COVID-19 vaccine. External sources outside the vaccine might cause vaccine hesitancy. Public opinions expressed in online media reflect the public’s cognition and attitude towards vaccines and their core needs in terms of information. Therefore, online public opinion monitoring could be an essential way to understand the opinions and attitudes towards public health issues. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - This paper examines public perceptions of shale gas development in China and the United States. Public perceptions are important, as they are known to influence public policy at national and local levels of government in both multi-party and single-party governance systems. Online surveys were conducted in several states/provinces in each country, the US survey in 2014 (N = 2833); the China survey in 2016 (N = 1571). Similar survey instruments were used in both countries. The survey results show that the reported levels of public support for shale gas development among Chinese respondents in select provinces are significantly higher than that among US respondents in the states included in this study. Perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of shale gas have both similarities and differences. Shale gas is perceived favorably in both samples because it is seen as a way to reduce dependence on foreign energy suppliers and strengthen the economy. The potential environmental advantages appear to be relatively more important to Chinese respondents than to American respondents. The statement “shale gas development is good for the environment because it substitutes dirty energy such as coal and oil” is seen as “Extremely important” by 54.23% of all Chinese respondents but by only 33.75% of American respondents. When it comes to the potential disadvantages of shale gas development, concerns about impacts on drinking water quality are important in both samples. Earthquakes related to shale gas is the second most important concern to Chinese respondents but a lesser concern to US respondents. We argue that the results are consistent with risk experiences, a variety of socio-cultural theories, and differences in media coverage in the two countries. Future work should examine how public perceptions in the two countries change over time, and how the stances of environmental groups, government, and industry may influence public opinion. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This essay analyses the French film 120 BPM (Campillo 2017) in relation to its aesthetics and critical reception in the context of scientific advances in human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) therapy, as well as revised socio-cultural attitudes towards, and political strategies for dealing with, the disease. It argues that the treatment trajectory of the virus has been paralleled by a transition in the way that the disease is both represented and received in media, film, and television. This is because advances in therapy and understanding of the disease now render it much less threatening, and, although AIDS remains a serious public health concern in certain regions, public attitudes towards the virus have correspondingly shifted. Such a refocusing reverberates in the visual style of 120 BPM, particularly its cinematography and framing, which consistently positions the spectator amidst the HIV/AIDS community. Although the film focuses on a period in the 1990s when survival rates were still low and death rates rising, it was paradoxically released at a time of relative optimism regarding the prognosis for HIV/AIDS, and thus presents a more upbeat narrative that achieved widespread critical acclaim. © 2021 Association for the Study of Modern & Contemporary France.

AB  - With the growing rise of Islamophobia in Canada, this study looks at Muslim women's experiences of Islamophobia, how they are impacted and how they respond to Islamophobia in the Canadian context. It also explores how Muslim women feel about being Muslim in Canada in relation to their identities. This study was conducted through individual semi-structured interviews with five Muslim women in the greater Toronto area. Findings from this study reveal how Muslim women experience a hypervisibility of their Muslim identity and how this shapes the way they regulate themselves in public. Muslim women in this study speak about how they are seen as Un-Canadian by others and share about the community-wide impacts of Islamophobia. Findings from this study demonstrate how Muslim women respond to Islamophobia in several different ways including activism, spreading awareness in the media and connecting more with the larger community. A key finding of this study includes how Muslim women describe their resilience and continue to persevere in the face of Islamophobia, thereby generating counter-narratives to dominant stereotypical tropes. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Social Media Networks have developed into an important channel and platform for the collection and dissemination of policy information. Various policy comments on them have fully demonstrated the basic characteristics of big data. This paper introduces knowledge graphs into the sentiment analysis, analyses and sorts out the policy comments of China's mainstream social media platforms from 2016 to 2019, build a sentiment analysis dictionary, and then use the policy comments evaluation system to form sentiment knowledge graphs of policy comments that includes seven sentiments and five themes. The process of the sentiment knowledge graph constructed in this paper helps to more accurately understand the changes of online public opinion, and provides a theoretical basis for local governments to adjust the implementation of various policies. Apart from being the prototype of the automated sentiment knowledge graph system for policy comments, it can also be applied to other related hot topics. © Operational Research Society 2021.

AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - A gap exists in the research on how online media frame a tourism crisis and the effects on travel intentions. This research proposed a basic crisis frames model for public online communications including nature (N), causes (C), processes (P), and results (R). Chinese online public opinions on the Thailand drownings in 2018 were collected and the Vector Auto-Regressive (VAR) technique explored the responses within the data. The results showed that: (1) crisis frames had a dynamic impact on negative travel intentions, and the effects and variance contributions of frames differed; (2) disturbance information produced by a negative communication incident from the destination was a factor promoting the accumulation of online public opinion; and (3) online data of public opinion and the VAR model are appropriate for research on tourism crisis information communication. This research provides new insights and a method for investigating tourism crises and dynamic responses in online communication. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background and aims: Diabetes as a lifestyle disorder could be effectively managed by creating awareness among people through social media. Understanding the content of Twitter messages will aid in strategizing health communication about diabetes to the community through Twitter. This study aimed to analyze the content, sentiment, and reachability of diabetes related tweets posted in India. Methods: Diabetes related messages from India were collected via Twitter's Application Programming Interface for April 2019. Themes and subthemes of tweet content were identified from randomly selected tweets. The tweets were coded as the source, themes, and subthemes manually. Sentiment analysis of the tweets was done by a lexicon-based approach. The reachability of tweets was assessed based on re-tweet and favorite counts. Results: Out of 1840 tweets, 57.28% were from organizations and 42.72% were from individuals. The largest proportion of tweet messages were informative (50.76%), followed by promotional tweets (21.52%). The largest proportion of tweets were positive (40.4%) followed by neutral (31.14%) tweets. Among the six major themes, the diabetes story had the highest reachability. Conclusions: The outcome of this study would aid public health professionals in planning information dissemination and communication regarding diabetes on Twitter so that the right information reaches a wider population. © 2021 Diabetes India

AB  - To what extent do perceptions of public opinion effect individual support and political participation in political action? To what extent might media use moderate the role of public opinion in predicting political participation in the digital age? This study investigates these questions by analysing unique data from an experiment and a representative survey designed and conducted at the height of the summer 2011 protests in Israel. This study offers a new analytical model for studying activism by independently and simultaneously examining the direct and indirect effects of perceptions of majority support, individual support and media use on political behaviour. The experimental results suggest that perceptions of public opinion and media use did affect participation in the 2011 social movement. Specifically, increased perception of majority support for the movement led to increased rates of participation. Moreover, media use was inconsequential among those respondents who perceived that a majority of the public supported the protest. Digital media had a moderate effect on the association between perceptions and support for the protest movement, but there was no such effect with respect to mainstream media use. The findings provide new empirical insight into the effects of perceptions of public opinion and media use on political behaviour. In doing so, they help to explain the development of mass protest movements in the digital age and especially the potential effect of perceptions and media use in promoting the evolution of social movements as well as involvement in collective action in the digital age. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As the energy industry became one of the most important aspects in our society, many nations took significant efforts toward energy policies and plans reflecting on public perceptions of energy issues. To efficiently address it, the current study collects user-created contents in social networking services and proposes a new word network model for swiftly observing public perceptions regarding energy issues. The results indicate that the proposed model and employed methodologies can successfully address public perceptions regarding specific energy issues. Based on the results of the network model and comparison with traditional media channels in this study, we found that social networking services can be one of the notable resources for exploring public perceptions of specific energy issues. In particular, although the majority of energy-related issues were presented and reported by traditional media channels and responded by social networking services, social networking services can show faster responsiveness than traditional media channels regarding several energy issues, which were crucially related to economic (cost) or accident-related events, and categorized as energy-related threats or burdens. This means that the public can immediately respond to specific energy-related issues that may directly affect an individual's situation or environment compared to more general and international energy issues. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - Social media have shown great potential for producing significant changes in behavior and have become the cornerstone for many public health and agency efforts. The nonprofit sector -including blood collection agencies- has adopted social media to aid their cause and reach their goals. However, despite the tremendous impact of social media on society and its promising role for donor recruitment and retention, it has been overlooked in donor research. This study therefore sought to map the social media landscape around blood donation. We showcase an inductive computational method to make sense of vast amounts of dynamic unstructured blood donation text data that exists on social media. With this method, we display what is discussed about blood donation on social media, how these topics are distributed on Facebook and Twitter, and how the prevalence of these topics changes over time. We applied structural topic modeling on 7 years of Dutch blood donation Facebook and Twitter data by the general public. We found 25 topics clustered in 6 distinct clusters. Over time, there is a substantial reduction of messages in which donors announce their donations. Topics that emphasize the positives of blood donation, including donor identity-related topics, are rising. In addition, the findings show a clear social media platform contrast. Topics related to campaigns and controversial policies were found more on Twitter and positive donation topics and topics related to the donation process more on Facebook. To make optimal use of social media for recruitment and retention campaigns and efforts, blood collection agencies should recognize the turbulent environment in which they take place. Monitoring public opinions about blood donation will help blood collection agencies make strategic choices and utilize social media more effectively. © 2021 The Authors

AB  - The land application of biosolids can be subject to questions and concerns, suggesting a gap exists with public perception of biosolids. There is opposition amongst a segment of the population regarding the land application of biosolids in the Southern Interior of British Columbia in Canada. Kamloops and Merritt communities were assessed through a mailout survey to understand better public perceptions of biosolids risks and factors that influence attitudes towards biosolids management. Two thousand surveys were distributed proportionately between the communities. Response rates for Kamloops and Merritt were 22 and 24 percent, respectively. Kamloops and Merritt respondents generally identified differing risk perceptions around biosolids management. Kamloops respondents relative to Merritt were more accepting of the risks associated with biosolids. This acceptance is a likely result of Merritt residents’ recent experience with application sites and proximity to biosolids projects, and the associated negative local media attention. Results from Kamloops highlighted that there is general support to find a productive use of biosolids. This research supports the notion that the ‘beyond compliance’ approach of conducting early engagement to obtain community support proactively may be valuable for any potentially controversial natural resource project, such as with biosolids land application projects. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Various forms of bias exist in medicine, including race, gender, age, socioeconomic status, and weight bias. Weight bias has not received as much attention in the literature as other forms of bias. More often when discussing weight bias, the discussion is with regard to physician to patient bias, or patient to physician. In this article, we summarize the study performed by McLean et al. as well as the podcast and discussion, and social media commentary, in which the investigators evaluate the presence of physician to physician weight bias. © 2021 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine

AB  - Analysis of public opinion, news consumption, and social media has examined increasing political polarization and/or partisan sorting; however, few have explored the potential connection between entertainment programming and political sorting. This paper examines viewership of U.S. television entertainment from 2001 to 2016 and finds increasing differentiation in the shows watched in primarily Democratic versus primarily Republican markets. Notably, these years coincide with partisan sorting in news consumption and enhanced fracturing of the U.S. television landscape. The article confirms growing differences in the most-watched shows in heavily Democratic versus Republican regions, a finding that provides uncommon evidence of suspected differentiation by political view and of the need to adapt theories of the “mass” media function of entertainment television to a context of greater fragmentation and choice. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In the period of Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), millions of people participate in the discussion of COVID-19 on the Internet, which can easily trigger public opinion and threaten social stability. This paper creatively proposes a multi-stage risk grading model of Internet public opinion for public health emergencies. On the basis of general public opinion risk grading analysis, the model continuously pays attention to the risk level of Internet public opinion based on the time scale of regular or major information updates. This model combines Analytic Hierarchy Process Sort II (AHPSort II) and Swing Weighting (SW) methods and proposes a new Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) method – AHPSort II-SW. Intuitionistic fuzzy number and linguistic fuzzy number are introduced into the model to evaluate the criteria that cannot be quantified. The multi-stage model is tested using more than 2,000 textual data about COVID-19 collected from Microblog, a leading social media platform in China. Seven public opinion risk assessments were conducted from January 23 to April 8, 2020. The empirical results show that in the early COVID-19 outbreak, the risk of public opinion is more serious on macroscopic view. In details, the risk of public opinion decreases slowly with time, but the emergence of important events may still increase the risk of public opinion. The analysis results are in line with the actual situation and verify the effectiveness of the method. Comparative analysis indicates the improved method is proved to be superior and effective, sensitivity analysis confirms its stability. Finally, management suggestions was provided, this study contributes to the literature on public opinion risk assessment and provides implications for practice. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Growing concern about the climate crisis comes with increased scrutiny of flying as an emission-intensive activity. This study conceptualises a modern communication system and draws on social media data to examine pre-COVID-19 (September to December 2019) public conversations about aviation and climate change. The analysis of >326,000 Twitter posts reveals that issue salience can be considerable at times, especially during key events such as United Nation climate summits and for users from countries such as Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, France and Spain. Topic modelling identified five key frames: economy and industry, public opinion, fairness and conflict, consequences and responsibility. The fairness and conflict frame recorded the largest number of tweets, and was noteworthy for its negative sentiment. It also had the highest retweet rate and the densest network in terms of average users per community. The responsibility frame was interesting for its positive sentiment, and perhaps the opportunity for aviation stakeholders to contribute proactively to the conversations by sharing climate action success stories. Given the importance of public opinion (voters and consumers), and the link between media activity and policy decisions, the ongoing monitoring of issue salience, frames and peer groups related to flying and climate change seems beneficial. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper investigates the role of crucial technological and social factors in enhancing or undermining vaccine coverage rates at the country level worldwide. Employing five country-level databases, it explores how different combinations of technology diffusion (that is, social media penetration) and social conditions (functional literacy and attitude toward science) affect the level of vaccine coverage. The analyses are based on two built ad-hoc longitudinal datasets of 36 and 40 countries worldwide, employing a fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fs-QCA) approach. The findings highlight that, at the country level, the absence of high social media penetration, combined with an above-average level of functional literacy and positive attitude toward science, enable vaccine coverage to reach the level recommended by health institutions and authorities. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - People living with mental illnesses and their families may conceal their conditions to avoid prejudice and discrimination. Stigma often prevents people from receiving adequate health care and other social support services which could exacerbate social and health consequences such as unemployment, homelessness, substance use, and compulsory hospitalization. In this paper, we discuss social contact as a promising anti-stigma strategy for enhancing social interactions among people with mental illnesses, their families, and those without mental illnesses. In particularly, we consider next steps for an approach that works to reduce the stigma-related burden of mental illness. For social contact to be effective in reducing mental illness stigma, it requires broad social buy-in as well as implementation within care systems. Engagement with this approach can be driven through diverse contact-based education using collaborative efforts of society, academic institutions, policy-makers, health professionals, media, and governments. Ultimately, this work aims to consider the next steps in enacting social contact as an anti-stigma strategy through direct interventions and contact-based education. The success of this approach requires pragmatic public policies to support its implementation. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Women are often depicted as sex objects rather than as human beings in the media (e.g., magazines, television programs, films, and video games). Theoretically, media depictions of females as sex objects could lead to negative attitudes and even aggressive behavior toward them in the real world. Using the General Aggression Model (Anderson & Bushman, 2002) as a theoretical framework, this meta-analytic review synthesizes the literature on the effects of sexualized media (both violent and nonviolent) on aggression-related thoughts, attitudes, and behaviors. Our sample includes 166 independent studies involving 124,236 participants, which yielded 321 independent effects. Overall, the effects were “small” to “moderate” in size (r =.16 [.14–.18]). Significant correlations were found in experimental, cross-sectional, and longitudinal studies, indicating a triangulation of evidence. Effects were stronger for violent sexualized media (r =.25 [.19–.31]) than for nonviolent sexualized media (r =.15 [.13–.17]), although the effects of nonviolent sexualized media were still significant and nontrivial in size. Moreover, the effects of violent sexualized media on aggression were greater than the effects of violent non-sexualized media on aggression obtained in previous meta-analyses. Effects were similar for male and female participants, for college students and non-students, and for participants of all ages. The effects were also stable over time. Sensitivity analyses found that effects were not unduly influenced by publication bias and/or outliers. In summary, exposure to sexualized media content, especially in combination with violence, has negative effects on women, particularly on what people think about them and how aggressively they treat them. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Adopting the Critical Discourse Analysis perspective, this study investigates the ideology reflected by the anti-Islam and anti-Muslim discourse in China, the power dynamics revealed by such discourse and how social media discourse differs from and utilises the government discourse. Four ways to disguise the anti-Muslims, anti-Islam prejudice are investigated: appealing to patriotism to demand cultural assimilation; claiming to defend secularism; framing Islam as incompatible with mainstream culture; appealing to consumer rights to reject halal food. Non-Muslims and assimilated Muslims (especially the elites) are found to have the prerogative to dictate who belong to the ingroup, what dietary restrictions are legitimate and whom to blame when undesirable situations arise, while Muslim non-elites are at the receiving end of such dictates. This study also argues that social media discourse expresses antagonism of higher intensity than the government discourse does, and may misappropriate the official narratives to express the interlocutor’s hatred towards Muslims. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significantly negative impact on public sentiment, which has resulted in panic and some irrational buying behavior, which in turn has had a complex impact on agricultural product prices. This study quantified online negative sentiment using micro-blog text mining and a time-varying parameter vector autoregressive model (TVP-VAR) to empirically analyze the dynamic impact of negative public emotions on agricultural product prices during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. It was found that the online negative sentiment impacted agricultural products prices during COVID-19 and had significant time-varying, lag, and life cycle characteristics, with the responses being most significant in the spread and recession periods. Differences were found in the price responses for different agricultural products and in different risk areas. The online negative sentiment was found to have the greatest impact on vegetable prices, with livestock products and vegetable prices being mainly positively impacted, fruit prices being mainly negatively impacted, and aquatic product prices being negatively impacted in the early stage and positively impacted in the middle and late stages. The online negative sentiment had the greatest impact on medium-risk area agricultural product prices, followed by low-risk areas, with the lowest impact found on the high-risk area agricultural product prices. Three policy suggestions for epidemic monitoring, public opinion guidance and control, and the timely release of agricultural product information are given based on the results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Facing the COVID-19 pandemic, governments have implemented a wide range of policies to contain the spread of the virus. During the pandemic, large amounts of COVID-19-related tweets emerge every day. Real-time processing of daily tweets may offer insights for monitoring public opinion about intervention measures implemented. In this work, lockdown policy in New York State has been set as a target of public opinion research. This task includes two stages, stance detection and opinion monitoring. For the stance detection stage, we explored several combinations of different text representations and classification algorithms, finding that the combination of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) with Global Vectors for Word Representation (GloVe) outperforms others. Due to the shortage of labeled data, we adopted the data distillation method for the training data augmentation. The augmentation of the training data allows to improve the performance of the model with a very small amount of manually-labeled data. After applying the distillation method, the accuracy of the model has been significantly improved. Utilizing the enhanced model, automatically classified tweets are analyzed over time to monitor the public opinion. By exploring the tweets in New York from January 22nd until September 30th, 2020, we show the correlation of public opinion with COVID-19 cases and mortality data, and the effect of government responses on the opinion shift. These results demonstrate the capability of the presented method to effectively and efficiently monitor public opinion during a pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The news media can reflect and influence public opinion, as well as affect individual practice. In the context of significant changes in alcohol consumption among young people over the past twenty years, we examined Australian newspaper reporting of young people (under 18 years) and alcohol to assess whether there have been changes over time in the content and slant of articles that reflect or elucidate these trends. Methods: Factiva was used to search newspaper articles from major Australian newspapers over a twenty year period (2000–2019). After screening, two researchers coded 2415 newspaper articles across four key domains: article type, article theme, sources cited and topic slant (e.g. approving, disapproving tone). Change over time across the study period was assessed using joinpoint Poisson regression analyses. Results: There was a significant increase in articles on young people and alcohol between 2000 and 2008, before a corresponding decrease to 2019. Policy or prevention strategies were the most common theme of articles (35.8%), followed by articles reporting on risks or harms associated with alcohol use for young people (18.1%). Researchers were the most common source reported (25.1%), followed by politicians (19.0%). Three quarters of articles (75.9%) had a socially disapproving topic slant, which increased significantly up until 2011, with a corresponding decrease thereafter. Conclusion: Attention to, and problematisation of, young people and alcohol increased in the first decade of this millennium which may have acted to sustain or accelerate declining drinking trends. However, this dissipated back to baseline levels in the second decade, which may indicate a lag time in recognition of young people's drinking becoming less of a public health ‘problem’. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Announced in 2013 and since then dubbed a game-changer, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a multifaceted project that holds the potential to influence Pakistan’s state and society. This paper examines, in particular, the CPEC’s potential to expand Chinese soft power to win Pakistanis’ hearts and minds. It focuses on what I term the ‘soft end’ of China’s soft power to offer a case study of the country’s use of higher education as a soft power instrument. To demonstrate Beijing’s practices in this regard and shed light on how they are received by the Pakistani government and the public, I draw on selected academic literature triangulated with primary sources such as public opinion polls, media and semi-structured interviews with Pakistani academics and graduates. This case study exposes the non-material aspects of China’s international connectivity and thereby contributes to understanding China’s growing role in South Asia and beyond. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In this article, we systematically assess how recent political communication scholarship has empirically demonstrated the interactions of the three main actors: elites, citizens and media. We found that research has focused overwhelmingly on within-actor relationships involving citizens, to the exclusion of elites and media, and concentrated mostly on micro-level processes. Most inter-actor relationships also tended to be moderated than mediated, implying the nature of findings as more exploratory and conditional than confirmatory and causal, and that cases were overdrawn from Western countries. In discussing possible reasons and implications for these findings, we call on scholars to move beyond studying micro-processes related to citizens' cognitions, attitudes, and behaviors, and explicitly anchor them to higher-level societal ramifications; incorporate the investigation of causal processes of inter-actor relationships; and make concrete affirmative actions to de-Westernize political communication research. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Motivation: The public needs to be better informed on the reasons for providing aid, especially that which supports the Sustainable Development Goals. How aid is framed by donors directly affects levels of public support. Purpose: The article investigates support for aid among English-speaking Canadians, and how this varies by the framing of aid spending, socioeconomic markers, personal values and political engagement. Approach and methods: Statistical analysis is undertaken of data from a representative survey of English-speaking Canadians on their knowledge and attitudes with respect to aid to developing countries. A particular focus of the analysis is the influence of the framing of aid spending on public support for aid spending, while controlling for the influence of socioeconomic factors. Findings: Support for increased spending rises when spending is framed relative to the size of the economy, whether in dollar or percentage terms, rather than when framed relative to government taxation or spending. Providing information on the current level of aid spending also raises support for increased aid spending. Overall, when informed about the level of aid spending, most respondents support maintaining or increasing aid. Views on aid vary little by age, education and other socioeconomic markers. People’s values, however, did affect support for aid. Respondents who believe in “Canada first” were considerably more likely to support aid cuts than others. Those who see kindness as part of Canadian identity tend to favour aid, while those who see economic prosperity as part of national identity tend to want aid cuts. While voting intention does not affect views on aid, respondents who have been either politically active or involved in collective action on media/social media are a little more likely to favour increased aid. Policy implications: The findings confirm the importance of the framing of aid spending for designing and implementing programmes to inform, engage and elicit support from the public. Given how values influence public support for aid, engagement needs to be tailored to different target audiences. © 2021 Overseas Development Institute.

AB  - Politics in the current era are replete with unreliable media stories which lack evidence, sometimes disparagingly dubbed “fake news”. A survey on a sample of Muslims in Indonesia (N = 518) in this work found that participants’ endorsement of collective action in of support issues with little to no empirical evidence (i.e., post-truth collective action) increased as a function of their belief in fake news and prejudice against the outgroup (i.e., non-Muslims). Belief in fake news stemmed from participants’ generic and specific conspiratorial thinking, whereas prejudice was positively predicted by relative Muslim prototypicality, denoting how much Muslims in Indonesia view that their group is more representative than non-Muslims of the superordinate Indonesian identity that encompasses both groups. Additionally, our findings revealed that generic conspiratorial thinking and relative Muslim prototypicality were positively predicted by collective narcissism, which in turn spurred participants’ support for collective action by augmenting belief in fake news. © 2021 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Whilst domestic violence against women receives significant international attention and prominence within the scholarly, media and policy discourses, much silence and reservation is evident in the case of domestic violence against men by women. The dominant societal notion portrays women as the natural victims and men as perpetrators, making it challenging to contextualize men’s experiences of domestic violence in the intimate relationship. Against this backdrop, using Bangladesh as a case study, this article highlights key factors contributing to the silences, subjugations and controversies associated with domestic violence against men in order to present the state of current knowledge for such violence. Currently, there is a paucity of scholarly information on domestic violence against men and policy, legal and social supports available for these victims require attention. It is thus, suggested to break the social prejudice associated with such violence and adopt appropriate policy and legal interventions including gender-neutral laws to protect men at home from violence perpetrated by women. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper examines the role of social media as a public sphere during the Algerian protests. A survey method was used on a randomly selected sample of social media users in Algeria. Findings showed that social media outlets were an alternative to traditional media, civil societies and opposition political parties. Furthermore, social media played an effective role in pulling people out of the spiral of silence and got them into the spiral of expression by a new perspective of explaining the mechanisms of social media influence in forming public opinion in exceptional circumstances when fear of isolation and conformity were no longer factors. Results also showed that social media expanded political participation and promoted democracy and freedom of expression in Algeria. © 2021 World Communication Association.

AB  - Public campaigns debating the rights of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex, and Queer (LGBTIQ) individuals to be treated as equal under the law highlight stigma and prejudice harmful to health and well-being. Previous research documenting the negative effects of political campaigns on LGBTIQ people’s health and well-being has largely left unexplored the effects on their families and allies. The present study analyzed open-ended responses of the parent allies of LGBTIQ people (N = 232) to questions about the effects of the public debate during the 2017 Australian Marriage Law postal survey. Parents expressed some positive experiences of connection to other supporters of marriage equality. Parents also reported many negative emotions and experiences. The debates increased their awareness of prejudice and discrimination targeting their children and made them fearful for their own and their children’s safety. Parents reported negative impacts on some interpersonal relationships with friends, family members, co-workers, and other community members. They expressed feelings of alienation and anger toward the government, media, and religious institutions for fostering anti-LGBTIQ prejudice and discrimination. Some parents reported feeling discouraged about society or humanity in general because of the public debate. Findings are discussed in relation to affiliate stigma and parental minority stress, and the need to consider in research and practice the effects of LGBTIQ stigmatization on family systems. © 2021.

AB  - The concept of dual quality of products provided by the same manufacturers is not a novel one, however, the awareness of its existence and implications has only recently been noticed in Europe by the general public. The response of the media was immediate and massive. The reality of what dual quality represents for consumers was largely exaggerated and companies applying such strategies were criticised by public opinions. However, there is a lack of knowledge of how this phenomenon affects changes in buyers’ behaviour and therefore, companies are unable to develop their strategies in accordance with current and believable data. This paper provides information on the relationship between the dual quality of goods and changes in buyers’ behaviour, resulting in developed guidelines and recommendations for international producers on the issue of dual quality and how to incorporate it into their marketing strategies in order to gain competitive advantage. The findings based on research conducted in Slovak Republic include a detailed structure of customer segments and their response to dual quality. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - European integration has been progressing even as support for Eurosceptic parties has been rising. Post-functionalist literature focuses on how public attitudes affect the progress of European integration (bottom-up), but the mechanism through which European integration affects domestic politics (top-down) is underexplored. Extreme parties on either the left or right are known to adopt a Polity-Eurosceptic agenda in order to realign the main domestic political cleavage and turn themselves into the new mainstream. We aim to contribute to this literature by arguing that the timing and type of EU events matter. Specifically, the vote for such Eurosceptified Pariah Parties increase with integration events that have a potential for high media profile, signal reduced state autonomy, and occur in proximity to national elections. Furthermore, we argue that even if mainstream parties may counter Eurosceptified Pariah Parties’ claims, the net effect is to ratchet-up electoral support for the latter. We support this argument by employing a mixed-method design using both a natural experiment approach (UESD for Spain’s 1993 election) and a model-based approach (all parties in 1979–2017 and a new event database). Results are robust to the usual confounders, and the exclusion of different classes of events and opportunistically-timed elections. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Hate Speech and harassment are widespread in online communication, due to users' freedom and anonymity and the lack of regulation provided by social media platforms. Hate speech is topically focused (misogyny, sexism, racism, xenophobia, homophobia, etc.), and each specific manifestation of hate speech targets different vulnerable groups based on characteristics such as gender (misogyny, sexism), ethnicity, race, religion (xenophobia, racism, Islamophobia), sexual orientation (homophobia), and so on. Most automatic hate speech detection approaches cast the problem into a binary classification task without addressing either the topical focus or the target-oriented nature of hate speech. In this paper, we propose to tackle, for the first time, hate speech detection from a multi-target perspective. We leverage manually annotated datasets, to investigate the problem of transferring knowledge from different datasets with different topical focuses and targets. Our contribution is threefold: (1) we explore the ability of hate speech detection models to capture common properties from topic-generic datasets and transfer this knowledge to recognize specific manifestations of hate speech; (2) we experiment with the development of models to detect both topics (racism, xenophobia, sexism, misogyny) and hate speech targets, going beyond standard binary classification, to investigate how to detect hate speech at a finer level of granularity and how to transfer knowledge across different topics and targets; and (3) we study the impact of affective knowledge encoded in sentic computing resources (SenticNet, EmoSenticNet) and in semantically structured hate lexicons (HurtLex) in determining specific manifestations of hate speech. We experimented with different neural models including multitask approaches. Our study shows that: (1) training a model on a combination of several (training sets from several) topic-specific datasets is more effective than training a model on a topic-generic dataset; (2) the multi-task approach outperforms a single-task model when detecting both the hatefulness of a tweet and its topical focus in the context of a multi-label classification approach; and (3) the models incorporating EmoSenticNet emotions, the first level emotions of SenticNet, a blend of SenticNet and EmoSenticNet emotions or affective features based on Hurtlex, obtained the best results. Our results demonstrate that multi-target hate speech detection from existing datasets is feasible, which is a first step towards hate speech detection for a specific topic/target when dedicated annotated data are missing. Moreover, we prove that domain-independent affective knowledge, injected into our models, helps finer-grained hate speech detection. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - This article develops the concept of “mimetic weaponization” for theory-building. Memes recurrently serve as identificatory markers of affiliation across social media platforms, with ensuing controversies potentially proving newsworthy. Our elaboration of weaponization refers to the purposeful deployment of memetic imagery to disrupt, undermine, attack, resist or reappropriate discursive positions pertaining to public affairs issues in the news. For alt-right memetic conflicts, impetuses range from “sharing a joke” to promoting “alternative facts,” rebuking “political correctness” or “wokeness,” defending preferred framings of “free speech,” or signalling cynicism, distrust or dissent with “mainstream” media, amongst other drivers. Of particular import, we argue, is the politics of othering at stake, including in the wider journalistic mediation of a meme’s public significance. Rendering problematic this contested process, this article focuses on Pepe the Frog as an exemplar, showing how and why variations of this mimetic cartoon have been selectively mobilized to help normalize–ostensibly through humour, parody or satire–rules of inclusion and exclusion consistent with hate-led agendas. Digital journalism, we conclude, must improve its capacity to identify and critique mimetic weaponization so as to avoid complicity in perpetuating visceral forms of prejudice and discrimination so often presented as “just a bit of fun.”. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) movement in Hong Kong was marked by a significant degree of tactical radicalisation in its first six months. Yet the movement also succeeded in maintaining a high degree of solidarity and public support. This article explains how tactical radicalisation and public receptiveness toward radical actions was achieved. It does this by drawing upon protest onsite survey data, public opinion poll data, analysis of digital media contents and field observations. Theoretically, it combines a relational approach with an emphasis on the role of discursive negotiation. The article first reconstructs the trend of movement radicalisation in Hong Kong since the late 2000s. It then examines the interactional dynamics that drove the process of radicalisation along multiple pathways during the first six months of the Anti-ELAB movement. The articulation of justifications and discursive negotiation of collective restraints is then examined. Overall, the analysis reconstructs the process of stepwise and constrained radicalisation in the Anti-ELAB movement. General theoretical implications of the analysis are discussed. © 2021 Journal of Contemporary Asia.

AB  - How does local television news shape viewers’ national political attitudes? The answer is unclear, because local news typically focuses on local, not national, stories, and is politically neutral. But the rise of Sinclair Broadcasting, now the nation’s second-largest owner of local TV stations, upends that assumption. News on Sinclair-owned stations focuses more on national topics, and presents them with a right-wing slant. Given this, we might expect it to shift its viewers’ attitudes in a pro-Republican direction. Using data on Sinclair’s acquisition of local TV stations between 2008 and 2018, I show that living in an area with a Sinclair-owned TV station lowers viewers’ approval of President Obama during his tenure in office, and makes viewers less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee for president. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of local TV news, as well as for media trust, as I discuss in the conclusion. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

What are the predominant issues that attract the attention of European print media? Does Europe detest Donald Trump? The objective of the present study is to analyze the perception European commentators had of the 2020 race for the White House. The media, the audience, and European governments were captivated more than ever before by how the U.S. election campaign unfolded, fixing their gaze on the contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Through a combined quantitative and qualitative methodology, a combination of content analysis and the application of framing theory (hitherto scarcely applied to opinion pieces), our research centers on exploring the views, opinions, and analyses published in eight leading newspapers from four European countries (France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) as expressed in their editorials and opinion articles. This study observes how the televised presidential debates were commented on, interpreted, and assessed by commentators from the eight newspapers we selected. The goal was to identify the common issues and frames that affected European public opinion on the U.S. presidential campaign and the aspirants to the White House. © 2021 SAGE Publications.

AB  - Though race is complex in lived experience, studies of anti-Black prejudice and discrimination in the United States often elide this complexity by operationalizing “Black” using one racial marker. We consider how three intersecting markers–skin colour, names, and gender–predict white people’s anti-Black prejudice. Using two experiments where white participants evaluated fictitious job applicants, we randomly manipulated the applicant’s name (distinctly Black or indistinctly Black) and race/skin colour (white, lighter-skinned Black, medium-skinned Black, or darker-skinned Black). We predicted that when women and men targets had distinctly Black names or darker skin, they would be rated more negatively. Results suggest gendered colorism via salary recommendations, where participants offered a darker-skinned man with a distinctly Black name less salary. However, a darker-skinned woman with a distinctly Black name was offered more salary. We argue that anti-Black prejudice may take on nuanced and gendered forms in the twenty-first century. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objectives The purpose of this qualitative study was to utilize the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation - Behavior model (COM-B) to: (1) evaluate athlete knowledge and understanding of current asthma-related anti-doping regulations, (2) explore the impact of environmental and societal influences on athletes with asthma, and (3) examine athlete perception of asthma medication use in competitive sport.Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with ten competitive endurance athletes (five athletes with asthma and five without asthma). Interviews were guided by the COM-B model and transcripts were analyzed inductively and deductively using reflexive thematic analysis.Results: Mapping the experiences and perceptions of athletes against an established behavioral framework identified that: (1) athletes’ possess limited knowledge and understanding of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Prohibited List and Therapeutic use exemption (TUE) policy with respect to asthma medication; (2) the use of sub-optimal diagnostic methods is commonplace and increases the risk of misdiagnosis and unnecessary inhaler therapy; (3) negative media portrayal of high-profile asthma-related doping allegations impacts public opinion and contributes to the perception of wrongdoing within the sporting community.Conclusion: The novel application of behavioral science highlights several factors that may contribute to asthma medication avoidance and promote misuse in competitive sport. The findings from this study provide a foundation for the development and implementation of targeted education programmes, and it is hoped that employing this approach will ultimately improve overall perceptions of asthma treatment in athletes, which is necessary to maintain respiratory health, optimize performance and protect the integrity of sport. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Far-right actors are often purveyors of Islamophobic hate speech online, using social media to spread divisive and prejudiced messages which can stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Hateful content can inflict harm on targeted victims, create a sense of fear amongst communities and stir up intergroup tensions and conflict. Accordingly, there is a pressing need to better understand at a granular level how Islamophobia manifests online and who produces it. We investigate the dynamics of Islamophobia amongst followers of a prominent UK far right political party on Twitter, the British National Party. Analysing a new data set of five million tweets, collected over a period of one year, using a machine learning classifier and latent Markov modelling, we identify seven types of Islamophobic far right actors, capturing qualitative, quantitative and temporal differences in their behaviour. Notably, we show that a small number of users are responsible for most of the Islamophobia that we observe. We then discuss the policy implications of this typology in the context of social media regulation. © 2021 Department of Security Studies and Criminology.

AB  - Individuals’ psychological processes during emergencies are critical to the understanding of social media user reactions. However, previous studies have paid little attention to the influence of psychological processes on information dissemination behaviours. To provide authorities with a better understanding of dissemination behaviours from the perspective of psychological language use, we used the Stimulus–Organism–Response (S-O-R) and dual-process models to analyze the effect of words expressing severity and susceptibility on the dissemination behaviours of Weibo users during the avian influenza epidemic. We also explored the mediating effects of emotional responses on the relationship between cognitive responses and dissemination behaviours. The results show that words expressing severity and susceptibility significantly affected the cognitive and emotional responses of users. Weibo user perception and cognition, positive and negative emotions significantly and positively affected their dissemination behaviours. Positive and negative emotions played a partial mediating role in perception responses, cognitive responses, and dissemination behaviours. These findings may assist governments or emergency management departments to effectively control and guide public opinion. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Public corruption appears ubiquitous and increasing in the last few decades, according to public opinion polls. Trials and convictions of public officials usually receive extensive media attention. It is expected that high profile convictions would reduce corruption in an area as it puts individuals on notice about such behavior. Selected US Attorneys’ offices appear to account for the majority of public corruption convictions. This study examines the public corruption conviction rate for all 94 US Attorneys’ offices in the US. Using 52 interviews with community stakeholders, former public officials, former prosecutors, and investigators, the nature of corrupt environments is examined to find aspects of a jurisdiction that encourage or inhibit corrupt behaviors. According to interviews, local history and culture, leadership and contagion, and watchdog/oversight activity impact the culture of corruption. Leadership is a double-edged sword. Leadership can both encourage corruption and curb it. Prosecutions may serve a purpose to hold corrupt officials accountable; it does not stem the tide of corrupt cultures. © 2021 American Society for Public Administration.

AB  - In this article, I explore the intersection between Hans Georg Gadamer’s ‘fusion of horizons’ and interpreter’s ‘prejudices,’ together with the concept of cultural resonances as they pertain to qualitative research in psychology. I define cultural resonances as the researcher’s different cultural associations and/or connotations (e.g., myths, legends, popular media references), that emerge in an interpretive encounter with a text. Through a reading of Gadamer’s theory, I further explain how cultural resonances are contained within what he referred to as the interpreter’s language, prejudice, horizon, and play. Therefore, inspired by Gadamer’s assertion that understanding is always a process in which different worlds of knowledge (horizons) fuse together, and with reference to psychoanalytic reverie, Boesch’s concepts of cultural psychology, and narrative theory, I discuss cultural resonances as a horizon that inevitably unfolds in qualitative research. Finally, relying on the different topics discussed in the article, I offer a Gadamer-inspired framework for using cultural resonances in qualitative interpretation. The limitations of this framework, as well as its advantages, are discussed, with regard to reflexivity, power, rigor, and cultural sensitivity. © 2020 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The focus of this article is to explain the outcome of Pakistan’s 2018 Election, which is only the second successful transfer of power from one civilian government to another after completing a full five-year term. The PTI (Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaaf) emerged victorious with a greater majority than was predicted, soundly defeating the incumbent ruling party PML-N (Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz). We question why an incumbent governing party that had been delivering on its campaign promises and was generally perceived to be performing well lost the election to PTI, a newer and more inexperienced party. We make a nested argument in this paper: had an uneven playing field not been created in the pre-poll phase due to reported interference by the military and the media in the formation of public opinion, so-called electables would not have defected to the PTI in large numbers. It is in the context of this broader political environment that PTI’s electoral strategy to accept these defecting politicians and select them as candidates paid-off, earning the party an electoral majority. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The objective behind the present article is two-fold. Firstly, departing from the assumption that distance and salience dynamics are key to both functioning and impact of the media, we aim to present a new theoretical perspective on social media discourse understood as both product and process–Media Proximization Approach–and thus shed light on the exploratory potential of Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS) paradigm (KhosraviNik, 2017b. Social Media Critical Discourse Studies (SM-CDS). In J. Flowerdew, & J. E. Richardson (Eds.), Handbook of Critical Discourse Analysis (pp. 583–596). Routledge) emphasizing both the horizontal (industrial) and vertical (social) dimensions of digital communication. Secondly, identifying various dimensions of proximization within social media, we will discuss their role in creating a conducive environment for the spread of populist ideologies, and, more generally, changing the communication dynamics between the primary and secondary definers. Data-wise, the article focuses on current social media discursive practices concerning Enoch Powell’s ‘Rivers of Blood’ speech in the context of rising anti-immigration sentiment and Brexit campaign. Two YouTube videos recontextualizing the speech along with the accompanying comments will be discussed here to show how political discourses get remediated in social media where their ‘prosumers’ imbue them with new form, function and emotionality. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The 2012 gangrape of a young woman in Delhi, known as the Nirbhaya case, became an international media event that cast public spaces in India as unsafe, and situated sexual violence as a problem characterized by class difference and lack of development. This dominant media discourse reiterated long-standing neocolonial, classist and casteist tropes that signified a failure of transnational solidarity. At this time, Talk to Me, a public art intervention by the Bangalore-based feminist artist collective, Blank Noise, went viral on social media. The project took place near the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology on a lane along which many women experience molestation and harassment. Students from Srishti engaged strangers–typically migrant and displaced men from the lower classes–in a conversation over tea and a snack. In this article, I analyse Talk to Me as an intervention that offered a counternarrative and countervisual to the dominant, fear-based characterization of public spaces in India. Talk to Me encouraged participants, through a process of dialogue and conversation, to identify and overcome their internalized biases about the lower-class, migrant men who are often constructed as sexual threats to upper-class women. These conversations, I argue, were designed to break down ingrained biases and internalized prejudice, and to attempt to create compassion and solidarity across the barriers of class, education, language, and gender. The intervention offers a model of building solidarity that is not passive or automatic, but rather requires the difficult and often uncomfortable labour of self-reflection and introspection. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The sociological, group-based factors of public opinion formation are often omitted from models of public opinion that rely on survey methodology. This study employs social identity theory and focus group interview technique to demonstrate the value-added from an alternative approach to the issue of opinion formation in authoritarian regimes. The empirical focus is on public opinion in post-Crimea Russia. The focus group interviews conducted in 2016 in two Russian cities reveal the effects of national identity salience and the implications of “depersonalized” political opinion formation in post-Crimea Russia. The study speaks to the increasing repertoire of legitimation mechanisms that modern, “informational” autocrats can rely on in the context of controlled media and public sphere. © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article examines how artists have engaged with the issue of air pollution in Beijing, where poor air quality has become a serious public health matter. Artists have utilized various mediums including performance art, photography, and painting to represent smog. Through generating media and online attention this work has contributed to a relatively vibrant “green public sphere” (Yang and Calhoun, 2007) of air pollution discourse. In contrast to much resistance in China that relies upon making specific claims to government officials, artistic expression bypasses the authorities and appeals instead to public opinion. Artists utilize ambiguity to portray air pollution in novel ways that subtly question the structures that produce and sustain it. In this way, artists can challenge popular perceptions of smog and raise public awareness, thus intensifying support for policies that tackle smog. Yet art can also embody deep frustration at the powerlessness that artists, and the public more widely, experience when confronted by severe air pollution. Art therefore serves both as a form of activism and as an expression of curtailed agency in a politically restrictive environment. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study analyzes media coverage of Census Bureau projections showing that the U.S. will become a majority-minority state by mid-century. I argue that the mismatch between the racial/ethnic categories used by the media in their coverage of Census projections, and the official government categories used by the Census, help construct social boundaries around “whiteness” that allows for growth of minority populations to be presented as a challenge for “American” society. I contend that media portrayals of Census projections can influence public perceptions of the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S., thus impacting political attitudes and voting behavior among the U.S. populace. © 2020 Midwest Sociological Society.

AB  - Social networks are becoming a site of unprecedented diffusion of fake news and misinformation in Morocco. This fact does not only affect people as individuals but also undermines social order and cohesion in general. To fight back, a number of journalists and researchers have engaged in fact-checking processes to verify claims and information. In this regard, this study considers fact-checking as an emerging journalistic brand that has the potential to promote healthier public debate in the contemporary media environment in Morocco. For this reason, a qualitative approach is adopted to explore the nature of a group of Moroccan online fact checkers to understand their motivations, practices, process of production, and the impact they have made in the public sphere. The significance of this research resides in the fact that it tracks a trend in Moroccan media landscape and investigates its importance in creating communities of interest. Also, exploring this new online trend will help in providing a different perspective on the richness and diversity of content, and change how people think about the online media environment in Morocco. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - This article explores the relationship between rumour and public opinion in Japan across the middle decades of the twentieth century. By situating Shimizu Ikutaro’s 1937 theory of rumour as ‘latent public opinion’ in comparative perspective, I show how he articulated an original vision of individual agency in an emergent mass-mediated society characterised by mobilisation, surveillance, and censorship. I then examine how Shimizu's theory acted as a reference point for discussions of rumour across the wartime divide. During the war, state officials drew on Shimizu's work as part of research into the efficacy of efforts to suppress rumourmongering. This ambivalent discourse on rumour provides insight into tensions between obedience and initiative during the mobilisation of the homefront for total war. After the war ended, the legacy of the wartime discourse on rumour was palpable in an undercurrent of skepticism directed toward quantitative approaches to public opinion promoted by the Allied Occupation. This skepticism shaped attitudes toward postwar democracy, leading some progressive intellectuals to turn to the rumours theorised by Shimizu as a possible basis for mobilised resistance against the sway of the mass media during the heyday of postwar protest movements. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The increasing and widespread usage of social media enables the investigation of public preference using the web as a device. Public sentiment as expressed in 44,319 massive open online course (MOOCs) related microblogs from January to December 2017 was examined on Sina Weibo (the Chinese equivalent of Twitter) to obtain broad insight into how MOOCs are viewed by the public in the Chinese educational landscape. Despite the unstable upward trend of public interest in MOOCs over the past 12 months, the public opinion on MOOCs was largely positive. Content and sentiment analyses were conducted to facilitate a better understanding of what is communicated on social media. A general model of public opinions of MOOCs in China has been developed based on the findings. Individuals were classified into a threefold typology based on the sources and purposes of how this recent form of distance education was perceived. Based on the seven themes, the public views towards MOOCs were differentiated among ‘promoters’, ‘commenters’ and ‘experiencers’.Implications of the findings were also discussed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Sparked by a collaboration between academic researchers and science media professionals, this study sought to test three commonly used headline formats that vary based on whether (and, if so, how) important information is left out of a headline to encourage participants to read the corresponding article; these formats are traditionally-formatted headlines, forward-referencing headlines, and question-based headlines. Although headline format did not influence story selection or engagement, it did influence participants evaluations of both the headline's and the story's credibility (question-based headlines were viewed as the least credible). Moreover, individuals’ science curiosity and political views predicted their engagement with environmental stories as well as their views about the credibility of the headline and story. Thus, headline formats appear to play a significant role in audience's perceptions of online news stories, and science news professionals ought to consider the effects different formats have on readers. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - American Olympic athlete and former reality television star Caitlyn Jenner remains a polarising figure in discussions of celebrity culture, transgender visibility, and social activism due to her conservative political views and limited knowledge about the issues non-famous transgender people face in society. Since reintroducing herself as a transgender woman in 2015, Jenner has been framed as a figurehead for transgender activism in mass media due to her avowed intention to disrupt transphobia and Twitter commentary on politics, and equally accused of commodifying her transgender experience for economic gain. Given the many questions surrounding the legitimacy of Jenner’s transgender advocacy and her intentional use of Twitter as a medium to discuss transgender politics, this research conducted a textual analysis of Jenner’s Twitter account, @Caitlyn_Jenner to examine how the transgender celebrity used social media to discuss her lived experiences as a transgender woman and advocate on behalf of the transgender community. The findings supported prior scholarly criticisms of Jenner’s celebrity image, online celebrity activism, and transwomen’s representations in celebrity culture. @Caitlyn_Jenner fostered online social connections and discussions with her transgender followers. However, Jenner did not facilitate any collective social movement actions due to her ideological differences with Republican and transgender communities. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The mediating role of emotional reactions and their relevance for political attitudes and behavioral intentions has remained an understudied subject, and the extant literature has mostly overlooked the importance of political campaigning on social media in the context of the European Union (EU). Using an experimental design, we test whether political parties’ (1) positive or negative EU-related (2) emotional or non-emotional political messages influence citizens’ emotions toward the EU, whether these emotions affect politically relevant outcomes, and whether the effects differ for citizens with varying political ideologies. We find that positive emotions in particular affect almost all outcome variables above and beyond experimental condition and individuals’ political orientation. We discuss our results in light of political marketing research and recent developments in the EU. © 2019 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Even though a certain degree of political bias is unavoidable in the media, strong media bias is likely to have an impact on society, especially on the formation of public opinion. This research proposes a data-driven method for quantifying political bias of media contents. With a document classification technique called doc2vec and social data from Facebook posts, a model for analysing the bias is developed. By applying the model to contents of major South Korean newspapers, this paper demonstrates quantitatively that significant political bias exists in the newspapers in line with the perceived political bias. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Citizens expect local elected and appointed officials to make, implement, and evaluate public policy. In recent years, citizen efforts to increase the number of companion animals leaving U.S. animal shelters alive have received considerable attention from animal welfare advocates, the mainstream media, and policymakers. Among the greatest challenges for urban shelters, where the most unowned, free-roaming cats are found, is how best to manage “community” cats. Three policy options have been identified: eradication, impoundment followed by lethal injection of cats not adopted (sometimes referred to as “trap-and-kill”), and trap-neuter-vaccinate-return (TNVR). Since governments at the state and local level are directly involved in any policy or decision-making strategy to manage community cats, public opinion and taxpayer-funded initiatives are important factors in policy making, especially in light of the recent push for “no-kill” animal shelters (i.e., where live outcomes are provided for 90% or more of the animals entering a facility). © 2020 Urban Affairs Association.

AB  - Since 9/11, representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in Western mass media have received much scholarly attention, not least because such representations influence how Muslims are perceived by and integrated into Western societies. Most existing studies have shown that Muslims and Islam tend to be framed negatively through orientalist and Islamophobic discourses. However, this paper argues that in specific contexts, neoliberal ideology has generated mass-media representations of Muslims and the Islamic world that differ from orientalist versions. In contexts relating to the globalised halal market, for example, neoliberal discourses portray Muslims and the Islamic world as economically useful and/or exploitable rather than culturally threatening. This argument is supported by an analysis of representations of Muslims and the Islamic world in local and regional newspapers in Brazil, one of the largest halal meat and poultry exporters in the world. Drawing on theories of neoliberalism, a discourse theoretical approach and the notion of imaginative geographies, the study examines newspaper articles on the halal business. Based on the findings, this paper suggests that scholars should subject neoliberal ideology (and its interaction with orientalism and Islamophobia) to greater scrutiny in future research on representations of Muslims and the Islamic world. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Aim: There are limited studies conducted to explore the social attitudes towards PWDs in Jordan. The aim of this study was to compare public attitudes towards physical, visual, auditory, and intellectual disabilities in the five components of community-based rehabilitation (CBR) which are, education, health, livelihood, social, and empowerment. Another aim of this study was to explore the effects that the factors of gender, age, educational level and geographical area have on the attitudes towards disability. Methods: 499 participants (210 males and 289 females), mean age (42.7 ± 8.4 yrs), age range (18–65 yrs) completed a survey specifically developed for this study based on the CBR guidelines. Results: A value (0.881) of Cronbach’s alpha confirmed the reliability of the survey. About 64% of the sample had positive perception and attitude towards disability. Participants had more positive attitudes towards physical disabilities followed by auditory, visual, and lastly, intellectual disabilities. The lower scores were in the empowerment and then the social components of CBR. Geographical area was the only factor that affected the attitudes towards disability. Conclusion: Positive attitude towards PWDs that is mainly attributed to cultural components associated with religion and some prevalent traditions in certain geographical areas in Jordan. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - When a mass casualty event occurs, why do some people label it terrorism while others do not? People are more likely to consider an attack to be terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim, yet it is unclear what other factors influence perceptions of mass violence. Using data collected from a national sample of U.S. adults shortly after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, we examine how media consumption and social identity influence views of the attack. Media consumption and individual-level factors—Islamophobia, political ideology, and other participant demographics—influence how people view the attack and how confident people are in their assessments. © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.
