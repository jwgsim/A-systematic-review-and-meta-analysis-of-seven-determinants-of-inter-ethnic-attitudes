AB  - Media portrayals of older people, such as those in newspapers, both inform and reflect public attitudes. By becoming aware of culturally influenced attitudes about older people, and how these attitudes are reflected in the ways older people are viewed, treated, and cared for in society, the healthcare profession can better understand how to provide high-quality care. By applying an ethnographic approach in textual reality, this paper explores how newspaper articles focusing on health portray older people in society, using Finland as an example. The data consist of articles selected from three of the main Finnish daily newspapers during a 3-month period in the spring of 2012. The findings show that, overall, the society regards older people and their care as important. However, there were suggestions of paternalistic attitudes towards older people. Furthermore, the perceptions regarding different groups of older people could lead to the possibility of inequality. The media portrayals of older people worldwide seem to share similarities, although the findings of this study are particularly in accordance with the cultural attributes of the Nordic countries and societies.

AB  - Scholars often study isolated media effects using one method at one time point in one country. We seek to generalise the research in this area by examining hundreds of press-worthy events across dozens of countries at various points in time with an array of techniques and outcome measures. In particular, we merge a database containing thousands of events with five waves of the European Social Survey to conduct analyses across countries and individuals as well as within countries and for specific respondents. The results suggest that there is an impressive degree of heterogeneity when it comes to how citizens react to political developments. Some events generate significant opinion changes when groups of individuals who are 'treated' are compared with 'control' cases. However, other events produce modest or even null findings with methods that employ different counterfactuals. Thus, findings of both strong and weak media effects that scholars have uncovered over the years could be a function of methodological choices as well as context-specific factors such as institutional arrangements, media systems, eras, or event characteristics. Data limitations also make some research designs possible while they preclude others. We conclude with advice for others who wish to study political events in this manner as well as discussion of media effects, broadly construed.

AB  - StyleLikeU is a hugely successful online social media platform that presents itself as a social justice movement related to body acceptance. Presenting moving personal stories, it offers a site for what it calls 'diverse individuals' to share their experiences as part of promoting individual self-acceptance in the face of a world that prioritizes one kind of body over another, which take the form of ableism, racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, ageism, sizeism and prejudice against disfigurement. Drawing out the discursive script carried across the platform, we show how, beneath the rhetoric of progressiveness, social justice becomes a kind of personal therapy, related to empowerment and transformation, which erases actual differences in personal circumstances and the very forces of injustice. We place StyleLikeU into broader scholarly concerns about the neoliberal colonization of identity politics, diversity and intersectionality in institutions and in branding, drawing attention to how this can form one part of what are now presented as social justice movements.

AB  - This study explores how national context moderated change in support for nuclear energy after the Fukushima accident. The following national contextual variables are tested: geographical distance, nuclear energy production status, freedom of the press, and the building of new nuclear reactors. The results illustrate that previous research has misunderstood the moderating role of national context on opinion change after the Fukushima accident. A survey conducted shortly after the accident with more than 23,000 respondents from 41 countries has shown that geographical distance from the accident mattered: Contradicting a previous study, the decrease in support for nuclear energy was stronger in countries closer to Fukushima. In addition, support for nuclear energy decreased more in countries where new nuclear reactors were under construction. The country's nuclear energy production status and press freedom did not determine opinion change after the Fukushima accident. The non-effect of freedom of the press on opinion change contradicts the role of media after a focusing event as described in the literature. Overall results demonstrate a limited effect of national context on opinion change following a focusing event. Hence, national context provides only limited information to policy makers on how to respond to a nuclear accident.

AB  - Objective We propose that citizens navigate an increasingly complex social and political world using a "cultural toolkit" shaped by firearms and gun violence. Young people in particular have experienced more mass shootings than any previous generation and have witnessed a lack of government response to these massacres. This article explores the attitudes that members of the Massacre Generation express about mass shooting prevention. Methods We analyze data from several public opinion surveys conducted following major mass shootings in the United States using ordinary least squares and logistic regression. These surveys were fielded and sponsored by a variety of organizations and asked a nearly identical question about whether mass shootings can be prevented by societal and governmental action. Results We find that the Massacre Generation is indeed more likely to think the government can prevent mass shootings by implementing stricter gun control laws. We find evidence of these attitudes in multiple public opinion surveys from 2012 to 2018. Furthermore, we find no age effect in multiple surveys conducted between 1999 and 2011, suggesting that these attitudes are a relatively new phenomenon. Conclusion Young people today express that government regulation (i.e., stricter gun laws) can prevent gun violence, placing them at odds with older generations. We discuss the implications of our findings for gun policy development and the future of the gun debate.

AB  - Over the last few years, a proliferation of attempts to define, understand and fight the spread of problematic information in contemporary media ecosystems emerged. Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors' collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles ('entities'), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of 'coordinated inauthentic behavior' in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion.

AB  - The rapid development of social media has accelerated the online rumor propagation, making social conflicts more intense during the development of NIMBY facilities. The "fake news" issue is not new, as the consequences will be amplified when the fakery spreads on social media as online rumors. However, few studies have been undertaken on the online public opinion, especially the rumor propagation on NIMBYism. This study collects data related to the anti-PX demonstration in Maoming city in 2014 on the Weibo platform. To form the rumor text library, qualitative research method is adopted to encode the collected data. Based on the social amplification of risk framework, three sub-frameworks are proposed in this study and statistical method is used to analyze the topics of rumors. Meanwhile, the textual content analysis and impact factor analysis is employed to examine the semantic features of rumor texts and the key role of rumor-mongers respectively. The results show that there are three main propagation lifecycles of rumors while the topics of rumors vary according to the cycle. Rumors belonging to each framework have diverse trend and the assessment framework is dominant throughout the process. "Individuals" and "Elites" are the main force of rumor spreading, and "Media practitioners" are the opinion leaders. These findings are useful for governments to establish a rumor detection system so that official information can be released and rumors can be refuted without delay. Meanwhile, the cooperation with the opinion leaders in online rumor propagation should be strengthened. In addition, a scientific popularization and timely notification of project progress is recommended prior to the development of NIMBY facility.

AB  - In an attempt to improve organ donation rates, some countries are considering moving from "opt-in" systems where citizens must express their willingness to be an organ donor, to "opt-out" systems where consent is presumed unless individuals have expressed their wishes otherwise, by, for example, joining an "opt-out" register. In Wales-a part of the United Kingdom-the devolved government recently legislated for an "opt-out" system. For the change to be effective, a public awareness campaign was critical to the policy's success. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis, we explored media coverage of the change to better understand the relationship between the state, policy actors, media and the public when such policy changes take place. Our findings illustrate how a state communication campaign can effectively set the media agenda within which we saw a degree of interdependency created with the state using the media to promote policy, and the media relying on the state for credible information. Yet we also found that the media is not uncritical and observed how it uses its autonomy to influence policy setting. Over the period of study, we found that a change in tone and view towards deemed consent organ donation has taken place in the media. However, while this may influence or reflect public attitudes, it is yet to be seen whether the media campaign translates into behavioural change that will result in increases in organ donations.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine how a crisis affects public attitudes toward stigmatized service workers (SSWs) who are blamed by the media for the event.
   Design/methodology/approach - Hypotheses grounded in two theories, crisis communication and empathic concern, are tested using two experimental design studies of 180 and 107 adult respondents.
   Findings - The effects of both empathy (positive) and anger (negative) on attitudes toward the SSWs involved in crisis are mediated by controllability of attribution of crisis. Empathic concern mitigates negative public attitudes toward stigmatized workers and appears to remove the effect of anger but only when the crisis severity is not too high. In a severe crisis both empathy and anger are important predictors of public response.
   Research limitations/implications - Boundary conditions in terms of severity, nature and victim of crisis and media framing need to be investigated.
   Practical implications - Proactive crisis management practice is required by professional associations of SSW. Eliciting empathy and paying attention to prior crisis history and professional reputation offers scope to quell public anger and desire for punishment.
   Social implications - The attrition rates of socially stigmatized workers following crisis events have profound social and financial costs to society. This study sets a foundation for substantive managerial change in crisis response, and how the perception of socially stigmatized workers, is managed.
   Originality/value - This study is the first to examine the voracity of two theories which provide informed but different insights to public response to service workers in crisis.

AB  - Instead of studying the impact of media on society, the traditional "top down" orientation of most communication studies scholars, this keynote presentation adopted the opposite perspective, exploring the "bottom-up" impact of "society" on "media". Unlike conventional "agenda-setting theory", which suggests that nationally prominent news media set issue "agendas" for other news media and public opinion, and also unlike the "guard dog" view that media essentially protect the interests of political and economic elites, the "community structure theory" explores links between different community (typically city or nation-state) demographics and variations in reporting on critical health concerns. Summarizing his scholarship on health communication presented and published over decades, the speaker outlined community structure theory's illumination of two overall patterns in US and cross-national coverage of health communication issues. In US coverage, broad measures of economically "buffered" privilege (educational, income, or occupational advantage) are linked to "favorable" or "government responsibility" coverage of health issues, and specific measures of "health" privilege (physicians, hospitals) are connected to "favorable" or "government responsibility" coverage promoting selected health issues. In cross-national coverage, specific measures of national "health vulnerability" (such as percent without improved water access, infant mortality rate) are linked to "government" responsibility coverage for selected health issues (human trafficking, water handling/contamination). In addition, broad measures of "macro" vulnerability conditions (agricultural dependence, political instability) are associated with "government" responsibility coverage for a wide range of health issues (genetically modified foods, drug trafficking, condom promotion, and food security). Overall, community structure theory's "bottom up" perspective reveals how the vulnerable are empowered by their demographic alignment with variations in health communication. (C) 2020 The author(s).

AB  - This article argues that an important political marketplace of keywords expands in social media around campaign events such as a debate; that rhetorical efforts to define the situation in which a campaign event occurs are met in this marketplace by user responses that more or less echo the keywords, thereby enhancing or diminishing the political power of their "caller" or speaker; and that social media monitoring platforms can enhance our understanding of public opinion influence competitions among candidates through the careful selection, tabulation, and inspection of words and phrases being voiced. In the case at hand, an analysis of Twitter volume data and a reading of a sample of 1200 tweets between July 30 and August 15, 2015, a period enveloping the first 2016 Republican presidential candidate debate on August 6, 2015, helps us understand how Donald J. Trump escaped political punishment from party and media elites for subverting Republican and U.S. norms of candidate behavior. Elite voices greatly disapproved of Trump's debate performance and conduct, a traditional augury of declining public support. But the presence of social media voices enhanced Trump's capacity to succeed with an insurgent marketing strategy, one he would continue into his election as president fifteen months later. Specifically, comparatively high user volume on a debate-oriented section of Twitter (i.e., posts with the hashtag #GOPDebate) for Trump's name, slogan, and Twitter address, and for such advantageous keywords as "political correctness," "MegynKelly," and "illegal immigration" relative to terms and phrases favoring other candidates and Republicans as a whole indicates the presence of heavy and active popular support for Trump. The contents of the corresponding tweet sample exhibit Twitter-savvy techniques and populist stances by which the Trump campaign solicited that support: celebrity feuding, callouts to legacy media allies, featured fan comments, a blunt vernacular, and confrontational branding. The contents also illustrate ways in which users manifested their support: from the aforementioned high keyword volume to imitative behavior and the supplying of evidence to verify Trump's contested claims during the debate.

AB  - At the end of the war in Europe in 1945, an alliance-loyalty attitude was predominant among the Scandinavian public voices on the Soviet Union. This attitude incorporated a favourable image of the Soviet war effort and implied that the Soviet system had undergone changes during the war. Another significant group supported the Soviet system more unequivocally. These attitudes were dominant in the Scandinavian media and public debate until late 1945 or early 1946, when opposition to and fear of the Soviet Union began to be openly expressed in conservative and social-democratic newspapers. A bipartisan attitude to the Soviet Union had not developed at this stage, as the alliance-loyalty attitude was transformed into a clearer third-voice attitude that saw the Soviet Union on the one hand as a power which was not worthy of imitation, but which on the other hand accepted that the Soviet Union was seeking international peace and cooperation. Third-voice supporters in the Scandinavian media sought investigative reports on conditions in the Soviet Union, as they claimed that the growing anti-Soviet attitudes were based on a lack of accurate knowledge. Considering that Denmark, Norway and Sweden had experienced different conditions during the war, the differences in public attitudes to the Soviet Union were comparatively small. The public third voice on the Soviet Union was clearly weakened in 1948 by the reception of more critical information on the Soviet system and the perception of news on international developments.

AB  - Does geographic proximity to nuclear power plants influence public attitudes toward nuclear energy? Utilizing a statewide survey of North Carolina residents, this research considers whether proximity to a nuclear facility - measured by residence in a 10 or 50 mile Emergency Planning Zone - influences citizen awareness, support, and perceptions of safety concerning nuclear energy. The results suggest that while geographic proximity to generating sites does lead to increased levels of awareness, it does not appear to impact overall attitudes toward the use and perceived safety of nuclear energy.

AB  - Policy-makers often refer to media reports and public opinion polls when advocating immigration policies. A good example of this is provided by Hong Kong, an international financial hub that prides itself on its multiculturalism and pluralism, but whose government officials and pro-establishment legislators have been calling for tougher measures because of a plethora of negative news reports on immigrants. This study examines how print media frames the issue of asylum seekers and refugees, with the findings indicating that the majority of local Chinese news articles portray asylum seekers negatively as fake refugees and criminals. The study also examines newspapers' framing of the causes of requests for asylum and their recommendations for dealing with the problem: (1) setting up detention camps, (2) enforcing stricter border control, and (3) withdrawing from the UNCAT. It argues that the negative framing provides justifications for anti-refugee policy-makers to suggest tougher policy solutions to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Policy implications are discussed which may affect Hong Kong's position as a first-class global city.

AB  - The Chinese media have undergone commercial liberalization during the reform era. Interviews with media practitioners reveal that media reform has brought about three different types of newspapers that differ with respect to their degree of commercial liberalization. Based on a natural experiment during the anti-Japanese protests in Beijing in 2005, this article shows that urban residents found more strongly commercialized newspapers more persuasive than less commercialized newspapers. Provided that the state can enforce press restrictions when needed, commercial liberalization promotes the ability of the state to influence public opinion through the means of the news media.

AB  - This research provides a basis for understanding how the contents of media coverage about CSR activities relates to the fit between these CSR activities and the organizations' core activities. In two steps, 513 news articles about organizations' CSR activities were analyzed. First, an expert review determined the fit between the CSR initiatives presented in the news articles and the core business of the organizations pursuing these initiatives. Second, a quantitative content analysis measured tone and framing of the news articles. The results reveal that while CSR fit does not influence tone, it does partly impact the framing of the media coverage, as CSR fit leads to a positive framing of organizations and their CSR activities. However, vice versa, CSR misfit does not necessarily lead to a negative representation of organizations and their CSR in the media coverage. In order to maximally benefit from their CSR activities and achieve optimal media coverage, organizations are advised to not only engage in CSR, but seek to implement initiatives that are well integrated into their core business.

AB  - There is reason to believe that an increasing proportion of the news consumers receive is not from news producers directly but is recirculated through social network sites and email by ordinary citizens. This may produce some fundamental changes in the information environment, but the data to examine this possibility have thus far been relatively limited. In the current paper, we examine the changing information environment by leveraging a body of data on the frequency of (a) views, and recirculations through (b) Twitter, (c) Facebook, and (d) email of New York Times stories. We expect that the distribution of sentiment (positive-negative) in news stories will shift in a positive direction as we move from (a) to (d), based in large part on the literatures on self-presentation and imagined audiences. Our findings support this expectation and have important implications for the information contexts increasingly shaping public opinion.

AB  - The average citizen often does not experience government policy directly, but learns about it from the mass media. The nature of media coverage of public policy is thus of real importance, for both public opinion and policy itself. It nevertheless is the case that scholars of public policy and political communication have invested rather little time in developing methods to track public policy coverage in media content. The lack of attention is all the more striking in an era in which media coverage is readily available in digital form. This paper offers a proposal for tracking coverage of the actual direction of policy change in mass media. It begins with some methodological considerations, and then draws on an expository case-defense spending in the United States-to assess the effectiveness of our automated content-analytic methods. Results speak to the quantity and quality in media coverage of policy issues, and the potential role of mass media-to both inform and mislead-in modern representative democracy.

AB  - Background: Over 60% of households (HHs) in Trinidad and Tobago (T&T) consume alcohol. These HHs were more likely to report illnesses, relationship problems, and behavioral problems with children. This study set out to determine what proportion of HHs were willing to support changes in specific policies, laws and regulations in a national alcohol campaign.
   Methods: A cross-sectional convenience sample of HHs were surveyed from a random sample of enumeration districts (ED) in T&T. An interviewer-applied, field pre-tested de novo questionnaire had 5 domains and was developed over 1 1/2 years after an extensive literature review and consultation. Many of the WHO 'best buys' recommendations were included. Results: One thousand six hundred ninety-five HHs (from 53 ED) responded from a total of 1837 HHs approached (response rate 92%). In a national campaign the following proportions of HHs would support: setting the legal age for drinking at 21 years (82.4%); restricting or banning alcohol advertising on TV and other media (73.1% and 54. 4% respectively); banning all alcohol advertising at sports and cultural events (64.8%); banning radio stations playing songs with reference to alcohol use (71.3%); holding sellers of alcohol responsible for the amount of alcohol sold (79. 5%); advocating that proof of age to be shown by persons buying alcohol (87.4%); placing more prominent warning labels on products displaying alcohol content (87.2%); placing more prominent warning labels on products showing harmful effects (88.5%); increasing taxes on alcohol sales (87.7%). Less than 50% of HH supported restrictions in density of outlets and reduction in opening times for alcohol outlets.
   Conclusions: Many HHs in T&T are willing to support changes in policies around alcohol, including many of the policies shown by the WHO to be effective in reducing the harmful consumption of alcohol.

AB  - Negative stereotypes about intellectually gifted individuals prevail among teachers and in society although empirical research has debunked them. They are also dominant in mass media representations of gifted individuals such as newspaper reports. The present study investigated whether stereotypic representations in newspaper articles contribute to the stigmatization of gifted individuals and whether nonstereotypic, evidence-based representations might help destigmatize gifted individuals. Two randomized controlled studies with N = 431 and N = 432 university students, respectively, were conducted. In both experiments, the stereotypic representation caused more negative attitudes toward gifted individuals (d = 0.86/0.81), whereas the evidence-based representation caused more positive attitudes (d = -0.54/-0.58), compared with a control group. Quality of previous relationships with gifted persons moderated both effects to some extent; however, both effects were quite robust against potential moderators. Results indicate that the media should be aware of their influence on recipients' attitudes. Giftedness researchers should more actively join in the public debate to counteract stigmatization of intellectually gifted individuals.

AB  - The activities of Fulani nomads in Ghana have gained considerable media attention and engendered continuing public debate. In this paper, we analyze the prejudiced portrayals of the nomads in the Ghanaian news media, and how these contribute to an exclusionist and a discriminatory discourse that puts the nomads at the margins of Ghanaian society. The study employs a critical discourse analysis framework and draws on a dataset of 160 articles, including news stories, editorials and op-ed pieces. The analysis reveals that the nomads are discursively constructed as undesirables through an othering process that centers on three discourses: a discourse of dangerousness/criminalization, a discourse of alienization, and a discourse of stigmatization. This anti-nomad/Fulani rhetoric is evident in the choice of sensational headlines, alarmist news content, organization of arguments, and use of quotations. The paper concludes with a call for more balanced and critical news reporting on the nomads, especially since issues surrounding them border on national cohesion and security.

Going beyond individual cases, this article uses framing theory and content analysis to examine and compare the four primary functions of frames employed by the news media, government, and netizens on the topic of government corruption. Results show partial differences in frames between netizens, government, and news media.

Drawing from social network theory, we argue that the spread of disinformation in the digital age is best understood by examining how actors achieve and maintain access to the existing social media networks via a process of cultural keying-mimicking the cultural cues of the target network to camouflage their intentions and attract followers. While this activity is usually limited in scale and scope, it may be amplified to seize on critical domestic and international events. To demonstrate these arguments, we examine the Twitter behavior of the Kremlin-linked news outlets RT and Sputnik during and after the 2017 French presidential election. We first analyze their presence and salience in a network of accounts interested in French politics. We then use structural topic modeling to identify thematic overlap between the outlets and our panel of users. Our analysis suggests that Kremlin-linked outlets are indeed active in local networks and repeatedly key on salient themes such as Islamophobia and Euroscepticism to blend in.

AB  - Drug policy has shifted from intense criminalization toward reforms that prioritize decarceration and treatment. Despite this shift, little is known about whether support for recent treatment-oriented drug policy is equitable by users' race and the drug type. Using the opiate and crack cocaine crises as cases, we analyze 400 articles from the New York Times and Washington Post to assess the degree to which the two crises were racialized, criminalized, and medicalized. We find that media coverage medicalized and humanized White people who use opiates, while coverage of crack cocaine focused on criminalization, vilifying Black people who use drugs. We then conduct two vignette experiments (N = 308; N = 630) to examine whether these racialized frames shape public support for treatment or criminalization. We find the public more likely to support criminalization for Black people, while supporting drug treatment for White people. Respondents are more likely to support drug treatment for heroin use than for crack cocaine. Our findings suggest that support for medicalized approaches to drug use is more likely to occur for White people and drugs linked to White people, while Black people and drugs associated with Black people continue to be perceived as largely amenable to punitive options.

AB  - In recent years, activists have increasingly organized to protest large-scale energy projects, and research has found that such activism affects project approval. Despite its increasing relevance, little is known about who participates in energy activism. This paper builds a profile of energy activists by drawing on existing literature to derive and test general expectations on resources, political attitudes, media exposure, trust, risk, climate concern, and local factors. We analyze an original survey from a nationally representative sample of the U.S. public to identify the individual-level determinants of energy activism and compare these factors with a more traditional model of political activism. We find that energy activists are distinct from political activists. Energy activists tend to be younger and more demographically diverse, more concerned about local environmental conditions, and, heterogeneous in their political attitudes. We conclude the paper with a discussion of the results, implications for energy producers, and suggestions for future research.

AB  - Following the COVID-19's outbreak in China, wildlife-related issues such as wildlife management and conservation made headlines around the world due to the potential zoonotic nature of the newly discovered coronavirus. In our study, we examined the dynamic interaction of the news agenda and public agenda concerning wildlife-related issues on social media after COVID-19's outbreak. Using big data analytics, we automatically extracted the agendas' attributes and networks from 110,549 social media posts made from January 1 to April 8, 2020, and investigated the effect of second- and third-level dynamic agenda setting in a time series analysis. Our findings suggest that the agenda-setting effect of wildlife-related issues on social media was not a single-step, unidirectional action but a reciprocal, dynamic interaction constantly constructed by news outlets and the general public.

AB  - This paper is interdisciplinary and combines the research perspective of medical studies with that of media and social communication studies and theological studies. The main goal of this article is to determine [from arguments on all sides of the issue] whether, and to what extent, statements issued by a religious authority can be used as an argument in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. The authors also want to find answers to the questions of how the pope's comments affect public opinion when they concern the sphere of secular and everyday life, including issues related to health care. The main method used in this study is desktop research and the analysis of the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on vaccination and on the types and significance of the pope's statements on various topics. The auxiliary methods are sentiment analysis and network analysis made in the open source software Gephi. The authors are strongly interested in the communication and media aspect of the analyzed situation. Pope Francis' voice on the COVID-19 vaccination has certainly been noticed and registered worldwide, but the effectiveness of his message and direct impact on Catholics' decisions to accept or refuse the COVID-19 vaccination is quite questionable and would require further precise research. Comparing this to the regularities known from political marketing, one would think that the pope's statement would not convince the firm opponents of vaccination.

AB  - Researchers, policymakers, and the public often claim that "extreme" political views have become increasingly commonplace and that polarization on issues of race and immigration has become a central dilemma for contemporary politics. The popular narrative of political polarization captures tensions that many are noticing and experiencing. However, there is also significant confusion around the concept, as well as gaps between popular perceptions and empirical findings on the different forms of polarization and their prevalence across regions. It is unclear to what extent polarization describes a global phenomenon, as its national and subnational manifestations vary considerably, produced from distinct local histories as well as diffuse transnational forces. While the United States is often treated as ground zero for political polarization, nearby Canada does not appear to be experiencing polarization to nearly the same degree. Using data from a 2019 survey on Atlantic Canadians' political views and perceptions of change, this paper examines whether underlying forms of political polarization are manifesting in the region. We assess whether mass ideological polarization and partisan sorting can be found in Atlantic Canada, looking at socio-cultural and economic dimensions of political values. We also examine perceptions of polarization in the region, using Multiple Correspondence Analysis to observe underlying associations between perceptions, extreme or polarized views, and partisanship. This mapping approach provides insight into latent patterns often missed by more traditional methods.

AB  - Media coverage of Muslims has been repeatedly shown to be negative, and attitudes toward Muslims in American society are typically more negative than attitudes toward other social groups. Does the tone of media coverage directly affect public attitudes? This relationship is not well established with respect to Muslims, nor as a proposition about social groups in general. We use an online between-subjects experiment to examine whether exposure to articles of quantifiably different valences about Muslims or Catholics affects reported attitudes toward each of those groups. We find clear support for this proposition. Our additional tests demonstrate that this effect persists but is attenuated when money is at stake. We also identify anxiety as a key mediator between exposure to articles of different valences and attitudes about each group. Our findings suggest that articles of a particular tone can influence views of social groups.

AB  - The understanding of the public response to COVID-19 vaccines is the key success factor to control the COVID-19 pandemic. To understand the public response, there is a need to explore public opinion. Traditional surveys are expensive and time-consuming, address limited health topics, and obtain small-scale data. Twitter can provide a great opportunity to understand public opinion regarding COVID-19 vaccines. The current study proposes an approach using computational and human coding methods to collect and analyze a large number of tweets to provide a wider perspective on the COVID-19 vaccine. This study identifies the sentiment of tweets using a machine learning rule-based approach, discovers major topics, explores temporal trend and compares topics of negative and non-negative tweets using statistical tests, and discloses top topics of tweets having negative and non-negative sentiment. Our findings show that the negative sentiment regarding the COVID-19 vaccine had a decreasing trend between November 2020 and February 2021. We found Twitter users have discussed a wide range of topics from vaccination sites to the 2020 U.S. election between November 2020 and February 2021. The findings show that there was a significant difference between tweets having negative and non-negative sentiment regarding the weight of most topics. Our results also indicate that the negative and non-negative tweets had different topic priorities and focuses. This research illustrates that Twitter data can be used to explore public opinion regarding the COVID-19 vaccine.

AB  - This study examines how the governments of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania influence public attitudes to legitimise their regimes through the media. It is based on a survey of 1 395 citizens in 15 provinces of East Africa, who were selected using a stratified multistage cluster sampling. Hierarchical Linear Models (HLM) estimated whether government influence on public attitudes towards regime legitimacy vary between users of state-owned and privately owned media, while accounting for education levels. Government influence on public attitudes towards regime legitimacy had a negative influence within provinces and had no significant positive influence across provinces when education levels were high. But the data show that those governments build their political influence by taking advantage of citizens who are less educated and lack a basic understanding of their political rights.

AB  - Dealing with the schoolyard bully is an age-old problem; however, legislators have only recently tackled it at the state level. This study examines the adoption of anti-bullying policies from the policy diffusion and innovation perspective with an emphasis on the role of print media coverage. The study contributes to the policy diffusion literature by examining both national and local media coverage as conduits for diffusion and adds to the expanding views of the diffusion process beyond the traditional geographic proximity argument. Further, it provides the first examination of an emerging policy area important to education policy scholars. The findings show issue saliency via national media coverage drives policy adoption beyond any geographic proximity. (C) 2014 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Social media has increasingly enabled "fake news" to circulate widely, most notably during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign. These intentionally false or misleading stories threaten the democratic goal of a well-informed electorate. This study evaluates the effectiveness of strategies that could be used by Facebook and other social media to counter false stories. Results from a pre-registered experiment indicate that false headlines are perceived as less accurate when people receive a general warning about misleading information on social media or when specific headlines are accompanied by a "Disputed" or "Rated false" tag. Though the magnitudes of these effects are relatively modest, they generally do not vary by whether headlines were congenial to respondents' political views. In addition, we find that adding a "Rated false" tag to an article headline lowers its perceived accuracy more than adding a "Disputed" tag (Facebook's original approach) relative to a control condition. Finally, though exposure to the "Disputed" or "Rated false" tags did not affect the perceived accuracy of unlabeled false or true headlines, exposure to a general warning decreased belief in the accuracy of true headlines, suggesting the need for further research into how to most effectively counter false news without distorting belief in true information.

AB  - This study examined Israeli public perceptions of institutional child sexual abuse (CSA) in the Malka Leifer case. Leifer is a Jewish ultra-Orthodox former Melbourne school principal who is wanted in Australia on CSA charges, after fleeing to Israel. Based on a qualitative analysis of 2,451 reader comments retrieved from four Israeli news websites and six public Facebook pages, the findings indicated diverse attitudes toward the alleged perpetrator, the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community, state authorities, and victims. All parties involved were criticized, but less so the victims. Criticisms included sociopolitical and gender stereotypes, and demonic attributions. Positive comments were directed at all involved, even the alleged perpetrator, and especially the victims. The results demonstrate the need to better understand CSA portrayals in cyberspace, as they affect both public and policymaker attitudes, and the importance of fighting prejudicial discourse about the ultra-Orthodox community, especially in light of its changing attitudes regarding CSA.

AB  - Despite a strong interest in media coverage of social problems, sociologists have failed to examine when and why news outlets present issues as problems in need of public action within short time periods. Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profile events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I find that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so: This finding highlights the importance of institutionalized action in calling attention to social problems.

AB  - Background: Cancer ranks among the most serious public health challenges worldwide. In China-the world's most populous country-about one-quarter of the population consists of people with cancer. Social media has become an important platform that the Chinese public uses to express opinions.
   Objective: We investigated cancer-related discussions on the Chinese social media platform Weibo (Sina Corporation) to identify cancer topics that generate the highest levels of user engagement.
   Methods: We conducted topic modeling and regression analyses to analyze and visualize cancer-related messages on Weibo and to examine the relationships between different cancer topics and user engagement (ie, the number of retweets, comments, and likes).
   Results: Our results revealed that cancer communication on Weibo has generally focused on the following six topics: social support, cancer treatment, cancer prevention, women's cancers, smoking and skin cancer, and other topics. Discussions about social support and cancer treatment attracted the highest number of users and received the greatest numbers of retweets, comments, and likes.
   Conclusions: Our investigation of cancer-related communication on Weibo provides valuable insights into public concerns about cancer and can help guide the development of health campaigns in social media.

AB  - The accuracy and relevance of United States print news media has been called into question at increasing rates in the post-truth era. Conservatives, in particular, have long expressed concerns that mass and digital media censor conservative as well as Christian viewpoints while promoting a progressive and, more recently, pro-Muslim, platform. They have increasingly turned to alternative-right and alternative right-wing sources for news and discussion within what they deem to be unfiltered and unbiased networks. This article employs a mixed method approach of content and discourse analysis of sources from 1 January to 15 May of 2019 pertaining to discourse concerning the relationship between Christianity and Islam within and in response to articles in three such sources: Breitbart, The Federalist, and FrontPage Magazine. The role of these three websites is considered in the radicalization of those who aim to defend a monolithic form of Christianity rather than a particular Christian denomination or belief.

AB  - This study examines the framing of Egypt's January 2011 uprising in the country's state-run, independent and social media using a unique dataset of Arabic language content from newspapers and key social media posts collected during the peak of protests. Semiofficial (governmental) newspapers framed the event as a conspiracy on the Egyptian state, warning of economic consequence and attributing blame and responsibility for the chaos on others. Social media posts used a human interest frame defining protests as a revolution for freedom and social justice and independent newspapers used a combination of these frames. Findings point toward the potential roles that news media will play in shaping public opinion and demonstrate why social media have wide appeal in times of political crisis.

AB  - Given the profound role that media play in public opinion, there exists an ongoing necessity to understand the portrayal of mental illness by journalists. There is a plethora of studies that have examined how mental illness is portrayed in the media, but few studies have sought to understand what journalist opinions about mental illness are, and none could be found regarding journalism students' opinions. This study aimed to bridge this gap by examining journalism student's attitudes towards mental illness using the Social Distance Scale (SDS). This study adheres to STROBE guidelines for cross-sectional studies. One hundred and seventy-two undergraduate journalism students (n = 172) completed the SDS with findings suggesting that students had moderate stigmatizing attitudes, with varying degrees of stigma present depending on the social context. Positively framed reporting and constructive media coverage surrounding mental illness may be improved by shared communication and education with health professionals who specialize in mental health: mental health nurses.

AB  - This study joins a growing body of research that demonstrates the behavioral consequences of hostile media perceptions. Using survey data from a nationally representative U.S. sample, this study tests a moderated-mediation model examining the direct and indirect effects of hostile media perceptions on climate change activism. The model includes external political efficacy as a mediator and political ideology and internal political efficacy as moderators. The results show that hostile media perceptions have a direct association with climate activism that is conditioned by political ideology: Among liberals, hostile media perceptions promote activism, whereas among conservatives, they decrease activism. Hostile media perceptions also have a negative, indirect relationship with activism that is mediated through external political efficacy; however, this relationship is conditioned by both ideology and internal political efficacy. Specifically, the indirect effect manifests exclusively among conservatives and moderates who have low internal efficacy. Theoretical, normative, and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Increased income inequality, and policies that can limit its further growth, are an important issue for citizens, politicians and the media. Numerous empirical studies have measured political support for redistributive policies by asking whether the government should equalize gaps between rich and poor. They try to discover whether 'redistributive' policies are supported by public opinion and are therefore politically feasible. This research note argues that the standard instrument measures diffuse support for more equality, but gives rather vague hints if this support is transformed into a political mandate for redistributive programmes. With regard to the way in which the political demand for state redistribution to reduce income inequality has been raised so far, methodological critique and innovation is largely lacking. This article therefore tests the validity of the standard item. It argues that the conventional measurement only captures a general 'inclination' towards the idea of equality. However, since the item phrasing is unspecific, other orientations confound the answers, so that ultimately the predictive power in terms of political behaviour is low. The standard item measures egalitarian preferences with inconsistence. This limits its reliability, so that hardly any conclusions can be drawn regarding voting for left parties or support for redistributive programmes.

AB  - It is well-known that events influence the standing of the governing parties. Still, important questions remain unanswered: Which characteristics are necessary for an event to have an impact? Why should voters care about events and which role does the mass media play? How are other influences on government popularity affected by the occurrence of events? To answer these questions a model of German government popularity containing the economic situation and events, selected by addressed criteria, will be advanced and tested by means of time-series regression. The results show that events have an impact on government popularity and are able to repress real-world influences. This effect is rather short-lived and does not cover all events which are normally perceived as influential.

AB  - While the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is spreading all over the world, misinformation, without prudent journalistic judgments of media content online, has begun circulating rapidly and influencing public opinion on social media. This quantitative study intends to advance the previous misinformation research by proposing and examining a theoretical model following an "influence of presumed influence" perspective. Two survey studies were conducted on participants located in the United States (N = 1793) and China (N = 504), respectively, to test the applicability of the influence of presumed influence theory. Results indicated that anger and anxiety significantly predicted perceived influence of misinformation on others; presumed influence on others positively affected public support in corrective and restrictive actions in both U.S. and China. Further, anger toward misinformation led to public willingness to self-correct in the U.S. and China. In contrast, anxiety only took effects in facilitating public support for restrictive actions in the U.S. This study conducted survey research in China and the U.S. to expand the influence of presumed influence (IPI) hypothesis to digital misinformation in both Western and non-Western contexts. This research provides implications for social media companies and policy makers to combat misinformation online.

AB  - In this paper, we examine social media-based participation and public deliberation in land-use planning. We use the Deweyan theory of the public, the Habermasian theory of the public sphere, and the recent theories of the digital public sphere as our framework, asking what should be the relation of public planners to the digital public sphere: should they try to manage self-organising participation, or should public opinion formation be free from the influence of public authorities? The empirical part of the study reflects on this question by investigating Finnish planners' experiences of the role of social media in planning in the light of two recent surveys.

AB  - Recent studies in psychology have shown that the framing of a message affects judgments about its truth, as negatively framed statements are perceived as more trustworthy than formally equivalent, positively framed statements. The current work examines this effect in the contexts of political communication and public opinion. The results of three experiments show that equivalence framing affects both the perceived truth of political messages and the trustworthiness of its source, and that one cause of this effect is that recipients have learned to associate negativity with news and positivity with persuasive communication through media exposure. Consequently, we find that positively framing statements can lead recipients to feel that the source is trying to persuade them, which triggers reactance, reducing the perceived truth of the message and the trustworthiness of the source.

AB  - The aim of this study is to better understand stigma towards individuals with mental illness who commit violent offences, and examine ways to mitigate the negative impact of social media news stories of schizophrenia and violent offending. Psychology undergraduate students (N = 255) were exposed to Instagram images and captions of recent real news stories of violent offending by individuals with schizophrenia. In the experimental condition, contextual clinical explanatory information was integrated. Pre- and post-measures of stigma were completed. There was a significant increase in negative attitudes towards individuals with mental illness who committed violent offences following the no-context condition, which was clearly mitigated in the experimental condition where context was provided. In both conditions, there were significant increases in intended social-distancing behaviours towards and perceptions of dangerousness of individuals with schizophrenia, and negative beliefs about mental illness more generally. There appears to be utility in incorporating knowledge-based clinical information to mitigate some facets of stigma.

AB  - Citizens are now central to national security strategies, yet governments readily admit that little is known about public opinion on security. This article presents a unique and timely examination of public perceptions of security threats. By focusing on the breadth of security threats that citizens identify, their psychological origins, how they vary from personal to global levels, and the relationships between perceptions of threats and other political attitudes and behaviours, the article makes several new contributions to the literature. These include extending the levels at which threats are perceived from the national versus personal dichotomy to a continuum spanning the individual, family, community, nation and globe, and showing the extent to which perceptions of threat at each level have different causes, as well as different effects on political attitudes and behaviour. These findings are also relevant to policy communities' understanding of what it means for a public to feel secure.

AB  - In the western United States, livestock grazing often co-exists with recreation, cultural resource management and biodiversity protection on federal and state protected rangelands as well as on many local government open space areas. While the value of livestock grazing for managing rangeland vegetation to reduce fire fuel loads and improve wildlife habitat is increasingly recognized by resource management professionals, public concerns, and conflict between recreationist and livestock have led to reductions in public land grazing. Traditional public input methods yield a constrained picture of people's attitudes toward cows and public land grazing. Public meetings, hearings, and surveys, the most commonly used mechanisms for public land managers to solicit public opinion, tend to foster participation of organized special interests or, in the case of surveys, focus on a specific topic. General public input is limited. This study explored the use of personal photography in social media to gain insight into public perceptions of livestock grazing in public spaces. Key findings of this study include that many recreationist in grazed San Francisco Bay Area parks shared views, interests, and concerns about cows and grazing on the photo-sharing website, Flickr(TM) that seldom show up at a public meeting or in surveys. Results suggest that social media analysis can help develop a more nuanced understanding of public viewpoints useful in making decisions and creating outreach and education programs for public grazing lands. This study demonstrates that using such media can be useful in gaining an understanding of public concerns about natural resource management.

AB  - A growing body of evidence demonstrates that the way the press frames policy issues can foster fear, particularly with respect to portrayals of immigrants. Building on this research, we examine images of immigrants, borders, and legality in the media's coverage of immigration. To do so, we collect a unique dataset of images appearing in three major national news magazines' articles about immigration or immigrants in the U.S. between 2000 and 2010. We code the images based on whether they include visual representations of the border and immigration enforcement, whether illegality and/or criminal behavior is shown or implied, and the activities in which the immigrants are engaged. We find that the press frequently portrays immigrants as undocumented, presenting images of the border as well as immigrant arrests and detentions. Moreover, when immigrants are working, they are disproportionately engaged in low-skilled activities. Our analysis demonstrates a general tendency to frame immigrants in a negative light, consistent with a "threat" narrative but inconsistent with actual immigrant demographics. Our findings are particularly important in light of research establishing that such portrayals contribute to more hostile attitudes about immigration in the U.S. as well as greater support for punitive immigration policy among Whites.

AB  - Public opinions play a pivotal role in public participation and decision-making in mega construction projects. The rise of technology and social media has facilitated the online public debate on social impacts derived from mega construction projects. This study presents a novel approach to analyze the evolution of public opinions through social media. This analysis framework covers: the temporal patterns of online messages, evolution of frames, and evolution of users. Such novel approach is employed to analyze the evolution of online public opinions on a mega construction project. Content analysis and a number of curve fitting methods were innovatively combined. Results show that social event had dual diffusion cycles while the formation mechanism of each cycle was completely different. The key parameters of Bimodal Gaussian model can depict the character. istics of online diffusion of public opinions. Elites and media organizations form the crucial nodes in the online diffusion process. The sequence of each frame and their share in the total number of frames are determined by preference of elites and media organizations. These findings are useful to develop effective strategy for public engagement, and to prevent and intervene the social conflicts.

AB  - Prejudice against another nation or culture is often perceived as a major hindrance to world peace. This paper will report on the early emergence of such prejudices, identified in eight-year-old primary school children in Korea. The research, conducted in June 2012, investigated Korean children's reactions to the Japanese tsunami of 2011. A pedagogically embedded research methodology (PERM) was used, where the research initiative was embedded within the teaching and learning of a normal school lesson. The research reveals that young Korean children's prejudices are nationally and culturally deep-seated, and are reinforced by parochial viewpoints projected by Korean mass media programmes. These influences place constraints on children's ability to empathise with people beyond their national borders. Nevertheless, the project provides evidence that prejudicial attitudes remain malleable in children and can be changed in a challenging but supportive educational context.

AB  - Background: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Czech population experienced a second lockdown lasting for about half a year, restricting free movement and imposing social isolation. However, it is not known whether the impact of this long lockdown resulted in habituation to the adverse situation or in the traumatization of the Czech population, and whether the media and specific media use contributed to these effects. O bjective: The aim of this study was to elucidate the effect of the long lockdown on the mental health of the Czech population, and the role of exposure to COVID-19 news reports and specific forms of media news use in mental health. Methods: We conducted two consecutive surveys in the early (November 2020) and late (March/April 2021) phases of the nationwide lockdown on the same nationally representative group of Czech adults (N=1777) participating in a longitudinal panel study. Results: Our findings showed that the self-reported symptoms of anxiety and depression increased in the second observation period, confirming the negative effect of the pandemic lockdown as it unfolded, suggesting that restrictive measures and continuous exposure to a collective stressor did not result in the strengthening of resilience but rather in ongoing traumatization. The results also suggest a negative role of the media's coverage of the COVID-19 pandemic in mental health during the early, and particularly late, phases of the lockdown. Furthermore, we found several risk and protective factors of specific media news use. The media practice in news consumption connected to social media use was the strongest predictor of exacerbated mental health symptoms, particularly in the late phase of the lockdown. Moreover, news media use characterized by internalization of information learned from the news, as well as negative attitudes toward media news, were associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression. Conversely, the use of infotainment, together with an in-depth and contextual style of reading news articles, were related to improvement of mental health. Conclusions: Our study showed that the long lockdown resulted in traumatization rather than habituation, and in more pronounced effects (both negative and positive) of media use in mental health.

AB  - The news media?s ability to mobilise citizens to participate politically by emphasising elite conflict in politics is not well understood. This article argues that citizens may gain knowledge when exposed to conflict news framing. It further theorises that whether they translate their knowledge into political participation is conditioned by their orientation towards conflict. Individuals who avoid conflict participate less frequently than individuals who do not. The proposed moderated mediation process was tested using a content analysis of news media coverage and a three-wave panel survey (n?=?2,061). Results show that the effect of exposure to conflict news framing on (changes in) political participation is positively mediated by knowledge. This mediation effect is moderated by conflict avoidance, where the effect is more positive among conflict non-avoiders than conflict avoiders. This study shows that understanding the news media?s mobilising effect on political participation requires attention to both news content and individual motivational factors.

AB  - In exploring the role of mediated noise in socio-political discourse, this paper discusses how noise as an element of the communication model with interruption as its fixed meaning needs reconsideration. Against the backdrop of criticism by the media critics and analysts about high decibel debates in broadcast media, this paper critically analyses the centrality of mediated noise in the political and public discourse in India. Noise, it argues, has emerged as a political device and a discursive weapon employed by the dominant stakeholders, capable of steering discourse and manipulating the public opinion that diverts attention from the pressing issues and emphasizes the political wrangling between the stakeholders while disrupting the discursive process. It underscores how dominant groups produce, manage, and mediate noise as a part of their discursive strategy that simulates constructed sincerity and its unquestionable existence. It is shown that meticulously crafted and stage-managed debate panels in broadcast media are aimed at creating a visual spectacle and are driven by commercial and political interests rather than the concern for informed discourse and debate. Noise, in this sense, is a sound that persuasively refers to its significance, as it creates a realm of discursive ambiguity and undermines a discursive process and its subsequent knowledge. Thus, noise is argued to be a form of discursive violence that manifests in the form of voices that distort the facts, dismiss, or deride a narrative, suppress opposing viewpoints, negate the possibility of discussion, and sabotage opportunities for discourse by creating an atmosphere of fear and violence.

AB  - Social media have changed the way citizens participate in and express opinions about government policy. Social media serve organizations in achieving four main goals: interacting with citizens; fostering citizen participation; furthering open government; and analyzing/monitoring public opinion and activities. We contend that despite the importance of social media, international and local health organizations have been slow to adopt to them, primarily due to the discrepancy between intraorganizational discourse modes and the type of discourse suitable for dialogue with the public. In this perspective paper, we recommend strategies for such public dialogue based on understanding the challenges faced by organiza-tions on the road to becoming more "social" in their social media presence and in their health and risk communication. Subsequently, we propose an integrative approach that combines three complementary paths: (1) putting the "social" back into health organizations' culture by inserting more "social" content into the internal organizational discourse through consulta-tion with experts from different fields, including those who diverge from the scientific consensus. (2) Using strategies to enable health organizations to respond to the public on social networks, based on health communications research and studies on emerging infec-tious disease (EID) communication. (3) Engaging the public on social media based on the participatory approach, which considers the public as a partner that understands science and can work with the organizations to develop an open and innovative pandemic realm by using crowdsourcing to solve complex global health problems. For each path, we define the current challenges, among which are (1) overcoming organizational groupthink and hidden profiles, (2) treating all unofficial information as misleading, and (3) insufficient public engagement in solving complex global problems.

AB  - The market size of the Internet audiovisual industry is expanding continuously, which has profoundly affected the ecology of public opinion and the development of the digital culture industry. During the epidemic of Covid-19, it is witnessed that a surge of active online audiovisual users. However, several issues happening in the Internet audiovisual industry, such as spreading rumors, engaging in vulgar performances, which seriously damaged the network environment and social order. For this reason, a tripartite evolutionary game model of Internet audiovisual space governance was established to simulate and analyze the behavior strategies of administrative departments of radio and television, the Internet audiovisual program service agencies, and network audio and video content creators. Moreover, the game model is verified by empirical analysis. Results demonstrate that: only driven by the administrative department of broadcasting and television can the tripartite evolutionary game of Internet audiovisual space governance reach the expected evolutionary equilibrium point. Therefore, administrative departments of radio and television should give full play to the driving role in the process of Internet audiovisual space governance, strengthen the publicity of regulating the creation of Internet audiovisual content and the warning of vulgar creation through government regulation.

TI  - Framing Climate Change: Economics, Ideology, and Uncertainty in American News Media Content From 1988 to 2014

AB  - The news media play an influential role in shaping public attitudes on a wide range of issues-climate change included. As climate change has risen in salience, the average American is much more likely to be exposed to news coverage now than in the past. Yet, we don't have a clear understanding of how the content of this news coverage has changed over time, despite likely playing an important part in fostering or inhibiting public support and engagement in climate action. In this paper we use a combination of automated and manual content analysis of the most influential media sources in the U.S. -the New York Times, Wall Street Journal, the Washington Post, and the Associated Press- to illustrate the prevalence of different frames in the news coverage of climate change and their dynamics over time from the start of the climate change debate in 1988. Specifically, we focus on three types of frames, based on previous research: economic costs and benefits associated with climate mitigation, appeals to conservative and free market values and principles, and uncertainties and risk surrounding climate change. We find that many of the frames found to reduce people's propensity to support and engage in climate action have been on the decline in the mainstream media, such as frames emphasizing potential economic harms of climate mitigation policy or uncertainty. At the same time, frames conducive to such engagement by the general public have been on the rise, such as those highlighting economic benefits of climate action. News content is also more likely now than in the past to use language emphasizing risk and danger, and to use the present tense. To the extent that media framing plays an important role in fostering climate action in the public, these are welcome developments.

AB  - The sexual assaults reported on New Year's Eve 2015 in Cologne posed major challenges to feminists struggling with the tensions and entanglements of feminism, imperialism, racism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, sexism and nationalism. The aim of the present article is to examine these tensions through an analysis of the pressures framing the positionality of discourses. It examines how feminists, framed by the larger Western debates about the 'failure of multiculturalism' and the global Islamophobia underpinning the 'war on terror' era, engaged with the moral panic which pervaded the mediatization of the assaults. It argues that feminist initiatives like #ausnahmslos', which situated anti-racism at the core of any engagement for gender equality, were a reaction to the femonationalist approach to the events pervading the media and the political debate, and attempts to counter arguments which associated the sexual assaults with cultural practices imported through (Muslim) immigration and which demanded (or condoned) stricter immigration laws and state surveillance of Muslims. Then, this article addresses the challenges posed by some feminists from Germany and from North African countries and/or with a Muslim background, who argued that the analysis of Cologne should address the religious-cultural background of the suspects. The article argues that the difficulty in engaging with their contributions in Germany derives from internal pressures, namely the risk of having their arguments co-opted by Islamophobic and anti-immigration agendas. By pointing at the role of positionality in defining priorities in a globalized world, this article addresses the constraints and potentials in developing transnational approaches to sexual violence.

AB  - Two correlational studies investigated the associations between different forms of intergroup contact, on the one hand, and Italians' prejudice and humanity attributions toward immigrants in Italy, on the other. Study 1 examined the effects of direct contact, extended contact, and parasocial contact through mass-media, assessing separately contact through TV news and newspapers and contact through entertainment programs. Study 2 analyzed the distinct effects of positive and negative episodes of the contact forms considered in Study 1. Across the studies, we tested the mediational role of intergroup anxiety, empathy, and trust. Overall, results showed the importance of taking into account different forms of contact and considering the emotional processes during contact experiences to understand intergroup attitudes.

AB  - This article explores the concept of 'love jihad' and the love jihad discourse in a Scandinavian setting, with a particular emphasis on contemporary works of art and popular culture in Norway. Arguing that 'love jihad' may be understood as part of a larger cluster of meaning related to fear of love across religious and cultural boundaries, and of losing 'our women' to 'foreign men', the article demonstrates that the love-jihad discourse and its related tropes exist in the Norwegian public sphere. It is directly articulated in far-right blogs and Facebook groups and indirectly present in the works of art and popular culture that this article explores. Indeed, read intertextually and in light of recent research in sociology and media studies about Islamophobia and anti-Muslim rhetoric on the Internet, works such as Disgraced, Heisann Montebello, SAS plus/SAS pussy, and Norskish demonstrate-through challenging, mocking or discussing the love-jihad discourse-that 'love jihad' has echoes in contemporary Norway.

KW  - misinformation
KW  - conservative media
AB  - Research examining attitudes and behaviors of Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has largely focused on partisanship as a lens through which many Americans see the coronavirus. Given the importance of partisan affiliation and the degree of partisan polarization in the American society, that is certainly an important driver of public opinion, and a necessary one to understand. But an overlooked set of predispositions might also shape COVID beliefs and attitudes: populism. It is a worldview that pits average citizens against "the elites" and, importantly in the context of a pandemic, it includes anti-intellectual attitudes such as distrust of experts (including scientists). We find that populism is correlated with conspiracy beliefs about COVID-19, above and beyond partisanship. Furthermore, we find that conservative media consumption tends to be a stronger predictor of conspiracy belief among those high in populism than among those low in populism. We also show that these beliefs have consequences: those who believe the conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are less likely to adapt behaviors recommended by public health officials.

KW  - SUPPORT
AB  - COVID-19 has illuminated health inequity in the United States. The burdens of disease are much higher among Black and Indigenous people and other people of color. Disparities by income are also profound, as lower-wage workers were less able to adopt mitigating behaviors compared to higher-income counterparts. These disparities became part of public health discourse in 2020, with commentators frequently highlighting the connection between racism, socioeconomic position, and COVID-19. But what proportion of the public-and among key subgroups-recognized these social group disparities, relative to disparities associated with age and chronic illness, and did public recognition change over the first year of the pandemic? To address these questions, we analyzed data from three nationally-representative cross-sectional public opinion surveys, collected using the NORC AmeriSpeak panel in April 2020 (N = 1007), August 2020 (N = 2716), and April 2021 (N = 1020). The key outcomes were respondents' agreement with statements about disparities in COVID-19 mortality by age, chronic illness, income, and race. We found little change from 2020 to 2021 in Americans' recognition of disparities. At all three time points, most respondents acknowledged age and chronic illness disparities, while no more than half at any time point recognized income- and race-based disparities. Political party affiliation was not statistically associated with agreement with age or illness-related disparities, but was strongly associated with views about income- and race-based disparities. Efforts to promote recognition of racial and socioeconomic health disparities in the United States need to be mindful of the ways in which public understanding of health inequities is linked to partisanship.

AB  - In September 2015, following the ratification of Istanbul Convention by Portugal, addressing someone with unwanted verbal "sexual proposals" became a criminal offence. This however, barely meets the requirements of the treaty and is far from what was first discussed about sexual harassment both in the Portuguese Parliament and more broadly in the media. When the criminalization of "piropo"-the Portuguese colloquial word for "catcalling"-was first proposed, it sparked heated opposition in online discussions, revealing strong prejudices against women and anti-feminist sentiments. Aiming to contribute to the understudied area of street harassment, this article maps the ways in which its legal developments were framed and counter-framed between August 2013 and September 2018, corresponding to the period before, during and after its adoption. Methodologically, we worked through the combination of quantitative and interpretative methods in order to understand gender politics in public policy making, through the study of news media texts and readers' comments posted on Facebook. We argue that whereas feminist interpretations found their way into media texts, reader's discussions expressed the popular misogyny that shaped the law reform.

AB  - Public support is important for countries that are at nascent stages of nuclear energy development. This study seeks to examine factors shaping public support for nuclear energy development in five Southeast Asian countries - Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Using surveys (with n = 1,000 in each country), results show that the public indicates generally low levels of support for nuclear energy development across the five countries. This reflects the possible lingering impact of the Fukushima nuclear incident on public opinion. We further show that factors, such as trust in various stakeholders, media frames, and risk and benefit perceptions, are associated with public support for nuclear energy. More importantly, people use trust, and risk and benefit perceptions as perceptual filters to interpret the relationship between nuclear knowledge and their support for nuclear energy. The findings imply that policymakers should take these perceptual filters into consideration when communicating messages about nuclear energy development to the public.

AB  - BackgroundIn 2014, Denmark experienced a rapid decline in vaccination uptake for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine after a successful introduction of the vaccine in 2009. Before the decline, the uptake of the first HPV vaccine was around 90% for girls born in the period 1998 to 2000, while it dropped to 54% for girls born in 2003. The decline followed negative public attention from 2013 coinciding with increasing suspected adverse-event reporting to the Danish Medicines Agency. The aim of this study is to describe the HPV-vaccination uptake, to quantify relevant HPV-related media coverage, and analyse the relation between media coverage and HPV-vaccination acceptance in Denmark in year 2009-2016.MethodsThree types of data were used for the analysis: Immunisation data from 243,415 girls, media coverage (8524 news items) and Google search activity. We used changes in the correlation between media coverage and vaccination uptake to identify a changing point in their relationship. The relationship before and after the changing point was analysed determined on the interactions between vaccination uptake, media and search activity, with search activity as a proxy for public attention.ResultsWe identified July 2013 as a changing point in the relationship between media coverage and vaccination uptake. We found no significant relationship between media coverage and vaccination uptake in the first part of the time series (June 2009 to June 2013), whereas from July 2013 and onwards there was a negative Pearson's correlation of -0.52. The changing point coincides with both an increase in Google searches for HPV side effects and media coveragewith negative content.ConclusionsFollowing a successful launch of the HPV-vaccination programme, concerns about vaccine safety shifted the public opinion and the coverage by the media. The noticeable shift in correlation between vaccination uptake and media coverage before and after July 2013 could indicate that increased media coverage influenced the decline in vaccination uptake. Media monitoring may represent an important tool in future monitoring and assessment of confidence in vaccination programmes.

AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers' social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively.

AB  - Building on the geographic constituency theory of awareness of Supreme Court decisions, we conducted a panel survey in Cleveland, Ohio before and after Zelman v. Simmons-Harris, which upheld state-funded vouchers in religious schools. We found several characteristics predict awareness: news consumption, income, and knowledge of and positive feelings toward the Court. Our results also showed those vested in the outcome, such as African Americans, religious individuals, and parents were more likely to change their attitudes in favor of the decision and become more positive toward the institution. These findings help us understand the circumstances under which some individuals may become vested in court decisions.

Methods We used sentiment analysis and topic modeling to geospatially explore ivermectin Twitter discourse in the United States and compared it to the political leaning of a state based on the 2020 presidential election. Results All modeled topics were associated with a negative sentiment. Tweets originating from democratic leaning states were more likely to be negative. Conclusions Real-time analysis of social media content can identify public health concerns and guide timely public health interventions tackling disinformation.

AB  - Sentiment analysis is an increasingly popular instrument for the analysis of social media discourse. Sentiment scores seemingly represent an objective means of assessing the mood of social media users, consumers, and the public at large. Similar to other computational tools, sentiment analysis promises to reduce complexity and mitigate information overload, and to inform the decisions of marketers, pollsters, and scholars with reliable data. This article argues that the assumptions encoded into sentiment analysis as a method are accompanied by a number of constraints, both regarding its technical limitations (in terms of what sentiment analysis can and cannot accomplish) and conceptually (in terms of what the notion of sentiment implicitly represents), constraints which are often de-emphasized in public discourse. After providing an overview of its history and development in computer science as well as psychology and the social sciences, we turn to the role of sentiment as a currency in the attention economy. We then present a brief study of common framing of sentiment analysis in the news media, highlighting the expectations that exist regarding its analytical capabilities. We close by discussing the kind of conceptual work that takes place around computational methods such as sentiment analysis in specific cultural environments, highlighting their influence on the public imaginary.

AB  - There is an extensive literature comparing the politics, sociology and economics of the United States and Canada, but very little work comparing the role that public intellectuals play in the space of public opinion and how their ideas are received in both nations simultaneously. Noam Chomsky provides a theoretically useful example of an established academic and public intellectual whose reputation is deeply contested in both countries. Our comparative case study offers leverage to contribute to debates on the sociology of knowledge, reputations, intellectuals, and the politics of professors using data from six major Canadian and American newspapers from 1995-2009 and an innovative coding of media portrayal. Earlier work has demonstrated that Chomsky is discussed as a public intellectual more prominently in Canada than in the United States (McLaughlin and Townsley in Canadian Review of Sociology, 48(4):341-368, 2011). Here we examine the comparative construction of a "public intellectual" reputation in the context of significant political change. We document small differences between the Canadian and American receptions of Chomsky, show change in the patterns of portrayal and number of publications over time, and offer an analysis of differences between political attacks and consecrations. We demonstrate more engagement with Chomsky's political view in Canada than in the United States, a rise in Chomsky's fame post 9/11, and illustrate clear political patterns in attempts to marginalize him.

AB  - The increasing use of social media like YouTube as a news platform provides new opportunities for the public to react to news reporting. This convergence produces multi-narrative framings of police violence-related evidence that requires further attention, especially given the potential impact on state accountability processes. Using a frame analysis of news outlets and content analysis of comments on YouTube, we identify frames, responses, and the multi-narrative framing that results from this converging environment. Our findings suggest a triumvirate of competing frames around police brutality, with mistrust of media complicating the role news media plays in accountability.

AB  - Background: Although past research has focused on COVID-19-related frames in the news media, such research may not accurately capture and represent the perspectives of people from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, research on the public attention to COVID-19 as reflected through frames on social media is scarce.
   Objective: This study identified the frames about the COVID-19 pandemic in the public discourse on Twitter, which voices diverse opinions. This study also investigated the amount of public attention to those frames on Twitter.
   Methods: We collected 22 trending hashtags related to COVID-19 in the United States and 694,582 tweets written in English containing these hashtags in March 2020 and analyzed them via thematic analysis. Public attention to these frames was measured by evaluating the amount of public engagement with frames and public adoption of those frames.
   Results: We identified 9 frames including "public health guidelines," "quarantine life," "solidarity," "evidence and facts," "call for action," "politics," "post-pandemic life," "shortage panic," and "conflict." Results showed that some frames such as "call for action" are more appealing than others during a global pandemic, receiving greater public adoption and engagement. The "call for action" frame had the highest engagement score, followed by "conflict" and "evidence and facts." Additionally, "post-pandemic life" had the highest adoption score, followed by "call for action" and "shortage panic." The findings indicated that the frequency of a frame on social media does not necessarily mean greater public adoption of or engagement with the frame.
   Conclusions: This study contributes to framing theory and research by demonstrating how trending hashtags can be used as new user-generated data to identify frames on social media. This study concludes that the identified frames such as "quarantine life" and "conflict" and themes such as "isolation" and "toilet paper panic" represent the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. The consequences could be (1) exclusively related to COVID-19, such as hand hygiene or isolation; (2) related to any health crisis such as social support of vulnerable groups; and (3) generic that are irrespective of COVID-19, such as homeschooling or remote working.

AB  - This article explores the securitisation of migrations in Slovenia as a transit country for migrants during 2015-2016. We examine the representation of migrations in the printed media, social media and in political discourse. The article contributes to the theoretical debate by proposing a dynamic migration-related security continuum which takes into account the legitimate security concerns of the migrants, the transit countries, and those of the host societies. The empirical analysis explores the attempts to frame migrants in the context of securitisation. Our findings reveal that the printed media was relatively neutral in this process or even opposed the over-securitisation of migrations, whereas political actors were biased. The Slovenian government adopted a balanced approach in terms of recognising the legal rights of migrants, especially of refugees, as well as the legitimate security concerns of its own citizens. In practice however, restrictive measures were applied which contributed to the securitisation of migrations. The main opposition political party spearheaded the securitisation of migrations with a discourse based on selective information, simplification and exaggeration. Our analysis of the survey data reveals that this influenced public opinion.

The paper's objects of inquiry are an opinion article in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the reaction it instigated in the Atlanta Black Star. We argue that the contestations of signification between the dominant narrative about African Americans in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution and the rhetorical pushback it actuated in the alternative Atlanta Black Star both reproduce and legitimate dominant media framing by highlighting the alterity of subordinate ethnic groups and providing a site for contestation.

This study examines the impact of social media opinions through a multi-channel social media approach encompassing Twitter, Facebook and YouTube from February 10(th) to March 10(th), 2020. A country-wise analysis is performed for both major developed and developing economies, like the US, India, China, Italy and Iran. The analysis reveals that public opinion is unanimously negative. The impact of the pandemic on businesses, society and education has been highlighted to help formulate country-specific strategies to mitigate stigmatization of people impacted by the virus.

AB  - Media coverage plays an important role in shaping public opinion and approaching solutions to homelessness in the United States and beyond. Scant prior research has shown that stories often highlight individual rather than structural causes and solutions to the issue, while also perpetuating anti-homelessness stigma and stereotypes. However, few studies have looked specifically at the role of photography in media stories about homelessness. In this study, we used content analysis methodology to assess features of 226 photographs accompanying stories about homelessness from U.S. news media outlets in 2019. Our analysis found that presumably homeless people were frequently photographed without eye contact and were not identified by name in captions, and that photographs often featured homelessness paraphernalia (e.g. tents, shopping carts) but rarely depicted affordable housing. These findings affirmed the dehumanizing nature of news photographs about homelessness, and underscore the importance of partnering with the media to raise awareness of stigma and ultimately bring about policy change.

AB  - This study explores the rationales by which citizens both embrace and resist the notion of using peer-to-peer digital platforms to circulate persuasive political messages. Drawing upon 25 in-depth interviews with US adults who used Twitter to link to the popular YouTube video Will the Real Mitt Romney Please Stand Up? I discuss the extent to which they imagine their online activities to be potentially influencing others in certain desired ways and thus constituting an instrumental form of political participation. The resulting analysis focuses on the complex and uneasy relationship between this media-spreading activity and a marketing-like model that positions social media users as microlevel participants in aggregate campaigns to shape public opinion. While some who engage in this activity enthusiastically embrace goals of persuasion, others opt for alternative conceptual frameworks, such as fostering citizenship by informing others and sparking deliberative dialogue, that seemingly avoid the manipulative connotations of political marketing.

AB  - By adopting a scholarly perspective on comparative journalism and intercultural communication, the present study delineates the conceptual common ground in terms of defining constructive journalism (CJ) and lays out the theoretical foundation for further discussion of this practical recontextualization in China's social and cultural contexts. The indigenous tradition of "public opinion surveillance" (POS) in China is traced out in comparison with the experiment of CJ and its derivatives like public/civic journalism in Western countries. In spite of different news philosophies and media eco-systems, promoting social reform and serving the people or the public constitute the common goals for both Chinese and Western journalists and media professionals. Notably, exploring the theoretical validity and practical applications of CJ and POS would provide a feasible entry point to the cross-cultural dialogue between the East and the West about news media innovation.

AB  - Does the public in authoritarian regimes disapprove of their leaders' backing down from public threats and commitments? Answers to this question provide a critical micro-foundation for the emerging scholarship on authoritarian audience costs. We investigate this question by implementing a series of survey experiments in China, a single-party authoritarian state. Findings based on responses from 5375 Chinese adults show that empty threats and commitments expose the Chinese government to substantial disapproval from citizens concerned about potential damage to China's international reputation. Additional qualitative evidence reveals that Chinese citizens are willing to express their discontent of leaders' foreign policy blunders through various channels. These findings contribute to the ongoing debate over whether and how domestic audiences can make commitments credible in authoritarian states.

AB  - Political public relations became headline news when Kellyanne Conway, Advisor to U.S. President Trump, described provable falsehoods as alternative facts. Other memorable/misstatements became part of the cultural zeitgeist even as journalists continued to interview her. Public relations professionals are inextricably connected to the journalists who shape public opinion. The author therefore conducted a qualitative framing analysis to understand how journalists framed her occupational role and job performance. Articles from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal revealed that journalists assigned Advocacy and Gendered framing for her occupational role. Analysis also indicated that journalists alternately depicted her performance as adequate, unreliable, and manipulative. The author considers implications of findings for public relations professionals.

KW  - CRISIS COMMUNICATION
AB  - The explosion of Transocean's Deepwater Horizon, an oil-rig licensed to BP, set in motion a chain of unfortunate events that led to BP's ruptured oil well disgorging millions of gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Since the spill, the corporate image of BP has been severely challenged. The company has used many strategies to preserve and restore the corporate image, and has sought means to mitigate the intensity of the ongoing threat to individuals, businesses, and a delicate ecosystem. Among these means are interacting with individuals and interest groups through social media channels. Benoit's (1995) theory of image restoration discourse posits various strategies corporations use to restore their image during a crisis. The BP crisis presents an opportunity to extend the theories of image restoration to the realm of social media. Results of a content analysis showed that corrective action was the dominant image restoration strategy employed by BP in their Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Flickr pages. A high presence of negative emotions revealed that corrective action was not an effective means of swaying public opinion in favor of BP's efforts. Dominant themes in all four social media channels and audience comments in terms of dominant issues and emotions on Facebook and YouTube were also analyzed. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Our paper focuses on eliciting the factors that constitute threats and dangers for urban energy networks, information networks, and energy grids in the cities. Moreover, we attempt to determine how these threats are perceived by the inhabitants of those cities. Urban energy networks tend to play an increasing role in achieving energy efficiency and environmental sustainability in large urban centers. Even though they do not necessarily correspond to reality, public opinions can substantially influence the adoption of relevant technologies in populous urban locations. We use the public opinion representative survey data from the Czech Republic (a sample of 1023 respondents) in order to show how people perceive the dangers and threats for urban energy networks from such events as: (i) Extensive and long-term power outage; (ii) service disruption of the Internet, mobile networks or telephone landlines; (iii) cyber-attacks, and (iv) the technological dependence of the state on multinational technological companies. Our results demonstrate that people who live in small rural settlements and medium-sized cities tend to be more afraid of the threats and dangers from urban energy networks such as electricity and Internet outages, compared to people residing in some smaller towns. As far as there would always be a fear of the new technologies and their vulnerabilities, the local governments, mass media, and Internet resources alike should pay more attention to providing the relevant and updated information on the threats to urban energy networks for the general public.

AB  - This study examines how political activists are framing the space weaponization debate in Canada and whether their arguments can influence public attitudes and perceptions about the issue. Eighty university students from two undergraduate courses were recruited as participants in a quasi-experiment. One class (n = 38) was exposed to the documentary Masters of Space, an episode of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's program The Nature of Things, and another class (n = 42) served as the control group. Pre-test and post-test questionnaires were used to measure the effects of viewing anti-weaponization arguments in the media, while also controlling for the influence of prior beliefs and background characteristics of participants. Results suggest that visually depicting the use of satellite technology in society can convince viewers that satellites are important to their way of life, but not necessarily to the defense of North America. Framing missile defense as a 'space weapon in disguise' also seemed to raise opposition to Canada's participation in continental missile defense. The findings, meanwhile, indicate that viewers respond strongly to the issue of space debris and that mobilizing support for joint military space projects may best be achieved by emphasizing the usefulness of these projects for locating and tracking such debris. In the end, media exposure seemed to help legitimize anti-weaponization arguments based more on rational self-interests than on idealistic beliefs. These findings can have implications for the way space policies are communicated to the public. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increased use of online communication in everyday life presents a growing need to understand how people are influenced by others in such settings. In this study, online comments established social norms that directly influenced readers' expressions of prejudice both consciously and unconsciously. Participants read an online article and were then exposed to antiprejudiced or prejudiced comments allegedly posted by other users. Results revealed that exposure to prejudiced (relative to antiprejudiced) comments influenced respondents to post more prejudiced comments themselves. In addition, these effects generalized to participants' unconscious and conscious attitudes toward the target group once offline. These findings suggest that simple exposure to social information can impact our attitudes and behavior, suggesting potential avenues for social change in online environments.

AB  - How and why does protest shape participants' attitudes? We study this issue using panel data gathered both before and after Ukraine's Euromaidan protests. We argue that frames play a key role in this process. We find that protest participation increased alignment of protesters' policy preferences with the main protest frames by stabilizing existing attitudes that were in alignment and changing attitudes that conflicted with the dominant frame. Attitudes on core protest issues also became more coherent. We find no comparable effects for issues less central to the protests, and all effects vary as the framing and protest environment changed. In addition, we examine the mechanisms of attitude change, showing that while protesters also experience significant increases in efficacy, interest, and participation, these changes only partly explain attitudinal changes. These findings speak to both the short- and long-term mechanisms by which protest participation can shape public opinion.

AB  - Associative issue ownership refers to one of the prerequisites for representative democracy-public awareness of the issue priorities of competing political parties. This article addresses the question of how the instability of associative issue ownership at the micro level of individual voters, which could be due in part to election news and political discussion, adds up to the relative stability of associative issue ownership at the macro level. The data come from a panel survey and a content analysis of newspapers and television news bulletins in the 2010 Dutch Parliamentary Election Campaign. Cross-nested multilevel logistic regression models were applied to estimate the impact of political news and political discussion on different respondents for different parties and issues. The findings show how contagion, by traditional issue ownership associations, explains the relative stability at the macro level in spite of volatility at the micro level. Campaign news and political discussion increase the likelihood of contagion by traditional issue priorities of political parties, while also evoking change due to their convergence on the issues of the campaign, from which the parties that own these issues take advantage, among others the VVD and the PVV in the 2010 campaign.

AB  - This research examines how fake identities on social media create and sustain antagonistic and racist discourses. It does so by analysing 11 Danish Facebook pages, disguised as Muslim extremists living in Denmark, conspiring to kill and rape Danish citizens. It explores how anonymous content producers utilise Facebook's socio-technical characteristics to construct, what we propose to term as, platformed antagonism. This term refers to socio-technical and discursive practices that produce new modes of antagonistic relations on social media platforms. Through a discourse-theoretical analysis of posts, images, about' sections and user comments on the studied Facebook pages, the article highlights how antagonism between ethno-cultural identities is produced on social media through fictitious social media accounts, prompting thousands of user reactions. These findings enhance our current understanding of how antagonism and racism are constructed and amplified within social media environments.

AB  - Introduction: On December 31, 2020, the Chinese government announced that the domestic coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) vaccines have obtained approval for conditional marketing and are free for vaccination. This release drove the attention of the public and intense debates on social media, which reflected public attitudes to the domestic vaccine. This study examines whether the public concerns and public attitudes to domestic COVID-19 vaccines changed after the official announcement.Methods: This article used big data analytics in the research, including semantic network and sentiment analysis. The purpose of the semantic network is to obtain the public concerns about domestic vaccines. Sentiment analysis reflects the sentiments of the public to the domestic vaccines and the emotional changes by comparing the specific sentiments shown on the posts before and after the official announcement.Results: There exists a correlation between the public concerns about domestic vaccines before and after the official announcement. According to the semantic network analysis, the public concerns about vaccines have changed after the official announcement. The public focused on the performance issues of the vaccines before the official approval, but they cared more about the practical issues of vaccination after that. The sentiment analysis showed that both positive and negative emotions increased among the public after the official announcement. "Good" was the most increased positive emotion and indicated great public appreciation for the production capacity and free vaccination. "Fear" was the significantly increased negative emotion and reflected the public concern about the safety of the vaccines.Conclusion: The official announcement of the approval for marketing improved the Chinese public acceptance of the domestic COVID-19 vaccines. In addition, safety and effectiveness are vital factors influencing public vaccine hesitancy.

AB  - Background: Since March 2020, companies nationwide have started work from home (WFH) owing to the rapid increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an attempt to help prevent the disease from spreading and to rescue the economy from the pandemic. Many organizations have conducted surveys to understand people's opinions toward WFH. However, the findings are limited owing to a small sample size and the dynamic topics over time.
   Objective: This study aims to understand public opinions regarding WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Methods: We conducted a large-scale social media study using Twitter data to portray different groups of individuals who have positive or negative opinions on WFH. We performed an ordinary least squares regression analysis to investigate the relationship between the sentiment about WFH and user characteristics including gender, age, ethnicity, median household income, and population density. To better understand the public opinion, we used latent Dirichlet allocation to extract topics and investigate how tweet contents are related to people's attitude.
   Results: On performing ordinary least squares regression analysis using a large-scale data set of publicly available Twitter posts (n=28,579) regarding WFH during April 10-22, 2020, we found that the sentiment on WFH varies across user characteristics. In particular, women tend to be more positive about WFH (P<.001). People in their 40s are more positive toward WFH than those in other age groups (P<.001). People from high-income areas are more likely to have positive opinions about WFH (P<.001). These nuanced differences are supported by a more fine-grained topic analysis. At a higher level, we found that the most negative sentiment about WFH roughly corresponds to the discussion on government policy. However, people express a more positive sentiment when discussing topics on "remote work or study" and "encouragement." Furthermore, topic distributions vary across different user groups. Women pay more attention to family activities than men (P<.05). Older people talk more about work and express a more positive sentiment regarding WFH.
   Conclusions: This paper presents a large-scale social media-based study to understand the public opinion on WFH in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic. We hope that this study can contribute to policymaking both at the national and institution or company levels to improve the overall population's experience with WFH.

AB  - This commentary explores the distribution of human papilloma virus (HPV) and HPV-related diseases, and factors affecting attitudes towards HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination in the Latin American Andean region. Lack of knowledge of HPV, known negative attitudes or incorrect assumptions about HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination provide a basis upon which to develop targeted HPV awareness and preventive health media campaigns. For maximal effect, media campaigns should use the internet, radio, and television to address health care providers, parents, and students. Additional programming can be developed for clinics to use in-house with their clients. Ministries of Education, Finance, and Health all have roles to play to increase national HPV, HPV-related diseases, and HPV vaccination awareness.

AB  - With the arrival of vaccines against the novel coronavirus in late 2020, the issue of how vaccines should be distributed and which groups should be prioritized has become salient. We study popular attitudes toward the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and how these have changed over the course of the pandemic in Switzerland, drawing on data from two rounds of an original public opinion survey conducted in the spring and winter of 2020. We find that the public supports prioritizing vulnerable groups such as health care workers or the elderly. We also find a notable degree of cross-generational solidarity: younger age cohorts prioritize the elderly, while older groups prioritize (typically younger) health care workers. We then examine whether this finding is not in fact driven by vaccine hesitancy. This is not the case for older age groups, whose solidarity thus seems to be genuine. Vaccine hesitancy is an issue among younger groups, however.

AB  - How do autocrats build support? This study argues that autocrats create and maintain participatory technologies-elite-mass communication strategies that promote two-way interaction between citizens and leaders-to foster support. Participatory technologies provide citizens with the opportunity to have a limited voice in otherwise closed political systems. I test this theory through a series of two nationally-representative survey experiments in Russia. Results suggest that awareness of participatory technologies increases approval of President Putin and improves perceptions that there are opportunities for voice in politics. This finding departs from previous research that suggests public opinion is influenced primarily by participation. Furthermore, I demonstrate that these effects can be directly attributed to the communicative format of these strategies, not to issue resolution or leadership effects. Finally, I demonstrate that effects are dependent upon individuals' political sophistication and political priors, contributing to political polarization and opening up the potential for backlash against the regime.

AB  - This study examines the knowledge gap hypothesis in the United States and Singapore in the context of nanotechnology. This study proposes that academic discipline serves as a better indicator than education levels in predicting nanotechnology knowledge gaps. To reflect the contemporary media landscape, this study examines how attention to online media and documentaries alongside traditional news outlets affect individuals' nanotechnology knowledge. In both countries, online media and documentaries, as well as traditional news outlets, were related to nanotechnology knowledge to various extents. While the knowledge gap hypothesis was not observed in Singapore, results revealed that increased media attention and interpersonal discussion widened knowledge gaps between individuals from science and non-science disciplines in the United States. Education levels failed to reveal a consistent moderation effect. Taken together, the interaction analyses revealed that academic discipline predicted nanotechnology knowledge gaps more consistently than education levels in the United States. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Oriental representations of Muslims are often manifested in a society's media, literature, theatre and other creative means of expression. However, these representations, which are often historically and conceptually one-sided, have adverse repercussions for Muslims today, potentially leading to Islamophobia. Orientalism of Muslims in Western writings and discourses have been much discussed, debated and disproved, yet some works of literature continue to disseminate many of the earlier Oriental assertions about Islam/Muslims: that of being terrorists, misogynists, barbaric or uncivilized compared to the civilized West. Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina (2008) chronicles the history of Islam from the time of the Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, through the voice of his youngest wife Aisha. This paper argues that there is more to the image of the Muslim than what is portrayed by Western writers. Through an "(un)reading" of Sherry Jones' text, this paper unravels the misconceptions regarding early and forced marriage with a view to address the ways in which these misconceptions could lead to Islamophobia. Using Edward Said's theory of Contrapuntal reading, which urges the colonized to unread Western canonical texts to unearth the submerged details, this paper identifies and puts to question non-conforming depictions of Muslims in Sherry Jones' The Jewel of Medina (2008) while placing the text in its historical space-in an effort to mitigate the growing stereotyping of Muslims and to address misconceptions with regard to Islamic history.

AB  - Political bots are social media algorithms that impersonate political actors and interact with other users, aiming to influence public opinion. This study investigates the ability to differentiate bots with partisan personas from humans on Twitter. Our online experiment (N = 656) explores how various characteristics of the participants and of the stimulus profiles bias recognition accuracy. The analysis reveals asymmetrical partisan-motivated reasoning, in that conservative profiles appear to be more confusing and Republican participants perform less well in the recognition task. Moreover, Republican users are more likely to confuse conservative bots with humans, whereas Democratic users are more likely to confuse conservative human users with bots. We discuss implications for how partisan identities affect motivated reasoning and how political bots exacerbate political polarization.

AB  - Despite their low pay and clerical status, the women who staffed the National Broadcasting Company's (NBC) Information Department played an integral role in shaping the national network's program and public relations policies. As the network's first line of contact with its audience, Information Department workers influenced public opinion by shaping the networks' responses to individual audience members' written complaints. They also processed and molded the information NBC executives used to sell programming to advertisers. Still, as women, they were routinely devalued and their labor dismissed as simultaneously rote, irrelevant, and hyperemotional. This paper brings together internal documents from across NBC's corporate structure to recover the careers of Anita Barnard and Kathryn Cole, two women who managed the Information Department through the 1940s and 1950s. During this period, the network underwent enormous transitions, including the shift from radio to television and renewed threats of federal regulation. The Information Department's status waxed and waned along with NBC's need to appease its audience and recruit and retain sponsors. Barnard and Cole's status rose when audience information was at a premium, but it fell as soon as network dominance over television was established and financial returns assured.

AB  - Despite the rapid and global increase in popularity and media focus of eSports, many issues remain, not least in terms of how the media portray eSports (players). Considering Flanders (Belgium) has been relatively slow to follow this global uptake, this article adopts an inductive framing approach to analyze exhaustively how eSports are portrayed in 103 Flemish newspaper and magazine articles. Results indicate eSports were represented via eight frames spread across the categories 'game/industry' and 'players' On the one hand, the Flemish printed media legitimize eSports via comparisons with traditional sports and its applicability to capitalist frameworks such as the sport-industrial complex. On the other hand, player representations remain largely permeated with 'softer' stereotypes of laziness as well as with neglecting reference to female players. Subsequently, greater investments by the Flemish government could raise the national prominence of eSports, benefit competitive development, and help tackle issues of stereotyping in the media.

AB  - Do newspaper opinion pieces change the minds of those who read them? We conduct two randomized panel survey experiments on elite and mass convenience samples to estimate the effects of five op-eds on policy attitudes. We find very large average treatment effects on target issues, equivalent to shifts of approximately 0.5 scale points on a 7-point scale, that persist for at least one month. We find very small and insignificant average treatment effects on non-target issues, suggesting that our subjects read, understood, and were persuaded by the arguments presented in these op-eds. We find limited evidence of treatment effect heterogeneity by party identification: Democrats, Republicans, and independents all appear to move in the predicted direction by similar magnitudes. We conduct this study on both a sample of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers and a sample of elites. Despite large differences in demographics and initial political beliefs, we find that op-eds were persuasive to both the mass public and elites, but marginally more persuasive among the mass public. Our findings add to the growing body of evidence of the everyday nature of persuasion.

AB  - Even though social investment is highly popular, welfare state recalibration remains an uphill battle. When resources are scarce in times of austerity, welfare recalibration involves multidimensional trade-offs. Existing research primarily studied preferences toward individual policies or trade-offs in specific policy fields, failing to capture citizens' overall social policy priorities. Using two novel survey experiments in three European countries, we show that citizens have clear social policy priorities: pensions and education enjoy a high, family policies a medium, and labor market policies a low priority. However, policy constituencies differ in their relative priorities. Our findings suggest that welfare state recalibration is difficult because trade-offs are unpopular, and distributive conflicts in mature welfare states are mainly about distributing resources to specific social groups.

AB  - This study revisited the state-press relations theory by analyzing the coverage of Vietnam over the 30 years between 1980 and 2009 in two leading American news magazines, Time and Newsweek. A contribution of this research is its context of the long-term and volatile relationship between these two countries. Despite progress in the diplomatic relations between the United States and Vietnam, the portrayal of Vietnam in US media remained unchanged. This finding indicates that American media do not always support the US government's political stance when covering international news. It suggests a new direction for future research applying this theory.

AB  - We propose an Attention-LSTM neural network model to study the systemic risk early warning of China. Based on text mining, the network public opinion index is constructed and used as a training set to be incorporated into the early warning model to test the early warning effect. The results show that: (i) the network public opinion is the non-linear Granger causality of systemic risk. (ii) The Attention-LSTM neural network has strong generalization ability. Early warning effects have been significantly improved. (iii) Compared with the BP neural network model, the SVR model and the ARIMA model, the LSTM neural network early warning model has a higher accuracy rate, and its average prediction accuracy for systemic risk indicators has been improved over short, medium and long terms. When the attention mechanism is included in the LSTM, the Attention-LSTM neural network model is even more accurate in all the cases.

AB  - Public opinion on complex policy questions is shaped by the ways in which elites simplify the issues. Given the prevalence of metaphor and analogy as tools for cognitive problem solving, the deployment of analogies is often proposed as a tool for this kind of influence. For instance, a prominent explanation for the acceptance of austerity is that voters understand government deficits through an analogy to household borrowing. Indeed, there are theoretical reasons to think the household finance analogy represents a most likely case for the causal influence of analogical reasoning on policy preferences. This article examines this best-case scenario using original survey data from the United Kingdom. It reports observational and experimental analyses that find no evidence of causation running from the household analogy to preferences over the government budget. Rather, endorsement of the analogy is invoked ex post to justify support for fiscal consolidation.

AB  - Public behavior in cyberspace is extremely sensitive to emergency disaster events. Using appropriate methodologies to capture the semantic evolution of social media users' behaviors and discover how it varies across geographic space and time still presents a significant challenge. This study proposes a novel framework based on complex network, topic model, and GIS to describe the topic change of social media users' behaviors during disaster events. The framework employs topic modeling to extract topics from social media texts, builds a user semantic evolution model based on a complex network to describe topic dynamics, and analyzes the spatio-temporal characteristics of public semantics evolution. The proposed framework has demonstrated its effectiveness in analyzing the semantic spatial-temporal evolution of Chinese Weibo user behavior during COVID-19. The semantic change in response to COVID-19 was characterized by obvious expansion, frequent change, and gradual stabilization over time. In this case, there were obvious geographical differences in users' semantic changes, which were mainly concentrated in the capital and economically developed areas. The semantics of users finally focused on specific topics related to positivity, epidemic prevention, and factual comments. Our work provides new insight into the behavioral response to disasters and provides the basis for data-driven public sector decisions. In emergency situations, this model could improve situational assessment, assist decision makers to better comprehend public opinion, and support analysts in allocating resources of disaster relief appropriately.

TI  - Language revitalization, video, and mobile social media: A case study from the Khroskyabs language amongst Tibetans in China
T2  - LANGUAGE DOCUMENTATION & CONSERVATION
LA  - English
AB  - Technology is by no means the most important channel to maintain a language, but it is an effective mode to communicate and interact using the language. As the lives of Khroskyabs speakers continue to be modernized, fewer and fewer aspects of those lives will take place in Khroskyabs. Furthermore, Khroskyabs speakers tend to express negative attitudes towards their language, especially in comparison to the dominant national language - Mandarin - and the local prestige language - Tibetan. The Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media project aims to expand the Khroskyabs language into a new domain amongst its speakers by creating a series of videos in the language and sharing them on social media-WeChat. The emerging use of social media such as WeChat provides a platform for language use in the contemporary context for unrecognized and under-resourced languages like Khroskyabs. This project aimed to address these issues, of domain exclusion and negative attitudes, through the production of mobile digital media that can be freely and conveniently shared via the social media platform WeChat for consumption of people in the Khroskyabs-speaking community.

FX  - I am a native speaker of Khroskyabs, from Siyuewu Village in Rngaba Prefecture, Sichuan Province, China. I was born and raised in the village and recently graduated from the University of Oregon with a linguistics degree. I began making videos about my community whilst in high school. I would like to thank and acknowledge my community for their ongoing support. I would also like to acknowledge the Smithsonian Center for Folklife and Cultural Heritage (SCFCH) and the Northwest Indian Language Institute (NILI) at the University of Oregon for their financial and institutional support for the Mothertongue Film on Mobile Social Media Project. The writing of this article was supported by a seed-funding grant from the China Studies Research Centre at La Trobe University (Australia). In the near future, I hope to come up with many other ways to preserve Khroskyabs people's customs, culture, and language.

AB  - It is often argued that right-wing populist party leaders are dependent on the media for their public image, which in turn is key for their electoral success. This study tests this assumption by comparing the effects of the media coverage of 2 Dutch right-wing populist leaders with the effects of the coverage of leaders of established parties, in a real-life setting, by tracking campaign developments in the Dutch 2006 national election campaign. We combine panel survey data (n = 401) with repeated measurements of the party leaders' public images with a systematic content analysis of 17 media outlets (with a total of 1,001 stories), on the basis of the media consumption of individual respondents. Our results show significant effects of the content of media coverage on the public image of political leaders. However, only in 1 case (out of 10) is there a significant difference between right-wing populist party leaders and leaders of other parties in the strength of media effects. It thus seems that leaders of right-wing populist parties are just as dependent upon the media as leaders of other parties. The findings are discussed in the light of extant research on right-wing populist parties and media populism.

AB  - Public concern over major agricultural product safety incidents, such as swine flu and avian flu, can intensify financial losses in the livestock and poultry industries. Crawler technology were applied to reviewed the Weibo social media discussions on the African Swine Fever (ASF) incident in China that was reported on 3 August 2018, and used content analysis and network analysis to specifically examine the online public opinion network dissemination characteristics of verified individual users, institutional users and ordinary users. It was found that: (1) attention paid to topics related to "epidemic," "treatment," "effect" and "prevent" decrease in turn, with the interest in "prevent" increasing significantly when human infections were possible; (2) verified individual users were most concerned about epidemic prevention and control and play a supervisory role, the greatest concern of institutional users and ordinary users were issues related to agricultural industry and agricultural products price fluctuations respectively; (3) among institutional users, media was the main opinion leader, and among non-institutional users, elites from all walks of life, especially the food safety personnel acted as opinion leaders. Based on these findings, some policy suggestions are given: determine the nature of the risk to human health of the safety incident, stabilizing prices of relevant agricultural products, and giving play to the role of information dissemination of relevant institutions.

AB  - Personality disorders, such as psychopathy, have a long history of stigmatization. Psychopaths are continually presented as criminals and feared due to their supposed aggressive tendencies, stemming from the excessive labelling of murderers as psychopaths by the media and popular culture. While previous research demonstrates the extent to which individuals stigmatize psychopaths, it is not yet known if psychopaths stigmatize other psychopaths. We hypothesized that individuals who displayed a high level of psychopathic traits, especially in adaptive components, would exhibit less stigma-related behaviors towards psychopaths. One hundred and sixteen participants (N = 116) from the community completed three questionnaires assessing their expression of psychopathic personality traits and stigma towards psychopaths. The presence of psychopathic traits, particularly those related to boldness, was negatively correlated with the degree of stigmatizing behaviors towards psychopaths. Findings are explained in terms of identification with psychopaths and the fearlessness component of psychopathy. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - When the world's first face transplant was performed in France in 2005, the complex medical procedure and accompanying worldwide media attention sparked many ethical issues, including how the media covered the story. This study uses framing theory to examine what happens when media ethics intersect with bioethics by analyzing French, American, and British media coverage on the transplant and its aftermath. This study looks at how this story was framed and which bioethical issues were focused upon. The media ethical implications of these findings are then discussed. By doing so, this article attempts to contribute to the debate on how complex medical stories with bioethical components can be reported in an ethical manner.

AB  - Why did Japanese Prime Minister Abe impose controversial export restrictions after rulings by the South Korean Supreme Court on wartime forced laborers? This article answers this question through the lens of domestic symbolism in economic sanctions studies. We argue that domestic political calculations led the Japanese government to adopt hawkish measures against South Korea. Abe wanted to ensure continued support from his constituents and to win the upcoming election. A series of political reforms since the early 1990s have empowered the prime minister and made LDP politicians pay more attention to public opinion than to factional topography. Strong anti-Korean sentiment among the Japanese public reduced the leadership's concerns about the audience costs of economic countermeasures. Through an examination of the interplay among various domestic actors over the policy measure, this study provides insights on how domestic symbolism can serve as an origin of foreign policy decision-making in democracies.

AB  - The media has been found to have an impact on public debate, public opinion, and public policy agendas. Public debate, and public opinion about water conservation and water supply management projects matter because they can influence specific outcomes. For example, public opinion can potentially lead to positive behaviour, like increased water conservation, or potentially negative behaviours such as public opposition to developments such as dams or water recycling plants, which may be necessary under changing climatic conditions. It is therefore critical to understand how the media reports on water-related topics. Results from a content analysis of 1253 newspaper articles published in Australia in 2008 indicate that water-related reports are characterised by lack of inclusion of views held by various stakeholders, a low level of support of statements with scientific evidence, a low level of impartiality in the sense of reporting on opposing views and a relatively high level of hedging, meaning that the author signals that there is some uncertainly about the reported information. In sum these tendencies could theoretically culminate to work against public engagement in water issues and undermine the public's understanding of and confidence in water management measures. Proactive measures of media management are recommended. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective : To examine the extent and nature of news coverage of a government-funded population monitoring survey of children and the potential implications of this coverage for public health advocacy. Methods : Case study of the NSW Schools Physical Activity and Nutrition Survey (SPANS), a population monitoring survey of school-aged children's weight and weight-related behaviours, conducted in 1997, 2004 and 2010. Printed news items from all Australian newspapers between January 1997 and December 2011 mentioning the survey findings were identified from the Factiva database and a descriptive analysis of the content conducted. Results : Overall, 144 news items were identified. The news angles focused mainly on physical activity/sedentary behaviour; overweight/obesity and nutrition; however these angles changed between 1997 and 2011, with angles focused on physical activity/sedentary behaviour increasing, compared with overweight/obesity and nutrition angles (p=0.001). Responsibility for obesity and weight-related behaviours was most frequently assigned to parents and food marketing, and the most common solutions were policy strategies and parental/child education and support. Conclusions : Population health surveys are newsworthy and when coupled with strategic dissemination, media can contribute to communicating health issues and interpreting findings in ways that are relevant for consumers, policy makers and stakeholders. Implications : This case study emphasises the news value of government-funded population surveys, while providing a cautionary note about media focus on individual studies rather than a larger body of research evidence.

KW  - role model
AB  - This article presents findings of a narrative analysis of the lateral use of models by Chinese public opinion generators to shape the behaviours of the people. It begins with lexical, sociological and narratological explanations of the meaning of a Chinese model, before presenting a general introduction of Chinese models as a phenomenon, including the hype usually involved in their making and propagating. It then proceeds to a narrative analysis of the singular good-sounding story usually told by Chinese models. The focus of the article, though, is a narrative case study based on a prolonged search for a model named Cadeer, an ethnic Uyghur from Xinjiang Autonomous Region and on his deferred final discovery. From this, the author presents several arguments. First, Cadeer does not tell a typical good-sounding story. Second, not retelling the good-sounding story deferred his final discovery. Third, his deferred but eventual rise to modeldom is an indication of the continued obsession with the use of models for mass persuasion in China, a sign of changing times and of the changing media environment in the country, as well as a reflection of its ever-intensifying interethnic tension.

AB  - The article investigates how the poor and welfare recipients are depicted in British, Danish and Swedish newspapers. The study was inspired by American media studies that have documented a negative stereotypic way of portraying the poor and welfare recipients, especially when they are African Americans. The article argues that there is an institutional welfare regime logic behind the way the poor and welfare recipients are depicted in the mass media. It is not only a matter of race. This argument is substantiated by showing that the poor and welfare recipients are (1) also depicted negatively in a liberal welfare regime, the UK, where most of the poor and welfare recipients are perceived to be white, and (2) depicted positively in two social-democratic welfare regimes, Sweden and Denmark, where the poor and welfare recipients have increasingly come to be perceived as non-white, especially in Denmark. The empirical analyses are based on a sample of 1750 British, 1750 Danish and 1750 Swedish newspapers covering the period from 2004 to 2009.

AB  - Public discourse regarding the Roma has been heated in many western European countries. This study investigates whether feelings of disgust, elicited through negative media portrayals, can lead to more dehumanization and support of deportation toward this minority. While Study 1 (N=30) validated a measure of dehumanization in the Norwegian context, Study 2 (N=195) experimentally tested whether disgust-eliciting media portrayals would increase dehumanization tendencies on this validated measure and support of deportation toward the Roma. As expected, reading a newspaper article focusing on allegedly low hygienic standards among the Roma increased the feeling of disgust, which, in turn, led to higher degrees of dehumanization and support of deportation. While being the first study experimentally showing that disgust leads to dehumanization of a real societal minority group, the results also have important implications for how media discusses and presents social issues regarding devalued minority groups.

AB  - Negative emotional contagion along with sentiment mutation through information propagation on social media is critical for mitigating disinformation and directing public opinion for compliance with key public interventions, such as vaccine uptake during a pandemic. Here, we develop a dynamic multiple negative emotional susceptible-forwarding-immune (MNE-SFI) model to examine how negative emotion spreads on social media and how sentiment mutation impacts by fitting the model to real multiple temporal information in messages with sentiments obtained from the Chinese Sina microblog. Emotional choices, meaning that individuals attempting to spread information are not only influenced by the objective emotions embedded in the influential information spread by influencers but also by subjective emotional tendencies, is an essential human behavior for information propagation. Hence, we seek to link the negative emotional contagion in the network at the macroscopic level to the emotional choices of individuals, and model parameters are used at the microcosmic level to measure the "copying" and "mutation" probabilities of negative sentiments in an event. Our results illustrate the emotional choices of users play essential roles in methods for mitigating harmful emotion spread and promoting meaningful emotion diffusion. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Objective. We explain how economic and political predictors shaped levels of American media coverage of the European financial crisis between 2008 and 2012. Methods. We link exchange rates, unemployment rates, inflation, trade, protests, votes of no confidence, elections, and U.S. presidential remarks with financial crisis stories produced by The New York Times, the Associated Press, and television newscasts. Error-correction modeling is utilized to determine whether relationships exist contemporaneously and across future months. Results. We find evidence across multiple models that changes in the exchange rate and elections shaped levels of media coverage. We find some evidence that votes of no confidence, protests, change in unemployment, and presidential remarks matter as well. Conclusion. A combination of economic change, specific political events, and broader newsworthiness norms journalists utilize in determining which stories are worthy of attention drove American coverage of the European financial crisis.

AB  - Several researchers declared that the telephone survey reaches more accurate voting tendencies than the face-to-face surveys. Telephone survey shows numerous advantages compared to a face-to-face one but, however, the telephone survey also has some inconveniences. Among these it is important to highlight the scant quality of the sampling frame; absence of a telephone in some homes and the wide expansion of the mobile phone; low response rate of certain collectives and the overrepresentation of others. There are also some new barrierswhich make access more difficult (e.g. the automatic answering phone) and the saturation of the telephone medium because of the large amount of publicity activities which generate a large number of "unsuccessful" calls and interruptedinterviews. The objective of this paper is evaluating the adaptation of the telephone surveys in the electoral forecasts; in an attempt to see if it shows substantial improvements when they are compared to face-to-face interviews.

AB  - While much of the scholarship on populist political communication focuses on its content and a verbal style, less is known about the nonverbal cues accompanying populist messages. This paper aims in filling that gap by providing findings of the study on characteristics of nonverbal communication of two Polish presidential candidates: Bronislaw Komorowski and Andrzej Duda, traced during two debates broadcast on television before the second round of the presidential elections in 2015. The results revealed that both candidates employed nonverbal cues such as appearance, eye contact, facial expressions, or gestures that emphasized their references towards the people or negative attitudes towards elites expressed in their verbal messages. The study also proved that the methods used previously in research on nonverbal content on television (observational protocols and analysis of facial expressions) may be successfully employed in studies on nonverbal components of the populist style of communication.

AB  - The political term "women of color" (WOC) emerged in the late 1970s in Black feminist organizing spaces as a rejection of a singular emphasis on a woman identity. At that time, a WOC identity signaled a political commitment to solidarity politics. Currently, the term "women of color" (WOC) is used by the media and among politicians but without much explicit discussion of its history. Given WOC's continued presence in American politics, the question remains, who identifies as a WOC today and does the identity continue to hold political meaning? We examine Black women and Latinas and find the majority of Latinas and Black women self-identify as WOC and see it as an important part of their identity. Consistent with our expectations, the WOC identity is more likely to be taken up and regarded as important by native-born Latinas and Afro-Latinas compared with other Latinas. While past research has examined racial and gender consciousness, ours is the first public opinion study to examine whether there is continued utility in a WOC identity.

AB  - News coverage of obesity has increased dramatically in recent years, and research shows that media content may contribute to negative public attitudes toward obese people. However, no work has assessed whether photographic portrayals of obese people that accompany news stories affect attitudes. In the present study, the authors used a randomized experimental design to test whether viewing photographic portrayals of an obese person in a stereotypical or unflattering way (versus a nonstereotypical or flattering portrayal) could increase negative attitudes about obesity, even when the content of an accompanying news story is neutral. The authors randomly assigned 188 adult participants to read a neutral news story about the prevalence of obesity that was paired with 1 of 4 photographic portrayals of an obese adult (or no photograph). The authors subsequently assessed attitudes toward obese people using the Fat Phobia Scale. Participants in all conditions expressed a moderate level of fat phobia (M=3.83, SD=0.58). Results indicated that participants who viewed the negative photographs expressed more negative attitudes toward obese people than did those who viewed the positive photographs. Implications of these findings for the media are discussed, with emphasis on increasing awareness of weight bias in health communication and journalistic news reporting.

AB  - Using critical discourse analysis, this study assesses reader comments to newspaper articles on the Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin Supreme Court case. The Fisher case challenges the consideration of race in the college admissions process at UT. Findings show that this racial equity practice was framed as being antithetical to individualism, merit, and competition. Many comments, divorced from social and historical contexts, used colorblind rationale to justify their opposition to affirmative action yet relied heavily on popular polarizing racial discourse in their argumentation. Social policy implications related to facilitating college diversity and promoting educational equity are presented.

AB  - This article examines the coverage of legislative lobbying in European news media. The starting point thereby is that lobbying in the crowded European Union (EU)-level interest community is not only a struggle for direct access to policymakers, but that in order to realize policy goals many interest groups rely on political attention generated by the media. Our main research question is how media attention is skewed toward particular interests and which factors explain these varying levels of prominence. Our empirical analysis is based on a set of 125 legislative proposals adopted by the European Commission between 2008 and 2010. For all these cases we identified 379 interest organizations that made public statements, we coded the amount of media attention these organized interests gained, the type of statements they made as well as some key organizational features. While the aggregate levels of attention look pretty balanced, our evidence shows that media prominence is skewed toward particular types of interests; in particular that organized interests which oppose a proposed policy gain significantly higher levels of media attention.

AB  - Information and communication technologies enable migrants to maintain bonds with multiple communities. Little is known about the association between migrants' connections to their country of origin and different integration practices in online and offline communities in the receiving society. We draw on a survey conducted amongst migrants in Iceland (N = 2,139) and conduct three regression analyses to identify determinants of migrants' use of media and social media from their country of origin. Contrary to other studies, we do not find evidence of reactive transnationalism (i.e., migrants seeking out connections to their places of origin due to dissatisfaction with life in the receiving society) as a response to negative attitudes towards the receiving society. We identify distinct patterns of online and offline integration: Migrants with frequent contact with their countries of origin are less integrated locally in terms of offline activities. However, they are more integrated in digital communities of the receiving society, and use receiving-country media more frequently, thus following a strategy of digital biculturalism.

AB  - The coronavirus public health crisis is also a political-communication and health-communication crisis. In this article, the authors describe the key communication-related phenomena and evidence of concerning effects manifested in the United States during the initial response to the pandemic. The authors outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute to deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. The authors suggest these have contributed to divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities with COVID-19 disease outcomes. The authors conclude with some suggestions for future research, particularly surrounding communication about health inequity and strategies for reducing partisan divergence in views of public health issues in the future.

AB  - The advancement of technology, the expansion of global networks, and the shift from print media to digital and social media have brought in a drastic change to human lifestyle. With the shrinking of the world because of the advancement of technology, identities get mutated and transformed according to the need. The development of modern societies denotes how the "self" has become a "reflexive project" where individuals construct identities mediated by symbolic materials. It is through the culture of media that people forge their identities by shaping their political views and social behavior. As such, this article is an attempt to analyze how the pandemic has brought a "new normal" to our lives. With months of lockdown, changing work spaces, education, lifestyle- habits, and priorities, each one of us has shifted to a visually imagined community, which not only marks a paradigmatic shift from the print culture to a new era of visual culture, but also reshapes the socio-cultural imagination dominated by media and visual images. Furthermore, delving in the question of surveillance, this article highlighting the Indian context, also aims to evaluate the functioning of a multicultural liberal state, and its constant struggle with the politics of power and identity.

AB  - North Korea is waging psychological warfare, through the internet, to erode the morale of the South Korean combatants. This study aims to examine whether the widespread use of the internet among the South Korean combatants has a significant effect on their belief in rumors allegedly originating from North Korean propaganda, for two reasons. First, South Korea's psychological counter-operation has been accused of inducing South Korean combatants to promote hatred and prejudice against the progressive political parties that support North Korean regime, causing harm to South Korea's democracy. Second, there is little empirical research on the effects of South Korea's psychological counter-operation on the individual's rumor belief and transmission. Results from a survey conducted among 707 South Korean combatants indicate that military education aimed to refute North Korea's propaganda, statistically speaking, significantly decreased their belief in rumor, but it did not decrease the likelihood of rumor transmission. What was found to be conducive to rumor transmission was the individual's social relations. Our analysis implies that internet use has a significant effect on the belief in and transmission of North Korean propaganda, but its effect can be moderated by various intervening factors.

AB  - Guided by the belief that anonymity inevitably breeds the kind of uncivil discourse that hurts their readers, many news organizations have chosen to ban anonymous comments sections on their websites in recent years. Unfortunately, little empirical research has been conducted to assess whether exposure to anonymous comments actually does influence people's attitudes. In this paper, we address this oversight by asking: do anonymous comments posted on a newspaper website shape how internet users feel about the media? Using an online experiment to systematically manipulate exposure to anonymous comments attached to a "hard news" report, we find strong evidence that exposure to non-attributed posts-regardless of their tone-leads internet users to feel more negatively towards specific news organizations and the media in general.

It considers the proliferation of these differently adapted texts across a range of platforms in the context of a converging and market driven media landscape, including associated book trailers, an interactive eBook, a video game, and media reviews. It argues that the texts signal, configure, and perhaps even mask contemporary fears and anxieties over class and race, and the social processes of commodification under capitalism.

AB  - Since 2004, online social media (OSN) have evolved hugely. This fast development had interesting effects to increase the connection and information exchange of users, but some negative effects also appeared, including fake accounts number growing day after day.
   The sockpuppets are the multiple fake accounts created by the same user. They are the source of several types of manipulation such as those created to praise, defend or support a person or organization or to manipulate public opinion.
   In this article, we present SocksCatch, a complete process to detect and group sockpuppets which is composed of three main phases: first phase is the data collection and selection; second phase is the detection of the sockpuppet accounts using machine learning algorithms; third phase is the grouping of sockpuppet accounts created by the same user using graph theory.
   Experiments have been performed for the three phases using real data crawled from english Wikipedia. The results compare six machine learning algorithms for the detection phase and show that SocksCatch detects between 89% and 95% of the selected sockpuppets depending on the algorithms. We also compare five community detection algorithms for the grouping phase, and show that SocksCatch's grouped sock puppets and the real sockpuppet's groups are similar between 80% and 88%, according to the cluster's comparison measures: normalized variation of information (NVI) and normalized mutual information (NMI).

AB  - Conflicts in the 21st century differ from past conflicts based on two central factors: the level of asymmetry and disparity between the actors taking part in the conflict and the amount of foreign media coverage that a conflict receives. This article aims to develop a new theoretical perspective on the implications of these two factors on how the involved states manage a conflict. Most actors in current conflicts have vast levels of disparity and receive extensive media coverage; events in those conflicts are referred to as occurrences in the information space because a conflict's borders are anywhere people can receive information about it. Imagefarethe use of images as a guiding principle or a substitute for traditional military means to achieve political objectivesis argued to be the main tool for better facing adversaries in the information space.

AB  - Background The USA must publicly share information about harmful and potentially harmful constituents (chemicals) in tobacco products. We sought to understand whether webpages with chemical information are "understandable and not misleading to a lay person." Methods Participants were a national probability sample of US adults and adolescents (n=1441, 18% smokers). In an online experiment, we randomly assigned participants to view one of the developed webpages (chemical names only, names with quantity ranges, names with visual risk indicators) or no webpage in phase one (between subjects). Participants completed a survey assessing knowledge, misunderstanding, perceived likelihood, perceived severity of health effects from smoking and quit intentions (smokers only). In phase two (within subjects), participants viewed all three webpage formats and reported webpage perceptions (clarity, usability, usefulness) and perceived impact (affect, elaboration, perceived effectiveness). Results In phase one, viewing any webpage led to more knowledge of chemicals (48%-54% vs 28% no webpage,ps<0.001) and health harms (77% vs 67% no webpage,ps<0.001). When exposed to any webpage, 5%-23% endorsed misunderstandings that some cigarettes are safer than others. Webpage format did not affect knowledge or reduce misunderstandings. Viewing any webpage led to higher perceived likelihood of experiencing health effects from smoking (p<0.001) and, among smokers, greater intentions to quit smoking (p=0.04). In phase two, where participants viewed all formats, a visual risk indicator led to the highest perceived impact. Conclusions Knowledge of chemicals and health effects can increase after viewing a website. Yet, websites may not correct the misunderstanding that some cigarettes are safer.

KW  - BLOGS
AB  - What motivates Chinese media campaigns during foreign policy disputes, and how are they carried out? "Influence campaigns" are often recognized as highly pertinent to international security, yet they remain understudied. This article develops and tests a theory that explains these media campaigns as strategic actions to align domestic public opinion when it deviates from the state's preferred foreign policy, exploiting the media's mobilization or pacification effect. These divergent media effects correspond to two types of media campaigns, respectively-mobilization campaigns and pacification campaigns. The pacification campaigns are particularly important because they indicate that hawkish rhetoric may counterintuitively pacify the public, and hence its adoption implies a moderate foreign policy intent. A medium-N congruence test of 21 Chinese diplomatic crises and process tracing of the 2016 Sino-Philippines arbitration case offer strong support for the theory and demonstrate how a pacification campaign works and how it differs from a mobilization campaign.

AB  - This article looks at explanatory approaches of fear of terrorism. Until now, empirical studies looking at determinants of fear of terrorism have used the theoretical framework from the field of research regarding fear of crime. We argue that the cognitive link between terrorism and Islam is currently so strong that explanatory models should include measures of attitudes towards Muslims. On an argumentative level, the fear of crime theoretical framework is unconvincing. Our empirical analysis using structural equation modelling shows that fear of terrorism shares almost no determinants with the fear of violent crime. Negative attitudes towards Muslims are the strongest determinant of fear of terrorism and totally mediate all other effects. Discussions about tackling the issue of fear of terrorism should consider these findings as solutions may otherwise be inappropriate, at best. At worst, solutions based on an improper understanding of the determinants of fear of terrorism may serve only to exacerbate the problem.

Comparative analysis reveals how the two jurisdictions differ in treatment of 'non-fault' scenarios and their underlying visions of shareholder protection. Potential reform of the UK's withdrawal regime based on German and Singapore law is also explored.

AB  - The European economic crisis, the migratory crisis and the Brexit in the UK are the main causes of the increasing negative moods of the European Union citizens. The research offers a comparative analysis of pupils' and teachers' viewpoints on European citizenship and European identity in selected two Visegrad Group countries. The research held in the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic in the fourth quarter of 2017 on the research sample of 1,973 respondents shows that the Slovak pupils and their teachers have in most cases more positive attitudes towards European citizenship and European identity than Czech pupils and their teachers. The responding Slovak pupils are more proud of being citizens of the European Union, less skeptic of the EU's activities and believe in the future of the European Union.
   On the other hand, the Czech pupils and teachers are more proud of the membership of the Czech Republic in the EU, as well as of the Czech activities in the European Union. In this context, the authors point out that a more intensive education relating to the European citizenship and Europeanism could increase positive attitudes towards European identity and membership in the European Union. The European dimension of education is still up to date not only in the old member states of the European Union but also in the new ones or future member states. Citizenship education unifies several social fields and disciplines including education to Europeanism, environmental, global, media, multicultural, personal and social education, and education relating to democracy and constitutionality.

AB  - With the advances of information communication technologies, it is critical to improve the efficiency and accuracy of emergency management systems through modern data processing techniques. Geographic information system (GIS) models and simulation capabilities are used to exercise response and recovery plans during non-disaster times. They help the decision-makers understand near real-time possibilities during an event. In this paper, a participatory sensing-based model for mining spatial information of urban emergency events is introduced. Firstly, basic definitions of the proposed method are given. Secondly, positive samples are selected to mine the spatial information of urban emergency events. Thirdly, location and GIS information are extracted from positive samples. At last, the real spatial information is determined based on address and GIS information. Moreover, this study explores data mining, statistical analysis, and semantic analysis methods to obtain valuable information on public opinion and requirements based on Chinese microblog data. Typhoon Chan-hom is used as an example. Semantic analysis on microblog data is conducted and high-frequency keywords in different provinces are extracted for different stages of the event. With the geo-tagged and time-tagged data, the collected microblog data can be classified into different categories. Correspondingly, public opinion and requirements can be obtained from the spatial and temporal perspectives to enhance situation awareness and help the government offer more effective assistance.

AB  - Social media rumor precise governance is conducive to better coping with the difficulties of rumor monitoring within massive information and improving rumor governance effectiveness. This paper proposes a conceptual framework of social media rumor precise governance system based on literature mining. Accordingly, insightful directions for achieving social media rumor precise governance are introduced, which includes (1) rational understanding of social media rumors, especially large-scale spreading false rumors and recurring false rumors; (2) clear classification of rumor spreaders/believers/refuters/unbelievers; (3) scientific evaluation of rumor governance effectiveness and capabilities. For the above three directions, advanced analysis technologies applications are then summarized. This paper is beneficial to clarify and promote the promising thought of social media rumor precise governance and create impacts on the technologies' applications in this area.

AB  - Social media have become a major venue where citizens discuss matters of public concern, prompting some scholars to apply theory of the public sphere to analyze online discussion. However, the public sphere is often viewed as a static space; little attention is given to the complex processes through which topics are raised, debated, and refined by the public through this discussion. This study conceptualizes the public sphere as a problematization process and proposes a novel framework combining a four-phase process analysis together with content analysis to analyze public deliberation process on social media. A case study is conducted of public discussion on Sina Weibo about municipal policy in Hangzhou, China. Data generated using the framework illustrate how social media function as a filtering mechanism, channeling salient public opinions from civil society to decision-making bodies in the center of the politicolegal system, where these opinions play a role in policy decision-making. This paper provides analytic leverage for understanding the relevance of public sphere theory to policymaking processes.

AB  - Edith Cavell's death by a German firing squad in 1915 proved to be a significant moment for First World War propaganda. News of the British nurse's death caused a torrent of outrage in Britain and around the world, inspired thousands of Allied troops to enlist and helped sway US opinion against Germany. Newspapers, as the principal source of communication between the government and the people, were essential in relaying this message and this article studies the roles played by the Daily Mail, the Manchester Guardian and the Daily Express. The results show the newspapers were eager participants as Britain sought to stiffen public hostility towards Germany and justify the suffering on the Western Front and at home. This article also examines the immediate post-war period as the newspapers changed from persuaders to reflectors of public opinion.

AB  - This study offers a systematic comparison of automated content analysis tools. The ability of different lexicons to correctly identify affective tone (e.g., positive vs. negative) is assessed in different social media environments. Our comparisons examine the reliability and validity of publicly available, off-the-shelf classifiers. We use datasets from a range of online sources that vary in the diversity and formality of the language used, and we apply different classifiers to extract information about the affective tone in these datasets. We first measure agreement (reliability test) and then compare their classifications with the benchmark of human coding (validity test). Our analyses show that validity and reliability vary with the formality and diversity of the text; we also show that ready-to-use methods leave much space for improvement when analyzing domain-specific content and that a machine-learning approach offers more accurate predictions across communication domains.

AB  - The interplay between news coverage of preelection polls and voters' assessments of bias has been well documented. Less known, but theoretically more important, is how it may play out in a media context that highly parallels political camps. The 2012 Taiwanese presidential election provides an ideal case to observe how voters' perception of hostile poll coverage might be affected by media partisanship in election campaigns. Against this backdrop, we first confirmed that voters reported greater perceptions of hostile bias when seeing disagreeable poll results. The polarized and divided media setting further shaped voters' reactions to poll coverage. Voters saw greater hostile poll bias in out-group media than in in-group media. Consequences of such perceived hostility, however, appeared inconsistent and mixed.

AB  - Background: The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented challenges to every country worldwide. A call for global vaccination for COVID-19 plays a pivotal role in the fight against this virus. With the development of COVID-19 vaccines, public willingness to get vaccinated has become an important public health concern, considering the vaccine hesitancy observed worldwide. Social media is powerful in monitoring public attitudes and assess the dissemination, which would provide valuable information for policy makers. Objective: This study aimed to investigate the responses of vaccine positivity on social media when major public events (major outbreaks) or major adverse events related to vaccination (COVID-19 or other similar vaccines) were reported. Methods: A total of 340,783 vaccine-related posts were captured with the poster's information on Weibo, the largest social platform in China. After data cleaning, 156,223 posts were included in the subsequent analysis. Using pandas and SnowNLP Python libraries, posts were classified into 2 categories, positive and negative. After model training and sentiment analysis, the proportion of positive posts was computed to measure the public positivity toward the COVID-19 vaccine. Results: The positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines in China tends to fluctuate over time in the range of 45.7% to 77.0% and is intuitively correlated with public health events. In terms of gender, males were more positive (70.0% of the time) than females. In terms of region, when regional epidemics arose, not only the region with the epidemic and surrounding regions but also the whole country showed more positive attitudes to varying degrees. When the epidemic subsided temporarily, positivity decreased with varying degrees in each region. Conclusions: In China, public positivity toward COVID-19 vaccines fluctuates over time and a regional epidemic or news on social media may cause significant variations in willingness to accept a vaccine. Furthermore, public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination vary from gender and region. It is crucial for policy makers to adjust their policies through the use of positive incentives with prompt responses to pandemic-related news to promote vaccination acceptance.

AB  - The idea of American exceptionalism has lived a long and vibrant life in U.S. politics. In recent years, however, many have suggested that the United States might be losing its edge in world affairs. Little research has sought to examine the effects that these explicit challenges to American exceptionalism might have on U.S. public opinion. With this in mind, we conducted an experiment in which a large sample of U.S. adults was exposed to such messages. Specifically, drawing on social identity theory, we explore the psychological dynamics that shape how U.S. adults might respond to messages that directly challenge the idea of American exceptionalism depending on whether these challenges come from competitor countries (e.g., China and Britain) or noncompetitor countries (e.g., Australia and Mexico). Our findings suggest that challenges to this idea have a significant impact on (1) U.S. adults' sense of American exceptionalism, (2) their willingness to actively degrade other countries, and (3) their attributions of responsibility for the United States' perceived decline. We reflect on the theoretical and practical implications of these findings.

AB  - Much debate has focused on the potential negative role of sexualized violent media on viewer attitudes toward women. One potential issue in previous literature is that depictions of sexuality and violence were confounded with subordinate depictions of female characters. The current study addressed this by randomly assigning young adults to watch either neutral media or sexually violent media with either subordinate or strong female characters. Women who watched sexually violent media were more anxious, and males who watched sexually violent media had more negative attitudes toward women, but only when female characters were subordinate. Sexual and violent content had no influence on viewer attitudes when strong female characters were present, suggesting these are not the crucial influence variables.

TI  - How Does Local TV News Change Viewers' Attitudes?The Case of Sinclair Broadcasting
T2  - POLITICAL COMMUNICATION
LA  - English
KW  - Local TV news
KW  - partisan bias
KW  - media effects
AB  - How does local television news shape viewers' national political attitudes? The answer is unclear, because local news typically focuses on local, not national, stories, and is politically neutral. But the rise of Sinclair Broadcasting, now the nation's second-largest owner of local TV stations, upends that assumption. News on Sinclair-owned stations focuses more on national topics, and presents them with a right-wing slant. Given this, we might expect it to shift its viewers' attitudes in a pro-Republican direction. Using data on Sinclair's acquisition of local TV stations between 2008 and 2018, I show that living in an area with a Sinclair-owned TV station lowers viewers' approval of President Obama during his tenure in office, and makes viewers less likely to vote for the Democratic nominee for president. This has important implications for our understanding of the effects of local TV news, as well as for media trust, as I discuss in the conclusion.

AB  - Documenting the emergent social representations of COVID-19 in public communication is necessary for critically reflecting on pandemic responses and providing guidance for global pandemic recovery policies and practices. This study documents the dynamics of changing social representations of the COVID-19 pandemic on one of the largest Chinese social media, Weibo, from December 2019 to April 2020. We draw on the social representation theory (SRT) and conceptualize topics and topic networks as a form of social representation. We analyzed a dataset of 40 million COVID-19 related posts from 9.7 million users (including the general public, opinion leaders, and organizations) using machine learning methods. We identified 12 topics and found an expansion in social representations of COVID-19 from a clinical and epidemiological perspective to a broader perspective that integrated personal illness experiences with economic and sociopolitical discourses. Discussions about COVID-19 science did not take a prominent position in the representations, suggesting a lack of effective science and risk communication. Further, we found the strongest association of social representations existed between the public and opinion leaders and the organizations' representations did not align much with the other two groups, suggesting a lack of organizations' influence in public representations of COVID-19 on social media in China.

AB  - Nolan, Burgin, Farquharson and Marjoribanks focus on media as a significant site through which a politics of belonging is played out, focusing particularly on coverage of Sudanese Australians. To this end, they analyse letters to the editor that concern Sudanese Australians in three Victorian newspapers in 2007, a highly significant year in which this group became the focus of significant levels of (predominantly negative) media coverage. Through textual and thematic analysis, the authors demonstrate how such letters worked to reiterate and extend a politics of integrationism' that, without entirely departing from Australia's commitment to multiculturalism, has rearticulated the latter along neo-assimilationist lines. In doing so, they show how, in many letters, Sudanese Australians are problematized for their failure or refusal to integrate' in ways that involve an explicit or implicit process of racialization. In the process, the article also critically considers the important role performed by media in the politics of belonging, particularly through their reiteration and contestation of the politics of race and multiculturalism in Australia. Rather than simply a matter of reproducing a hegemonic politics, it shows how such processes, despite the marked limitations of their framing within a race debate', also serve to demonstrate significant fault lines in the politics of belonging.

AB  - This study presents multimodal metaphors as (re)framing tools in the analysis of a 10-minute promotional video of Hubei Province produced by the Chinese government and circulated on new media platforms like YouTube, Douyin (Chinese Tik Tok) and WeChat Channels. The video introduces Hubei Province to the world in the pre-pandemic, pandemic and post-pandemic stage to erase the prejudiced "Wuhan virus" and "China virus" painted by Western media. Drawing upon MIPVU (the Metaphor Identification Procedure Vrije Universitei), multimodality of metaphors, and Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), this study analyzes how the Chinese government attempts to reframe Hubei as a place of courage, prosperity and humanity via metaphors like WAR, BRIDGE, HAND and BACK. The benefits and drawbacks of such metaphor usage are also discussed with appropriate contextual and socio-cultural relevancies. The study provides a hands-on practice of the CDA-based analysis of multimodal metaphors and justifies the feasibility of integrating translation, metaphor and semiotic studies through the sociological theory of framing.

AB  - Do renegotiations of existing free trade agreements (FTAs) increase mass support for other FTAs, and if so, how? The media and scholars have suggested that the recent uptick in support for a Canada-China FTA can be attributed in part to NAFTA renegotiations, based on trends in public opinion polls. In this article, I present a formal test of this causal claim. I identify two interrelated causal mechanisms (distribution of benefits from cooperation and market threat) linking NAFTA renegotiations as a causal variable to explain support for a Canada-China FTA. I evaluate these causal mechanisms using new data from a survey experiment carried out during NAFTA renegotiations. The results provide support for both causal mechanisms and are consistent with existing notions about why Canadians have recently increased their support for a trade deal with China. Policy implications are discussed following the analysis.

AB  - Media censorship is a hallmark of authoritarian regimes. We conduct a field experiment in China to measure the effects of providing citizens with access to an uncensored internet. We track subjects' media consumption, beliefs regarding the media, economic beliefs, political attitudes, and behaviors over 18 months. We find four main results: (i) free access alone does not induce subjects to acquire politically sensitive information; (ii) temporary encouragement leads to a persistent increase in acquisition, indicating that demand is not permanently low; (iii) acquisition brings broad, substantial, and persistent changes to knowledge, beliefs, attitudes, and intended behaviors; and (iv) social transmission of information is statistically significant but small in magnitude. We calibrate a simple model to show that the combination of low demand for uncensored information and the moderate social transmission means China's censorship apparatus may remain robust to a large number of citizens receiving access to an uncensored internet.

AB  - As a performance venue, online social spaces afford users a variety of ways to express themselves. Many of these expressions include social identity work, such as the articulation, affirmation, or policing of a shared identity. In this study, we examine one online space in which users engage in social identity work: a Reddit forum (r/starterpacks) that primarily generates and discusses image memes of a very specific format: the "starter pack." Users leverage these image memes to convey what we refer to in this article as prototypes of social identities. Many of these prototypical depictions are necessarily influenced by offline social groups and/or consumer culture, and are furthermore constructed around gendered, racial, or ethnic stereotypes. To understand how these image memes are used to form and perpetuate prototypes of social identities, we employed content analysis to evaluate a sample of 500 image meme artifacts created, shared, and upvoted by the subreddit's users. We discuss the process of applying visual analysis techniques to articulate themes identified in the image meme expressions, in particular: (1) the default of the White, male identity in starter pack characterizations; (2) the production of oppressive social identities through the use of visual and textual content; and (3) the dedication to a stance of "consumption" in assembling starter pack memes, both through body politics expressed therein and use of consumer goods in images. Finally, we draw on reader response theory to frame the challenges of researchers "reading" starter pack memes, despite employing systematic methods of analysis.

AB  - Aim: The research aimed to assess the perception on nursing and nurses among schoolchildren of Slovenian elementary schools. Background: Among the general public, nursing remains under-recognized as an occupation and a science. Especially young people have unrealistic perceptions of nurses. Design: A cross-sectional research design was undertaken. Methods: The study included 1984 eighth grade schoolchildren from 103 elementary schools. Data were collected with a structured questionnaire. Results: The research results revealed a positive general perception of nursing. Surprisingly, only 2.5% of respondents would consider a career in nursing. Girls had more understanding of nursing compared to boys (p < 0.001); having a nurse relative meant better understanding of nursing (p = 0.032). The influence of the traditional view of nursing and the biomedical model of care which describes nursing not as autonomous, but as subordinate to medicine, was considerate (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The study shows that elementary school children do not express an interest in a career in nursing. They perceive the job of a nurse as female-dominated, they cling to the traditional perception of nursing being subordinate to medicine, and they indicated dominance of the biomedical model of care. Healthcare policy makers must remember that healthcare systems cannot function without nurses, so developing nursing is crucial. To increase interest in the profession, a national campaign promoting nursing programs and the nursing profession and presenting horizontal and vertical career opportunities is needed. Young people must have realistic information on nursing as an occupation and a science, its role in the healthcare system, and career opportunities. Activities aimed at changing public opinion on nursing must be planned.

AB  - Bruneau et al. show that a five-minute video intervention is able to effectively promote support for the reintegration of former Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces combatants into Colombian society.
   Whereas politicians broker peace deals, it falls to the public to embrace peace and help sustain it. The legacy of conflicts can make it difficult for people to support reconciling and reintegrating with former enemies. Here we create a five-minute media intervention from interviews we conducted with Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces (FARC) ex-combatants in a Colombian demobilization camp and non-FARC Colombians in neighbouring communities. We show that exposure to the media intervention humanizes FARC ex-combatants and increases support for peace and reintegration. These effects persisted at least three months post-exposure, were replicated in an independent sample of non-FARC Colombians and affected both attitudes (for example, support for reintegration policies) and behaviour (for example, donations to organizations supporting ex-combatants). As predicted, the intervention's effects were mediated by changing conflict-associated cognitions-reducing the belief that ex-combatants are unwilling and unable to change-beyond affective pathways (for example, increased empathy or reduced prejudice).

AB  - In recent years, social media has had a crucial role in promoting governments to act more responsibly. However, few studies have investigated whether social media use actually leads to increased disclosure during environmental incidents, or how social media influences regional governments' information disclosure, even though delayed and insufficient disclosure on relevant incidents is often widespread in China. In this article, we model information disclosure during environmental incidents as an evolutionary game process between the central government and local governments, and examine the role of social media on game participants' strategy selections in the information disclosure game. The results indicate that social media plays an active role in promoting the regional government to proactively disclose information during environmental incidents through two mechanisms: the top-down intervention mechanism, and the bottom-up reputation mechanism. More specifically, social media can provide efficient information channels for the central government to supervise local officials' limited disclosure during environmental incidents, essentially sharing the central government's supervision costs, and thus improving its supervision and intervention efficiency. Social media helps focus the public's attention on the limited disclosure of local officials in environmental incidents, and actively mobilizes citizens to protest to maintain their interests, placing considerable pressure on the reputation of local governments.

AB  - This article addresses the participation of celebrities and their fans in media controversies. As techno-social events, controversies are constitutive of discursive battles, between numerically conscious participatory communities, aimed at describing the meaning and significance of cultural symbols. Celebrities, in their capacity as cultural symbols, provide the ground for staging these discursive battles. Fan participation, as auxiliary of celebrity participation, is studied here specifically to discern its essential functions vis-a-vis controversies. For elaborating its argument, this article looks at Shah Rukh Khan (hereafter SRK) and his fandom in India. SRK, as a transcultural symbol of Liberal Islam, was embroiled in media controversies wherein the meaning and significance of his 'Muslimness' was debated and scrutinised. Marked by struggles between SRK fandom, on one side, and right-wing/reactionary groups on the other, these controversies testify SRK's centrality in political debates surrounding the 'Muslim Question' in Indian Polity. This article argues that SRK Fandom's primary discursive function is to create an 'Eulogistic Buffer' that insulates SRK from right-wing/reactionary islamophobia.

AB  - Social psychological theorizing on prejudice and discrimination, which largely focuses on tangible or verifiable content of people's thoughts, feelings, and actions toward a group (what we term commissions), falls short in capturing the nature of prejudice and discrimination directed toward Native Americans. Utilizing the literature on the prevalence, content, and consequences of representations of Native Americans, we argue that aspects of the world that are invisible or intentionally left out of the public conscious, what we refer to as omissions, hold important meaning for both Native and non-Native individuals. We propose that a framework of bias that incorporates both omissions and commissions will enrich our understanding of bias, prejudice, and discrimination and better elucidate the experiences of groups that are historically underrepresented and underserved by social science.

AB  - Initiative campaigns, unlike candidate-centered elections, are efforts to mobilize and persuade residents of state and local governments on specific policies. Previous studies have conflicting findings whether or not initiative campaigns can persuade voters. For issues like same-sex marriage, voters may be even more difficult to persuade because their attitudes may be crystallized. Four states voted on marriage equality in November 2012, which resulted in historic victories for the proponents of same-sex marriage. This led to a belief that the marriage equality campaigns won because of their strategic communications. I examine the effect of televised campaign ads on people's attitudes toward same-sex marriage by combining market-advertising data from the 2012 campaigns and a rolling cross-sectional national survey. Media markets that spill over into neighboring states are analyzed as a natural experiment, isolating the effect of televised advertisements from other campaign efforts. The results suggest that people were greatly affected by campaign ads aired by the groups opposed to marriage equality, and the ads in favor of marriage equality were ineffective. When competing sides are framing the rights of sexual and gender minorities, those opposed retain an unequal advantage in changing the minds of the public through televised media.

AB  - This article aims to identify how digital public opinion was articulated on Twitter during the visit of the Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to Mexico City in 2016 by invitation from the Mexican government, which was preceded by the threat to construct a border wall that Mexico would pay for. Using a mixed methodology made up of computational methods such as data mining and social network analysis combined with content analysis, the authors identify conversational patterns and the structures of the networks formed, beginning with this event involving the foreign policy of both countries that share a long border. The authors study the digital media practices and emotional frameworks these social network users employed to involve themselves in the controversial visit, marked by complex political, cultural and historical relations. The analysis of 352,203 tweets in two languages (English and Spanish), those most used in the conversations, opened the door to an understanding as to how transnational public opinion is articulated in connective actions detonated by newsworthy events in distinct cultural contexts, as well as the emotional frameworks that permeated the conversation, whose palpable differences show that Twitter is not a homogeneous universe, but rather a set of universes codetermined by sociocultural context.

AB  - This article explores the effects of people's digital coexistence on the construction of difference and feelings of aversion to or recognition of "others". It seeks to make a theoretical contribution to works on the geographies of difference and encounter, Internet or digital geography, as well as on migration and digital media, by highlighting the relevance of indirect and fleeting digital encounters and the dialectical process in which encounters play out in intertwined, specific and multiple digital and physical spaces that we define as "cON/FFlating situational places of encounter". Based on a qualitative study with Chinese, Filipino and German migrant professionals in Singapore, it shows how fleeting digital encounters take an ambivalent role through challenging but also producing new "temporary fixings of difference". As such they can engender new sensibilities for and openness toward the host society but also breed new, or aggravate existing, cultural stereotypes and prejudices. The findings show that inherited and instituted classificatory practices that people use to structure and make sense of their fleeting interactions with others in offline space are, where possible, transferred and imposed on encounters in digital space. At the same time, they are inflected or replaced with new markers of difference where ingrained sorting mechanisms applied in offline space did not help them make sense of encounters in digital space.

AB  - With the Civil Union Act in 2006, South Africa passed the first national-level same-sex marriage legislation on the continent. Both proponents and opponents ascribed importance to this legislation based on the idea that it would fundamentally change the institution of marriage. Has the Civil Union Act changed the depiction of marriage in media, and by extension, changed representation of this institution in the public sphere? This article investigates marriage as it appears in South African media through an analysis of 736 English language newspaper articles from 2005-2011. We demonstrate that discourses around marriage changed in the short term, with more attention paid to sexual minorities. Over the medium term, however, there was no significant shift in media discussions of marriage, suggesting that the legislation did not significantly alter depictions of the institution of marriage in the public sphere.

AB  - Purpose - Social media (SM) is a new communication tool that substantially contribute to facilitating online hate speech (OHS). In emphasis of the question "what role can SM play in an individual's life?", this study aims to understand Bangladeshi university students' personal experiences and opinions of OHSs related to SM.
   Design/methodology/approach - The authors used an online survey method to collect data and retrieved responses from 410 students. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal Wallis test and Spearman's rank correlation analysis were used to test the hypotheses.
   Findings - This study found that hate speech is a familiar term among students. Students' political views or opinions, religion and gender have become the most targeted instruments for OHSs. Comparing students' use of SM, the authors found that Facebook was the most used SM site to spread hate speech in Bangladesh. In terms of personal experiences, the findings indicated that 45.6% of students became victims of OHSs at least once or more times, and the majority of students tended to simply avoid OHS& Another significant finding was that OHS has real-life effects on the students, resulting in various personal and psychological distress.
   Originality/value - Although some research has been conducted on hate speech at the local level, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no study has focused on the student community. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt in Bangladesh to focus on OHSs from a student's personal viewpoint.

AB  - We demonstrate that social media data represent a useful resource for testing models of legislative and individual-level political behavior and attitudes. First, we develop a model to estimate the ideology of politicians and their supporters using social media data on individual citizens' endorsements of political figures. Our measure allows us to place politicians and more than 6 million citizens who are active in social media on the same metric. We validate the ideological estimates that result from the scaling process by showing they correlate highly with existing measures of ideology from Congress, and with individual-level self-reported political views. Finally, we use these measures to study the relationship between ideology and age, social relationships and ideology, and the relationship between friend ideology and turnout.

AB  - What would a machine say about politics if it could speak? Because of virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri, social scientists are now equipped to answer this question. Yet little is known about what these machines say about politics or why they say it, even though their political responses are potentially consequential given their widespread usage. In this article, I survey six virtual assistants and find that they typically have an above average knowledge of politics, an elementary understanding of important political concepts, and only a handful of opinions on important political issues. In follow-up interviews with tech workers, ranging from software engineers to executives, I use grounded theory to generate hypotheses about how companies craft responses to political questions. I find that tech companies are motivated in large part by economic considerations and that the future responses of the virtual assistants will likely create political echo chambers in which responses are highly customized to individual users. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for political polarization, democratic citizenship, and the growing prevalence of artificial intelligence in politics.

AB  - Perceived discrimination, a subjective appraisal of disadvantageous treatment on the grounds of identity, is negatively associated with wellbeing. We explored this association among British Muslim students, sampled online, by questions about perceived and experienced discrimination, visibility as a Muslim, symptoms of depression and anxiety, and positivity. Results from 457 respondents showed greater discrimination was experienced by those with more visible signs of Muslim faith, with a small but statistically significant positive correlation between perceived discrimination and psychological distress. Many participants gave examples of discrimination experienced. Implications for educational institutes, policy makers, clinicians, and the wider Muslim community are discussed.

AB  - Background: There is continued scientific debate regarding the link between risk of COVID-19 infection and increased disease severity and tobacco and cannabis use. The way this topic is presented in news media coverage may influence public attitudes and behavior and is thus an important topic of investigation. This study examines (1) the extent to which Israeli news media reported a positive (i.e., protective/therapeutic), negative (i.e., harmful), or inconclusive association between three types of substance use (tobacco, medical cannabis, recreational cannabis) and risk of COVID-19 infection and/or increased disease severity, and (2) the extent that this media coverage refers to scientific research.Methods: A quantitative content analysis of news articles related to tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 ( N = 113) from eleven of the highest circulation newspapers in Israel.Results: News items were significantly more likely to mention increased COVID-19 risk for tobacco use, compared to cannabis use. All medical cannabis news items reported that medical cannabis use was associated with reduced COVID-19 risk. In contrast, news items about recreational cannabis use were more likely to describe a balanced or inconclusive risk for COVID-19, or increased risk. The majority of articles referred to scientific research. Conclusion: While Israeli news media reported a relatively consistent message about the increased risk of COVID19 in relation to tobacco use, messages about cannabis use were less consistent in communicating risk information. Research should examine effects of media coverage of tobacco and cannabis use and COVID-19 on public perceptions and behaviors.

AB  - Social media has emerged as a robust medium for discourses on sexuality given its capacity to challenge mainstream narratives and empower personal views on self-expression. In Nigeria, the growing interest in homosexual expressions through online platforms is yet to receive significant research attention, although scholars are hinting at the influences of social media. The present study examines social media as a relatively novel platform for discourses on homosexuality in Nigeria. It attempts to ascertain users' willingness to express opinion, directions of opinion, and factors affecting opinion formation. Within the purview of social integration paradigms, the study reviews current perspectives in global homosexuality narratives. Using descriptive and hermeneutic analysis, it examines data from 323 Facebook users selected through snowball sampling technique as well as 300 comments purposively selected from "verified" Instagram accounts. The study finds significant willingness to express opinions, propelled by "rising interest in the topic." Within a persisting climate of negative opinion, the study locates subsisting influences of socio-cultural institutions on opinion formation. It discusses the implications of the influences of the institutions and political propaganda, which nourish heterosexism and negative bias against homosexuality.

AB  - Weight-loss reality shows, a popular form of television programming, portray obese individuals and their struggles to lose weight. While the media is believed to reinforce obesity stereotypes and contribute to weight stigma, it is not yet known whether weight-loss reality shows have any effect on weight bias. The goal of this investigation was to examine how exposure to 40-min of The Biggest Loser impacted participants' levels of weight bias. Fifty-nine participants (majority of whom were white females) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (one episode of The Biggest Loser) or control (one episode of a nature reality show) condition. Levels of weight bias were measured by the Implicit Associations Test (IAT), the Obese Person Trait Survey (OPTS), and the Anti-fat Attitudes scale (AFA) at baseline and following the episode viewing (1 week later). Participants in The Biggest Loser condition had significantly higher levels of dislike of overweight individuals and more strongly believed that weight is controllable after the exposure. No significant condition effects were found for implicit bias or traits associated with obese persons. Exploratory analyses examining moderation of the condition effect by BMI and intention to lose weight indicated that participants who had lower BMIs and were not trying to lose weight had significantly higher levels of dislike of overweight individuals following exposure to The Biggest Loser compared to similar participants in the control condition. These results indicate that anti-fat attitudes increase after brief exposure to weight-loss reality television.

AB  - The present study investigates media discourse about "late pregnancy" (LP) which, in the French-speaking Swiss press, refers to postmenopausal pregnancy. LP is a relatively new phenomenon giving raise to debates in the media and within the broader society about whether this new form of motherhood, and the application of medically assisted procreation in this context, is legitimate or not. Drawing upon a dialogical approach to the theory of social representations and media discourse analysis, we investigated a set of 44 articles extracted from six leading newspapers between January 2005 and February 2011. The aim of the analysis was twofold: first, we intended to identify the themes of the media debate on LP and to unveil the cultural assumptions and social representations they rely upon; second, we examined the specificity of the scientific and medical discourse within this debate. Our findings show that moral considerations are at the very core of the debate and they engage scientific and medical concerns as means of legitimising certain perspectives on motherhood and upbringing. These findings are discussed in light of the communicative activity type specific for media reporting and its normative tendency in the construction of consensual realities in a given society.

AB  - Contemporary discourse on domestic immigration policy varies widely based on political affiliation, linguistics, and regional differences. This experimental study aimed to concurrently investigate three social psychological bases of attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants in the USA: political ideology, social labels, and social context. Participants were 744 adults, recruited from "New York Community College" ("NYCC"/urban) and "New Jersey Community College" ("NJCC"/suburban), who were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions: "illegal" vs. "undocumented." Participants completed a scale measuring their attitudes toward unauthorized immigrants with the embedded label manipulation, followed by the General System Justification scale, and culminating with demographic items. Results demonstrated that whereas social context and political ideology both contributed significantly to the regression model, the social labels did not. Both high system justification and political conservatism predicted negative attitudes, but the latter effect was stronger for suburban students. Post hoc analyses revealed a significant difference between suburban and urban students in the frequency of the social labels "illegal" and "undocumented" heard and seen among family members, friends, and the media. Implications are discussed with a focus on system justification as an explanatory theory for immigration attitudes, as well as contextual effects for it.

AB  - This article observes to what extent prejudice towards lesbians (homophobia) and the moral evaluation of this sexual orientation affect responses to narratives about lesbians and towards their lesbian protagonists. Two hundred six students (79.6% women, M-Age=20.68, SD=2.36, Rg(Age)=18-33) of different sexual orientations completed a questionnaire that measured homophobia, the morality attributed to lesbians and familiarity with lesbians in everyday life. Following this, they watched a film about a lesbian community with a morally controversial lesbian protagonist. Later, they completed a questionnaire that measured the protagonist's attributes and characteristics, the perceived realism of the story, enjoyment and appreciation. Statistical analyses show that homophobia and morality impact on the evaluation of the lesbian protagonist's actions and attributes and enjoyment of the film. Nonetheless, homophobia, morality, familiarity with lesbians, and the gender and sexual orientation of the receiver do not impact on appreciation or perceived realism. In fact, appreciation and perceived realism are independent of attitudes towards lesbians. These results reveal the role of prejudice and morality in film reception. They also enable us to characterise enjoyment and appreciation of stories particularly about lesbians.

AB  - Part of the goal of the International Paralympic Committee is to "touch the heart of all people for a more equitable society" by exposing people to adaptive sports, with the goal of improving public views toward people with disabilities. The authors hypothesized that exposure to parasocial contact with images of athletes with disabilities could lead to a change in attitude during the formation of social identity, disrupting the tendency to view the population of individuals with physical disabilities as "other." This case study found that viewing a documentary of a Paralympic sprinter produced in the same style as an Olympic feature appeared to affect the emotional components of attitude formation, especially when compared with respondents who viewed a comparable documentary about an able-bodied athlete. These findings are of interest to proponents of adaptive sports, producers of adaptive-sports media, and marketers who use athletes with disabilities in advertising campaigns.

AB  - After a decade long surge in Sino-Latin American trade, the bilateral relationship has gained political and cultural complexity. Recent public opinion polls depict a mildly positive opinion of China in Latin America. Nonetheless, these polls are not well suited to unveiling the framing of anti-Chinese attitudes that are present among the Latin American public. This research draws on Facebook users' comments on news articles about China found in eight major newspapers from Argentina, Colombia, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. Our main goal is to gain insights into the concepts that structure negative views on China and to reconstruct narratives of anti-Chinese sentiment in Latin America today. Opinions triggered by news about China reveal that "China's rise" has generated anxieties due mainly to the perceived threats posed by environmental impacts, outward migration, and the demand for natural resources. In addition, these opinions elicit concern over Latin America's own development.

AB  - Partisan bias in the news is a perennial matter of concern and debate for scholars, journalists, politicians, and citizens. Although there are abundant opinions about the magnitude, direction, and even existence of media bias, producing a scholarly consensus on the issue has proven difficult for several reasons. In particular, scholars studying media bias empirically must overcome problems of subjectivity, strategic behavior by the actors involved in the process, and especially the absence of suitable baselines against which to assess bias. This article reviews some approaches to studying media bias and explores several promising strategies and tools scholars have developed to help overcome these obstacles. I conclude with suggestions for future research in the area.

AB  - The death penalty enjoys overwhelmingly cross-partisan support among Taiwanese citizens. Politicians, mass media actors, and anti-death-penalty activists all believe that death penalty executions boost the president's approval. As a result, Taiwanese presidents are motivated to strategically execute prisoners, trying to improve their approval rate. To examine this myth, we exploit data from a nationally representative survey conducted in 2012; six inmates were unexpectedly executed during the survey period. This unique opportunity enables us to examine the causal relationship between implementing a welcoming policy and its effect on public opinion. Contrary to popular belief, however, the results of the regression discontinuity design indicate that death penalty executions in Taiwan did not boost the president's approval rate at all. This non-finding holds after several robustness checks and difference-in-differences analyses. This result yields implications for the study of judicial politics and presidential approval.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a network analysis of Twitter discussions about Myung-Bak Lee, a former president of South Korea, to gain a better understanding of the dynamics of the public opinion exchange on Twitter.
   Design/methodology/approach - Opinion leaders in the discussion network were identified by considering the longitudinal distribution of tweets containing the former president's name, and three types of messages ("followings," "mentions," and "retweets") were analyzed using data collected from November 1, 2011, to April 20, 2012. The sample included 26,150 Twitter users and 892,034 relationships reflecting three types of messages.
   Findings - The results indicate that the discussion about President Myung-Bak Lee was dominated by liberal Twitter users who already had considerable influence both online and offline. In addition, Twitter users were unlikely to interact with other users with opposing political views.
   Research limitations/implications - Almost all of the opinion leaders identified in the study held liberal political views, and liberal Twitter users dominated the discussion network. In addition, the Korean Twitter network showed the presence of the homophily phenomenon, implying that opinion leaders' influence within the Twitter network was limited to other users sharing the same political views. Further, political views of opinion leaders were skewed toward a particular political stance without necessarily representing the opinion of the general public, possibly hindering the democratic process.
   Originality/value - This study tests the homophily thesis in the context of Twitter users in Korea and contributes to the literature on Twitter-based political discourse by identifying opinion leaders in Korean Twitter networks and examining the phenomenon of homophily within those networks.

AB  - Few studies have empirically examined how media stereotypes of Muslims influence Americans' support for public policies exclusively harming Muslims. Across three studies, we tested the short-term and long-term effects of news portraying Muslims as terrorists on Americans' support for public policies harming Muslims domestically and internationally. Study 1 revealed that exposure to news portraying Muslims as terrorists is positively associated with support for military action in Muslim countries. Study 2 revealed that exposure to news portraying Muslims as terrorists is positively associated with support for public policies that harm Muslims domestically and internationally; this effect was fully mediated by perceptions of Muslims as aggressive. Experimental results from Study 3 revealed that exposing participants to negative Muslim media footage, relative to neutral or no-video footage, increased perceptions of Muslims as aggressive, increased support for harsh civil restrictions of Muslim Americans, and increased support for military action in Muslim countries. Exposure to positive Muslim footage yielded opposite results. We discuss the importance of media in exacerbating aggressive attitudes and public policies in the context of intergroup relations.

AB  - A Government Annual Report (GAR) plays a critical role in signalling what issues governments at various levels in China paid attention to. Based on data from a survey conducted in June 2016, we divide GAR topics into two categories: macro-economic issue and citizen livelihood issue. On average, citizens are more interested in livelihood issue than economy issue in 19 cities in China. Our empirical analysis shows that media usage and political interest can explain the variation in issue attention among different citizens. We also find that the effect of political interest on livelihood issue can be mediated by social media.

AB  - Background: Pain neuroscience education (PNE) programs have become popular among clinicians and are widely promoted through social and mainstream media.Purpose: To test the hypothesis that people with persistent pain are likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements and compare their responses to other social media user groups.Methods: A total of 1319 respondents completed an online survey and were directed into four groups: persistent pain, healthcare professionals with persistent pain, pain-free healthcare professionals, and pain-free controls. The survey included ten statements of popular PNE concepts. Feedback was invited by offering seven attitudinal response categories (three positives, three negatives, and one neutral). A two-step hierarchical regression model was used to assess the likelihood of reporting negatively.Results: Compared to controls, respondents from the persistent pain group were more likely to report negatively towards all statements (OR 1.6-2.16), except for two statements (#3 and #5). Healthcare professionals were less likely to report negative attitudes for 4 out of 10 statement (OR 0.35-0.58). Health care professionals living with persistent responded to most statements like the pain-free controls (besides statement #2, OR 0.59).Conclusion: People living with persistent pain are more likely to express negative attitudes to PNE statements on social media, unlike healthcare professionals who were less likely to express negativity. Healthcare professionals living with persistent pain responded to most PNE statements like the pain-free control group. The study's main weaknesses include the lack of psychometric information of the questionnaire used, selection bias, small samples of the healthcare professionals and the overrepresentation of young social media users.

AB  - Televised election coverage is increasingly dominated by the horse race, a key element of which is poll coverage. How do news outlets decide which poll to air? We know little about the gatekeeping function of news outlets as it pertains to poll coverage, perhaps because this research is plagued by selection bias: By observing only reported polls and not unreported polls, researchers cannot definitively establish that any differences in representativeness are due to bias. Using a novel dataset that includes all prime-time presidential election poll coverage on Fox, MSNBC, CNN, and broadcast television networks during the 2008 election, we compare the universe of polls released each day to the polls actually covered by each news network. We find differences between the distribution of poll coverage and distribution of actual poll results. Our results suggest that both gatekeepers and reporters may have a hand in this distortion.

AB  - This paper focuses on the accuracy of COVID-19-related knowledge during the 2020 pandemic. We look at the effects of traditional vs. digital news use and distinguish between positive (number of recoveries) and negative (number of casualties) knowledge. Importantly, the moderating role of crisis context is examined when tracing media effects on knowledge. Relying on a four-wave panel survey fielded in the Netherlands, we find that people's knowledge became more accurate over the course of the crisis. News exposure did not lead to more accuracy, in fact, a negative relation was found. The impact of digital news use weakened as the crisis continued.

AB  - Online activity is often cyberbalkanized, but it remains unclear whether this phenomenon leads to polarization of public opinion or if the relationship works in the reverse direction. This study tested the temporal association between cyberbalkanization and opinion polarization during the debate on political reform in Hong Kong. Online communities were constructed by a post-sharing network of 1,644 Facebook pages (101,410 shares); the differences between intra-and inter-community shares were derived, and a cyberbalkanization index was computed. A time-series analysis showed that the index temporally preceded the opinion polarization, i. e., most of the opinion poll's respondents gave extreme ratings to government leaders, but not vice versa. The index was particularly predictive of polarization among youth.

AB  - In New Zealand, aiding and abetting a person to commit suicide or euthanasia even with consent is unlawful. The introduction of a third Bill on assisted dying to the House of Representatives following a high-profile court case afforded an opportunity for examining how assisted dying was discussed in the public sphere. In this article, we report on a discourse analysis of a selection of social media to illustrate the ways in which citizens participate in the voluntary euthanasia debate. The volume of social media posts that made up our data set suggests that the legalisation of assisted dying is a highly topical and deeply salient societal issue. Social media postings represent the voices of ordinary citizens who may not participate in formal public consultation processes. Based on our analysis, the assignment of binary conclusions about public opinion is simplistic and fails to adequately represent the intricacies of public debate. Contributors' posts reveal deeply held sociocultural values, as well as tensions about the relationship between citizens and the apparatus of government.

AB  - In accordance with its traditional role of creating and cultivating public opinion, one should not neglect the fact that the media also serves as a tool in promoting or eradicating prejudices and stereotypes. In terms of the representation of women (their presence and the way they are portrayed) in the media, this paper presents the results of a study focused on the portrayal of women on the front pages of two of Croatia's national daily newspapers - Jutarnji list and Vecernji list. The results show that men overwhelmingly dominate the fold, both as the subjects of texts and the subjects of photographs. Women, though rarely present, appeared more often than men as subjects in texts related to "lighter topics", e.g., entertainment. Both newspapers promoted stereotyped depictions of women such as their depiction only through the lens of motherhood, family and home, the division of "feminine" and "masculine" labor, women as the weaker sex, and an emphasis placed solely on their bodies.

AB  - The pervasive influence of social media on our lives provides new opportunities to study residents' attitudes to tourism. Even though it is now common for residents to express their opinions and read about tourism development on social media, the consequences of this for their attitudes remain to be understood. This article uses the analytical perspectives of the information society and draws from the elaboration likelihood model, the influence of presumed influence model, and the social exchange theory to develop a causal-chain framework that considers the influence of social media on residents' attitudes to tourism. Twenty-five research propositions emanate from the conceptual framework. The framework examines the direct as well as indirect influence of social media tourism messages on residents' attitudes. It also recognizes users as the receivers and expressers of pro- as well as anti-tourism messages on social media. Our framework is theoretically inclusive, providing a reference to scholars and stimulating new ideas for future research on social media and residents' attitudes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that provides the necessary theoretical foundations and a conceptual framework to study residents' attitudes to tourism in an information era intensified by the growth of social media.

AB  - In this paper, we propose a mathematical model to assess the impact of social media advertisements in combating the coronavirus pandemic in India. We assume that dissemination of awareness among susceptible individuals modifies public attitudes and behaviours towards this contagious disease which results in reducing the chance of contact with the coronavirus and hence decreasing the disease transmission. Moreover, the individual's behavioral response in the presence of global information campaigns accelerate the rate of hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and also encourage the asymptomatic individuals for conducting health protocols, such as self-isolation, social distancing, etc. We calibrate the proposed model with the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases for the Republic of India. We estimate eight epidemiologically important parameters, and also the size of basic reproduction number for India. We find that the basic reproduction number for India is greater than unity, which represents the substantial outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Sophisticated techniques of sensitivity analysis are employed to determine the impacts of model parameters on basic reproduction number and symptomatic infected population. Our results reveal that to reduce disease burden in India, non-pharmaceutical interventions strategies should be implemented effectively to decrease basic reproduction number below unity. Continuous propagation of awareness through the internet and social media platforms should be regularly circulated by the health authorities/government officials for hospitalization of symptomatic individuals and quarantine of asymptomatic individuals to control the prevalence of disease in India.

AB  - Over five million athletes with intellectual disability (ID) currently participate in Special Olympics (SO) worldwide with the broader aim of promoting their inclusion in society. The public's knowledge of SO was determined in 17 selected countries globally and the characteristics of those most actively involved identified. Online, self-completion surveys were completed by 36,508 nationally representative respondents. Around 1 in 7 people globally reported an active involvement with SO and a further third were aware of it through the media. Engagement was greater among respondents who had experience in volunteering, playing sports and frequent personal contact with people with ID. Only one quarter of respondents correctly distinguished SO from Paralympics and the Olympic Games. There is scope to make the public more aware of, and better informed about SO. Further research examines the relationships between engagement with SO and public attitudes towards the inclusion of persons with ID in wider society.

AB  - This paper introduces a new perspective into the literature on judicial legitimacy by examining the incentives for courts to cater to a popular majority and offering a novel model of legitimacy that has consequences for judicial responsiveness. The account integrates into the literature classic research on how strategic social groups shape public opinion. I theorize that citizens use their perceptions of the judiciary's support for various social groups as a means to assess the institution overall. From this insight, I derive specific expectations about the conditions under which the Supreme Court's protection of minority groups like gays and immigrants can damage its legitimacy. Using national survey data, I demonstrate that dislike for the beneficiaries of recent Court rulings systematically diminishes the institution's legitimacy. The influence of these group-based considerations shapes individual-level attitude change and can be observed at various points in time.

AB  - Though Central Asia is often studied through the prism of its relationships with external powers, research on local public perceptions of these different actors has largely been overlooked. The literature on Kazakhstanis' perceptions of their neighbours, for instance, is scarce, and mostly focused on analysis of official discourse on Kazakhstan's multi-vector policy, with little exploration of how this is received, appropriated or refuted by the population. On the basis of Gallup data spanning the last decade, and several other surveys, we test most of the main hypotheses usually advanced to explain attitudes to the US and Russia - age, ethnicity and access to information - and draw five main conclusions: (1) Kazakhstanis are not defined by an exclusive pro-US/pro-Russian dichotomy; (2) they nevertheless largely choose Russia over the US if forced to pick; (3) age does not have a significant effect on foreign policy attitudes; (4) ethnicity does affect some of the attitudes under consideration, but its effects are not large enough to produce markedly different opinions among ethnic Kazakhs and ethnic Russians in aggregate; and (5) consumption of media from Russia and access to non-governmental and Western sources of information do not seem to have significant effects on the attitudes under consideration.

AB  - Background: Safe consumption sites are spaces where people can legally use pre-obtained drugs under medical supervision and are currently in operation in Canada, Australia and Western Europe. These sites are effective in reducing opioid overdose mortality and other harms associated with opioid use, such as HIV infection, and increasing drug treatment entry. Various U.S. communities are considering establishing safe consumption sites, however, only 29% of U.S. adults support their legalization. This purpose of this study is to assess what types of arguments resonate with the public in support of and opposition to legalizing safe consumption sites to combat the opioid epidemic.
   Methods: A public opinion survey of U.S. adults in July-August 2017 (N = 1004) used a probability-based sample of respondents from a large, nationally representative online panel. The survey examined the public's perception of the strength of common arguments offered in support of and opposition to legalizing safe consumption sites. Arguments were identified through a detailed scan of news media coverage, public reports, and advocacy materials.
   Results: The national sample of U.S. adults rated all arguments opposing legalization of safe consumption sites as stronger than any of the arguments supporting legalization. The most highly rated opposing arguments were that public funds were better spent on addiction treatment, and that sites were allowing illegal activity and encouraging people to use drugs. The highest rated arguments supporting legalization were that safe consumption sites were a better alternative than arresting people for using drugs, they would reduce HIV and hepatitis C by encouraging safe injection practices, and that they would lower emergency department admission and hospitalization costs.
   Conclusion: Legalization of this evidence-based harm reduction approach in U.S. communities will be difficult to advance without public education to confront persistent myths that safe consumption sites encourage drug use and do not facilitate treatment access.

AB  - The present research aims to verify the presence of Linguistic biases in crime news reports (Study 1) and their role (Study 2) in activating a crime stereotype toward racial/ethnic minorities. In a first content analysis study, the natural occurrence of a set of linguistic biases was analyzed in Italian news articles that described comparable crimes committed by an in- or an outgroup aggressor. Results indicated that when the crime was committed by an outgroup (vs. ingroup) member, more aggravating and less attenuating adjectives were used. Moreover, the nationality of the perpetrator was not only mentioned more frequently, it also appeared in most cases as a noun. In Study 2, participants read a fictitious news article that either described an in- or outgroup criminal act with neutral or biased language. Their implicit associations between in- and outgroup members and weapons (vs. tools) were measured immediately afterward in the weapon paradigm. Results confirmed that a biased (vs. neutral) language use increased participants' crime-related associations with the outgroup in general only when an outgroup criminal was staged. The role of media portrayals in determining the cognitive representations of racial/ethnic minorities is discussed.

AB  - With the rapid development of social media, fluctuations in the price of vegetables are passed on to the people through the Internet in real time, which will certainly attract widespread attention in China. Therefore, Public opinion in social media is regarded as a latent factor contributing to market fluctuation. To predict the vegetable price fluctuation in China's market, a hybrid prediction model combining convolution neural network with corpora is constructed. Although a direct causality test shows the uncertainty between the vegetable price and public opinion in social media, strong causality is found after removing the seasonal effect of price. This shows that the spread of public opinion through the Internet can strengthen the link between vegetable price changes and external events by affecting the expectations of market traders.

AB  - Video games have traditionally held a dubious reputation in the media and have been linked to many antisocial behaviors. A large amount of research has borne out some of these concerns, linking video games with addiction and particularly aggression. However, recent work in this area has begun to examine the positive aspects of video gaming. In this work, we examine how playing casual, low-involvement video games with an outgroup member may reduce prejudice. In Study 1, participants played cooperatively or competitively with a (trivial) outgroup member or alone. In Studies 2 and 3, a meaningful social identity was used: students' university affiliation. Participants played either cooperatively with a rival university student against the computer, or alone. Analyses of all three studies showed that attitudes toward the outgroup were more positive after playing with an outgroup member compared with control conditions. How these findings may be applied to real world groups and extensions for future research are then discussed.

AB  - This paper argues that the British television drama serial Lost in Austen implicitly constructs a critical analysis of post-feminism. Firstly, it will argue that its complex narrative structure (travelling from contemporary London to the pages of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice) allows its female protagonist to ask important questions about the nature and relevance of feminism today. In particular, it enables it to rediscover feminist history in an attempt to reconnect it to a generation of young women who have arguably lost sight of its continuing significance. Secondly, it implicitly positions traditional romantic fiction as a cultural antidote to an overly sexualised post-feminist culture, one that continues to objectify the female subject while making young women complicit in their own oppression. In doing so, it arguably offers a critical evaluation of post-feminism while reinventing the emotional power of traditional romantic discourse for a contemporary age.

AB  - This article explores the dynamics of digital (dis)information in the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. International Relations scholars have presented the online debate in terms of 'information warfare'-that is, a number of strategic campaigns to win over local and global public opinion, largely orchestrated by the Kremlin and pro-western authorities. However, this way of describing the online debate reduces civil society to a mere target for manipulation. This article presents a different understanding of the debate. By examining the social media engagement generated by one of the conflict's most important events-the downing of the Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 (MH17) over Ukraine-we explore how competing claims about the cause of the plane crash are disseminated by the state, media and civil society. By analysing approximately 950,000 tweets, the article demonstrates how individual citizens are more than purveyors of government messages; they are the most active drivers of both disinformation and attempts to counter such information. These citizen curators actively shape competing narratives about why MH17 crashed and citizens, as a group, are four times more likely to be retweeted than any other type of user. Our findings challenge conceptualizations of a state-orchestrated information war over Ukraine, and point to the importance of citizen activity in the struggle over truths during international conflicts.

AB  - In this study, we investigate differences in occupational status between women and men, and between ethnic minority and majority members, by means of a content analysis of Belgian prime-time television in 2013. We evaluate the accuracy of these television portrayals using interreality comparison strategies. Results indicate that although in television content women obtain higher average scores for occupational status than men, this is mainly due to the underrepresentation of women in low-status occupations. Although previous studies focused on the absence of women in high-status jobs, this analysis shows for the first time that women are also absent in low-status manual and industrial jobs. Ethnic minorities have lower average scores for occupational status. Moreover, interaction terms made clear that this especially holds for female ethnic minorities, suggesting that mechanisms of intersectionality are at play. In general, the labor world as portrayed on television diverges strongly from the real labor world.

AB  - Online and social media platforms employ automated recognition methods to presume user preferences, sensitive attributes such as race, gender, sexual orientation, and opinions. These opaque methods can predict behaviors for marketing purposes and influence behavior for profit, serving attention economics but also reinforcing existing biases such as gender stereotyping. Although two international human rights treaties include explicit obligations relating to harmful and wrongful stereotyping, these stereotypes persist online and offline. By identifying how inferential analytics may reinforce gender stereotyping and affect marginalized communities, opportunities for addressing these concerns and thereby increasing privacy, diversity, and inclusion online can be explored. This is important because misgendering reinforces gender stereotypes, accentuates gender binarism, undermines privacy and autonomy, and may cause feelings of rejection, impacting people?s self-esteem, confidence, and authenticity. In turn, this may increase social stigmatization. This study brings into view concerns of discrimination and exacerbation of existing biases that online platforms continue to replicate and that literature starts to highlight. The implications of misgendering on Twitter are investigated to illustrate the impact of algorithmic bias on inadvertent privacy violations and reinforcement of social prejudices of gender through a multidisciplinary perspective, including legal, computer science, and critical feminist media-studies viewpoints. An online pilot survey was conducted to better understand how accurate Twitter?s gender inferences of its users? gender identities are. This served as a basis for exploring the implications of this social media practice.

AB  - Aim: The aim was to gain an understanding of what the United Kingdom (UK) Punjabi Sikh community understands and thinks about advance care planning (ACP). This is in response to evidence showing a lack of service usage by Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic groups. Methods: Surveys containing questions about the impressions of terms, advance decisions for care, do-not-attempt-resuscitation, and lasting power of attorney were taken to targeted community groups; these included community day centers, sporting groups, temples, and social media circles. Surveys were available in both Punjabi and English languages. Results: A total of 311 surveys were received in total. There was a 50/50 gender split and a mixed group of ages; 75% were born in the UK and 15% were born in Punjab, India. Only a third had some understanding of what ACP meant. Nearly 50% of the participants did express wishes toward the end of their life, however only a third of the respondents knew how to access services. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was felt to be mandatory by 36%. Sixty percent thought that their decision would be legally binding in relatives who do not have capacity. Conclusion: This study showed that wishes for religious rites were common, however many do not know how to make them known. If they do know about services, then people are highly likely to engage with the ACP process.

AB  - This study compared the newsgathering goals of gatekeepers with public attitudes regarding the coverage of Africa by CNN International (CNNI). A critical discourse analysis was based on interviews with CNNI news producers and executives, and 6 focus groups of Ugandan viewers that were conducted in 2004 and 2008. Results show not only dissonance, but also a disconnection between CNNI news producers and Ugandan viewers' perceptions of the network and of their 2 major local stations. The network was the main source of international news in 2004 in Uganda but its appeal diminished by 2008. Viewers considered its coverage largely biased and ill-motivated towards Africa. CNNI was regarded more favorably than local television (UBC and WBS) news in quality and depth of news content in 2004 than in 2008. This love-hate relationship for CNNI and the other local television networks is discussed in detail.

AB  - Purpose:
   To describe media coverage and framing of Oakland, California's, sugar-sweetened beverage tax.
   Design:
   Media content analysis.
   Sample:
   Media documents (n = 90), published January 1, 2016-August 31, 2019, were retrieved from Oakland news outlets and ProQuest, NexusUni, EBSCO, and Google.
   Analysis:
   Documents were coded using constant comparative analysis in Atlas.ti v8; with descriptive analyses conducted using Stata/SE v. 15.1.
   Results:
   Documents were published evenly between pre- and post-ballot periods (n = 45); the majority (n = 47) provided neutral framing. Protax documents (n = 33) highlighted SSB consumption and health associations and countered antitax messaging; antitax documents (n = 10) focused on misinformation and sowing public confusion.
   Conclusion:
   Neutral media educates and raises awareness. Published prior to a vote, the media may help influence public opinion regarding SSB taxes. SSB tax media advocacy campaigns, giving particular attention to timing and perspective-based framing, may help to secure adoption and support implementation.

KW  - PERCEPTION
AB  - Analyzing social media has become a common way for capturing and understanding people's opinions, sentiments, interests, and reactions to ongoing events. Social media has thus become a rich and real-time source for various kinds of public opinion and sentiment studies. According to psychology and neuroscience, human emotions are known to be strongly dependent on sensory perceptions. Although sensation is the most fundamental antecedent of human emotions, prior works have not looked into their relation to emotions based on social media texts. In this paper, we report the results of our study on sensation effects that underlie human emotions as revealed in social media. We focus on the key five types of sensations: sight, hearing, touch, smell, and taste. We first establish a correlation between emotion and sensation in terms of linguistic expressions. Then, in the second part of the paper, we define novel features useful for extracting sensation information from social media. Finally, we design a method to classify texts into ones associated with different types of sensations. The sensation dataset resulting from this research is opened to the public to foster further studies.

AB  - The political impasse over global warming legislation stems from obstacles in the mass media arena, public awareness, electoral politics as well as governmental policy. Advocates of global warming policy have to be simultaneously successful in all four major public arenas to prevail. This article provides an overview of the obstacles in each public arena in the United States highlighting the broader context in which McCright and Dunlap's analysis of polarized public opinion operates. Global warming advocates have had their greatest success in the media arena but are checked by the rise of a conservative counter-campaign as well as media reporting norms, which have contributed to polarized public opinion and limited salience of the issue. Global warming never ranks in the top issue list to which electoral candidates attend, giving it little priority in national electoral contests. Although the House of Representatives passed the Waxman-Markey Bill in 2009, the bill died in the Senate and will not resurface until the Democratic margin is again large enough to overcome opposition vetoes. At the same time, major legislation has often incubated on the margins of these public arenas for significant time until a political crisis removes the normal obstacles to such major "watershed" legislation. For global warming, the long march through American public arenas appears to have begun.

AB  - Discussions generated in Russian and Western academic, policy-making and media circles by recent terrorist attacks in the Middle Volga and Urals (Idel-Ural) derive primarily from hegemonic state discourses and as such miss the wealth of discussion generated in local-language sources about the causes and implications of these attacks. The goal of this study is to provide an examination of the various perspectives concerning terrorism in the region, focusing on the level of Tatar (and secondarily Russian) society. Employing insights from a recent body of literature on 'everyday' and 'vernacular' (in) securities as well as on conspiracy theories, I examine Tatar-language Internet forums posted on the Radio Free Europe website related to the terror events of July 2012. I detect no incitement to violence among the Tatar-speaking participants. However, my results suggest that Tatar publics use diverse interpretive repertoires to make sense of a securitizing reality. The study suggests that Tatar-speaking publics depart in important ways from the dominant narrative of the ;'police' order as well as from the Weltanschauung of their Russian-speaking compatriots.

AB  - Hostility toward same-sex parenting is widespread. Literature supports one persistent argument against same-sex parenting which focusses on the concern for children's wellbeing, whereas lesbian and gay parents' ability is sometimes evaluated positively. In particular, the belief that children need both a father and a mother impacts the evaluation that same-sex parents are unfit to raise well-adjusted children. The present research aimed to investigate linking mechanisms and conditional processes underlying the evaluation of same-sex parents' ability. Cisgender heterosexual Italian participants (N = 320) read one of four vignettes describing a family situation - two types of same-sex (step)parents (i.e., lesbian and gay (step)parents) vs. two types of different-sex (step)parents (i.e., heterosexual (step)parents) - in which a child misbehaved in the context of a mild family disagreement. After reading the vignette, the participants rated parenting ability and to what extent the child's misbehavior was attributable to the parenting relationship. Moderated-mediation analyses indicated that same-sex (step)parents were perceived as being less capable parents compared to different-sex (step)parents by giving them greater responsibility for the child's misbehavior, among participants with medium and high levels of gender role beliefs. Implications for research on sexual discrimination are discussed.

AB  - In the context that Australian journalists and the Australian public are largely ignorant of Islam and Muslims and where racism and Islamophobia are historically rooted and persistent, this study reports on where Australians source their information about Islam and Muslims. In this study, we find that while a sample of Australian journalists believe overall that 80% of the Australian public relies on the mainstream news media as a primary source of information about the Islamic faith and its followers, this is a significant overestimation. This study identifies that the mainstream news media is a primary source of information about the religion of Islam and Muslim people for around half of Australia's non-Muslim population (49.27% and 45.89%, respectively). Muslim people, books, social media and family and friends are also important primary sources of information. In identifying the main sources of information about Islam and Muslims in Australia, this study answers the question posed by social geographer Kevin Dunn more than a decade ago. By comparing perceptions with reality, we find the mainstream news media are not as significant a source of information for non-Muslim Australians about Islam and Muslims as our sample of journalists believe them to be. This opens up the space for policymakers to look for new and targeted ways (beyond improving the ways the news media report stories about Islam and Muslims) to normalise Islam as a religion of peace and further work to combat entrenched Islamophobia, key among them are Muslim people.

AB  - Horsti's article analyses how transformations in the media environment shaped the political success of the anti-immigration movement in Finland from 2003 to 2013. The qualitative textual analysis of blogs and mainstream media debates that relate to racism and the national populist Finns Party demonstrates how changes in the mediascape in general and in new media technology in particular have provided opportunities for the emerging anti-immigration movement. These changes facilitated the earlier development of the Finns Party but the fragmentation of online space later hindered the internal coherence of the movement and its integration into the populist party political family. In order to regain unity, the Finns Party performed the public scapegoating of individuals for racist speech, thus distancing itself from racism. Horsti shows that, rather than being isolated and marginal, the anti-immigration movement and the uncivil' public sphere overlap with traditional politics and the mainstream media.

AB  - Public awareness has an important effect on the legislation and implementation of climate change policies. Against the backdrop of the "Big Data Era," social media is an appealing and promising tool for a timely and complete understanding of public perception and attitudes towards climate policies. This paper examines the public's spontaneous attention and awareness about carbon emissions trading (ETS). Tweets related to the EUETS, published between 2008 and 2019, were collected for multi-dimensional analysis. Empirical results show several important findings. First, public attention on the EU-ETS has increased significantly since 2011. Second, government officials and industry practitioners have a stronger influence in the discussions than the public and industrial enterprises. Third, topic followers mostly gathered in Belgium (16.65%), the UK (11.6%), and some non-regulated countries like the US and Australia. Fourth, the public mainly focused on the policies and legislation, allowance price, and allocation. The innovation of this study rests in the development of a social media data-based research framework to examine the public's cognition of climate policies, which integrates the advantages of public social media, social network analysis, and text topic analysis. This study provides comprehensive analysis and support for climate policy implementation and public acceptance improvement.

AB  - Despite the importance that the media has in regard to influencing people's perceptions of wrongdoing, organizational scholars have paid little attention to how the media reports wrongdoing. This article starts to address this gap by considering how the media frames corporate scandals. We empirically examine how four different German newspapers reported on the Volkswagen diesel scandal. We inductively identify the constitutive elements of a general corporate scandal frame. Then, we analyze how each newspaper framed the scandal through combinations of different elements. We identify from our dataset four frames of corporate scandals that newspapers applied: legalistic, contextual, reputational, and scapegoating. Our article testifies to the importance of cross-fertilization between research on mass communication and political science on one side, and organizational research on the other side and, more generally, it calls for more attention to be given to the media in the study of scandals and organizational wrongdoing.

AB  - Since its 2016 launch, negative attitudes towardThe Athletic, a network of hyperlocal subscription sports news sites, have resonated throughout the journalism community because of the new media startup's nontraditional approach, one centered on hiring established journalists from the hometown newspaper. Therefore, to accurately paint a picture ofThe Athletic's perceived impact on print journalism, 22 in-depth interviews were conducted with newspaper sports editors. This analysis reveals that most sports editors were generally accepting ofThe Athleticand viewed its presence as reinforcement that newspapers need to stick to daily coverage to stand out in the crowded sports media marketplace.

AB  - This research examines the effects of racial stereotypes embedded within sports media. An experiment was conducted to examine the impact of racialized "brawn" and "brain" frames on perceptions of student-athletes among their potential peers. College student participants (N = 232) were exposed to one of eight versions of a news article about a college football recruit that manipulated the athlete's race (White vs. Black) and the frame used to describe him (brawn vs. brain vs. mixed vs. control). Results showed a college admittance essay was evaluated more positively when the author was a Black athlete compared to a White athlete. In addition, the brawn frame elicited lower levels of social attraction and greater athlete stereotype endorsement compared to all other frames. No interaction effects were revealed. These findings suggest that how the media frame student-athletes affects expectations of their academic performance, which has practical implications for interpersonal dynamics between student-athletes and their peers, as well as public perceptions of student-athletes writ large.

AB  - Explanatory models accounting for variation in policy choices by democratic governments usually include a demand (by the public) and a supply (by the government) component, whereas the latter component is usually better developed from a measurement viewpoint. The main reason is that public opinion surveys, the standard approach to measuring public demand, are expensive, difficult to implement simultaneously for different countries for purposes of crossnational comparison and impossible to implement ex post for purposes of longitudinal analysis if survey data for past time periods are lacking. We therefore propose a new approach to measuring public demand, focussing on political claims made by nongovernmental actors and expressed in the news. To demonstrate the feasibility and usefulness of our measure of published opinion, we focus on climate policy in the time period between 1995 and 2010. When comparing the new measure of published opinion with the best available public opinion survey and internet search data, it turns out that our data can serve as a meaningful proxy for public demand.

AB  - This study explores the multidimensionality of engagements with international large-scale standardised assessments (ILSAs). The objective is to understand how different policy actors-government, media, and citizens-rationalise, report, and perceive China's PISA participation. First, government archive analysis traces a decade of documents (2005-2015), and the findings show that Shanghai's initial participation in PISA was rationalised as a policy experiment for learning Western ideas of education governance. Second, media content analysis of two major news outlets indicates that media framing of PISA participation was strategic on timing, intensity, and tone. Third, a public opinion survey yields results which show that low public knowledge of Shanghai's PISA participation in 2012 is prevalent. Drawing on these findings, this study investigates how the ILSA movement, exemplified by PISA, engages different levels of stakeholders in China.

AB  - Hate crimes carry many emotional and psychological detriments for those who are targeted because of who they are. The harms associated with hate are commonly theorized in the context of those directly targeted. Using a victimological lens, I consider how the harms of a mass anti-LGBT+ shooting in Orlando, Florida were carried across social media, indirectly victimizing LGBT+ people in the North East of England. This article examines seven distinct interviews conducted post-Orlando from a wider sample of 32. LGBT+ participants were victimized vicariously by receiving news of the Orlando shooting. They utilized social media to organize vigils, stand in solidarity with LGBT+ Floridians, and share in the emotional distress caused by the shooting. The findings contribute to our understandings of hate crime as a communicative tool, by examining the role of social media in carrying the emotional harms associated with hate. Through these in-depth narratives, this article encourages a conversation about how hate crimes, transmitted across social media, can victimize people who share the victimized identity with the direct victims.

AB  - This article analyzes framing strategies by political actors and their impact on media framing. By framing the issue strategically, we argue that political actors face three strategic choices. First, they must choose one or several substantive frames capable of steering the attention of the media and the public to their own cause and away from the cause of their opponents (osubstantive emphasis choiceo). Second, they must decide about the amount of attention they want to pay to the opponent's substantive frame(s) as compared to their own frames and whether they want to use their opponents' frames offensively or defensively (ooppositional emphasis choiceo). Third, they must decide about how much priority they want to give to their own substantive frame(s) as compared to the (referendum) campaign contest (ocontest emphasis choiceo). The results are based on a Swiss direct-democratic campaign about the tightening of the asylum law and can be summarized along the three choices. First, in this case, the framing input of the political actors is decisive. The media tend to respect frame ownership and report accordingly. Second, while the political actors predominantly focus on their own frames, they do not exclusively, but refer to their adversaries' frames as well. They do so mainly in a defensive way. The journalists reported both camps with their adversaries' frames too, and attributed a slightly more offensive stance to both camps. Third, the political actors mainly focus on substance. The substantive frames also dominate in the media.

AB  - What explains support for Black Lives Matter among Asian Americans? This article draws on nationally representative data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey to examine the contours of Asian American public opinion on Black Lives Matter and the factors that shape them. Examining intragroup and intergroup attitudes across a set of racial, ethnic/national origin, and cross-racial group measures, I show that race-based considerations are significant predictors of Asian American support for Black Lives Matter. Specifically, I find that those who support Black Lives Matter are more likely to perceive linked fate with other Asian Americans and with other non-white groups and to perceive anti-black discrimination in the United States. I argue that, while never a panacea, race-based linked fate beliefs among Asian Americans, both as Asian Americans and with other groups of color, are a viable and imperative part of building cross-racial coalitions and contemporary racial justice movements.

AB  - Research design involves a set of decisions regarding what or who will be studied and the procedures in acquiring and analyzing information. In this article, we apply lessons from research design to public diplomacy, a field focused on engaging with foreign publics. Much prior scholarship sheds light on what PD is and its programs, but less attention has been given to the role of listening to understand what foreign publics think and believe. We propose three interrelated recommendations to improve the quality of implementing PD programs. First, before any program is implemented, we need to correctly identify a perceived issue that requires a program. Once we confirm if the issue exists, we also need to understand why it exists. Second, designing PD programs with clear goals increases the effectiveness of the program and the ability to confirm its success. This requires designing programs unique to each case. Third, public opinion data should be collected at several points-taking advantage of time-to confirm the effectiveness of programs. Our recommendations are particularly valuable for policy makers.

AB  - Despite growing attention to corporate social-political advocacy, little is known about how publics mobilize and establish relationships in social media when firms are involved in hot-button issues. Using the social network approach, this study examines a network structure which emerged around boycotting and advocating for Starbucks and Budweiser when these two brands responded to President Donald Trump's immigration ban executive order in 2017. The study identified three unique characteristics in the boycotters' networks. The boy-cotters appeared not only in the aggregated brand boycotting networks, but also in the advocators' networks. In addition, boycotters in Budweiser and Starbucks networks were engaged in boycotting other brands or organizations which were opposed to Republicans or President Trump's policy. Finally, the network of boycotters was very dense and highly connected among subgroups while that of advocators was sparse. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - Second-level agenda-setting suggests that news media influence how we think. As a case study examining the nature and effects of mainstream news media's coverage of the 2015 Apple/FBI dispute about data privacy versus national security, this study found via content analysis that a majority of articles covering the dispute (73.7%) made the same potentially misleading claim about how the American public feels about the dispute. Nearly half (45.6%) of those articles made public opinion claims without offering empirical evidence, and almost all articles (97.4%) that cited the Pew survey appeared to have inadvertently created an unsubstantiated social reality. Then, this study found in a subsequent experiment that, consistent with impersonal influence, the above-mentioned news portrayals significantly affected the participants' view on Americans' collective opinion towards the Apple/FBI dispute. The long-term effect of this journalistic oversight is notable. Theoretical implications and practical recommendations for future science communication in the news are discussed.

AB  - The study of public opinion in nondemocratic states has found that people often say they support democracy, yet they show little demand for democratization or regime change. Given this paradox, recent scholarship has shown that these attitudes exist because people who live under the rule of non-democratic regimes often misunderstand what democracy is. Individuals in these societies often think that authoritarian ways of governance are fundamental aspects of democracy. In another strain of literature, research has shown that the internet can alter demands for democracy and increase protest activity in non-democracies. Given these findings, this study investigates what impact the internet has on understanding democracy in non-democracies. Using World Values Survey data and employing two different styles of empirical modelling, the study finds that consuming information from the internet leads to a better understanding of essential elements of democracy. The findings also show that the effects are more pronounced in autocracies than they are in illiberal regimes.

AB  - A confluence of interests and forces among Norwegian political, media and legal elites since the Rushdie affair and the 'Mohammed cartoon crisis' have created conditions in which minority protections against racist and discriminatory speech as guaranteed by Norwegian law, and Norwegian obligations under international law, have been rendered all but ineffective - in the name of stronger protections for freedom of expression. In the event, Islamophobia and anti-Muslim racism have not only often gone unchallenged, but have been amplified and disseminated both through the extreme rightwing presence on the internet, and in mainstream and respected Norwegian print media. The ideology of Anders Breivik, perpetrator of the massacre of 22/7/2011, was not isolated, but forms part of a larger and by many accounts growing phenomenon. Successive government commissions on freedom of expression in Norway have only exacerbated this tendency. This article explores the philosophical and political underpinnings of the freedom of expression debate in Norway and warns about the threat to liberal democracy and equal citizenship from the sanitising and mainstreaming of virulent far-right racism and extremism.

AB  - This study examines how individuals' opinion congruence with macro/micro-climates of opinion and others' supportive online comments influence their willingness to speak out on social media. We conducted two experiments with 413 adults and found that people with macro-opinion congruence (i.e., societal majority) were more willing to speak out when perceiving supportive interactions from the majority of online commenters than no supportive interactions. Competence was a significant factor found to explain why people become emboldened to speak out under such conditions (i.e., macro-opinion congruence with majority online commenters' supportive communication). However, counter to our original prediction, even if people perceive macroopinion congruence, people with opinions incongruent with the majority online commenters are less willing to speak out when the minority online commenters (i.e., congruent with their own opinion) express supportive communication than no supportive communication. Although sense of community was found to be a significant mediating factor in explaining why people were more or less willing to speak out on social media in experiment 2, why supportive communication among minority online commenters diminished their willingness to speak out, rather than amplifying it, calls for further investigation. By incorporating factors like one's competence and sense of community, we identified the underlying mechanism of social empowerment while revisiting and expanding the spiral of silence theory in the context of social media interactions.

AB  - The implicit association test (IAT) and concept of implicit bias have significantly influenced the scientific, institutional, and public discourse on racial prejudice. In spite of this, there has been little investigation of how ordinary people make sense of the IAT and the bias it claims to measure. This article examines the public understanding of this research through a discourse analysis of reactions to the IAT and implicit bias in the news media. It demonstrates the ways in which readers interpreted, related to, and negotiated the claims of IAT science in relation to socially shared and historically embedded concerns and identities. IAT science was discredited in accounts that evoked discourses about the marginality of academic preoccupations, and helped to position test-takers as targets of an oppressive political correctness and psychologists as liberally biased. Alternatively, the IAT was understood to have revealed widely and deeply held biases towards racialized others, eliciting accounts that took the form of psychomoral confessionals. Such admissions of bias helped to constitute moral identities for readers that were firmly positioned against racial bias. Our findings are discussed in terms of their implications for using the IAT in prejudice reduction interventions, and communicating to the public about implicit bias.

AB  - Employing a public opinion survey and a content analysis of local media, this study sets out to examine of the agenda-setting effect in China. China is highlighted in this study because it is a collectivist, socialist nation whose mainstream media is largely controlled by the state. Data from this study reveal that (a) Chinese people make clear distinctions between issues of personal importance (their personal agenda) and issues of national importance (their social agenda) and (b) the agenda-setting function of Chinese media was only observed when considering one's social agenda; the personal agenda was not related with the Chinese media agenda. These findings hold true when comparing across different demographic groups on variables such as age, education, news source, and one's ability to critically analyze news. This article contributes to agenda-setting scholarship by providing empirical evidence of agenda-setting effects in a political and media structure substantially different from the Western structures usually examined in such research.

AB  - Domestic violence is a widespread issue, with victims suffering emotional and physical harm and severe cases resulting in homicide. Media presentation of extreme instances of domestic homicide may affect public opinion and related public policies. This study examines the presentation of homicide in print news media in the context of victim-offender relationship (domestic vs. non-domestic) using measures of article prominence. The sample includes articles published in the Vancouver Sun over a 12-year period (2004-2015) that reported on a homicide in British Columbia, Canada, with nature of the victim-offender relationship specified (n = 3,877). Results show that domestic-related homicides are reported less prominently than are non-domestic homicides, including being shorter in length, less likely to be placed on the front page, and less likely to include an image. Results are discussed in light of media impact on public opinion and the influence on public efforts to address and prevent the consequences of domestic violence.

AB  - The size of China's State-owned media's operations in Africa has grown significantly since the early 2000s. Previous research on the impact of increased Sino-African mediated engagements has been inconclusive. Some researchers hold that public opinion toward China in African nations has been improving because of the increased media presence. Others argue that the impact is rather limited, particularly when it comes to affecting how African media cover China-related stories. This article contributes to this debate by exploring the extent to which news media in 30 African countries relied on Chinese news sources to cover China and the COVID-19 outbreak during the first-half of 2020. By computationally analyzing a corpus of 500,000 written news stories, this paper shows that, compared to other major global players (e.g. Reuters, AFP), content distributed by Chinese media (e.g. Xinhua, China Daily) is much less likely to be used by African news organizations, both in English and French speaking countries. The analysis also reveals a gap in the prevailing themes in Chinese and African media's coverage of the pandemic. The implications of these findings for the sub-field of Sino-African media relations, and the study of global news flows are discussed.

AB  - This study aims to demonstrate and change negative perceptions of descendants of members of the Indonesian Communist Party (Partai Komunis Indonesia/PKI), a stigmatized social group in Indonesia. In Studies 1 and 2, participants were given positive descriptions of an adult (Study 1) and a child (Study 2), and were asked to evaluate them twice, before and after reading information about the target's family background. In Study 1, targets were described either as descendants of PKI members, members of another Indonesian party or criminals. In Study 2, the target was presented as a descendant of PKI members, of members of another Indonesian party or without information on family background (control condition). The studies showed that whenever people were 'revealed' to be descendants of PKI members, the respondents' judgments became more negative, and their assumptions about commonly shared views of these people became more negative as well. In Studies 3 and 4, participants were again given descriptions of an adult (Study 3) and a child (Study 4), which were both described as descendants of PKI members. Half of the participants were reminded afterwards with a written statement that every human is by nature good and unique (the experimental condition), while the other half did not get any additional information (control group) By making salient a shared and positively valued human 'essence', it was possible to alleviate the stigma that still is attached to PKI-affiliations in Indonesian society. We end the study with a discussion of our findings' political and societal implications.

AB  - Mainstream North American media promotes the message that attaining a thin, youthful appearance is central to a woman's value and social role while appearing older is highly undesirable. However, appearance ideals and attitudes toward aging differ substantially across cultural and ethnic groups, which may influence the degree to which one internalizes media ideals and holds anti-aging attitudes. Consequently, this study examined the relationships between internalization of the youthful, thin-ideal appearance perpetuated by mainstream North American media and attitudes toward the elderly in a sample of 281 undergraduate females under the age of 30 attending a university in the Western United States. Specifically, European American (n = 115), Asian American/Pacific Islander (n = 74), Hispanic/Latina (n = 52), and African American (n = 42) women voluntarily completed self-report measures of internalization of media ideals and attitudes towards older adults. Attitudes towards the elderly were significantly more negative at higher levels of internalization of North American appearance ideals, independent of ethnicity. These data suggest that internalization of North American appearance ideals perpetuated by media are related to negative attitudes towards older adults. Future research should investigate the influence of negative attitudes about aging on behaviors toward older adults or one's own aging process.

AB  - Public Policy Relevance Statement Entertainment celebrities often voice their stance on various social issues. The study examines the consequences of this practice, showing that although entertainers can leverage their celebrity status to attenuate public opinion, it might come at the cost of their popularity. These findings can inform efforts to maximize the impact of political advocacy, enhance celebrity management practices, and promote political participation.
   The present study examines 4 cognitive discrepancy management strategies that media users can use in response to a celebrity making a political statement that runs contrary to their beliefs. The experiment (N = 382) replicates the results using 3 celebrities and 2 attitude object contexts. Exposure to a celebrity making political statements that the media user disagrees with resulted in weaker parasocial relationships with the celebrity and attribution of lesser importance to that issue. Viewers who particularly liked the celebrity prior to the study were more likely to decouple the actor from their line of work to continue enjoying the actor's media content despite their political disagreement. These findings illuminate the potential consequences of celebrity politics for both the media figures' stardom and the citizens' political participation.

AB  - The objective of the study is to contribute to the discourse about media by investigating frames and journalistic techniques used by the corporate mass media to establish boundaries for understanding police and protesters at the 2010 G20 Summit, any temporal changes, and the applicability of the hierarchy of credibility at this international protest event. Using data from 2009 to 2011 in two national and one local newspaper, a frame analysis seeks to uncover how the media frame behaviour and events, what are the primary and second definers of reality, and how the police and protesters are depicted as social problems. The findings suggest that media portrayals of the social actors are framed within an inferential structure that shifts from protester violence before the summits to police violence afterward. Episodic coverage and the decontextualization of people and events create the boundaries for discussion, through the use of the attribution-of-responsibility, conflict, economic-consequences, and human-interest generic frames in the areas of security, social problems, and controversy. We conclude that the results depart from previous research by suggesting a reconceptualization of the hierarchy of credibility. Within conflict and human interest frames, this crisis event destabilized the police as primary definers of crime in favour of citizens and protesters.

TI  - Media Discussion on the Naturalization Policy for Syrians in Turkey
T2  - INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION
LA  - English
AB  - This study focuses on the public opinion on the naturalization policy for Syrians in Turkey. It analyses news media coverage in the religious, far-right newspaper (Yeni Akit), a centre-right newspaper (Hurriyet), a social democrat newspaper (Cumhuriyet), and a socialist-left news portal (Solportal). The research question is: What are the metaphors, arguments, and omissions produced by media of different ideologies about the possible citizenship of Syrians in Turkey? The results show that metaphors and arguments differ according to ideological stance, suggesting that the current political polarization in Turkey affects the public's acceptance of Syrians and challenges Turkey's established migration policy. Each ideological stance accepts Syrians on a selective basis, implying that universal naturalization of Syrians is not welcome; instead, there seems to be consensus favouring naturalization according to socio-economic criteria. These results indicate a need for a change in migration policy, especially concerning disadvantaged Syrians.

AB  - This article is a theoretical analysis and generalisation of scholars' views on different approaches to understanding visualisation in modern society and determining its impact on public opinion. It is proved that the use of propaganda 2.0 in the series increases the manipulative impact on modem society. The article aims to analyse the impact of visualisation on creating a picture of the world (on the example of the series "Squid Game"). The methodological basis of our article are general scientific methods of cognition of social phenomena and processes (analysis, synthesis, induction, deduction, typology, modeling, extrapolation, operationalisation, interpretation, abstraction, generalisation, and synergy, as well as methods of logical-historical, systematic, comparative, networking and structural-fimctional analysis). With the help of the logical-historical method the evolution of the formation of the influence of virtual reality on public opinion in modern society is traced; method of comparative analysis -identified the characteristics of the modern generation and their preferences for the consumption of information through modern media; method of typological analysis - identified signs and approaches to the definition of propaganda and propaganda 2.0; method of systems analysis - visualisation is considered as a holistic tool for creating a picture of the world of modern society. It is shown that with the transition of modem society in the information space, our lives have been significantly transformed. Society no longer feels the systemic influence of information, which does not determine the possibility of protection from it. The article identifies and reveals the key ideas of the series "Squid Game".

AB  - Digital media provide individuals platforms to express political views. Despite the significant scholarly attention to how and why political expression occurs through technologies and to what effect, research remains fragmented in its theoretical frameworks. The present work synthesizes research on computer-mediated communication and political communication to offer a framework that describes theoretically (a) which technological affordances lead (b) to which psychological processes with (c) which politically relevant actions. We address these questions in the context of four different technological affordances. In doing so, we emphasize the psychological cost-benefit calculations that occur when deciding whether to engage in political expression online.

AB  - Internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced leads to heightened control of stereotype activation. However, it is not clear whether internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced only reduces stereotype activation or whether individuals high internally motivated to behave nonprejudiced are also more successful in intentionally controlling already activated stereotypes. Two studies show that internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced when measured as well as when manipulated leads to more efficient control of activated stereotypes. This underlines the powerful potential of internal motivation to behave nonprejudiced to support the intentional control of previously activated stereotypes.

AB  - Indoor tanning (IT) increases risk of developing skin cancer. A social media campaign to reduce mother's permissiveness toward their teenage daughters IT was evaluated. Mothers (N = 869) of daughters aged 14-17 in 34 states without bans on IT by minors were enrolled in a randomized trial with assessments at baseline and 12-months follow-up in 2017-19. A year-long adolescent health campaign was delivered to all mothers. The intervention group received posts on preventing IT and the control group, posts about preventing prescription drug misuse. Daughters (n = 469; 54.0%) completed the assessments at baseline and 12 months. At 12-month follow-up, intervention-group mothers were less permissive of IT by daughters (unadjusted means = 1.70 [95% CI: 1.59, 1.80] v. 1.85 [1.73, 1.97] [5-point Likert scale], b = -0.152), reported more communication about avoiding IT with daughters (4.09 [3.84, 4.35] v. 3.42 [3.16, 3.68] [sum of 7 yes/no items], b = 0.213), and had lower intentions to indoor tan (1.41 [1.28, 1.55] v. 1.60 [1.43, 1.76] [7-point likelihood scale], b = -0.221) than control-group mothers. Daughters confirmed intervention-group mothers communicated about IT (3.81 [3.49, 4.14] v. 3.20 [2.87, 3.53] [sum of 7 yes/no items], b = 0.237) and shared IT posts (unadjusted percentages = 52.4% v. 36.4%, b = 0.438) more than control-group mothers. No differences were found in IT behavior, self-efficacy to refuse permission, and negative attitudes toward IT. A social media campaign may be an effective strategy to convince mothers to withhold permission for IT, which may help increase the effectiveness of state laws designed to reduce IT by minors by requiring parental permission.

AB  - Compartmental models have been used to model information diffusion on social media. However, there have been few studies on modelling positive and negative public opinions using compartmental models. This study aimed for using sentiment analysis and compartmental model to model the propagation of positive and negative opinions on microblogging big media. The authors studied the news propagation of seven popular social topics on China's Sina Weibo microblogging platform. Natural language processing and sentiment analysis were used to identify public opinions from microblogging big data. Then two existing (SIZ and SEIZ) models and a newly developed (SE2IZ) model were implemented to model the news propagation and evaluate the trends of public opinions on selected social topics. Simulation study was used to check model fitting performance. The results show that the new SE2IZ model has a better model fitting performance than existing models. This study sheds some new light on using social media for public opinion estimation and prediction.

AB  - This study investigates the framing effects of gay-themed entertainment media in China. Specifically, the study explores the mechanisms underlying attribution framing and value framing, through two separate experiments. The results of the first experiment indicate that exposure to attribution frames had considerable influence on the participants' perceptions of the controllability of homosexuality and their emotional responses. In addition, fictional entertainment media's framing of the origin of homosexuality indirectly influenced the participants' opinion through anger. Those participants exposed to a program homosexuality as a type of controllable' sexuality were likely to express anger and thus were not likely to support gay rights. The results of the second experiment indicate that the core values reflected in a gay-themed program affected the participants' opinions by changing their perception of the importance of value-related beliefs. Those participants exposed to a frame reflecting family values were likely to consider beliefs about family values to be important, which facilitated their support for gay people's personal dignity and equal rights to jobs, housing, and freedom of expression, among others.

AB  - How do people form beliefs about the factual content of major events when established geopolitical orders are violently challenged? Here, we address the tragic events of 2 May 2014, in Odesa, Ukraine. There, Euromaidan protest movement supporters and opponents clashed following Russia's annexation of Crimea and the onset of the Donbas conflict, culminating in the worst civilian death toll the city had seen since World War II. Shortly after, we surveyed Ukraine's population about who they thought had actually perpetrated the killings and relate people's answers to alternative narratives (frames) that an original content analysis finds were available to Ukrainian citizens through different media. We find evidence, consistent with theories of hot cognition and motivated reasoning, that the Odesa violence triggered emotional responses linked to ethnic, regional, and partisan identity, which then activated attitudes associated with these identities that, in turn, led people to adopt very different (sometimes highly improbable) beliefs about who carried out the killings. Ethnic identity in particular is found to have strongly moderated the effects of television, with Ukrainian television greatly influencing Ukrainians but backfiring among Russians, and Russian television mainly impacting non-Ukrainians. Education and local information are found to reduce susceptibility to televised factual narratives.

   This study attempted to combine the text mining method and the fuzzy association rules mining method to explore the main points of web posts about the reasons of bike-sharing company's failure in Taiwan. This research can offer a new way of data mining research.
   The sharing economy has become an important issue in recent years. Many researchers have paid attention to its application around the world. The sharing of bikes, as one of the major applications of the sharing economy, has shown its advantage in the realm of environmental protection and low energy consumption. However, bike-sharing system has encountered problems in certain regions. This arouses the concern about the sustainable development of the bike-sharing system. This research focused on the failure case of oBike in Taiwan. This research used text mining and fuzzy association rules mining methods to evaluate Taiwan's public opinion about the oBike in order to verify the reasons for oBike's failure in Taiwan. This study also made a comparison between the bike-sharing system in Mainland China and Taiwan. The research results explored the factors of oBike's failure in Taiwan and showcased the problems of bike-sharing systems in different regions. The research results also offer useful information for bike-sharing companies and the authorities concerned in order to develop a sustainable bike-sharing system.

AB  - This study examined the emergence of corporate social responsibility (CSR) as a public issue over 25 years using a content analysis of two national news- papers and seven regional, geographically-dispersed newspapers in the U.S. The present study adopted a comprehensive definition encompassing all four CSR dimensions: economic, ethical, legal, and philanthropic. This study examined newspaper editorials, letters to the editor, op-ed columns, news analyses, and guest columns for three aspects: media attention, media prominence, and media valence. Results showed an increase in the number of opinion pieces covering CSR issues over the 25-year period. The prominence of each of the four CSR dimensions varied over time. Each of the four CSR dimensions had its moment of media prominence when it was more important than the other dimensions. The most prevalent valence of the opinion pieces was negative; the volume of negative pieces increased over the 25 years, whereas the number of opinions with positive, neutral, and mixed tones showed little change over time. The study concludes by tracing the implications of the role of the news media for business ethics research.

AB  - Introduction. Contrary to TV programs projecting awareness about organ donation in society, concrete evidence exists about adverse influence of negative broadcasts on organ donation rates. We sought to determine the effect of mass media on public opinion toward organ donation and the efficacy of public campaigns and novel social media attempts on donation rates.
   Methods. We conducted a systematic review of relevant literature and national campaign results.
   Results. Hoaxes about brain death and organ transplantation adversely affect organ donation rates in both Western and Eastern societies. Scientifically controversial and exaggerated press conferences and institutional advertisements create mistrust in doctors, thus reducing organ donation. The overall effect of public education campaigns in promoting organ donation is a temporary 5% gain. Increments in organ donation rates is expected with novel applications of social media (Facebook effect).
   Conclusion. Communication, based on mutual trust, must be established between medicine and the media. Continuing education programs with regard to public awareness on organ donation should be conducted over social media.

AB  - There are few questions of greater significance in African international relations than China's actions in and engagement with other states. Chinese infrastructure, businesses, and people have blanketed the continent and revolutionized lifestyles, transportation, and political economies. The advantages and detractions of such developments, in turn, have shaped local attitudes. African attitudes towards China, nevertheless, remain largely the subject of conjecture. This article explores the contemporary attitudes of Kenyan university students to China through surveys and contributes empirical data to the literature. Combined with a comparative textual analysis of the main Kenyan newspaper, the article sheds light on largely unknown-but generally assumed-attitudes of Kenyans towards China. The findings question a stereotype of China in Kenya and, by extension, the actions and reactions of other Africans and African states towards it. They also uncover nuanced attitudes that confound the mostly negative Western narrative about China in Africa. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as debt, perceived racism and unfair labour practices, Kenyan university students' attitudes and discourse in the elite media have become less positive. There is, in addition, the broad perception that it is Kenya's leadership that benefits from the relationship and not so much its ordinary citizens.

AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.

AB  - The article presents the results of the comparative study of the neighboring countries' images in the perception of the Russian student youth. In the first part of the article, the authors emphasize the importance of public opinion as one of the key social institutions in the contemporary society though it is often manipulated by state and political organizations to ensure the public support of ambiguous decisions. There are two basic mechanisms to form social representations including the images of different countries in public opinion: spontaneous and purposeful (when officials and media use special techniques to create an image of either a dangerous enemy or the best geopolitical friend). Today in Russia the former seems to dominate for except the key geopolitical powers other countries seem to attract the state attention rather sporadically, which is supported by general political indifference, wide dissemination of information technologies, and freedom of travels all over the world, etc. The second part of the article focuses on the methodological consequences of thus developing images in the Russian public opinion. The authors explain the thematic structure and techniques of the questionnaire developed for the study of the images of China, Kazakhstan and Serbia in the Russian student youth' worldview, which were applied in the sociological survey of 2010-2011 in the project supported by the Russian Foundation for Humanities, and then again in 2016 for the comparative analysis. The last part of the article presents the results of these surveys in the comparative perspective and focuses on a few indicators to reconstruct the persistent stereotypic elements of the neighboring countries' images in the student youth worldview though there are some changes that are difficult to interpret.

KW  - "Battle of Kosovo" film
AB  - The author explores the creation of public opinion in Serbia in the late 1980s and the (ab)use of the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Kosovo on 28 June 1989. As a result of Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic's carefully planned propaganda, a negative image of Albanians as well as a positive perception of Serbian nationalism were enforced. The media and popular culture played a particularly important role in reviving the Kosovo Myth, together with the leading Serbian (academic) institutions and influential intellectuals. Thirty-some years after 1989, the Kosovo Myth is presented in the media in a largely unchanged manner, while for Serbia the Kosovo problem remains unsolved.

AB  - School interventions to address sexual orientation discrimination can be important tools for fostering inclusive school climate, and improving student wellbeing. In this study, we empirically evaluated a film-based intervention, Out in Schools, designed to reduce sexual orientation prejudice and foster inclusive school attitudes. Our evaluation mapped data about Out in Schools presentations onto student data from the random cluster-stratified, province-wide 2013 British Columbia Adolescent Health Survey (BCAHS) as well as potential confounding variables of Gay-Straight Alliance clubs (GSAs) and inclusive school policies. Outcome measures included past year sexual orientation discrimination, bullying, suicidal ideation, and school connectedness among lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) and heterosexual (HET) students in grades 8 through 12 (ages 13 to 18; unweighted N = 21,075, weighted/scaled N = 184,821). Analyses used complex samples logistic regression, adjusted for sample design, conducted separately by gender and orientation. We found Out in Schools presentations were associated with reduced odds of LGB students experiencing discrimination, and both LGB and HET girl students being bullied or considering suicide, and increased levels of school connectedness, even after controlling for GSAs and policies. Out in Schools appears to have an additive contribution to reducing orientation prejudice and improving LGB and heterosexual student wellbeing within schools.

AB  - As interlocutors in national level discourse with the power to influence public opinion and inform policy, the news media are an important data source in understanding the constitutive roles played by culture and discourse in shaping health experiences and outcomes. This paper reports on a critical discourse analysis of news media coverage of HIV in the Republic of Ireland between 2006 and 2016. This period is significant because of the considerable increase in new HIV diagnoses that occurred in Ireland after the 2008 recession. Analysis of articles (n = 103) demonstrated a pattern of dividing practices whereby people living with or affected by HIV were frequently positioned as somatically and morally deficient via discourses of risk and responsibility. Little focus was given over to examination of the structural drivers of HIV, occluding the social context of the epidemic. The findings suggest that media discourses on HIV have the potential to other people living with HIV and generate stigma by invoking a dynamic of blame and shame frequently implicated in the stigma process.

   Result Nine months after this momentous Icelandic victory, Asgeir Petur borvaldsson a medical doctor in Iceland, posted a tweet in jest suggesting that a baby boom had occurred as a result of increased celebratory coital activity following the win. The media covered this widely but statistical analysis shows otherwise and this was confirmed by the original tweet source.
   Discussion: Given the increase in fake scientific news, it is especially important for scientists to correct misinformation lest the public loses trust in science or gains a distorted understanding of known facts.

AB  - Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama struggled to overcome widespread and persistent myths about their proposals to reform the American health care system. Their difficulties highlight the influence of factual misinformation in national politics and the extent to which it correlates with citizens' political views. In this essay, I explain how greater elite polarization and the growth in media choice have reinforced the partisan divide in factual beliefs. To illustrate these points, I analyze debates over health care reform in 1993-1994 and 2009-2010, tracing the spread of false claims about reform proposals from Bill Clinton and Barack Obama and analyzing the prevalence of misinformation in public opinion. Since false beliefs are extremely difficult to correct, I conclude by arguing that increasing the reputational costs for dishonest elites might be a more effective approach to improving democratic discourse.

AB  - Prior research indicates that the news media play a critical role in transmitting information to the public about the most pressing public health problems, and framing attributions about who in society is responsible for solving these problems. In this article, we use content analysis methods to study the agenda-setting and framing functions of the news media in shaping perceptions about the health risks posed by trans fat in the U.S. diet. A census of news stories focusing on trans fat was collected from the two largest circulation U.S. newspapers and three major television networks from 1998 to 2008 (N=156). The content of news coverage was analyzed using a 23-item instrument. Findings indicated that the news media served an important agenda-setting role in educating the public about the presence of trans fat in the U.S. diet and describing the health risks these foods pose. In addition, results indicate that news media coverage framed attributions of responsibility for solving the problem of trans fat in the food supply. News stories noting the heart disease risks of trans fat were significantly more likely to mention governmental responses aimed at curbing consumption than news coverage that did not note these health risks.

It explores the implication of findings on the prevalence of human interest framing in immigration coverage for comparative analysis, suggesting that it may be too simplistic to assume that commercialization is always associated with human interest framing, particularly in coverage of marginalized populations. It also explores the complexity of public opinion on immigration, and issues about how to understand the role of media over time in the evolution of public opinion.

AB  - This paper explores the intersection of race, law and medical authority in Gilded Age New York through an examination of the trial and execution of Chastine Cox. This case was a media sensation due to two controversies which played out in the courtroom and the court of public opinion. For the public, Cox's race inflected the debate over the crime and execution. Within the courtroom, however, controversy centred on the interpretation of medical evidence, which raised the possibility that Cox was not guilty. In particular, the defence strategy centred on medical theories of suspended animation, making use of new medical evidence about the line between life and death to prompt uncertainties both about the possibility of murder and the reliability of medical professionals. This paper demonstrates the ways in which anxieties about life, death, law, race and medicine were negotiated in courts of law and public opinion.

AB  - The Japanese people's understanding of the Fifteen Years War (1931-1945) is still problematic. The problem of the war was commonly solved by transferring responsibility for the war to an obscure subject called the State, and by offering financial compensation to those who were directly affected. However, there has been no in-depth discussion of how the Japanese public's understanding of the war in the period before defeat was modified in the post-war period. This article is a study of the children's magazineShonen Kurabu, which gained wide popularity by featuring articles related to war during the early modern era of Japan, including the wartime period, and continued to be published until 1962. By focusing onShonen Kurabu, this paper explores the close relationship between the mass media and the public attitude toward war, and the handling of the theme of war by both the media and the public.

AB  - 'Muslim grooming gangs' have become a defining feature of media, political and public debate around child sexual exploitation in the UK. The dominant narrative that has emerged to explain a series of horrific cases is misleading, sensationalist and has in itself promoted a number of harms. This article examines how racist framings of 'Muslim grooming gangs' exist not only in extremist, far-right fringes but in mainstream, liberal discourses too. The involvement of supposedly feminist and liberal actors and the promotion of pseudoscientific 'research' have lent a veneer of legitimacy to essentialist, Orientalist stereotypes of Muslim men, the demonisation of whole communities and demands for collective responsibility. These developments are situated in the broader socio-political context, including the far Right's weaponisation of women's rights, the 'Islamophobia industry' and a long history of racialising crime. We propose alternative ways of understanding and responding to child sexual exploitation/abuse. We contend that genuinely anti-racist feminist approaches can help in centring victims/survivors and their needs and in tackling serious sexual violence without demonising entire communities.

AB  - Drawing upon the social psychology concept of identity entrepreneurs (Haslam et al., 2010), we develop a feedback model between politicians and the public that strongly emphasizes the circumstances in which public opinion may facilitate populist discursive elements and politics. We thus consider the success of populism as neither inherently driven by political leaders nor primarily driven by increasing populist attitudes in the public and acknowledge the fragmented nature of the populist discourse emphasized by recent studies. We raise the question of whether there is a populist collective identity, which is accountable in terms of populist rhetorical elements, and how it changes over time. To answer this question, we apply the proposed framework to the case of the rise and development of the populist discourse in Switzerland while accounting for its dynamic adaptation to raising public concerns and for the influence of its core rhetorical elements on individual voting behavior.

AB  - This study analyzes news media's role in governmental decision-making processes related to a gradually intensifying series of earthquakes resulting from gas drilling in the Netherlands, and catastrophic natural earthquakes in Italy. According to the risk governance actors interviewed in both cases, media play three roles, as: democratic fora, agenda setters, and strategic instruments. Media attention for risk can create ripple effects in governmental decision-making processes. However, media attention tends to be risk-event driven and focuses on direct newsworthy consequences of events. For 'non-event risks', or when newsworthiness after a risk-event fades, the media's agenda setting and democratic fora roles are limited. This contributes to risk attenuation in society, potentially resulting in limited risk prevention and preparedness. Governmental actors report difficulties in using news media for strategic communication to facilitate risk governance because of media's tendency towards sensationalism. Our research suggests that, in the governance of earthquake-risk news, media logic overrules other institutional logics only for a short while and not in the long run when the three roles of media do not reinforce each other.

AB  - The 20th and 21st centuries have been marked by a number of traumatic events: with the two World Wars, Korean War and, especially in the last twenty-five years, with conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as others, vast numbers of people have been displaced and have had to journey far and wide to find not only a new home but a safe haven from the atrocities of war. While discrimination against newcomers to a country, prejudice, racism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and authoritarian dictatorships are not new phenomena, what makes the recent reactions to the current worldwide human influxes different is the use of language manipulation, propaganda and hate speech via social media to re-stigmatize and re-traumatize the new refugees, asylum-seekers, immigrants and migrants. Social media platforms give everyone the opportunity to express their views, whether positive or negative, about anyone who could be considered the other. Both right-wing and left-wing parties and governments also see the usefulness of using the manipulation of the labels given to newcomers and inciting fear of them for their own agendas. In this paper we will investigate how the use of linguistic labels and stereotyping about the other contribute to the rise of hate speech worldwide and how the presence of hate speech about the newcomers has re-traumatized many refugees who had thought they had reached a safe haven after fleeing the source of their original trauma. For the purpose of this study, we will be using data that primarily refers to Italy and Poland, as well as some other examples.

AB  - This article analyses the politicization of natural disasters in the media and the narratives of crisis that contribute to these dynamics. In particular, it studies media coverage of the 2017 mega-fires in Chile and the way in which this coverage was framed by pre-existing political disputes over the performance of Michelle Bachelet's government (2014-2018). It examines the print press coverage of the mega-fires, and the framing contests used to interpret the fire crisis. It pays special attention to the controversies that erupted over the foreign planes that were sent to help fight the fires: the American Supertanker and the Russian Ilyushin. We argue that press coverage of the mega-fires transformed a natural-social phenomenon into an emotionally charged political drama in which the Supertanker airplane was signified as the hero, and the Chilean government the villain. The Supertanker played a condensation symbol role. It was cast in the media as an external hero promising to control the fires that had overwhelmed local capabilities, and to overcome a government that was portrayed as inefficient and late to respond. The media functioned as an echo chamber for the cultural battle between the government and opposition. This article contributes to a cultural sociology of disasters, paying special attention to the role played by the symbolic representation of nature and socio-technical artefacts in political disputes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to systematically analyze and describe the tone of media coverage of the nursing home sector and its relationship to other dimensions of the coverage reported. Through a search of the LexisNexis database, 16,280 articles were identified from 51U.S. newspapers from 1999 to 2008. Articles were analyzed for tone, themes, prominence, central actor, and issue jurisdiction. Multinomial logit was used to examine the correlates of tone. Most articles were negative (36.9 percent) or neutral (45.5 percent) in tone; very few were positive (12.6 percent) or mixed (5.0 percent). Differences in tone were noted with regard to article placement and content. Findings highlight the preponderance of negative coverage and suggest that its adverse influence on public attitudes toward nursing homes may be enhanced by its prominence and focus on state/local concerns and industry interests/behavior. Future research should examine the relationship between media coverage and government agendas and outcomes related to nursing homes.

AB  - The crack cocaine scandal that embroiled former Toronto Mayor Rob Ford presents an opportunity to explore how we think and talk about substance (mis) use and recovery. Examining 1,836 articles from four Canadian newspapers, we analyze the ways news media frame Ford's use of crack cocaine. We find that Ford's drug use was often linked to a police investigation into gangs and guns, and much was made of his association with "Somali" drug dealers. Not only does this framing perpetuate prevailing stereotypes (crack cocaine use by racialized individuals living in poor and violent communities), but also it encourages the public to consider drugs a criminal justice issue and contributes to the stigma associated with drug use. Moreover, news media repeatedly suggested that Ford's problematic drug use could be solved if he took a leave from his job and entered a treatment facility. However, Ford's refusal to express shame and seek immediate treatment made him unworthy of compassion and instead rendered him deserving of censure. We argue that news media promoting a narrow pathway to addiction recovery and redemption ignores the realities of problematic drug use and justifies the continued marginalization of those who fail to meet this strict code of conduct.

AB  - While the politics of time are an important dimension of Chinese state discourse about Tibet, it remains insufficiently explored in theoretical and practical terms. This article examines the written and visual discourses of Tibetan temporality across Chinese state media in the post-2008 era. It analyses how these media discourses attempt to construct a 'regime of temporality' in order to manage public opinion about Tibet and consolidate Chinese rule over the region. While the expansion of online technologies has allowed the state to consolidate its discourses about Tibet's place within the People's Republic of China (PRC), they have also provided Tibetans a limited but valuable space to challenge these official representations through counter readings of Tibet's past, present and future. In doing so, this article contributes new insights on the production of state power over Tibet, online media practices in China, and the disruptive potential of social media as sites of Tibetan counter discourses.

AB  - The Norwegian Facebook page Yes to Wearing the Cross Whenever and Wherever I Choose was initially created to protest the prohibition of the cross for NRK news anchors. Yet, many of the discussions and audience interactions transpired into heated religio-political debates with strong elements of anti-Muslim, xenophobic, anti-secular, and anti-atheist sentiments. This study aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between media and religion by providing new insights on the variety of ways in which media audiences may 'add a series of dynamics to conflicts, namely, amplification, framing and performative agency, and co-structuring' and perform conflict', as formulated by Hjarvard et al. It is argued that mediatized conflicts with inherent trigger themes, which tug at core religio-political identity issues, also tend to evoke emotional responses, which, in turn, inspire social media users to perform the conflict in ways that multiply the conflict(s).

AB  - Although scholarship on competitive framing acknowledges that framing is a dynamic process in which the early stages may matter most, very little research has focused on the dynamics of issue emergence. In this article, we draw on several literatures to develop theories for how controversy related to new issues will emerge and expand in news coverage. Through a comprehensive content analysis of 101 local newspapers across the fifty U.S. states, we explore the dynamic and evolving process wherein a new issue-the HPV vaccine-emerged into public discourse and a legislative debate over school requirements for vaccination began. We find that coverage of controversy is a function of proximity, driven primarily by events within a state, although external events also influence local coverage. We also find that the legislative discussion in the media did not necessarily start out as controversial, but as the issue evolved, we observe a large increase in the proliferation of both actors taking positions and the types of arguments made to influence debate. The findings yield important insight into issue emergence with implications for how future research might test competing frames to better understand how the presentation of controversy in the mass media affects public opinion.

AB  - In a location-based social network, users socialize with each other by sharing their current location in the form of check-in, which allows users to reveal the current places they visit as part of their social interaction. Understanding this human check-in phenomenon in space and time on location based social network (LBSN) datasets, which is also called check-in behavior, can archive the day-to-day activity patterns, usage behaviors toward social media, and presents spatiotemporal evidence of users' daily routines. It also provides a wide range of opportunities to observe (i.e., mobility, urban activities, defining city boundary, and community problems in a city). In representing human check-in behavior, these LBSN datasets do not reflect the real-world events due to certain statistical biases (i.e., gender prejudice, a low frequency in sampling, and location type prejudice). However, LBSN data is primarily considered a supplement to traditional data sources (i.e., survey, census) and can be used to observe human check-in behavior within a city. Different interpretations are used elusively for the term check-in behavior, which makes it difficult to identify studies on human check-in behavior based on LBSN using the Weibo dataset. The primary objective of this research is to explore human check-in behavior by male and female users in Guangzhou, China toward using Chinese microblog Sina Weibo (referred to as Weibo), which is missing in the existing literature. Kernel density estimation (KDE) is utilized to explore the spatiotemporal distribution geographically and weighted regression (GWR) method was applied to observe the relationship between check-in and districts with a focus on gender during weekdays and weekend. Lastly, the standard deviational ellipse (SDE) analysis is used to systematically analyze the orientation, direction, spatiotemporal expansion trends and the differences in check-in distribution in Guangzhou, China. The results of this study show that LBSN is a reliable source of data to observe human check-in behavior in space and time within a specified geographic area. Furthermore, it shows that female users are more likely to use social media as compared to male users. The human check-in behavior patterns for social media network usage by gender seems to be slightly different during weekdays and weekend.

AB  - The use of the Internet, and especially social media networks, is becoming increasingly relevant for 21st century politics, not only for political campaigning purposes, but also as a platform to encourage the public to engage in political discourse. This study considers comments posted on two South African political party Facebook sites: the African National Congress' (ANC); and the Democratic Alliance's (DA). It examines how both the South African public and the political parties are using the site for discussion, debate and opinion formation. The study also investigates the perceived benefits and challenges that are offered to members of the Facebook groups. According to the findings, the public are using the Facebook site(s) to engage in discussion of a political nature as well as using the platform to connect with each other and share political information in new ways. However, it is this article's contention that the two political parties are not fully capitalising on the potential offered by Facebook. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Celebrities saturate American culture and often become relevant in politics, yet political science has largely left unstudied how celebrities affect mass political behavior. We focus on the 2015 story of Caitlyn Jenner revealing her transgender identity. Using an original nationally representative survey from that summer, we examine whether following the Jenner story and evaluations of its social significance affected attitudes toward transgender rights policies. Specifically, we examine how age and transphobia interacted with engagement with the Jenner story to shape attitudes toward transgender rights. We find, counterintuitively, that older respondents who were more transphobic were less likely to see her story as representing negative social trends if they followed it in the media. Furthermore, more transphobic older respondents were more likely to support pro-transgender policies if they viewed Jenner's story less negatively. We then discuss the implications of our findings for research on celebrity effects on politics and transgender rights.

AB  - This article looks at extreme speech practices in Danish weblogs and Facebook comment threads that treat issues of refugees, migration, Islam, and opponents as a cultural war of values and conflict. The article highlights the ritualized ways in which anti-immigrant sentiments are being communicated, received, and responded to. Such recurrent ritualistic communicative patterns include the use of a distinct indignant tone, sarcasm, racialized reasoning, and the use of "high-fives," as well as a general indifference to facts. The article argues that these online speech patterns can best be understood as a form of "ritualized opposition" that relies on extremist, divisive use of language and a naturalization of racialized difference in its attempt to recruit and consolidate communities of support.

AB  - Regulating migration is currently one of the most salient issues in Europe. So far, research has overlooked how this politicisation affects attitudes towards migration regimes. This article links the literatures on public opinion and framing effects from a comparative European perspective and presents original data from representative EU-wide vignette experiments conducted in mid-December 2017 (N = 10.827). I show that framing Schengen as a threat to public security or national identity weakens support for the status quo inside Schengen and reaffirms it amongst Schengen outsiders. Regarding Freedom of Movement only negative frames, particularly those referring to labour market risks, have a significant impact. Given the weak public support in several EU member states, these findings have important implications for the future of European migration regimes.

AB  - Purpose Due to the significant rise in the use of social media in recent years, the purpose of this paper is to investigate who, how and why participates in creating content at political social networking websites utilising a content analysis of posts and comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia. It shows consequences of a transition from traditional to social media campaigns and the effectiveness of social media at activating and moving public opinion during the general election campaign.
   Design/methodology/approach This study uses a data collection through a social media website, a classification of data set items by content attributes and a statistical analysis of the classified data.
   Findings Building on an empirical data set from Croatia, this study reveals that different political parties implement different election campaign strategies on social media to influence citizens who, consequently, respond differently to each of them. The results indicate that political messages with positive emotions evocate positive response from citizens, while neutral content is more likely to invoke negative comments and criticism, and support to the opponent. Another implication of the results is that two-way and tolerant communication of political actors increases citizen engagement, whereas unidirectional communication decreases it.
   Originality/value This paper provides an original insight into qualitative content analysis of posts and user comments published on Facebook during the 2015 general election campaign in Croatia.

AB  - Although there is a long empirical record exploring links between violent videogame play and aggression, little is known about how these games potentially affect players' political attitudes. Specifically. with firearms frequently featured in videogames, including games where players are required to use firearms to succeed during gameplay, it is worth examining whether players' experience with firearms relates to their attitudes toward guns and gun policy. Utilizing the General Learning Model, this survey explores whether public policy outcomes regarding gun control and public safety are related to exposure to violent video games. first-person shooter games, and realistic gun controllers. Results show that increased exposure to first-person shooter games was related to more negative attitudes concerning gun control. In addition, more experience using realistic gun controllers was associated with negative attitudes toward gun control and greater support for the idea that greater gun availability can help guarantee public safety. Thus, video game exposure may shape the gun attitudes of young people in small but important ways.

AB  - Cabinets are the engine of policy change in parliamentary systems. Yet, we still know little about how cabinets micro-manage the content of their multifaceted agenda during their term in office. Drawing on the party and agenda-setting literature, this article addresses this gap by focusing on three main determinants of cabinet priorities: issue priorities in the electoral platforms of majority and opposition parties, and new and unforeseen problems as conveyed by the media. Our analysis reveals that (1) majority platforms have a stronger impact on the cabinet agenda than those of opposition parties, but this effect decreases as the legislative term progresses; (2) cabinet agendas do take into consideration opposition electoral priorities but only when the latter are expressed by mainstream competitors or when the media focus on them and (3) an externally imposed adjustment programme can also create the conditions for strengthening the congruence between electoral and cabinet agendas.

TI  - SOCIAL MEDIA WARFARE AND KENYA'S CONFLICT WITH AL SHABAAB IN SOMALIA: A RIGHT TO KNOW?
T2  - AFRICAN AFFAIRS
LA  - English
AB  - This article explores Kenyan citizens' right to know details about sensitive security-related information in the context of a new era of social media warfare. It considers the public communications response to Al Shabaab's January 2016 attack on Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) personnel in El Adde, Somalia, and then to a similar attack in Kulbiyow a year later. Drawing on Twitter posts, an official account of Kenya's military activities in Somalia, and - unusually for the study of social media - on 'offline' methods of qualitative data collection, it asks why the KDF did not provide real-time updates about the El Adde attack, but did provide information about the assault on Kulbiyow? Three plausible explanations for the KDF's differing response are considered. First, at the time of El Adde, the KDF was inexperienced in terms of social media communication. Second, El Adde taught the KDF that in order not to lose the all-important public opinion, it had to match its enemy and also disseminate credible information. Finally, the strengthening voice of Kenyan citizens and the potential for further reputational damage pushed the KDF from a 'need-to-know' frame of mind in terms of its sharing of information, to more of a 'right-to-know' mentality.

AB  - This article examines how on-air conversations between journalists indicate how US television coverage of a race-related crisis can reflect racial ideology. Using critical discourse analysis, we examined interjournalistic discourse about African Americans in national network and cable news programs that aired after Hurricane Katrina reached New Orleans. While we expected conversational semantic items from conservative Fox News to reflect racial ideology, we also found such discursive elements from politically moderate and progressive news organizations such as CBS, CNN, and MSNBC. These findings are consistent with Anxiety Uncertainty Management theory, which predicts that exposure to stressors in unfamiliar settings causes individuals to think in ethnocentric, dichotomous, stereotypical ways. Our research underscores the impact of white privilege on language, communication, and news production, and the need for cultural competence training to enhance journalists' ability to discuss racial matters with ease.

AB  - Walter Lippmann's description in Public Opinion of the news media as the bridge between "the world outside and the pictures in our heads" is particularly apt for the two goals of this study: exploring a new perspective in agenda-setting theory grounded in network analysis, which, in turn, provides the setting for a comparative analysis of the Iraq War news coverage in newspapers of the United States, Mainland China, Taiwan and Poland. Exploring competing hypotheses about the globalization of news versus the influence of cultural and political stances in the construction of attribute agendas during the opening two years of the Iraq War, this study found some support for both factors, but with the preponderance of the evidence reflecting the political stance of each newspaper's government. In regard to the emerging perspective of network agenda setting, this study found that a focus on bundles of message attributes highlights the larger context of these individual attributes on the media agenda and presents a more nuanced measure of salience in contrast to the traditional focus on the frequency of discrete objects or attributes to define the media agenda.

AB  - Respected scholar, expert, public opinion maker, oracle, under-cover politician, charlatan, cartoon character - all roles "out there" waiting for scholars sharing knowledge with a wider public. Scholars of religion trying to carve out more room in the public arena for a nonreligious, scientific approach to religion always risk digging their graves as (respected) scholars. What's worse, they also risk digging the grave for a valuable and respectable, as well as publicly valued and respected academic, scientific study of religion. The scholar popularizing scientifically based knowledge, not least via the mass media (daily newspapers or public television), may "become" political and controversial to such a degree that s/he becomes a problem for the scientific study of religion, the community of scholars of religion, and the university with which s/he is affiliated. The otherwise valuable engagement threatens the reputation of science as being something valuable, "pure" and "neutral," elevated above the dirty business of politics and power. In spite of the risks, the engaged scholar, it is, however, also argued, actually can help to strengthen the position, inside and outside the academy, of scientifically based knowledge and of the critical, analytical, scientific study of religion.

AB  - In contrast to most developed countries that use registration systems, China has implemented an approval system for initial public offering (IPO) applications. As this IPO approval system involves more than a compliance test, the process allows regulators to exercise a large degree of discretion, which provides an opportunity to observe regulators' decision making in capital markets. We examine the outcomes of firms' IPO applications from 2008 to 2014 and find evidence that the media influence regulators' decisions on IPO applications. Specifically, firms that experience negative news coverage are more likely to have their IPO applications rejected. Negative news influences government decisions via both information and monitoring roles. The political connections of a firm can alleviate an adverse outcome from negative news. Moreover, negative news predicts a higher probability of committing fraud as well as lower earnings persistence in the post-IPO period. The evidence from the post-IPO period suggests that the media help improve the efficiency of regulators' decision making. Our results are robust to controlling for endogeneity issues and to adopting alternative measures of news negativity and an alternative sample.

AB  - Context: Although research has begun to examine perceptions of being on the losing side of politics, it has been confined to electoral politics. The context of health disparities, and particularly the opioid crisis, offers a case to explore whether frames that emphasize racial disadvantage activate loser perceptions and the political consequences of such beliefs.
   Methods: White survey participants (N = 1,549) were randomized into three groups: a control which saw no news article, or one of two treatment groups which saw a news article about the opioid crisis framed to emphasize either the absolute rates of opioid mortality among whites or the comparative rates of opioid mortality among whites compared to blacks.
   Findings: Among control group participants, perceiving oneself a political loser was unrelated to attitudes about addressing opioids, whereas those who perceived whites to be on the losing side of public health had a less empathetic response to the opioid crisis. The comparative frame led to greater beliefs that whites are on the losing side of public health, whereas the absolute frame led to more empathetic policy opinions.
   Conclusions: Perceptions that one's racial group has lost ground in the public health context could have political consequences that future research should explore.

Dates of vaccine-related events and policy changes were collected from public health units in Ontario. The daily number of COVID-19 cases was retrieved from the Ontario provincial government's public health database. Latent Dirichlet Allocation was used for unsupervised topic modelling. VADER was used to calculate daily and average sentiment compound scores for topics identified.Results: Vaccine, pandemic, business, lockdown, mask, and Ontario were six topics identified from the unsupervised topic modelling. The average sentiment compound score for each topic appeared to be slightly positive, yet the daily sentiment compound scores varied greatly between positive and negative emotions for each topic.Conclusion: Our study results have shown a slightly positive sentiment on average during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario, along with six topics. Our research has also demonstrated a social listening approach to identify what the public sentiments and opinions are in a timely manner.

TI  - Press Liberalization, the New Media, and the 'Coptic Question': Muslim-Coptic Relations in Egypt in a Changing Media Landscape
T2  - MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The introduction of new media (internet, satellite TV) in the 1990s and the liberalization of the Egyptian press in the 2000s have brought the Coptic minority and its demands for equality and recognition to the forefront of public debate in Egypt. The consequences are diverse: more and sometimes better information and more room for the discussion of uncomfortable truths on the one hand, irresponsible sensationalism, the propagation of new and old prejudice, and a further strengthening of exclusive religious identities on the other hand. Government policies, though, rightly criticized as contributing to the current crisis in Muslim-Christian relations, have so far remained unaffected.

AB  - In this paper, we present a study on keyword selection behavior in social media analysis that is focused on particular topics, and propose a new effective strategy that considers the co-occurrence relationships between keywords and uses graph-based techniques. In particular, we used the normalized rich-club connectivity considering the weighted degree, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality and PageRank values to measure a subgroup of highly connected "rich keywords" in a keyword co-occurrence network. Community detection is subsequently applied to identify several keyword combinations that are able to accurately and comprehensively represent the researched topic. The empirical results based on four topics and comparing four existing models confirm the performance of our proposed strategy in promoting the quantity and ensuing the quality of data related to particular topics collected from social media. Overall, our findings are expected to offer useful guidelines on how to select keywords for social media-based studies and thus further increase the reliability and validity of their respective conclusions.

AB  - Sweden, with a high level of political participation and an avant-garde position regarding internet access, broadband and social media penetration in the population, is a critical case for studying social media in relation to political participation. Three types of users - members of political parties, members of interest organizations, and non-members - are interviewed in focus groups about their attitudes to political content in the social network site Facebook. The discussions show that although practices and attitudes vary, using social network sites alone does not drive previously inactive respondents to political participation. Respondents who are members of interest organizations view social network sites as valuable tools for participation, whereas respondents who are not refrain from sharing political views with their friends. They are exposed to political content and requests for participation, but prefer generally to remain passive.

AB  - Surfing on the Internet 2.0 revolution, Patani 2.0 has allowed Patani neojihadist militants to access new competitive spaces and create their own imagined online community by penetrating new realms of the Internet. This article discusses the use of new media militant propaganda by Patani militants and how it is Janus faced. It further examines how the Patani 2.0 social interaction enabled by social media such as YouTube leads to group cohesion among certain actors and the formation of a collective identity that is clustered around the notions of Muslim victimization and defensive jihad; and how, at the same time, it reinforces antithetical identities and fosters group identity competition, where one religious group is often pitted against another. As a result, the Janus effect of Patani neojihadist YouTube online propaganda, while it primarily seeks to radicalize, also generates a reactionary, often virulent, anti-Muslim response from the movement's critics.

AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender.

AB  - The progress in sentiment analytics and communication research provides a powerful scaffold by which to reexamine the long-debated research on residents' attitudes toward tourism. To mitigate the limitations of the classical survey-based research method, this study takes a news media sentiment analytics perspective to unveil how the residents' attitudes toward tourism evolve over time and how socioeconomic factors interact with such evolving attitudes in the context of Hong Kong. Drawn on a news data set containing 72,755 news articles published in Chinese language newspapers, this study computes the overall news sentiments for 156 calendar months since 2003, examines the face validity and nomological validity of the results, and discusses the long-run dynamics between residents' attitudes and typical socioeconomic factors. This study adds a vital dimension to current residents' attitudes research and practices from data-scarce to data-rich studies and from static snapshots to dynamic unfolding.

AB  - This article views appraisal as co-selection patterns of target, source and evaluative parameters and investigates the ways in which news discourse retells news stories and reproduces truthful reality. We combined the corpus-assisted method and quantitative/qualitative analysis of the data, i.e., 904 sentences which were extracted from the corpus of German 5G news reports by selecting the top 5 items from each of the noun keywords lists of the three subcorpora of economics, politics and technology news reports. It was found that the German media restage the necessity and desirability to promote the development of German communication facilities/technology through international cooperation, particularly Germany-Sino cooperation. In addition, a hesitant image was evoked as to the high-profile 5G development in Germany with an awareness of the potential security risks and economic losses. On the intersubjective dimension, our findings suggest that journalists make full exploitation of different dialogistic positioning strategies for closing down or opening up the dialogic space to a greater or lesser degree. More specifically, they tend to acknowledge and endorse the positive/negative attitudes attributed to the non-authorial voices towards particular targets in the fields of economics, politics or technology. A future comparison with the genre of news comments or editorials would deepen our understanding of the performativity of media.

AB  - This paper explores the connection between the rise of new types of online uncivil discourses and the recent success of populism. While discussions on the upsurge of populism have centred on institutionalised politics and politicians, only limited attention has been paid to how the success of the former and the latter was propelled by developments outside of the political realm narrowly conceived. Our interest is therefore in the rise of uncivil society, especially on the web, and in its 'borderline discourse' at the verge of civil and uncivil ideas, ideologies and norms. Those discourses - showcased here on the example of the language on immigration/refugees in Austria and Sweden - have been using civil-to- uncivil shifts in the discursive representations of society and politics. They have progressively 'normalised' the anti- pluralist views across many European public spheres on a par with nativist and exclusionary views now widely propagated by right-wing populist politics in Europe and beyond.

AB  - China scholars have examined the China threat theory from various theoretical perspectives, offered a range of explanations for the theory's emergence and forecast the potential implications for USChina relations. However, few scholars have empirically studied the China threat theory through the lens of the US media. This is a critical oversight, because the media plays a pivotal role in shaping US public opinion and US foreign policy, and the media is a key channel for China threat dissemination and popularization. This study seeks to redress this oversight by empirically examining China threat coverage in the US print media over a 15-year period from 1992 to 2006. We use content-analysis methodology to systematically collect, code and analyze China threat data from five major US newspapers and to track the frequency and content of this coverage over time.
   Our analysis reveals many interesting patterns in China threat media coverage. First, the initial emergence of China threat arguments in the US print media corresponded with the sharp upward turn in China's economic growth rates in the early 1990s. However, since the early 1990s, China threat coverage has not mirrored China's steady growth. Rather, the media coverage was cyclic, featuring three key peaks (1996, 2000 and 2005) followed by subsequent declining interest. Second, our analysis reveals that the focus of these stories also varied over time. Perceptions of China as a political/ideological threat dominated media coverage in the earlier years (19921994) but steadily declined after 1995 and totally disappeared from the US print media after 2001. Perceptions of China as a military/strategic threat replaced political/ideological concerns in 1995, and the military focus has dominated media coverage ever since. Perceptions of China as an economic/trade threat persisted steadily throughout the 15-year time period with a clear uptick in recent years. We conclude this analysis by turning to the literature on realism, agenda setting and information processing to offer possible explanations for these empirical trends.

AB  - Ever since the Mao era, propaganda has been the primary vehicle in China for the indoctrination and mass mobilization of citizens. In the last few years however, as China has continued to open up to the outside world and deepen its reforms, it has experienced an unprecedented boom and liberalization of its media sector While the propaganda regime continues to attempt to guide and shape public opinion, the conventional propaganda apparatus is not as effective as it used to be. This has given rise to a new governing mechanism that employs Internet commentators to direct cyber discussions and create favorable online opinions about the party-state. Accordingly this paper addresses the new phenomenon of Internet commentators and argues that the creation and increased utilization of such commentators has provided the Beijing government with an up-to-date tool for disseminating and reinforcing party ideology and thought work in the information age. A case study of the Weng'an incident is discussed as a means through which to explore China's propaganda regime.

AB  - How do legal changes affect discourse concerning family forms? The concept of the family is conventionally assumed to be stable and unchanging; yet, the idea of family is continuously defined and redefined by the law. I analyze the nature of media framing before and after federal legislative changes, specifically the passage of the Defense of Marriage Act (1996) and Windsor v. United States (2013). I investigate 156 articles about same-sex marriage legislation published in The New York Times. Results show that legislative events and court decisions influence the framing of family and family forms. DOMA influenced the discourse surrounding family composition by strictly defining the family unit, centering it on a heteronormative framework of one man and one woman. Windsor affected the discourse concerning the role of children by shifting the focus away from LGBT parents as unfit or dangerous to children and toward a structural and societal assessment of discrimination. Both DOMA and Windsor affected public discourse about morality. These findings support the idea that legal changes affect conceptions of the family and reveal how these conceptions can change in the broader public imagination.

AB  - This article presents an empirical analysis of the Australian media representation of terrorism using the 2014 Sydney Lindt Cafe siege as a case in point to engage with the notion of moral panic. Deploying critical discourse analysis and case study as mixed methods, insights into trans-media narratives and aftermath of the terrifying siege are presented. While news media appeared to collaborate with the Australian right-wing government in the reporting of terrorism, social media posed challenges and raised security concerns for the state. Social media heightened the drama as sites were variously deployed by the perpetrator, activists and concerned members of the public. The amplified trans-media association of Muslims with terrorism in Australia and its national and global impact, in terms of the political exclusion of Muslims, are best described in this article in the form of an Islamophobic Moral Panic Model, invented for a rethink of the various stages of its occurrence, intensification and institutionalization.

AB  - The idea that the success of media personae in attracting audiences and maintaining their loyalty depends on the creation of a pseudo-friendship, known as para-social relationships, has been a mainstay of mass media research for more than half a century. Expanding the scope of para-social relationship research into the political realm, the notion that political support could be predicted based on the intensity of para-social relationships between voters and political figures was demonstrated in a recent study. The current exploration tests the predictive power of Political Para-Social Relationship (PPSR) in the context of the April and September 2019 Israeli election campaigns. Findings from online panel data (n = 1,061) demonstrate that PPSR toward Netanyahu was a positive predictor of voting for Netanyahu's Likud party and a negative predictor of voting for opposition leader Benny Gantz's Blue and White party in both campaigns. The opposite was true for PPSR toward Benny Gantz. The PPSR constructs also predicted shifts in party support from the February to October (post-election) waves of the study, and loyalty toward the parties. In all models, the PPSR constructs were among the strongest predictors of political support.

AB  - During the George W. Bush administration, intense debate focused on the administration's interference with the work of government scientists. In this study, analyzing a May/June 2009 survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), we evaluate the factors during this period that influenced scientists' awareness of political interference and their media outreach and communication activities. Controlling for demographic and professional-level influences, those members who were more liberal in their political outlook, who were frequent blog readers, and who felt strongly about global warming were substantially more likely to have heard a lot about political interference. However, neither ideology, partisanship, nor opinion-intensity were predictive of the various media and communication behaviors assessed. Instead, the strongest predictor was the belief that media coverage was important for an individual's career advancement. Implications for evaluating the expert community's participation in future political debates are discussed.

AB  - The mass media has a powerful impact on public attitudes about mental health and psychiatry. The question of identity of psychiatry as a medical profession as well as of the future of psychiatry has been the subject of much controversial discussion. Psychiatry today has the historical opportunity to shape the future of mental health care, medicine and society. It has gained in scientific and professional status by the tremendous increase of knowledge and treatment skills. Psychiatry should build up new transdisciplinary and integrative image of a specialized profession, promote it and make it public. Good public relations are very important for the future of psychiatry.

AB  - Health issues are increasingly becoming politicized, but little is known about how politicization takes shape in the news and its effect on the public. We analyze the evolution of politicization in news coverage of two health controversies: the uproar over the 2009 mammography screening guidelines and the 2006-2007 debate over mandating the HPV vaccine as a requirement for middle school-aged girls. We then examine the public response to politicization in the HPV case, using original data from a survey-embedded experiment that was linked with news coverage in all fifty states. We find that real-world politicization is associated with decreases in support for HPV vaccine requirements, state immunization programs, and confidence in doctors and in government. In addition, among those less likely to have encountered real-world politicization, we find marginal evidence that exposure to political conflict decreases support for state immunization programs and clear evidence that politicization reduces confidence in doctors. We discuss the implications of these findings and suggest future avenues of research.

AB  - Objective The media's framing of public health issues is closely linked to public opinion on these issues and support for interventions to address them. This study characterized geographic and temporal variation in the US media's framing of obesity across states from 2006 to 2015.
   Methods Newspaper articles that mentioned the term obesity were drawn from Access World News (NewsBank, Inc., Naples, Florida), a comprehensive online database (N = 364,288). This study employed automated content analysis, a machine learning technique, to categorize articles as (1) attributing obesity to individual-level causes (e.g., lifestyle behaviors), (2) attributing obesity to environmental/systemic causes (e.g., neighborhood walkability), (3) attributing obesity to both individual-level causes and environmental/systemic causes, or (4) articles without any such attribution framework.
   Results Nationwide across all years, a higher proportion of articles focused on individual-level attribution of obesity than environmental-level attribution or both. Missouri and Idaho had the highest proportions of articles with an individual framework, and Nevada, Arkansas, and Wisconsin had the highest proportions of articles with an environmental framework.
   Conclusions This analysis demonstrates that US media sources heavily focus on an individual framing of obesity, which may be informing public perceptions of obesity. By highlighting differences in obesity media portrayal, this study could inform research to understand why particular states represent outliers and how this may affect obesity policy making.

AB  - The German media presentation of the so-called Greek financial crisis caused an unexpected uproar in Germany. An anti-Greek sentiment evolved and spread among German citizens and solidarity for crisis-hit Greece was mostly rejected. Public surveys revealed that many Germans even wanted Greece to exit the Eurozone immediately. This article highlights the crucial role of the media in shaping the negative public opinion. In 2010, a period which has lately been referred to as Greek bashing, the German press had discussed the Greek financial crisis heatedly and controversially. Europe's largest daily newspaper, BILD, published numerous reports that implicitly and explicitly constituted the myth of the corrupt and lazy Greeks in comparison to the hard-working Germans. In 2012, the crisis had spread much further, and not only Greece but other countries too were suffering from high debt, economic stagnation and unemployment. The news coverage became more moderate and conciliating and presented the dramatic social consequences for the respective population. This study highlights not only the development of the German media's tenor on the Greek crisis through time, but adds an international perspective and widens the view by comparing the media treatment of the different countries involved. Based on 122 online articles, the study methodologically focuses on the analysis of metaphorical language in the news coverage of three comparable international news magazines: SPIEGEL (Germany), The Economist (the UK) and TIME (the USA), and contrasts the representation of Greece with the depiction of larger indebted European countries like Spain and Italy. The analysis shows remarkable differences in the evaluation and presentation of the crisis, which can be linked to the degree of involvement of Germany, the UK and the USA in European policies.

AB  - Political observers of all types often express concerns that Americans are dangerously polarized on political issues and are, in part due to the availability of opinionated niche news programming (e.g., ideological cable, radio, and Internet news sources), developing more entrenched political positions. However, these accounts often overlook the fact that the rise of niche news has been accompanied by the expansion of entertainment options and the ability to screen out political news altogether. We examine the polarizing effects of opinionated political talk shows by integrating the Elaboration Likelihood Model of attitude development into our own theoretical model of selective media exposure. We employ a novel experimental design that gives participants agency to choose among news and entertainment programming by including treatments that allow participants to select the programming they view. The results from two studies show that ideological shows do indeed have the power to polarize political attitudes, especially among individuals who possess strong motivations to craft counterarguments. However, the polarizing force of cable news is diminished considerably when individuals are given the option to tune out. [Supplementary material is available for this article.

AB  - The humanities, the natural and social sciences all represent advanced and systematic knowledge productionand they all receive public funding for doing so. However, although the field of public understanding of science has been well established for decades, similar research attention has not been directed at the humanities. The purpose of this study is to argue the case for further research of public understanding of the humanities and to take a first step in that direction by presenting a study of the framing of the humanities in Danish print news media. Different framings of the humanities are analyzed. Despite the differences in the issue-specific frames, the generic framing of the humanities shared by most articles is as follows: 75% explicitly frame the humanities as deficit, while the remaining 25% are more neutral. Consequently, if newspapers constitute the only source of information concerning the humanities, newsreaders may not be much wiser in understanding what the humanities might bebut they will know that whatever the humanities is, it is broken and useless.

AB  - Combining media coverage data from approximately 17,000 unique media outlets with the full population of CEO appointments for U.S. publicly traded firms between 2000 and 2016, we investigate whether female CEO appointments garner more public attention compared with male appointments, and if so, whether this increased attention can help make sense of the previously reported negative market reaction to these events. Contrary to prior reports, our data do not indicate that the appointments of female CEOs elicit overly negative market reactions, on average. Our results do highlight an important moderating role of public attention, however. We demonstrate that greater attention-even when exogenously determined-contributes to negative market reactions for female CEO appointments but positive market reactions for male CEOs, all else held constant. Additionally, female CEO appointments that attract little attention garner significant positive responses in the market, compared with both male CEOs drawing similarly limited levels of attention and female CEOs drawing high levels of attention. Our results help to reconcile contrasting empirical findings on the effects of gender in executive leadership and parallel recent work on anticipatory bias and second-order discrimination in alternative empirical contexts. Implications for research on attention, gender bias, and executive succession are discussed.

AB  - Background: The objective of the current study is to investigate whether an area-level measure of racial sentiment derived from Twitter data is associated with state-level hate crimes and existing measures of racial prejudice at the individual-level.
   Methods: We collected 30,977,757 tweets from June 2015-July 2018 containing at least one keyword pertaining to specific groups (Asians, Arabs, Blacks, Latinos, Whites). We characterized sentiment of each tweet (negative vs all other) and averaged at the state-level. These racial sentiment measures were merged with other measures based on: hate crime data from the FBI Uniform Crime Reporting Program; implicit and explicit racial bias indicators from Project Implicit; and racial attitudes questions from General Social Survey (GSS).
   Results: Living in a state with 10% higher negative sentiment in tweets referencing Blacks was associated with 0.57 times the odds of endorsing a GSS question that Black-White disparities in jobs, income, and housing were due to discrimination (95% CI: 0.40, 0.83); 1.64 times the odds of endorsing the belief that disparities were due to lack to will (95% CI: 0.95, 2.84); higher explicit racial bias (beta: 0.11; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.18); and higher implicit racial bias (beta: 0.09; 95% CI: 0.04, 0.14). Twitter-expressed racial sentiment was not statistically-significantly associated with incidence of state-level hate crimes against Blacks (IRR: 0.99; 95% CI: 0.52, 1.90), but this analysis was likely underpowered due to rarity of reported hate crimes.
   Conclusion: Leveraging timely data sources for measuring area-level racial sentiment can provide new opportunities for investigating the impact of racial bias on society and health.

AB  - This article investigates the 'glocalization' of the US TV popular drama series The West Wing, while focusing on one (in some ways) exceptional episode. Because politics is inherently linked to language, discourse and communication, I will take an approach from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (the discourse-historical approach), with a particular focus on elements of argumentation theory and rhetoric, and combine this with media studies. More specifically, I attempt to illustrate how a thorough understanding of the topoi operating within the complex dialogues and interactions helps to reveal the series' (manifest and latent) political and didactic objectives, embedded in a longstanding tradition of conveying US American liberal values via films and TV. The episode analyzed in this article, Isaac and Ishmael (which was broadcast immediately after 9/11) is exceptional because it explicitly relates to salient real life events; its topical focus on the 'war on terror' shifts attention from US domestic politics to an issue that, according to US policy rhetoric, concerns the whole world. Thus, this episode links the debates taking place in one of the world's most famous institutions, The White House, with those occurring in workplaces across the world: a truly 'g/local' moment. The interdisciplinary analysis allows insight into the intricate and complex discursive construction of new glocal narratives, particularly in times of political crisis, revealing which norms are projected and recontextualized both locally and globally, given the many translations of the series worldwide.

AB  - This article investigates media coverage of 19th and early 20th century river activism and its effect on federal policy to control the Mississippi River. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' "levees-only" policy-which joined disparate navigation and flood control interests-is largely blamed for the Great Flood of 1927, called the largest peacetime disaster in American history. River activists organized annual conventions, and later, professional lobbies organized media campaigns up and down the Mississippi River to sway public opinion and pressure Congress to fund flood control and river navigation projects. Annual river conventions drew thousands of delegates such as plantation owners, shippers, bankers, chambers of commerce, governors, congressmen, mayors and cabinet members with interests on the Mississippi River. Public pressure on Congress successfully captured millions of federal dollars to protect property, drain swamps for development, subsidize local levee districts and influence river policy.

AB  - This study analyzes media coverage of Census Bureau projections showing that the U.S. will become a majority-minority state by mid-century. I argue that the mismatch between the racial/ethnic categories used by the media in their coverage of Census projections, and the official government categories used by the Census, help construct social boundaries around "whiteness" that allows for growth of minority populations to be presented as a challenge for "American" society. I contend that media portrayals of Census projections can influence public perceptions of the racial/ethnic composition of the U.S., thus impacting political attitudes and voting behavior among the U.S. populace.

AB  - The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (Gardasil) is a significant advancement in reducing women's risk for cervical cancer. Public opinion of the vaccine can be influenced by the mass media. We used content analysis to assess the discussion of risks, fear-inducing messages about HPV, cervical cancer, and the HPV vaccine in four high circulating North American news magazines from January 2006 to December 2007. Risk messages about HPV and cervical cancer focused on threatening illness or injury. Reporting on the HPV vaccine emphasized it being poorly understood by science. News magazine articles on the HPV vaccine and cervical cancer included fear-inducing messages. Cancer educators need to be aware of media reporting in order to alleviate fears that the public may experience about the HPV vaccine.

AB  - We have become increasingly aware of the importance of addressing diversity across media landscapes. Whilst we are still far from a genuine appreciation for difference, media outlets that view themselves as progressive understand the value of appearing diverse. This has meant that a number of Muslim voices have risen to prominence in recent years. Often these voices have attracted the title of 'moderate Muslim' as they are thought to represent a non-radical politics. This paper examines how the voice of this 'moderate Muslim' has been co-opted by the White mainstream as a sign of inclusion and commitment to multiculturalism but emphasizes that the moderate is never truly permitted to speak. In exploring how divergent voices have been publicly disciplined and how the right to speak has been positioned as a 'privilege', we show how Islamophobia permits a religious population to speak only via a select few voices, denying the spectrum of narratives, ideas and dissent. We argue that one troubling consequence of this dynamic is the chilling and marginalizing effect it has on dissenting Muslim voices who seek to destabilize efforts to produce and reproduce Islamophobia's good/bad, moderate/radical dichotomies.

AB  - Young Australian Muslims living in Sydney have been influenced by the Cronulla riot. Online surveys (n: 76) and interviews (n: 10) reveal the impact on their engagement with the Sutherland region around Cronulla, detectable a decade after this event. The exclusionary intent of the rioters and their sympathisers was a racist form of spatial management that had both specific and general aims. The Australian news media contribute to the ethnic purification that was originally intended by the Cronulla riots. This reduces mobility among an 'ethnic other' in accessing spaces that have been portrayed as 'racist' - or, in the case of young Muslims, 'Islamophobic'. Findings demonstrate the ongoing consequences of a wide-scale racist attack, like the Cronulla riot, on urban citizenship. Representations of the Cronulla riot are a repertoire of learning for young Sydney Muslims that rehearse what has been conceptualised as pedagogies of (un)belonging by Noble and Poynting [(2010). White Lines: The Intercultural Politics of Everyday Movement in Social Spaces. Journal of Intercultural Studies, 31, 489-505]. We have extended the application of this concept to a specific space and point to the means by which constructions of unbelonging are reinforced and made material. Processes of repetition and accumulations identified by Butler and Essed highlight how this enduring pedagogy of spatial unbelonging is maintained by media representations of places as Islamophobic.

AB  - Latino immigrant men who have sex with men (MSM) are at risk for HIV and delayed diagnosis in the United States. This paper describes the evaluation of a pilot of the Tu Amigo Pepe, a multimedia HIV testing campaign aimed at Latino MSM in Seattle, WA particularly targeting immigrants who may not identify as gay, ages 18-30 years old. The 16-week campaign included Spanish-language radio public service announcements (PSAs), a Web site, social media outreach, a reminder system using mobile technology, print materials and a toll-free hotline. In developing the PSAs, the Integrated Behavioral Model was used as a framework to reframe negative attitudes, beliefs and norms towards HIV testing with positive ones as well as to promote self-efficacy towards HIV testing. The campaign had a significant and immediate impact on attitudes, beliefs, norms and self-efficacy towards HIV testing as well as on actual behavior, with HIV testing rates increasing over time.

AB  - This article surveys the way in which British print media have presented the European Union (EU)'s global presence in the international arena by analysing two case studies which reflect two very distinctive areas of EU foreign policy: global climate change policy and the policy towards Russia. It employs frame analysis, allowing for the identification of the way in which the discourse of the press was categorized around a series of central opinions and ideas. Frames underscore the connections made by journalists between different events, policies or phenomena and their possible interpretations. The analysis highlights that acting through the common framework of the EU rather than unilaterally was a strategy preferred by the British press. These findings are in stark contrast with the deep Euroscepticism which characterizes press attitudes towards most policy areas, and is often considered to be rooted in the British political culture, media system, public opinion or the longstanding tradition of viewing the European continent as the other.

AB  - Stating the value of archaeology for contemporary society is a very difficult task hardly undertaken by archaeologists. Work with a contemporary record directly linked to local communities, and the approach of public archaeology, have helped to bring society and archaeology closer together. However, the role of a public intellectual goes beyond archaeology, delving into current social worries. Is it possible to play this game from archaeology? The multiple and complex relations between archaeology and society open the door to participation in public debates, but we stand to lose our essence. We face a Shakespearean dilemma, a choice between having an influential voice in the present, or just an expert opinion.

AB  - The aim of Gross and Rutland's paper is to analyse the problem of antisemitic bullying in contemporary Australian state schools by investigating the case of Jewish children in those schools. The study is interdisciplinary, drawing on historical data and educational methodology, and employs a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews conducted in Sydney and Melbourne with all the major actors: students (55), teachers (10), principals (4), parents (13) and Jewish communal leaders (10). Gross and Rutland argue that classical anti-Jewish stereotypes are perpetuated in the school playground, transmitted by children from one generation to the next. This finding provides an additional perspective to the general literature, which argues that racial prejudice and stereotypes are acquired primarily through home socialization, religious institutions and the media, and neglects the role of the school playground.

AB  - The 2008 Beijing Olympics were widely regarded as China's 'coming out party', a belief strengthened by the extravagance and efficiency of the games. China was open about the image it wished to convey to the world, dubbing its games as the 'humanistic Olympics', 'green Olympics' and 'technological Olympics'. Now, one year after the 2008 Olympics, this paper wishes to examine the extent to which China's Olympics were successful as a public-relations campaign in the United States by focusing on the images of China portrayed in the American media before, during and after the Olympics to detect any significant trends. The analysis focuses on editorial boards of widely circulated newspapers, representing the nine major divisions of the United States, and the three largest cable news networks: Fox News, CNN and MSNBC. Finally, there is an assessment of public opinion polls gauging amity towards China. The results indicate that overall, US media images of China became increasingly negative directly before, during and after the Olympics. US public opinion of China correspondingly became more negative. To conclude, there is a reflection upon the implications of these findings on US-Sino relations and the image China wishes to impart to the American media and public.

AB  - Overestimation of the level of democracy is prevalent among citizens in nondemocracies. Despite such prevalence, no research to date has systematically documented this phenomenon and examined its determinants. Yet given the renewed interest in the role of legitimacy in authoritarian survival, studying whether and why this phenomenon arises is important to our understanding of authoritarian resilience. I argue that, even in the absence of democratic institutions in nondemocracies, autocrats exercise media control in order to boost their democratic legitimacy. This facade of democracy, in turn, benefits their survival. Combining media freedom data with individual survey response data that include over 30,000 observations from 22 nondemocracies, I find that overestimation of the level of democracy is greater in countries with stronger media control. But highly educated citizens overestimate less. These findings shed light on media control as a strategy for authoritarian survival, and have important implications for modernization theory.

AB  - Demonstrations that analyses of social media content can align with measurement from sample surveys have raised the question of whether survey research can be supplemented or even replaced with less costly and burdensome data mining of already-existing or "found" social media content. But just how trustworthy such measurement can be-say, to replace official statistics-is unknown. Survey researchers and data scientists approach key questions from starting assumptions and analytic traditions that differ on, for example, the need for representative samples drawn from frames that fully cover the population. New conversations between these scholarly communities are needed to understand the potential points of alignment and non-alignment. Across these approaches, there are major differences in (a) how participants (survey respondents and social media posters) understand the activity they are engaged in; (b) the nature of the data produced by survey responses and social media posts, and the inferences that are legitimate given the data; and (c) practical and ethical considerations surrounding the use of the data. Estimates are likely to align to differing degrees depending on the research topic and the populations under consideration, the particular features of the surveys and social media sites involved, and the analytic techniques for extracting opinions and experiences from social media. Traditional population coverage may not be required for social media content to effectively predict social phenomena to the extent that social media content distills or summarizes broader conversations that are also measured by surveys.

KW  - DISCOURSE
AB  - It has been assumed that populism has become mainstream in the Western world, and that the media have substantially contributed to populism's success and omnipresence in politics and society. To investigate populist elements in media coverage, extant research has mainly focused on election periods, or media populism in specific types of coverage and outlets. In this paper, we investigate if the use of populist elements in general media coverage has increased over time. Focusing on a 28-year period in the Netherlands, we find clear evidence for an increasing presence of people-centric, anti-elitist and right- and left-exclusionist coverage in newspapers. This trend is general, with only limited evidence for cross-outlet differences. Since our analysis was not limited to specific periods, sample frames or topics, our research offers first evidence for an unconditional increase of different elements of populist communication in traditional news coverage. An important implication is that the rise of populist news coverage has made populism more visible to the electorate, potentially setting the agenda for political parties and populist attitudes in public opinion.

AB  - In 2019, the HBO limited television series Watchmen aired to critical acclaim. A contemporary extension of the world established by the 1986-87 Watchmen comic, viewers and commentators alike have viewed the show as a critical commentary on racial politics in the United States. Using Nexis Uni's News Database, we conducted an inductive qualitative content analysis of 31 news articles written by mainstream television critics and/or writers about the show. Across reviews, three primary themes emerged-White supremacy, revisionist history (specifically pertaining to the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921), and the power of masks. The role of critics/writers in engaging audiences with themes about race is discussed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are public concerns regarding OxyContin (Purdue Pharma, Canada) and charges within the pain medicine community that media coverage of the drug has been biased.
   OBJECTIVE: To analyze and compare representations of OxyContin in medical journals and North American newspapers in an attempt to shed light on how each contributes to the 'social problem' associated with OxyContin.
   METHODS: Using searches of newspaper and medical literature databases, two samples were drawn: 924 stories published between 1995 and 2005 in 27 North American newspapers, and 197 articles published between 1995 and 2007 in 33 medical journals in the fields of addiction/substance abuse, pain/anesthesiology and general/internal medicine. The foci, themes, perspectives represented and evaluations of OxyContin presented in these texts were analyzed statistically.
   RESULTS: Newspaper coverage of OxyContin emphasized negative evaluations of the drug, focusing on abuse, addiction, crime and death rather than the use of OxyContin for the legitimate treatment of pain. Newspaper stories most often conveyed the perspectives of law enforcement and courts, and much less often represented the perspectives of physicians. However, analysis of physician perspectives represented in newspaper stories and in medical journals revealed a high degree of inconsistency, especially across the fields of pain medicine and addiction medicine.
   CONCLUSION: The prevalence of negative representations of OxyContin is often blamed on biased media coverage and an ignorant public. However, the proliferation of inconsistent messages regarding the drug from physicians plays a role in the drug's persistent status as a social problem.

AB  - ObjectiveThe marriage equality debate is becoming increasingly prominent in Australian political and media discourse. Moreover, as policy that would legislate marriage equality continues to be debated in political circles, public opinion on the topic appears to be becoming increasingly divided. This article presents a cross-sectional study exploring predictors of support for marriage equality.
   MethodA sample of 137 Australians (66% females) responded to a series of demographic items, a measure of attitudes towards gay men and lesbian women, and a forced-choice question asking whether or not they would support marriage between two peopleregardless of their gender.
   ResultsThe results revealed that support for marriage equality in this sample was predicted by religious affiliation, political orientation, and sexual prejudice. More specifically, individuals in support of marriage equality were more likely to be non-religious, politically liberal, and have more positive attitudes towards gay men (attitudes towards lesbian women were unrelated to support for marriage equality). Age and gender did not predict support for marriage equality.
   ConclusionsSupport for marriage equality in Australia can be predicted by social attitudes and demographic variables. These findings are discussed in terms of the implications of maintaining the legal status quo, which mandates marriage inequality.

AB  - Recent Census Bureau projections indicate that racial/ethnic minorities will comprise over 50% of the U.S. population by 2042, effectively creating a so-called majority-minority nation. Across four experiments, we explore how presenting information about these changing racial demographics influences White Americans' racial attitudes. Results reveal that exposure to the changing demographics evokes the expression of greater explicit and implicit racial bias. Specifically, Whites exposed to the racial demographic shift information preferred interactions/settings with their own ethnic group over minority ethnic groups; expressed more negative attitudes toward Latinos, Blacks, and Asian Americans; and expressed more automatic pro-White/anti-minority bias. Perceived threat to Whites' societal status mediated the effects of the racial shift information on explicit racial attitudes. These results suggest that rather than ushering in a more tolerant future, the increasing diversity of the nation may instead yield intergroup hostility. Implications for intergroup relations and media framing of the racial shift are discussed.

AB  - The current study examined the third person effect (TPE) in relation to media coverage of the shooting incident at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University (i.e., Virginia Tech.) in April of 2007. TPE refers to tendency to perceive that media coverage influences others ( i.e., the third persons) to a greater extent than self( i.e., the first person). Three groups (non-Korean Americans, Korean Americans, and Koreans living in the United States) were compared with one another for their perceptions of media coverage. Specifically, this study investigated how much individuals perceived media to influence themselves versus the American public and the Korean American public. Additionally, the current study examined the extent to which individuals' focus on the shooter and their perceptions of media bias were related to TPE. The results showed support for TPE in terms of media coverage resulting in negative feelings toward Korean Americans and Koreans. As individuals focused more on the shooter and also perceived greater media bias against Korean Americans, they thought that the media coverage of the incident would be more likely to influence the American public to have negative feelings about Koreans and Korean Americans.

AB  - The impeachment of Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff in 2016 was the result of a coup of the economically dominant conservative oligarchy against the leftist Partido dos Trabalhadores (PT, the Worker's Party), in power since 2003. The right wing Brazilian media played a crucial role in this coup by manipulating public opinion as well as the politicians who voted against Dilma. In particular, the media of the powerful Globo Corporation, such as O Globo newspaper, and especially Globo's Jornal Nacional, the pervasive TV news program, systematically demonized and delegitimized Dilma, as well as ex-President Lula and the PT, in their news reports and editorials by selectively associating them with pervasive corruption and attributing the serious economic recession to them. After a summary of this sociopolitical context, and a brief theoretical definition of manipulation, this article examines some of the manipulative strategies of O Globo's editorials during March and April 2016.

AB  - The present study (N=1074) examined the impact of a theory-driven media intervention aimed at violence prevention and intergroup reconciliation in Burundi. We used a novel methodology utilizing audio-based surveys to assess attitudes related to intergroup conflict and reconciliation among community members. We conducted a propensity score analysis to estimate the causal effects of the intervention by examining differences between listeners and non-listeners of the radio dramas. The results indicated a positive effect of the intervention on several social psychological outcomes (tolerance, in-group superiority, social distance, intergroup trust, responsibility attributions, trauma disclosure and competitive victimhood). However, listeners and non-listeners did not differ in obedience toward leaders or historical perspective taking; and the results for active bystandership, one of the main foci of the intervention, were mixed. Furthermore, the results show that the impact of the intervention sometimes depends on listeners' personal experiences of victimization. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Strong anti-Islamic sentiments increased dramatically after the 9/11 terror attacks on the United States, leading to an uptick in prejudice and the perpetration of hate crimes targeting Muslims. Sikh men and boys, often mistaken for Muslims, suffered as collateral damage. The overall health of both communities has been adversely affected by these experiences. Faced with such realities, communities and parents often adopt adaptive behaviors to foster healthy development in their children. In this paper, drawing on interviews with 23 Sikh parents from 12 families, we examine Sikh parents' ethno-religious socialization of their children. The confluence of media stereotyping and mistaken identities has shaped Sikh parents' beliefs regarding their children's retention/relinquishment of outward identity markers. Sikh parents, in general, are concerned about the safety of their boys, due to the distinctive appearance of their religious markers, such as the turban. They are engaged in a constant struggle to ensure that their children are not identified as Muslims and to protect them from potential harm. In most of the families in our study, boys were raised to give up wearing the indicators of their ethno-religious group. In addition, many parents took responsibility for educating the wider community about their ethno-religious practices through direct communication, participation in cultural events, and support of other ethno-religious minorities. Policy implications are discussed.

AB  - This study investigated Malaysian preschool teachers' self-efficacy and attitudes toward the use of the English language as a medium of instruction (EMI) and proposed a model of how different variables were related to their use of English in the classrooms. In order to obtain a broad picture of the nature and scope of preschool teachers' use of EMI, a survey study was undertaken. The research instrument was a questionnaire that was distributed to randomly-selected preschool teachers throughout Malaysia. The process of modeling was based on the empirical data and a theoretical model that was constructed on the basis of the two theoretical aspects, that is self-efficacy and attitudes-behavior relation. The theoretical model served as a bridge between the abstractions from theory and the development of the model. The model suggested that strong self-efficacy influenced preschool teachers' use of English to teach. In addition, the model also indicated that those preschool teachers with positive attitudes also felt self-efficacious in using English to teach and negative attitudes had the opposite effect. Those preschool teachers who had a positive attitude that teaching using English would be useful for the children perceived that they had greater ability toward handling classroom management issues. In addition, they believed too, that they were confident to use appropriate assessment tasks in the classroom when English was used as the medium of instruction. It would appear that self-efficacy and attitudes were mutually related to preschool teachers' use of English to teach.

AB  - Empirical insights on the attitudinal correlates of direct democracy are inconclusive. On the one hand, direct democracy bears a conceptual resemblance with populist ideas. On the other hand, participatory democrats advocate the use of direct democracy precisely on grounds that it promises to educate citizens. This paper complements tests of arguments positing an educative potential of direct democracy with tests of its populist potential. We make use of original survey data collected in the German Bundeslander, which present a relatively underappreciated, yet interesting and representative case for studying direct democracy. Multilevel models indicate that political attitudes are neither more populist nor more supportive of the political system among citizens in direct democratic contexts. The story is more complicated though as the relationship between direct democracy and populist attitudes is conditional on the ideological orientation of a citizen.

AB  - Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face negative consequences linked to prejudice, including homelessness and violence. One medium that perpetuates prejudice toward TGNC individuals is our choice in language. Biased language is related to prejudiced attitudes. Use of gender-inclusive language, however, promotes gender equality. Previous research has examined gender-inclusive language use regarding cisgender men and women, but little work has focused on gender-inclusive language use regarding TGNC individuals. Two studies explored the connections between attitudes toward transgender individuals and perceptions of TGNC-inclusive language. Three hierarchical linear regressions and a mini meta-analysis were conducted. Results suggest that people with negative attitudes toward transgender individuals perceive greater difficulty in using gender-inclusive language. These findings suggest that inclusive language use may be indicative of more positive attitudes.

AB  - Two studies examined the effects of reliance on direct and media-based contact for information about Muslims on Americans' stereotypic beliefs of and negative emotions toward Muslims and support for public policies harming Muslims domestically and internationally. Results revealed that reliance on media for information about Muslims was positively associated with stereotypic beliefs, negative emotions, and support for harmful policies. Reliance on direct contact for information about Muslims produced the opposite results. Results from a three-wave longitudinal design revealed that reliance on media and direct contact significantly predict changes in negative emotions which then predict changes in support for civil restrictions for Muslim Americans. We discuss the differential effects of reliance on media-based and direct contact in influencing intergroup outcomes.

AB  - In recent years, a growing body of research has set out to examine the role that emotions play in shaping political attitudes and behaviors regarding terrorism. However, one major issue that is generally overlooked is whether the thematic relevance of emotive triggers leads to differential effects on people's reactions to international terrorism. Specifically, does angerregardless of its sourcetend to drive people towards supporting an aggressive foreign policy option to counter terrorism, or do the thematic underpinnings of anger (i.e., the specific contents that trigger this particular emotion, such as watching a news story about a recent terrorist attack) matter vis-a-vis the policy choice? To address this gap, this study experimentally examines the impact of angerinduced by thematically relevant versus irrelevant emotive triggerson people's cognitive processing and foreign policy preferences regarding international terrorism. Overall, we find that the induction of anger via thematically relevant emotive triggers leads to a higher tendency for selecting a military option, a lower amount of information acquisition, and a shorter processing time in response to terror-related incidents.

AB  - National newspapers regularly report on public opinion as part of their political coverage. In addition to covering aggregate survey trends, journalists occasionally conduct follow-up interviews with respondents from those surveys to present the views of real people in news stories. The practice of reporting these "qualitative quotes" has existed for decades, yet, there has been little scrutiny of the voices that appear in news stories or their effect on public opinion. We examine this phenomenon in the context of the United States with a historical examination of New York Times stories and other major U.S. outlets that contain polling information and follow-up interviews. Consistent with past work on exemplars, there is considerable evidence for the nonrandom nature of the people invited to comment for news stories. In particular, the use of qualitative quotes reinforces some of the biases that exist in news sourcing more generally. Finally, we demonstrate in an experiment that qualitative quotes influence policy attitudes as least as much as aggregate polling figures.

AB  - This article has two aims. First, it is concerned with a discourse in British media and politics of Muslim education', a concept that often appears alongside words such as extremism' and radicalisation' and contributes to the undue religification' of people of Muslim backgrounds. I offer a preliminary analysis of this discourse arguing that the description of an educational setting as Muslim' opens up a social and political space in which certain types of action can occur, including fundamentally undermining the educational integrity of the setting in question. Second, the article considers original ethnographic data from two Iranian supplementary' schools in London as a way to push beyond a mere critique of Islamophobia towards a new theoretical framework. Drawing in particular on the concept of diaspora, the framework accounts for the highly creative, and potentially innovative, modalities of citizenship and education practice that exist in diasporic communities from Muslim backgrounds. With reference to Thomas' work on the strength of case studies to develop exemplary knowledge' (rather than abstract theory), I sketch out some ideas for a theory of diasporic education'.

AB  - Based on the tenets of social identity theory, a two-study experimental design was conducted which examined the influence of exposure to positive Latino media exemplars on ingroup (Latino) and outgroup (white) consumers. Specifically, the impact of exposure on interethnic evaluations as well as perceptions of self and other was evaluated. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 suggest that although exposure to positive media depictions of Latinos can prompt more favorable evaluations of ingroup and self among Latinos, the same cannot necessarily be said for the effects of exposure to affirmative messages on judgments about Latinos among outgroup members (i.e., whites). Instead, these data indicate that for whites, ingroup (racial/ethnic) identification is a potent factor in media-related interethnic evaluations.

TI  - Media, Trials and Truth Commissions: 'Mediating' Reconciliation in Peru's Transitional Justice Process
T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE
LA  - English
KW  - SOUTH-AFRICA
AB  - Increasing emphasis is being given to truth commissions in efforts to achieve transitional justice goals, including the establishment of a collective memory, democracy and reconciliation. Truth commissions alone cannot guarantee that these goals will be met, however. The authors of this article believe that the media also has a definitive impact on the process. Indeed, how the media portrays transitional justice mechanisms, such as truth commissions and trials, often determines how they are received in a postconflict society. Failure to take into account the importance of public opinion during transitional justice processes carries the risk of societal divisions being reinforced, which appears to have been the case in Peru. The authors argue that, for this reason, attention should be paid to establishing a constructive societal dialogue, which is often most possible through attention to the reform and support of the local media. Although a national dialogue may not always result in an agreed-upon collective memory, it is arguably a prerequisite. The media plays an important role in this endeavor and may ultimately encourage or hinder reconciliation and the recurrence of conflict.

AB  - Supporters of the Republican Party have become much more skeptical of the science of climate change since the 1990s. This article argues that out-group cues from Democratic elites caused a backlash that resulted in greater climate skepticism. The authors construct aggregate measures of climate skepticism from nearly 200 public opinion polls at the quarterly level from 2001 to 2014 and at the annual level from 1986 to 2014. They also build time-series measures of possible contributors to climate skepticism using an automated media content analysis. The analyses provide evidence that cues from party elites - especially from Democrats - are associated with aggregate dynamics in climate change skepticism, including among supporters of the Republican Party. The study also involves a party cue survey experiment administered to a sample of 3,000 Americans through Amazon Mechanical Turk to provide more evidence of causality. Together, these results highlight the importance of out-group cue taking and suggest that climate change skepticism should be examined through the lens of elite-led opinion formation.

AB  - Bariatric surgery is effective on short- and medium-term weight loss, reduction of comorbidities, and overall mortality. A large and increasing portion of the population is eligible for bariatric surgery, which increases instant health care costs. A review of the literature identifies a series of ethical challenges: unjust distribution of bariatric surgery, autonomy and informed consent, classification of obesity and selecting assessment endpoints, prejudice among health professionals, intervention in people's life-world, and medicalization of appearance. Bariatric surgery is particularly interesting because it uses surgical methods to modify healthy organs, is not curative, but offers symptoms relief for a condition that it is considered to result from lack of self-control and is subject to significant prejudice. Taking the reviewed ethical issues into account is important when meeting persons eligible for bariatric surgery, as well as in the assessment of and decision making on surgery for obesity.

AB  - Background: The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019 and its subsequent spread worldwide continues to be a global health crisis. Many governments consider contact tracing of citizens through apps installed on mobile phones as a key mechanism to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2.
   Objective: In this study, we sought to explore the suitability of artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled social media analyses using Facebook and Twitter to understand public perceptions of COVID-19 contact tracing apps in the United Kingdom.
   Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 10,000 relevant social media posts across an 8-month period, from March 1 to October 31, 2020. We used an initial filter with COVID-19-related keywords, which were predefined as part of an open Twitter-based COVID-19 dataset. We then applied a second filter using contract tracing app-related keywords and a geographical filter. We developed and utilized a hybrid, rule-based ensemble model, combining state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches.
   Results: Overall, we observed 76% positive and 12% negative sentiments, with the majority of negative sentiments reported in the North of England. These sentiments varied over time, likely influenced by ongoing public debates around implementing app-based contact tracing by using a centralized model where data would be shared with the health service, compared with decentralized contact-tracing technology.
   Conclusions: Variations in sentiments corroborate with ongoing debates surrounding the information governance of health-related information. AI-enabled social media analysis of public attitudes in health care can help facilitate the implementation of effective public health campaigns.

AB  - Although the government no longer explicitly establishes boundaries of whiteness, it continues to play a central role in shaping symbolic boundaries between immigrants and nonimmigrants through immigration lawmaking. However, the salience of these boundaries may depend on how the media disseminate them to the public. In this study, we investigate media framing of immigration lawmaking using an original data set of news coverage of six of the most widely recognized exclusionary immigration bills and laws at different levels of government. Two patterns emerged from an iterative frame analysis. First, in their coverage of frames critical of these bills and laws, outlets devoted more attention to the effects of exclusionary legislation for nonimmigrants. Second, in their coverage of frames supportive of the restrictive legislation, outlets provided more space to those who openly associated immigrants with criminality and terrorism. Regardless of outlets' seemingly neutral stance toward restrictive legislation, their disparate coverage of exclusionary lawmaking demonstrates apathy and antipathy toward immigrants, which has repercussions for the maintenance of inequality.

AB  - The 2016 presidential election provided a unique opportunity to revisit two competing hypotheses for how voters establish their perceptions of electoral integrity. First, mass public opinion is believed to derive from elite messages. In the 2016 presidential campaign, candidate Donald Trump maintained that the election system was "rigged," while election administration experts and officials received considerable media coverage in their efforts to counter Trump's claims. Second, literature on voter confidence has established a "winner effect"-voters who cast ballots for winners are more likely than voters on the losing side to believe their vote was counted correctly. Thus, voters were exposed to two theoretically opposite effects. In this paper, we find that the "winner" effect mitigates the effects from strong pre-election cues from elites. We also show the effect of pre-election attention to the rigging issue, find a symmetry of the election outcome effect for winners and losers, and reconsider our explanations of the winner effect. Finally, we go beyond the existing studies of the winner effect to consider the kind of citizens who are most susceptible to that effect.

AB  - This article discusses the digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that providing new' media in prisons offer for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. Currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, and unable to communicate in ways that have become ordinary' in the wider community, it is argued that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. In prisons which provide selected prisoners some access to information and communication technologies, their high socio-cultural status and consequent construction as a privilege' frequently results in them being used in the exercise of soft' power by prison officer gatekeepers. Moreover, when prisoners come to the end of their sentences, they not only are faced with prejudice and poor job prospects due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during a period of incarceration may have compound effects and lead to long-term and deep social exclusion.

AB  - This article presents the first systematic analysis of how location of drone strikes and the identification of civilian or terrorist casualties in newspaper reporting affect media assessments of operational outcomes and elite responsibility. Conducting a content analysis of several hundred newspaper articles, we evaluate the likelihood of these newspapers identifying the civilian casualties, the role those casualties play in media assessments of operational outcomes, and who they blame for failure. We found that there were significant differences in the likelihood of the two newspapers reporting civilian casualties. We demonstrate that political elites including the US President tended to avoid blame for failure, with much of the focus of newspaper dissatisfaction being directed at the intelligence agencies. We believe these findings have serious ramifications for the democratic oversight for future warfare and have the potential to undermine the ability of public to constrain elites from launching military operations using drones.

AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston's poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the 'threatening other'. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

AB  - The spillover of racism towards welfare opinions has previously been studied in several countries. This paper analyses how racism and welfare are formed intertwined in Austria. This remains an important topic, as the welfare state not only distributes material resources but is also seen as a site of socialization - at least within the German-speaking literature. Besides identifying a potential spillover effect within survey data for Austria, the article also discusses how the topics of the racialized, especially in the form of the migrant "other" and welfare state and support, are rhetorically linked within newspaper articles. Four rhetorical strategies are distinguished within the empirical material using the notion of the undeserving "other" to argue, among others, for general welfare state cutbacks. These strategies also introduce arguments for extreme cases of social exclusion within the welfare state that affect existing views on, and possibly also, society and social life itself.

AB  - Social media data (SMD) offer researchers new opportunities to leverage those data for their work in broad areas such as public opinion, digital culture, labor trends, and public health. The success of efforts to save SMD for reuse by researchers will depend on aligning data management and archiving practices with evolving norms around the capture, use, sharing, and security of datasets. This paper presents an initial foray into understanding how established practices for managing and preserving data should adapt to demands from researchers who use and reuse SMD, and from people who are subjects in SMD. We examine the data management practices of researchers who use SMD through a survey, and we analyze published articles that used data from Twitter. We discuss how researchers describe their data management practices and how these practices may differ from the management of conventional data types. We explore conceptual, technical, and ethical challenges for data archives based on the similarities and differences between SMD and other types of research data, focusing on the social sciences. Finally, we suggest areas where archives may need to revise policies, practices, and services in order to create secure, persistent, and usable collections of SMD.

AB  - This article uses social media network analysis (SMNA) to examine whether there was an astroturfing campaign on Twitter in support of the Adani Carmichael coal mine in 2017. It shows that SMNA can be used to visualize and analyze outsider lobbying activity in issue arenas and is capable of identifying networks of fake opinion. This study found that in April 2017, there was a small network of accounts that made a series of suspiciously similar pro-Adani tweets that could be considered a form of duplicitous lobbying. However, this study concludes that these posts were likely a weak influence on public opinion in Australia and largely ineffectual as a lobbying tactic. Nevertheless, this analysis shows how communitas public interests can be subverted by covert social media campaigns used in support of corporatas goals, as well as the role digital research methods can play in protecting the integrity on public debates by exposing disingenuous actors.

AB  - This study explores how televised football in Poland serves as a site for the (re)construction of discourses surrounding race and ethnicity and to what extent this squares with previous studies on sport media conducted mainly in Western countries. In our analysis, we identify the discourses surrounding race and ethnicity that the commentators in televised football draw on and examine how they relate to hegemonic discourses and categorizations in wider Polish society. Our findings show that Polish football commentators draw on transnationally circulating racialized/ethnicized discourses on assumed superior physicality when talking about Black football players and on supposed negative psychological capabilities when talking about White Southern European football players. The findings also show that when talking about non-Polish players and head coaches, the commentators regularly rely on an us-versus-them frame that constructs foreign influences as a threat.

AB  - Despite the emergence of newer forms of web-based political engagement, radio phone-ins continue to have a significant role in the enactment of the democratic process, providing a live forum for direct encounters between members of the public and politicians, beyond the professional forms of mediated encounters between studio journalists and politicians. In this paper, drawing on data from the BBC's 2015 phone-in Election Call, we use Membership Categorisation Analysis to examine the ways in which political engagement is configured within this forum in the run up to the UK General Election in 2015. In particular, we examine how callers and politicians engage in live political debate through transforming personal experiences into politicised social categories. What emerges most significantly here is that, whereas in previous Election Call series participants configured political categories through personal social identities, in 2015 there is a particular emphasis on callers' geographical locations as political categories.

AB  - Affordable and ubiquitous online communications (social media) provide the means for flows of ideas and opinions and play an increasing role for the transformation and cohesion of society - yet little is understood about how online opinions emerge, diffuse, and gain momentum. To address this problem, an opinion formation framework based on content analysis of social media and sociophysical system modeling is proposed. Based on prior research and own projects, three building blocks of online opinion tracking and simulation are described: (1) automated topic, emotion and opinion detection in real-time, (2) information flow modeling and agent-based simulation, and (3) modeling of opinion networks, including special social and psychological circumstances, such as the influence of emotions, media and leaders, changing social networks etc. Finally, three application scenarios are presented to illustrate the framework and motivate further research.

AB  - The expansion of research on migration over recent decades has neglected sending and transit countries. Whether in terms of their internal development, their diaspora policy, their shift from primarily sending countries to (potential) transit or destination countries, or the issue of return migration and reintegration into home societies - all these topics deserve further exploration. This paper seeks to redress this by examining Albania, a sending country with almost a third of its population living externally, and which is recently shifting to a transit and potential destination country. Media discourse on migration was analysed, recalling its power to reflect as well as shape public opinion. Employing a quantitative approach, media discourse on migrants from 2015 to 2018 was examined. Some 55 web-based media were identified, along with twenty TV channels, 61 TV programs, and 317 articles. A qualitative analysis was then used to detect the tone of the discourse and gain a deeper understanding of the messages conveyed. Results showed that migration from the perspective of a sending country has dominated Albanian media discourse over the monitoring period. Major identified issues include: migration and demographic challenges, migration and multiculturalism in societies receiving Albanian migrants, and asylum seeking as a recent trend in Albanian emigration often standing in the way of potential Albanian EU membership. The regional migration "crisis" and the potential of Albania becoming a transit or destination country for refugees has only gained limited attention. The binary of "our migrant" versus "the other migrant" became a key distinction.

AB  - This article examines the discursive practices of Facebook users who use the platform to express racist views. We analyzed 51,991 public comments posted to 119 news stories about race, racism, or ethnicity on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation News Facebook page. We examined whether users who hold racist viewpoints (the vocal minority) are less likely to express views that go against the majority view for fear of social isolation. According to the "spiral of silence" theory, the vocal minority would presumably fear this isolation effect. However, our analysis shows that on Facebook, a predominantly nonanonymous and moderated platform, the vocal minority are comfortable expressing unpopular views, questioning the explanatory power of this popular theory in the online context. Based on automated analysis of 8,636 comments, we found 64 percent mentioned race or ethnicity, and 18 percent exhibited some form of othering. A manual coding of 1,161 comments showed that 18 percent exhibited some form of othering, and 25 percent countered the racist discourse. In sum, while Facebook provides space to express racist discourse, users also turn to this platform to counter the hateful narratives.

AB  - This article describes how divisive groups have taken advantage of Myanmar's new political and media freedoms to pursue an agenda that will limit the civil and political rights of the country's Muslim population. The article argues that enforcement of the four Protection of Race and Religion Laws will disadvantage Myanmar's already politically marginalized Muslim residents by creating a de facto religious test for full Myanmar citizenship rights. The article examines both the positive and negative aspects of Myanmar's liberalizations, the nature of the 'Protection of Race and Religion' legislative package and how this will interact with Myanmar's citizenship laws.

AB  - Political communication is crucial for opinion formation about any kind of political issue. According to arguments in the literature on the local public sphere and in political science, processes of communication and opinion formation differ at the local and national levels. However, opinion formation about national and local issues has yet to be compared systematically. This study analyses differences in the communication processes at the local and national levels in Germany based on a survey (n=1014). The results demonstrate that opinions about local and national issues are predisposed, and hardly any media effects occur. Respondents' opinions about local issues are formed more systematically, and interpersonal discussions can be influential while opinions about national issues are based less on personal relevance. In sum, opinion formation processes differ at local and national levels but not always in the way it is often assumed in the existing literature.

AB  - Research suggests that the ability of the president to influence public attention to issues and shape public opinion is limited. Recently, presidential efforts at persuasion have expanded to social media, but presidential persuasion has yet to be explored in this medium. We address two relevant questions. First, what effects does a presidential tweet have on public interest in the issue discussed in the tweet? Second, what effect does a presidential tweet have on public attitudes about that issue? To answer these questions, we utilize a natural experiment that occurred while we were fielding a nationally representative survey of American adults. Our analysis provides considerable evidence that presidential tweets can have the unintended consequence of driving the public away from the president's position on an issue.

AB  - With the realization of the promised global village, media, particularly online newspapers, play a significant role in delivering news to the world. However, such means of news circulation can propagate different ideologies in line with the dominant power. This, coupled with the emergence of so-called Islamic terrorist groups, has turned the focus largely on Islam and Muslims. This study attempts to shed light on the image of Islam being portrayed in Western societies through a Critical Discourse Analysis approach. To this end, a number of headlines about Islam or Muslims have been randomly culled from three leading newspapers in Western print media namely The Guardian, The Independent and The New York Times (2015). This study utilizes "ideological square" notion of Van Dijk characterized by "positive presentation" of selves and "negative presentation" of others alongside his socio-cognitive approach. Moreover, this study will take the linguistic discourses introduced by Van Leeuwen regarding "representing social actors and social practices" into consideration. The findings can be employed to unravel the mystery behind the concept of "Islamophobia" in Western societies. Besides, it can reveal how specific lexical items, as well as grammatical structures are being employed by Western media to distort the notion of impartiality.

AB  - The article is devoted to the study of public discourse in the Russian society in terms of immigration. The immigration has become an integral part of Russian reality and one of the most important factors in its development. Indeed, immigration is destiny for Russian society. So, these forecasts suggest that the number of migrants arriving into Russian Federation will increase in the short-to-medium-term. The arrival of migrants who are different from the host population raises serious concerns among people in Russian society. The part of these risks is justified and the rest is more the result of existing stereotypes and prejudices. The article aims to highlight the main scenarios related to the immigration risks assessment as well as to analyze the reasonableness of mentioned ideas. The article formulates some recommendations that can reduce conflict potential degree in migration flows and thus diminish the importance of some stereotypes and prejudices in the modern Russian society.

AB  - Background:
   Mass media depictions of people with mental illness have a strong influence on public attitudes, to the extent that changes in these depictions can reduce public stigmatization of people with such illness. Journalists' mental health may influence their depiction of those with mental illness, but little is known about this.
   Aims:
   To investigate mental illness among journalists in five key areas: (1) journalists' mental health status; (2) journalists' personal attitudes towards mental illness; (3) attitudes and support journalists expect or have experienced from colleagues when they have a mental health problem; (4) effect of journalism's professional culture on the course of mental illness; and (5) effect of journalism's professional culture on mass media depictions of people with mental illness.
   Methods:
   We performed a systematic screening of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library regarding the study aims.
   Results:
   We identified 19, 12, seven and four studies for aims 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. No articles were found for aim 5.
   Conclusions:
   The prevalence of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among journalists is higher than that among the general population. Journalists have positive personal attitudes towards mental illness, but there are perceived workplace disincentives to disclose mental health problems.

AB  - Against the backdrop of heated debates within and outside Japan regarding Japan's push for the right to exercise collective self-defense (CSD), the Japanese mass media have reported a series of polls on Japan's exercise of its right to CSD, with significantly disparate results. In this article, we present one natural experiment and one controlled experiment that show that the disparate outcomes are due to the different ways the options are segmented. We conducted a comparative analysis of two questionnaires, one presenting two options of 'approve' and 'disapprove' and the other with three options, splitting the option of 'approve' into two answers presenting different means of approving the use of the right to CSD. As a result, more respondents chose 'approve' when the option was split into two. The result shows that option-splitting expands the respondents' range of perception and psychological availability, which in turn raises the selection rate. This research implies that inducing the poll results through option-splitting is possible, which might eventually affect the policy-making process in democratic societies where public opinion polls affect policy.

AB  - Our research capitalized on a naturalistic data collection opportunity to investigate responses to experimental evidence of gender bias within science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). We analyzed 831 written comments made by members of the public in response to three prominent articles reporting on experimental evidence of science faculty members' gender biases. Utilizing a mixed-method approach (i.e., thematic and quantitative analysis), we identified the nature and frequency of positive and negative responses, and we investigated possible gender and professional differences in what commenters wrote. Although acknowledgment of gender bias was the most prevalent category, a wide range of positive (e.g., calls for social change) and negative (e.g., justifications of gender bias) reactions emerged. Among the subsample of 423 comments for which it was possible to code commenters' gender, gender differences arose for the majority of categories, such that men were more likely than women to post negative responses and women were more likely than men to post positive responses. Results were unaffected by commenters' own STEM field affiliation. We discuss implications for the role of clearly demonstrated bias in prejudice recognition and reduction as well as the development of STEM diversity interventions.

AB  - In this paper, the Spiral of Silence theory (SOS) in the study of mass communications is applied to examine the trends and mechanisms of public opinion in Social Media (SM), using the popular topic of the COVID-19 pandemic. The study includes a secondary analysis of the data on pandemic information consumption obtained through four mass surveys conducted in Armenia. In the period from July 1 to August 30, 2020, we also surveyed Armenian Facebook users by means of Google forms during the highest outbreak of the pandemic in Armenia. In particular, the study demonstrates that although the majority of people are well informed about both public conduct requirements and the sanctions for misconduct during the pandemic, they do not follow the rules but hide their real opinion, preferring to openly agree with the official position while silently breaking the rules (that is, they keep their silence). We have found a correlation between the opinion environment of "friends" and other Facebook users, and a willingness to express their own opinion. Due to the predominance of the self-presentation mode as a communication strategy on Facebook, there is a trend among Armenian users not to risk their reputation, and avoid possible critics by keeping silence, if the discussion goes against their opinion. The findings of the study might be helpful both for the further development of communication theories and its application to the conditions of new pandemic reality, and for a better understanding of communicative behavior mechanisms in SM.

AB  - In 2015, United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Implementing SDGs is an important issue for companies as well as for nations. However, to consistently monitor and evaluate progress towards these goals, major efforts in developing objective indices for measuring the levels of SDGs are essential. Currently almost all SDG studies uniformly use available country-level official statistics to synthesize an SDG index, failing to reflect the feelings and opinions of the general public. In this paper we introduce an SDG Social Index developed by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm. By using social media text data rather than conventional survey data, this index can measure and evaluate the outspoken feelings and opinions of the public toward the SDGs. Here we produce an SDG Social Index for a global company and statistically assess its effectiveness. This framework for producing an SDG Social Index can easily be extended to make other indices where various text data are available. It can also be easily extended to yield country-specific SDG indices across nations. In Conclusion section we summarize the implications of our approach and discuss limitations and future research areas.

AB  - Background. Journalists and the information they disseminate are essential to promote health and organ donation and transplantation (ODT). The attitude of journalism students toward ODT could influence public opinion and help promote this treatment option.
   Objective. The aim of this study was to determine the media through which journalism students receive information on ODT and to analyze the association between the sources of information and psychosocial variables.
   Methods. We surveyed journalism students (n = 129) recruited in compulsory classes. A validated psychosocial questionnaire (self-administered, anonymous) about ODT was used. Student t test and chi(2) test were applied.
   Results. Questionnaire completion rate was 98% (n = 126). The medium with the greatest incidence on students was television (TV), followed by press and magazines/books. In the factor analysis to determine the impact of the information by its source, the first factor was talks with friends and family; the second was shared by hoardings/publicity posters, health professionals, and college/school; and the third was TV and radio. In the factor analysis between information sources and psychosocial variables, the associations were between information about organ donation transmitted by friends and family and having spoken about ODT with them; by TV, radio, and hoardings and not having spoken in the family; and by TV/radio and the father's and mother's opinion about ODT.
   Conclusions. The medium with the greatest incidence on students is TV, and the medium with the greatest impact on broadcasting information was conversations with friends, family, and health professionals. This could be useful for society, because they should be provided with clear and concise information.

AB  - Two studies are reported in which ethnic majority children's reactions to media representations of ethnic minorities are examined. In Study 1, 20 white Scottish 6-year-olds viewed short television stories in which white or ethnic minority children were depicted as hostile to the participants in-group (threat present) or not (threat absent). A strong effect of threat on liking was obtained but no effect of ethnicity of target and no interaction. In Study 2, 4- and 6-year-old white Scottish children viewed PowerPoint displays in which Scottish people were shown only as white (traditional version) or as ethnically diverse (multicultural version). Intergroup threat was manipulated. Again, a strong effect of threat was obtained. However, when threat was absent, participants exposed to the traditional condition liked the white out-group more than the multi-ethnic out-group, while participants exposed to the multicultural condition liked the multi-ethnic out-group more than the white out-group. The results are interpreted as consistent with the predictions of Social Identity Development Theory.

AB  - In recent years, concerns about misinformation in the media have skyrocketed. President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that various news outlets are disseminating 'fake news' for political purposes. But when the information contained in mainstream media news reports provides no clear clues about its truth value or any indication of a partisan slant, do people rely on the congeniality of the news outlet to judge whether the information is true or false? In a survey experiment, we presented partisans (Democrats and Republicans) and ideologues (liberals and conservatives) with a news article excerpt that varied by source shown (CNN, Fox News, or no source) and content (true or false information), and measured their perceived accuracy of the information contained in the article. Our results suggest that the participants do not blindly judge the content of articles based on the news source, regardless of their own partisanship and ideology. Contrary to prevailing views on the polarization and politicization of news outlets, as well as on voters' growing propensity to engage in 'partisan motivated reasoning,' source cues are not as important as the information itself for partisans on both sides of the aisle.

AB  - Contrary to the popular notion of the pledge-breaking politician, research has revealed that governing political parties fulfill most of their pre-election pledges. This discrepancy between public perception and scientific findings could be the result of citizens' looser definition of election pledges. Thus, as citizens' assessment of pledge fulfillment (and with that their satisfaction with the governing parties) hinges on their understanding of election pledges, we examined citizens' perception of election pledges. Our experiment (N = 705) showed that citizens were more likely to perceive messages as pledges when they were articulated in binding versus less binding terms, but when they were vague as opposed to specific in terms of goals. Political attitudes also biased the understanding of election pledges, demonstrating that it is in the eye of the beholder which messages are considered to be election pledges.

AB  - Survey studies have consistently shown strong public support for biodiversity conservation, even though conservation regulations often face strong local resistance when they are implemented. This seemingly contradictory phenomenon is due to the fact that previous polls have sought opinion only in the abstract, yet many conservation measures are implemented at the expense of local economic development, and policymakers often face a 'Conservation-Development Tradeoff' -a policy dilemma that remains understudied by social scientists. To fill this gap, this study conducts one of the first comparative surveys on public support for biodiversity conservation in China and the United States. I measure public support for conservation using two separate question versions online. The 'regular version' asks directly about individual support for biodiversity conservation, and the "tradeoff version" asks the same question but in the context of the policy tradeoff. The results show that both American and Chinese citizens are highly supportive of conservation in the abstract. But after they learn about the tradeoff effect, the aggregate support falls sharply, and the Chinese citizens show significantly less support compared to their American counterparts. The survey findings expanded on existing academic research on public attitudes toward conservation policies and can encourage future conservation policymakers to understand the significance of the tradeoff issue, as conventional wisdom may have overestimated public support for biodiversity conservation. Moreover, as China has become a crucial player in global conservation governance, understanding the Chinese public sentiment on the real-world policy dilemma can have important implications for conservation policymaking in the world.

AB  - In the education sector, media outlets have been increasingly active in reporting on standardized testing. The purpose of this paper is to identify the most recurrent discursive frames used by the Norwegian regional and local press when informing their readers about national standardized testing, and to explore whether differences over time and across geographical localities exist in the pervasiveness of frames. Our analysis is guided by framing theory, and builds on a corpus of 3,046 articles that focus on national testing, published by 155 Norwegian regional and local newspapers between 2004 and 2018. The analysis identifies four different discursive frames within Norwegian press coverage, namely the frame of 'performance', 'transparency and empowerment', 'misinterpretation and misuse', and 'criticism'. The four frames convey highly distinct causal and normative beliefs and realities about national standardized testing. While the dominance of the frames varies over time and across Norwegian counties, the frame of 'performance' is increasingly pervasive, something that potentially contributes to naturalize performative-oriented reporting and competition in education. The study highlights the importance of systematic media analyses to identify circulating principle beliefs on education, and of not limiting research to national newspapers in order to grasp geographical variation in media coverage.

AB  - Humans have caused a catastrophic decline to animal species and look to emerging technologies to stop the decline. Gene drive is a potential tool that may eradicate invasive rodents known for their devastating impact on native animals. The use of gene drive will be significantly influenced by public opinion and support, thus early dialogue with society is needed. Framing is a communication technique in which certain beliefs or values are emphasized that resonate with the target audience. Framing may increase how much people objectively think about new information and update their opinions; framing may mitigate emotive and polarising public opinion of contentious topics. Four framed articles were developed that aligned to values of four pre-identified segments (scientific, humanitarian, pragmatic and individualistic). A representative sample of New Zealanders (n = 1,600) read two frames (one aligning to their segment and one to another segment) and were surveyed. Four constructs were measured: (a) public support for gene drive for conservation gains; (b) motivated reasoning (how fixed the opinion is and thus susceptible to bias processing); (c) affective response (how emotive the topic is) and (d) risk perception (the extent the tool is perceived as detrimental to humans and nature). Our study found no evidence of motivated reasoning or heightened emotional response to the counter-aligned frames, suggesting gene drive remains a new topic to the public and entrenched opinion has not been established. While the scientifically framed article was regarded as the most objective and credible, it elicited the greatest perception of risk from the humanitarian group. While current support for gene drive is currently high amongst this group, long-term exposure to scientifically framed messages may result in reduced support and polarisation. Communicating with this group using language that recognises the sanctity of all life and humaneness of gene drive may be more effective in facilitating an open dialogue over time. Early and effective public engagement about gene drive should occur prior to entrenched public attitudes, which is the current context in New Zealand, and not wait for further technology development.

AB  - Data from the Transatlantic Trends: Immigration survey was used to investigate whether the debate surrounding Thilo Sarrazin's immigration-skeptical Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany abolishes itself) had any impact on migration-related attitudes in Germany. The book was published in August 2010 and fieldwork took place during the evolving debate, providing a unique opportunity to study the impact of a major media event on public attitudes. Descriptive findings on the aggregate level show no substantial change in migration-related attitudes in the months after publication. More detailed findings reveal a significant increase in skepticism only for respondents with low levels of education, whose assessment of Muslim migrants' integration became more negative during the debate. There are two possible reasons for the lack of more substantial attitudinal change. Firstly, the debate was highly polarized and lacked the consonant national media coverage that is an important precondition for media effects on public opinion. Secondly, there were no additional "external shocks" prior to the book's release, such as a high levels of immigration, that could have made the public more susceptible to criticism of the impact of migration.

AB  - This study, using survey data (N = 529), examined perceived immigration "threat," subjective knowledge, support for punitive and assimilative immigration policies, and opinions about media coverage effects. Perceived threat was not related to a third-person effect; however, perceived threat of immigrants was related to support for punitive immigration policies, and a strong "hostile media perception" was confirmed. There was a significant belief among respondents that others would view immigration negatively, if only media were not biased in favor of immigration. Internet use, age, race, and education predicted threat perception; perceived threat, perceived favorableness of coverage, and daily newspaper reading predicted presumed influence of news coverage.

AB  - The impact of knowledge on public attitudes toward scientific issues remains unclear, due in part to ill-defined differences in how research designs conceptualize knowledge. Using genetically modified foods as a framework, we explore the impacts of perceived familiarity and factual knowledge, and the moderating roles of media attention and a food-specific attitudinal variable (food consciousness), in shaping these relationships. Based on the differential effects on "negative attitudes" toward genetically modified foods, we provide further evidence that the measures of knowledge are separate concepts and argue against a one-dimensional view of scientific knowledge. We discuss implications for understanding the relationship between knowledge and science attitudes.

AB  - The Internet has been often described as a tool that fosters the inclusion of traditionally marginalized people in the democratic process. Yet, if the type of device used by people to access the Internet impacts their online democratic engagement, uneven Internet penetration and differences in the devices used by social groups will result in a deeper democratic divide. After discussing the impact of the types of internet use and type of access devices on civic engagement, we postulate 3 hypotheses on how democratic values and type of access to the Internet-place and devices-are related to the civic use of social media. We use data from a Valparaiso Regional poll in Chile in 2017, 2018 and 2019 to test those hypotheses. People who access the Internet via mobile phones are less likely to use social media with a civic purpose, while those who access the Internet at home or work are more likely to do so. Since low-income sectors primarily access the Internet via mobile phones while higher income groups have a wider array of Internet connection options, the rapid growth of cell phone use for accessing the Internet risks deepening social and income gaps in civic engagement.

AB  - This article reconsiders ideas of the public sphere in the seventeenth century, by focusing on how public opinion is shaped by the movement of information between media and between receivers. It contends that the scholarly preoccupation with a public sphere viewed exclusively in terms of politics obscures the fact that contemporaries did not distinguish between politics and subjects such as crime in their newsgathering. Examining the case study of James Turner, a burglar in the 1660s who became a cause celebre in London and beyond, this article shows how crime news were eagerly exchanged, informing discussions and constructing public opinion.

AB  - The lack of knowledge of current public attitudes towards basic research into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is a serious problem when considering appropriate ways of governance regarding research and its clinical applications. We therefore conducted an internet-based survey to determine public opinion regarding the research and development of iPSCs and regenerative medicine (RM). A total of 14,908 valid responses were collected, which revealed that the Japanese public were familiar with the terms iPSCs and RM, and many of them had received information about iPSCs and RM through the television and newspapers. They also generally accepted the need for extra funding for research into iPSCs, but also decided to adopt a "wait and see" approach and thought that research and development of iPSCs and RM should be conducted under proper governance in accordance with an international regulatory framework. It will be necessary to discuss an internationally consistent regulatory system and effective mechanisms for information flow.

AB  - Research shows that both entertainment and news media coverage of Islam and Muslims generate anti-Muslim attitudes in the wider U.S. public. In this article, I explore how this media trend shaped Taqwacore punks' struggle to define what it means to be American, Muslim, and punk rock on their own terms. Upon their first U.S. tour, Taqwacore started getting the attention of both independent and mainstream media outlets. Taqwacores initially welcomed this because it helped them expand their audience to other (potential) Taqwacores as well as to a larger non-Muslim public. Their perspective changed, however, as they started to realize that most mainstream media stories were turning their punk protest into sensationalist stories about Americanized "Muslim punks" who oppose Islamic conventions. It was around this time that Taqwacores began imagining their audience as either with them or against them, enemies or allies. This study shows how this understanding of their audience shaped an internal dispute among Taqwacores about whether or not to identify as "Muslim punk." Findings reveal that their internal debate over the Muslim punk label is structured by a racist media frame that defines Muslims as either good or bad, with or against the United States.

AB  - Climate change poses a challenge to countries across the world, with news media being an important source of information on the issue. To understand how and how much news media cover climate change, this study compares coverage in ten countries from the Global North and the Global South between 2006 and 2018 (N = 71,674). Based on a panel analysis, we illustrate that news media attention varies across countries and is often associated with political, scientific, and (partly) societal focusing events. Based on an automated content analysis, we also find that news media do not only cover ecological changes or climate science, but that they focus predominantly on the societal dimension of climate change: They emphasize how humans are aware of, affected by, battle, or cause climate change. Overall, the study illustrates important differences between the Global North and the Global South. While countries from the Global North cover climate change more frequently, countries from the Global South focus more on its challenges and implications for society at large, i.e., the societal dimension of climate change.

AB  - Based on two theoretical approaches contact-theory and threat perception theory-(i)n combination with meaningful encounter and media perspective and using the example of two neighbourhoods in Zagreb, this paper aims to explore several issues related to asylum seekers: (1) the deftnition and perceptions of asylum seekers expressed by locals; (2) attitudes towards asylum seekers in relation to vicinity to an asylum seeker centre and contact with asylum seekers on the neighbourhood level; and (3) the relationship between attitudes and socio-demographic characteristics of respondents. The survey was conducted in the period of November 2015 to January 2016, using a systematic random sample (N = 299) in two selected neighbourhoods of the City of Zagreb: Dugave and Trnje. Each neighbourhood represents a specific surrounding in relation to the proximity of asylum seekers. In terms of location and contact with the asylum seekers, significant differences were found in all obtained latent dimensions of attitudes towards asylum seekers and attitudes based on locational attributes regarding asylum seeker reception: Dugave residents (located closer to the reception and accommodation centre) expressed, in general, more negative attitudes towards asylum seekers and their reception in Croatia than their counterparts in Trnje. The specific timeframe (the 2015-2016 sequence usually referred to as "European Migration Crisis") and the spatial context chosen for conducting the survey allows for spatialised and comparative findings. The discussion further develops the perceptive role played by media in a context of highly-mediatised migration, and the nature of contact in shaping more positive or negative attitudes towards refugees and migrants.

AB  - Inequities in China are reflected within state-run media coverage due to its specific role "guiding public opinion," and with our study we contribute to the geographic turn in the Chinese context with regard to media and journalism. As a subject of a spatial study, China is unique due to several factors: geographic diversity, authoritarian control, and centralized media. By analyzing text from 53,000 articles published in People's Daily (renmin ribao,) from January 2016 to August 2020, we examine how the amount of news coverage varies by region within China, how topics and sentiments manifest in different places, and how coverage varies with regard to foreign countries. Automated methods were used to detect place names from the articles and geoparse them to specific locations, combining spatial analysis, topic modeling and sentiment analysis to identify geographic biases in news coverage in an authoritarian context. We found remarkably uniform and positive coverage domestically, but substantial differences towards coverage of different foreign countries.

AB  - Since 2015 South African universities have emerged as central sites for the decolonial project which has manifested through various movements such as 'Fees Must Fall' and 'Rhodes Must Fall'. Understood as Fallism, these movements have looked towards the deconstruction of various forms of oppression not only in universities but across South African society. Although issues of race and class are central to the recent wave of student activism, the issue of sexual violence has become a critical feature of the project. Public protests and social media are important platforms on which the issues of South Africa's rape culture and university policies on sexual violence are being interrogated.
   This article explores public opinion regarding sexual violence on university campuses. It analyses university policy as well as social media data on the topic, using document and content analysis. Examination of these narratives reveals the ongoing power of patriarchy and its impact on sexual violence. Findings show dissatisfaction with university policies on sexual assault, which are perceived as outdated and ineffective, and that rape culture at universities is viewed as a symptom of broader patriarchy in society. In response to these findings we recommend that attention be given to the sensitivity of cases presented, as well as to strategies of communication and training in dealing with sexual assault. This would include a psychosocial component of sexual assault and harassment being considered, and appropriate approaches to dealing with its effects being made explicit.

AB  - This article explores the construction of extremism in media discourse, the factors driving specific constructions and the implications of these constructions for counterterrorism policy. We contend that extremism has predominantly and increasingly been framed as a security issue. This article explores the implications of this practice through the framework of securitisation. We measure the average intensity of security framing in 38,616 articles found in three major US newspapers, New York Times, Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, between 20 January 1993 and 19 January 2017 comprising the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidencies, and look at factors influencing the shift in intensity over time. Through our analysis, we show that it is possible to return to a pre-9/11 discourse but that the confluence of real-world events and the strategic choices of political actors have so far prevented this from fully occurring. We then explore the effect of securitisation on public perceptions of the threat from terrorism, finding that increases in the intensity of security framing artificially increases the public's worry about becoming a victim of terrorism.

AB  - This paper examines public perceptions of shale gas development in China and the United States. Public perceptions are important, as they are known to influence public policy at national and local levels of government in both multi-party and single-party governance systems. Online surveys were conducted in several states/provinces in each country, the US survey in 2014 (N = 2833); the China survey in 2016 (N = 1571). Similar survey instruments were used in both countries. The survey results show that the reported levels of public support for shale gas development among Chinese respondents in select provinces are significantly higher than that among US respondents in the states included in this study. Perceptions of the advantages and disadvantages of shale gas have both similarities and differences. Shale gas is perceived favorably in both samples because it is seen as a way to reduce dependence on foreign energy suppliers and strengthen the economy. The potential environmental advantages appear to be relatively more important to Chinese respondents than to American respondents. The statement "shale gas development is good for the environment because it substitutes dirty energy such as coal and oil" is seen as "Extremely important" by 54.23% of all Chinese respondents but by only 33.75% of American respondents. When it comes to the potential disadvantages of shale gas development, concerns about impacts on drinking water quality are important in both samples. Earthquakes related to shale gas is the second most important concern to Chinese respondents but a lesser concern to US respondents. We argue that the results are consistent with risk experiences, a variety of socio-cultural theories, and differences in media coverage in the two countries. Future work should examine how public perceptions in the two countries change over time, and how the stances of environmental groups, government, and industry may influence public opinion.

AB  - Background
   Growing availability of research about addressing adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) has recently been embraced by the mainstream media and public. Social media, especially Twitter, provides a unique forum and platform for the public to access and share information about this topic.
   Objective
   This study aims to better understand how the public is framing, sharing, and using research about ACEs on Twitter and to examine the information being commonly discussed about ACEs.
   Method
   We obtained tweets on the topics of ACEs, childhood resilience, and childhood trauma between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019. This timeframe was determined based on key related events in the mainstream media. Crimson Hexagon, a social media analytics system using Boolean logic, was used to identify salient topics, influencers, and conduct a content analysis.
   Results
   A total of 195,816 relevant tweets were obtained from our search. The weekly volume was approximately 1,864 tweets. Key topics included general use of the term ACEs (23%), trauma and ACEs (19%), long-term impact of ACEs (12%), preventing ACEs (11%), short-term effects of ACEs (8%), the 1997 ACE Study (5%), and students with ACEs (5%). The top two sentiments were fear and joy. Top conversation influencers included pediatricians, child health advocacy organizations, California's state government, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and National Public Radio.
   Conclusion
   This analysis provides insight to the ways the public is conversing about ACEs and related topics. Results indicated that conversations focus on increasing awareness of ACEs by content experts and public health organizations. This presents an opportunity to leverage social media tools to increase public engagement and awareness.

AB  - Community conflict is increasingly associated with commercial uses of the marine environment. This research investigates the evolution of newspaper coverage of finfish aquaculture over a 25-year period and how it has reflected growing levels of community conflict common to much of the world's salmon aquaculture production. A detailed case study suggests that by actively constraining debate to positive associations throughout the introduction and early growth stage of the industry lifecycle, companies and regulating agencies may have inadvertently: (i) eroded public trust by contributing to reader ambiguity and uncertainty relating to industry's environmental credentials and publicised partnerships with transnational environmental groups; (ii) failed to promote an open dialogue and a more informed community regarding the real benefits and risks of production; and (iii) created a situation in which negative influences on public opinion post-turning point were magnified.

AB  - When do parties take over the media's issue attention in parliament? Scholarly work has shown that the mass media's influence over the political agenda is conditional, yet only recently scholars started to consider the active role of parties and their strategic incentives in responding to the media. This article argues that parties only respond to media attention if the issue is framed in the party's terms, as the right framing helps the party attain its policy goals. This argument is supported by pooled time-series analyses of the issue of European integration and the issue of immigration in Sweden and the Netherlands over the period 1995 to 2010. Altogether, the study contributes to our understanding of the strategic incentives and options parties have in responding to the media, as well as to our knowledge of the role of framing in political competition.

AB  - This paper reports on the real-time public responses to the eruption disaster on Mt. Kusatsu-Shirane in January 2018. This volcanic disaster attracted significant media coverage, with many people again acknowledging the risk of volcanic hazards from the many news reports. These days, as it has become increasingly common for people to express their opinions using online sites, online reader comments can be important sources of public opinion. This paper used a content analysis approach to analyze the comments posted in online news reports on the volcanic disaster to determine the public's perspective of the risks associated with volcanic disasters and volcanology. Applying an inductive category-extraction strategy, the comments were sorted into six categories of comments (1) that made reference to volcanic risk perception, (2) on volcanology or volcanologists, (3) that had fatalistic perceptions of natural disasters as blameless misfortunes, (4) on eruption predictability, (5) on disaster risk reduction measures implemented by central/local governments and disaster management agencies, and (6) explaining the phreatic explosion mechanism. It was found that many comments tended to have a negative tone, and a prominent criticism was that modern science could not detect volcanic activities reliably. However, some commenters suggested that experts with a sophisticated knowledge of volcanology should be available to support local communities in a similar way to the "home doctor". Volcanologists need to disseminate information, such as the current state of geological and earth science education systems, volcanological knowledge, and application of the lessons learned from volcanic disasters.

AB  - English as a medium of instruction in settings in which the listeners are L2 users has led to concern over learning outcomes for students as well as stereotyping of lecturers. Students report problems understanding their (L2) lecturers' accent, but this concern has typically been treated as a sign of stereotyping towards non-native speakers. Low intelligibility, then, is seen as a product of prejudice. Some researchers, however, have proposed theo-rizing negative attitudes partially as a consequence of more effort required to understand unfamiliar accents.
   In this study we test L2 listeners' perceived and actual understanding of as well as attitudes towards one familiar and one less familiar accent. We further manipulate the effort required to understand the speakers by adding noise simulating the adverse listening conditions in which instruction often occurs.
   Perceptions of the native speaker are negatively affected by noise. Understanding is lower in high noise conditions and she is perceived as less capable. Contrary to our expectations, the listeners' evaluation of the L2 speaker is not affected by noise. The uptake, we suggest, is that we should not be overly concerned with L2-L2 English medium instruction in adverse listening conditions. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The literature on healthcare management has noted that shared decision-making (SDM) - a practice of organizing joint decisions between healthcare professionals and patients - should improve healthcare outcomes through patient engagement and autonomy, fostering patient-centeredness. While SDM projects are implemented across Europe and the US, the diffusion of the practice remains partial, and its' conceptualization scattered. Healthcare management literature explores SDM on the underlying assumption that its limited diffusion results from an information problem, implying objective criteria and rational behavior. The purpose of this research is to study the social construction of SDM within the clinical setting and the underlying rationales using the case of one of the largest healthcare markets worldwide - Germany. To capture the complexity of SDM, a frame analysis is conducted on its medial representations. News media is both influential in shaping public opinion, as well as in generating public discourse. This analysis enables one to elaborate different facets of the construct of SDM, to capture inherent patterns of facilitating and obstructing aspects and to explore consequences for the diffusion of SDM. Three facilitating and three obstructive frames on the implementation of SDM were identified. The polarities of these frames range from the questioning of one's decision-making authority to the perception of individual competence and decision-making agency. Moreover, this study reflects on how physicians' and patients' role for SDM is conceived.

We use quantitative analysis on the published contents (from Factiva (R)) of the main Spanish think tanks between 1st January 2004 and 31st December 2018 in national and international media. The results suggest that the impact of think tanks has increased since the crisis period and has remained constant thereafter, thereby confirming the relevant role of think tanks in public opinion. Moreover, during the process of economic policy design, there has been a significant increase in the hegemony of a few think tanks' influence in media debates.

AB  - Background: As internet and social media use have skyrocketed, epidemiologists have begun to use online data such as Google query data and Twitter trends to track the activity levels of influenza and other infectious diseases. In China, Weibo is an extremely popular microblogging site that is equivalent to Twitter. Capitalizing on the wealth of public opinion data contained in posts on Weibo, this study used Weibo as a measure of the Chinese people's reactions to two different outbreaks: the 2012 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak, and the 2013 outbreak of human infection of avian influenza A(H7N9) in China.
   Methods: Keyword searches were performed in Weibo data collected by The University of Hong Kong's Weiboscope project. Baseline values were determined for each keyword and reaction values per million posts in the days after outbreak information was released to the public.
   Results: The results show that the Chinese people reacted significantly to both outbreaks online, where their social media reaction was two orders of magnitude stronger to the H7N9 influenza outbreak that happened in China than the MERS-CoV outbreak that was far away from China.
   Conclusions: These results demonstrate that social media could be a useful measure of public awareness and reaction to disease outbreak information released by health authorities.

AB  - While scientific consensus and political and media messages appear to be increasingly certain, public attitudes and action towards the issue do not appear to be following suit. Popular and academic debate often assumes this is due to ignorance or misunderstanding on the part of the public, but some studies have suggested political beliefs and values may play a more important role in determining belief versus scepticism about climate change. The current research used two representative postal surveys of the UK public to: measure scepticism and uncertainty about climate change; determine how scepticism varies according to individual characteristics, knowledge and values; and examine how scepticism has changed over time. Findings show denial of climate change is less common than the perception that the issue has been exaggerated. Scepticism was found to be strongly determined by individuals' environmental and political values (and indirectly by age, gender, location and lifestyle) rather than by education or knowledge. Between 2003 and 2008, public uncertainty about climate change has remained remarkably constant, although belief that claims about the issue are exaggerated has doubled over that period. These results are interpreted with reference to psychological concepts of motivated reasoning, confirmation bias and 'finite pool of worry'. Implications for communication and policy are discussed.

AB  - Human-wildlife interactions generate public interest and attract substantial media attention. This becomes particularly interesting in regions where different languages are used by media reports, creating the opportunity to investigate associations between language and the perspectives presented in the reports. In this article, we used 207 English articles (from 2006 to 2019) and 721 Chinese articles (from 2016 to 2019) on human-wild boar interactions in Hong Kong to analyze the gaps and differences in how the interactions are presented in the Chinese and English language media. Although English and Chinese news reporting on interactions follow similar geographical patterns, they differed significantly in terms of the content included, the identity of interviewees, the management strategies mentioned and the reported causes of "conflict." The distinct presentation of human-wild boar interactions in English and Chinese news has the potential to contribute to diverging public attitudes toward the wild boar and policy development.

TI  - Framing Russia in the Estonian, German, and Bulgarian Online Media: Coverage of Two Concrete Events
T2  - THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL ISSUES OF JOURNALISM
LA  - English
KW  - Social constructionism
KW  - news portal
KW  - journalism
AB  - The article provides a short theoretical discussion of framing in news and its role in the construction of reality. They present their approach to frame analysis by showcasing the coverage of two concrete events (the explosion in Arkhangelsk Oblast on August 8, 2019; the Eastern Economic Forum, that took place in Vladivostok on 4-6 September 2019) in Russia by the Estonian, German, and Bulgarian online media, with an emphasis on the Estonian news portals. The analysis rests on the assumption that individual members of society base their actions on the meanings that different events have to them; thus, an analysis of media constructions can explain people's attitudes to specific social phenomena. Journalists play a crucial role in the formation of public attitudes towards the events that take place outside the country borders.
   Journalistic framing is based on the choices journalists make guided by their professional standards. It is demonstrated that the journalists working for the news portals under discussion generally use a rather narrow scope of frames in picturing Russia. On the one hand, these frames indicate limited access to information, while on the other hand, the use of frames by the journalists indicates their intention to attract the readership's attention, the need to present the reality in a simplified and easily understandable form, etc.
   The authors concluded that their findings indicate certain trends in framing Russia in the traditional EU online media, and argue for the necessity to pay more attention to the selection of information in online media newsrooms.

AB  - This article introduces a new dataset to study Israeli politics. Taking an agenda-setting approach, the dataset includes longitudinal series of political outputs-legislative, executive, judicial, and public opinion-as a measure of policy attention in Israel from 1981 to 2019. Each item in each series is hand-coded using the coding scheme of the Comparative Agendas Project (CAP), providing a unified longitudinal overview of the Israeli political agenda. The dataset enables scholars interested in Israeli policy and politics, as well researchers from communication, economy, and law to study agenda dynamics within specific venues, between venues over time, and across countries. It also enables comparative studies that situate Israel among other countries and provides empirical evidence to assess whether, in what, and to what extent Israel is exceptional.

AB  - This article studies how traditional media functions have changed due the new media growth in terms of consumption and influence and how this has affected the public relations (PR) campaigns in terms of storytelling and managing content. The starting point of this article is the media coverage of the Paris attacks on the 13th November, as well as the institutional ceremonies that the French government organized as a tribute to 120 victims. The methodology of this article is based in a sample of the mainstream media in French and English language published in Europe. The analysis indicators are the following: (a) the message, as the story based on organizational essentials, values and identity; (b) the publics in a media relations campaign: opinion leaders and opinion makers; (c) the social dimension and the agenda setting; (d) effectiveness versus excellence and vice versa; (e) role of the media: traditional media (or mainstream media) and new media; (f) trends and challenges for professionals. As we will see, new trends of communication are redirecting the media strategy in PR campaigns in terms of influencing other key publics that generates major engagement in institutional reputation. Hence, traditional media functions (setting agenda, transmitting values, and creating opinion) operate in a new digital context of mashup journalism where cross-cultural PR seeks to better align media agenda's with public and political agenda's in order to set frames of sociability and community engagement.

AB  - Objective Methods This study tests U.S. citizens' attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Immigrants and immigration educe strong, divergent sentiments in the U.S. population. While these sentiments, which are tied to public policy, have been examined in prior studies, it is important to test them regularly in empirical studies to observe any changes in attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. I rely on the 2014 General Social Survey and employ hierarchical multivariate regression models to test the effects of patriotism, nationalism, xenophobia, and "world citizenship" on pro-immigration attitudes. Results Conclusion Appendix Females, respondents with higher education, and respondents who were more patriotic were more likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. Conversely, older respondents and respondents who held greater xenophobic attitudes were less likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. Finally, respondents who viewed themselves more as citizens of the world than citizens of a particular country were more likely to hold pro-immigration attitudes. The study's results are generally consistent with findings from prior research, and point to a general invariability in Americans' views about immigrants and immigration. The policy implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - Public opinion on autonomous vehicles (AVs) is an important topic as AVs are expected to change the transportation system dramatically. Although the topic has been discussed extensively by many researchers and experts, it is beneficial to complement current studies by explaining the AVrelated sentiment variations leveraging the unique social media features. Different from traditional survey-based studies, this study relies on tweets to understand the sentiments on AVs. A comprehensive model framework is proposed to categorize sentiments, recognize critical dates with sentiment changes, and explain sentiment variations. The results indicate that the general sentiment is positive towards AVs, but social media users have sentiment biases towards different AV terms. Significant sentiment changes are often linked with major social events related to AVs, and the general public is more sensitive to social events than the most active users. A wide range of policy insights are discussed based on the results of the analyses, including policies related to safety, pricing, unemployment, and AV adoption rate. Possible challenges and the corresponding strategies are also discussed. These insights will be helpful for the public agencies, automobile manufacturers, and technology companies in gaining a better understanding of AV adoption, and in preparing for the future of transportation systems.

AB  - DNA ancestry testing may seem frivolous, but it points to two crucial questions: First, what is the relationship, if any, between biology and race? Second, how much and why do people prefer clear, singular racial identities over blurred, mixed racial self-understandings, or the reverse? We posit that individuals of different racial or ethnic backgrounds will have different levels of support for this new technology. In particular, despite the history of harm caused by the biologization of race, we theorize that African Americans will be receptive to the use of DNA ancestry testing because conventional genealogical searches for ancestral roots are mostly unavailable to them. This broken chain theory leads to two hypotheses, of disproportionately high Black interest in DNA ancestry testingthus an implicit acceptance of a link between biology and raceand high acceptance among Blacks of multiple heritages despite a preference for evidence of roots in Africa. To test these hypotheses, we analyze two databases of U.S. newspaper articles, one with almost 6,000 items and a second with 700. We also analyze two new public opinion surveys of nationally representative samples of adult Americans. Most of the evidence comes from the second survey, which uses vignettes to obtain views about varied results of DNA ancestry testing. We find that the media increasingly report on the links between genetic inheritance and race, and emphasize singular racial ancestry more than multiple heritages. The surveys show, consistent with our theory, that Blacks (and Hispanics, to some degree) are especially receptive to DNA ancestry testing, and are pleased with not only a finding of group singularity but also a finding of multiple points of origin. Qualitative readings of media reports illuminate some of the reasons behind these survey findings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the broader importance of DNA ancestry testing.

AB  - Up until now, the literature on sociological approaches to translation has mainly focused on the self-perceptions of translators. This article analyses the coverage devoted to non-literary translation and translators in the print media in Switzerland. What perceptions of translation are newspapers circulating? Are these hetero-images positively or negatively connoted? A qualitative thematic analysis is conducted on four daily newspapers in Switzerland - Tages-Anzeiger, St. Galler Tagblatt, Le Temps and 24 Heures (two important newspapers for each of the two major official languages) - over a period of one year (spring 2013 - spring 2014). The analysis shows the scarcity and negativism of discourse about non-literary translation in Switzerland: it is depicted as a risky, costly, lonely and peripheral business - results that would need to be compared across media and countries. Understanding the construction of external 'translation talk' may help social actors such as translators or professional societies fight against existing prejudices about translation.

AB  - Conflicts over natural resource use and management often arise where groups have different goals or priorities. The media can play an important dual role in these conflicts; article content might offer insights about public opinion, whilst media may shape debates and how issues are perceived by the public and decision-makers. Wildlife farming is a contentious conservation tool attracting the attention of worldwide media, and associated conflicts among different interest groups may undermine its applicability. We investigated the media's portrayal of the Cayman Turtle Farm (CTF), a facility in the Cayman Islands which breeds green sea turtles (Chelonia mydas) for human consumption, to investigate how the media presents information about wildlife farming (i.e. framing), consider its potential roles influencing conflicts and explore how it can be used for conservation conflict management. Content analysis was used to compare framing, article valence, and stakeholder representation in 634 newspaper articles from the international and local media. These media stories were framed in terms of: tourism, conflict, conservation, culture/community, management, and utilisation. International articles most often described CTF as a tourism facility. However, during a media campaign by an international animal welfare group, CTF was also often depicted as a source of controversy. Trade in turtle products was mostly debated in older articles. Local media mainly had a financial focus. Conflict framing was associated with a negative article valence, and conflict framed articles were significantly more likely to contain no conservation information. Mentions of environmental interest groups were significantly associated with negative articles, whereas academics were significantly more likely to be mentioned in positive articles. Conservationists must consider stakeholder objectives from the outset of interventions and be aware of the multiple roles the media might play. Media analysis and effectively harnessing the potential of media outlets should be considered as tools for managing conservation conflicts.

AB  - In 2018-9, millions of youth participated in climate-related marches across the globe. This activism reflects youth's distinctive form of political participation: cause-oriented, expressive, and networked. However, the pathway between environmental concern and environmental activism is complicated in some contexts and for some citizens. This article uses survey data from four countries (Canada, France, the United Kingdom, the United States) gathered in autumn 2019. We focus on the environmental activism of youth and young adults (aged 18-33 years, n = 1574). We find the role of social media is consistent and strong for all environmental activities in all countries; the role of political efficacy depends on activity and country but has a positive role in environmental activism; and environmental concern is a positive and significant correlate of boycotting and signing petitions but a weak predictor of participating in environmental marches. The relationship between environmental concern and environmental marches is distinctive in the United Kingdom. Overall, we find that concern about a social cause does not automatically translate into increased activism related to that cause. Moreover, online social networks, political efficacy, and political context are critical to understanding this mobilization process.

AB  - The "Trust Building" initiative, launched in the United Kingdom in April 2016, aimed to dispel myths about Islam and build trust between Muslims and the wider community. This community-led initiative involved trained Trust Building "Ambassadors" delivering workshops at places of work and other community settings to talk about Islam and facilitate open dialogue. Previously, the project reported trust among participants had significantly improved, but the reasons for this were not explored. In this paper, we unpack how and why trust was being built. Providing a forum that permits open dialogue between Muslims and the wider community allowed opportunities for stories and experiences to be shared, enabling negative stereotypes to be uncovered and addressed, and for mutual values to be recognised. With negative media portrayal and rise in hate crime towards minorities, this research is a promising model that has important implications to address the trust deficit seen within our society.

AB  - The societal and ethical implications of artificial intelligence (AI) have sparked discussions among academics, policymakers and the public around the world. What has gone unnoticed so far are the likewise vibrant discussions in China. We analyzed a large sample of discussions about AI ethics on two Chinese social media platforms. Findings suggest that participants were diverse, and included scholars, IT industry actors, journalists, and members of the general public. They addressed a broad range of concerns associated with the application of AI in various fields. Some even gave recommendations on how to tackle these issues. We argue that these discussions are a valuable source for understanding the future trajectory of AI development in China as well as implications for global dialogue on AI governance.

AB  - The political preferences of those with high and low incomes are highly correlated, and both groups become less supportive of redistributive spending as economic inequality increases. This article looks for a source of these interincome group correlations by examining trends in media coverage. We find that during periods of higher inequality, media coverage is more likely to focus on the personal characteristics of welfare recipients rather than the social consequences and causes of poverty. Observational and experimental data indicate that this shift in media frames can predict declining support for welfare spending, even for those with lower incomes who might benefit from redistribution. These findings help explain the reactions of the American public to rising inequality.

AB  - With increasing attention devoted to automated bot accounts, fake news, and echo chambers, how much of the theory of a Habermassian public sphere is still applicable to social media? Drawing on Twitter data collected on April 16, 2017, during the night of Turkey's 2017 Constitutional Referendum, we test whether the networks of political communication resemble the communicative structures characteristic of Habermas's "public sphere." The referendum left the country sharply divided; 51.4 percent of the electorate voted in favor of amending the constitution to grant sweeping new executive powers to the presidency, with an overall turnout of 85.46 percent. In this article, we examine whether Twitter users were meaningfully engaged on the night of the referendum, and if their communicative patterns resembled a networked public sphere, that is, a space where information and ideas are exchanged, and public opinion is formed in a deliberative, rational manner. We find ideological uniformity, polarization, and partisan antipathy to be especially evident-mirroring existing social tensions in Turkey. Rather than resembling a public sphere, we found Twitter users to be more likely to communicate on the basis of homophily-rather than to engage in democratic debate or establish a common ground between the two campaigns.

AB  - This article describes Russian Arctic policy agendas as they have been reflected in mainstream Russian media outlets. The research was based on modeling topic structures of three federal and three regional newspapers. Topic modeling was performed with the unsupervised LDA algorithm and complemented with hand labelling of topics. Data was collected by retrieval of relevant newspaper articles from the media database Integrum for the period 2011-2015 (N = 611); the corpus was further divided in two periods (2011-2013 and 2014-2015) to account for the potential effect of the Ukrainian crisis on agenda-setting. Both federal and regional newspapers were found to have been mostly concerned with the development of hydrocarbon resources, as coverage of this topic was the largest during both periods. However, during the second period (2014-2015), the repercussions of the Ukrainian crisis, namely the economic sanctions and securitization, gained significant attention while marginalizing other topics. The results of this analysis may serve as a foundation for application of sentiment analysis to allow an in-depth understanding of topic salience and impact on public opinion. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In this article we examine whether the proposal to criminalize illegal stay in the Netherlands was preceded by increased negative media attention for unauthorized immigrants. Using a corpus linguistics approach, we carried out a quantitative discourse analysis of all newspaper articles on unauthorized migrants over a period of 15 years. Our results show that the amount of media coverage actually strongly decreased in the years before the proposal, and this coverage was moreover increasingly less negative. This study thus nuances the somewhat popular belief that unauthorized migrants are increasingly portrayed in negative ways and shows that the framing of migrants as criminals is a more diffuse process in which the media seem to follow rather than fuel politics and policy.

AB  - In rapidly and chaotically developing globalization processes, which are observed in recent years, the media have become increasingly important as factors influencing social consciousness. This phenomenon is associated with the increasing complexity of social structures and psychological relations in the course of natural evolution of mankind, with the development of information technology as well as the tense international situation caused by the deployment of the so-called hybrid warfare. Impact of the media on public knowledge is particularly relevant for the Russian Federation because, first, the "subjective" factor has always been highly important (which was confirmed more than once by the course of historical events) in the mentality of Russian society, and second, Russia plays a major role in the hybrid warfare. The aim of this study is to identify and characterize the specific features of social perception and social well-being prevailing in the public mind under the influence the media. The key question that the present article addresses is how objective the media reflect the existing social reality? Is the purpose of the "fourth estate" to help people see the objective and reliable information about political and economic situation in the country and abroad and thus involve the broad layers of society in the construction of social reality? Or are the modern media to a greater extent a tool of information management, focused on programming a certain type of behavior, forming certain types of psychological response to certain events taking place in Russia and in the world? The main sources of information for the preparation of this article were the results of a sociological research conducted in the territory of a particular region - the Vologda Oblast (ISEDT RAS) and in the whole country (VTsIOM, Levada-Center, RAS Institute of Sociology). The conclusions and issues raised in the course of the reasoning are fairly debatable, but, in the author's view, they are worthy of discussion, primarily, due to the existence of potential threats to social stability and national security, which can be found in a distorted perception of social reality in public consciousness.

AB  - Competitive information diffusion on large-scale social networks reveals fundamental characteristics of rumor contagions and has profound influence on public opinion formation. There has been growing interest in exploring dynamical mechanisms of the competing evolutions recently. Nevertheless, the impacts of homogeneity trend, which determines powerful collective human behaviors, remains unclear. In this paper, we incorporate homogeneity trend into a modified competitive ignorant-spreader-ignorant rumor diffusion model with generalized population preference. Using microscopic Markov chain approach, we first derive the phase diagram of competing diffusion results on Erdos-Renyi graph and examine how competitive information spreads and evolves on social networks. We then explore the detailed effects of homogeneity trend, which is modeled by a rewiring mechanism. Results show that larger homogeneity trend promotes the formation of polarized 'echo chambers' and protects the disadvantaged information from extinction, which further changes or even reverses the evolutionary advantage, namely, the difference of stable proportions of the competitive information. However, the reversals may happen only when the initially disadvantaged information has stronger transmission ability, owning diffusion advantage over the other one. Our framework provides profound insight into competing dynamics with homogeneity trend, which may pave ways for further controlling misinformation and guiding public belief systems. Moreover, the reversing condition sheds light on designing effective competing strategies in many real scenarios.

AB  - Studies of fake news have historically suffered from being primarily Western-centric and focusing on "news" emanating from formal media outlets. The Sahel has generated its own unique version of fake news, the authors refer to as Afrancaux News. Using nationwide public opinion surveys in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger, open-source online forum ethnographic research, and postcolonial epistemological predispositions, the authors suggest that although other historical instantiations exist, the most prominent contemporary example of Afrancaux News can be seen in the fake news stories related to the French counterterrorism presence in the Sahel.

AB  - The diffusion of breaking news largely relies on propagation behaviors in the media. The tremendous and intricate propagation relationships in the media form a complex network. An improved understanding of breaking news diffusion characteristics can be obtained through, the complex network research. Drawing on the news data of Bohai Gulf oil spill event from June 2011 to May 2014, we constructed a weighted and directed complex network in which media are set as nodes, the propagation relationships as edges and the propagation times as the weight of the edges. The primary results show (1) the propagation network presents small world feature, which means relations among media are close and breaking news originating from any node can spread rapidly; (2) traditional media and official websites are the typical sources for news propagation, while business portals are news collectors and spreaders; (3) the propagation network is assortative and the group of core media facilities the spread of breaking news faster; (4) for online media, news originality factor become less important to propagation behaviors. This study offers a new insight to explore information dissemination from the perspective of statistical physics and is beneficial for utilizing the public opinion in a positive way.

AB  - Past quantitative studies have shown that most media coverage is of men. Here we ask if the scarce coverage that women get is qualitatively different from that of men. We use computer-coded sentiment scores for 14 million person names covered in 1,323 newspapers to investigate the three-way relationship between gender, fame, and sentiment. Additional large-scale data on occupational categories allow us to compare women and men within the same profession and rank. We propose that as women's fame increases their media coverage becomes negative more quickly when compared to men (a "paper cut"), because their violation of gender hierarchies and social expectations about typical feminine behavior evokes disproportionate scrutiny. We find that while overall media coverage is much more positive for women than for men, this difference disappears and even reverses at higher levels of fame. In encyclopedic sentiment data we find no biographic basis for women's disproportionate decline in media coverage sentiment at high fame, consistent with the conjectured double standard in media discourse.

AB  - This article uses the theoretical framework of constructivism to evaluate the political relationship between Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan. The leaders of the two states have begun to strengthen political relations in order to achieve the common goal of enhancing the image of Islamism in the western world. This paper explores the basic research question of why Imran Khan is getting closer to Tayyip Erdogan? What are the driving forces behind Imran Khan's diplomacy to boost the image of Islamism? This paper argues that Imran's pursuit of Naya Pakistan and his desire to explain Islam to the West need the support of other Islamic countries, which gravitates him to Erdogan. Imran's foreign behaviour is inspired by his desire to maintain political power to stay in office, and therefore he is trying to create the state of Medina and explain Islam to the West. Ergo, Erdogan is a rational choice for Imran as both of them share the same idea to solve the Muslim problem by uniting Muslims and explaining Islam to the West. They agreed to set up a joint television channel and an Islamic bloc to address Islamophobia and Muslim problems.

AB  - African elephant populations are under substantial anthropogenic pressure, but these are not spatially homogenous. Elephant densities are high in parts of southern Africa, leading to conflict with human populations. Conservationists working to mitigate impacts of human-elephant conflict (HEC) will turn to mechanisms or incentives to achieve this, mostly financial (such as compensation, or income generation through tourism). Little is known about the attitudes of stakeholders' (such as farmers) toward financial incentives used to mitigate conflict. Here we carried out a content analysis of stakeholder evaluative expression, or valence, using reports from the southern African news media. We sourced 428 separate news articles over the past ten years, and quantitatively assessed stakeholder valence on the financial mechanisms used to mitigate human-elephant conflict. We found that stakeholder attitudes or valence differed across countries and that stakeholders were generally positive, even with regard to controversial mechanisms such as trophy hunting. Our work has some implication for conservation policy.

AB  - Purpose - The discourse about agriculture within Switzerland's and Germany's public is to be compared in order to obtain an idea about the impact of the different agricultural systems. The paper aims to discuss this issue.
   Design/methodology/approach - After a brief description of agricultural systems and policies in Germany and Switzerland, the discourse among the general public in the two countries in internet newsrooms and message boards is analyzed. The subjects of discussions are compared, and selected sequences are analyzed using objective hermeneutics.
   Findings - Results indicate that, in Germany, agriculture is largely perceived as a black box where food safety is a crucial issue. Although food safety also is discussed in Switzerland, Swiss discussants focus more on changes that should be implemented in agricultural production and policy systems.
   Research limitations/implications - The quantitative and qualitative evaluation of newsrooms and message boards reveals important insights, particularly in a comparative setting.
   Practical implications - A small-structured agriculture may contribute to generate trust in the reliability of food safety among consumers.
   Originality/value - The discourse on German and Swiss internet platforms on agricultural issues reveals significant differences which shows that such an analysis allows important insights.

AB  - Across the world, the use of the internet has impacted citizenship and governance which in some cases has resulted in the modification of political landscapes. Events such as the overthrow of regimes in the Middle-East during Arab Spring to the latest election upset in Malaysia in 2018, have proven the potential of new media platforms as media of change. Diverse media content generated by the public, including citizen-generated news, is shared across virtual space. Before the advent of the internet, journalism was practiced exclusively by trained journalists. These days, however, everyone has access to the tools to produce news on his or her own. This type of journalism, described in this study as citizen journalism, has changed the dynamic of news-sharing. This article seeks to explore how citizen journalism content has influenced the Malaysian political landscape. In 2016, two years before the shocking election upset in Malaysia, eight informants were interviewed for this study. The interviews were conducted in Malaysia and the United Kingdom. Despite the abundance of content on the internet generated by citizen journalists, it is believed that Malaysians in general still rely heavily on materials produced by professionals. Based on the respondents' responses, citizen journalism does have influence over the political landscape and plays a part in shaping public opinion.

AB  - Representative democracy presents politicians with an information problem: How to find out what voters want? While party elites used to rely on their membership or mass surveys, social media enables them to learn about voters' issue priorities in real time and adapt their campaign messages accordingly. Yet, we know next to nothing about how campaigns make use of these new possibilities. To narrow this gap, we use a unique data set covering every Facebook post by party leaders and party organizations in the run-up to the 2017 Austrian parliamentary election. We test the hypothesis that party actors are more likely to double down on issues that have previously generated higher levels of user engagement. We also theorize that responsiveness is conditional on major/minor party status and pre-campaign issue salience. The analysis shows that parties' issue strategies respond to user engagement, especially major parties on low-salience issues. This represents some of the first empirical evidence on how social media can enhance parties' issue responsiveness.

AB  - The alignment between media and presidential framing following 9/11, as well as surrounding the Iraq war, has been criticized as an instance of "when the press fails." We explore this idea further by comparing presidential and newspaper framing in the case of 9/11 and the subsequent "war on terror." We argue that high president/press framing alignment after 9/11, and again during the start of the Iraq war, was largely driven by institutional incentives. Thus, "failure" of the press should be expected in these cases, as in the case of other crisis events that yield a strong rally response. Because the media and the president operate under different incentives, they exhibit different framing behaviors-and different framing dynamics. The result is that, in general, the framing messages of these two institutions sometimes align, especially at critical moments, but more often differ. And in the case of major crises like 9/11 and Iraq, we should see a distinct pattern in president/press framing alignment over time-namely, high initial alignment followed by steep decay-as incentives lead the president to "stay the course" while leading news outlets to shift their framing in line with elite and public opinion. We test this idea by applying a new measure of framing alignment to over 3,400 news stories and 500 presidential papers about 9/11 and the war. We find support for our theoretical expectations, showing that, despite their immediate similarities in the cases of 9/11 and Iraq, the president and the press exhibited increasingly divergent framing behaviors over time.

AB  - While previous research has examined the effect of the content and context of communication on the communication experience and effect, this study explored their interactive effect with an eye to reducing stereotypes and prejudice. In an experiment, Israeli Jews watched a movie about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that was edited to be either pro-Palestinian or pro-Israeli in the company of either a Jew or an Arab confederate coviewer. We then measured their attitudes toward Arabs. We found an effect of both movie type and the coviewer's ethnicity on stereotypes as well as an interactive effect of these variables, mediated by the identification of the participants with the Arab protagonist.

AB  - Scientific debates in modern societies often blur the lines between the science that is being debated and the political, moral, and legal implications that come with its societal applications. This manuscript traces the origins of this phenomenon to professional norms within the scientific discipline and to the nature and complexities of modern science and offers an expanded model of science communication that takes into account the political contexts in which science communication takes place. In a second step, it explores what we know from empirical work in political communication, public opinion research, and communication research about the dynamics that determine how issues are debated and attitudes are formed in political environments. Finally, it discusses how and why it will be increasingly important for science communicators to draw from these different literatures to ensure that the voice of the scientific community is heard in the broader societal debates surrounding science.

AB  - Political parody, which is entitled to free speech protection under the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, aims at criticizing politicians' policies and ideas with humor. As such, political parodies represent a serious threat to a politician's brand image and reputation. Despite their prevalence in political life and debates, the relative persuasive effects of political parodies based on their communication source (user-generated parody [UGP] vs. media-generated parody [MGP]) have been underexplored. To fill this gap, we developed two studies. The first study involved content analysis of more than 330 parody videos posted on YouTube between 2012 and April 2019 in France. Our findings, in Study 1, showed that MGP led to fewer likes and a more negative attitude toward the parody than UGP. The second study, based on controlled experiment, provided evidence through mediation; compared to UGP, MGP led to more negative attitudes toward the parody and less perceived influence of the parody because of a higher perception of the source's intention to manipulate. This mediating effect was significant only when individuals were highly skeptical of traditional media. These findings add to current theories of political parody, free speech and user-generated content and offer actionable insights to practitioners.

AB  - With growing scientific evidence showing the harmful impact of air pollution on the environment and individuals' health in modern societies, public concern about air pollution has become a central focus of the development of air pollution prevention policy. Past research has shown that social media is a useful tool for collecting data about public opinion and conducting analysis of air pollution. In contrast to statistical sampling based on survey approaches, data retrieved from social media can provide direct information about behavior and capture long-term data being generated by the public. However, there is a lack of studies on how to mine social media to gain valuable insights into the public's pro-environmental behavior. Therefore, research is needed to integrate information retrieved from social media sites into an established theoretical framework on environmental behaviors. Thus, the aim of this paper is to construct a theoretical model by integrating social media mining into a value-belief-norm model of public concerns about air pollution. We propose a hybrid method that integrates text mining, topic modeling, hierarchical cluster analysis, and partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). We retrieved data regarding public concerns about air pollution from social media sites. We classified the topics using hierarchical cluster analysis and interpreted the results in terms of the value-belief-norm theoretical framework, which encompasses egoistic concerns, altruistic concerns, biospheric concerns, and adaptation strategies regarding air pollution. Then, we used PLS-SEM to confirm the causal relationships and the effects of mediation. An empirical study based on the concerns of Taiwanese social media users about air pollution was used to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed framework in general and to examine gender differences in particular. Based on the results of the empirical studies, we confirmed the robust effects of egoistic, altruistic, and biospheric concerns of public impact on adaptation strategies. Additionally, we found that gender differences can moderate the causal relationship between egoistic concerns, altruistic concerns, and adaptation strategies. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of enhancing perceptions of air pollution and environmental sustainability by the public. The results of the analysis can serve as a basis for environmental policy and environmental education strategies.

AB  - In recent years, increasing attention has been dedicated to the hazardous and volatile situation in the Middle East, a crisis which has pushed many to flee their countries and seek refuge in neighboring countries or in Europe. In describing or discussing these tragic events, labels such as European migrant crisis and European refugee crisis started being widely used by the media, politicians, and the online world alike. The use of such labels has the potential to dictate the ways in which displaced people are received and perceived. With this study, we investigate label use in social media (specifically YouTube), the emergent patterns of labeling that can cause further disaffection and tension or elicit sympathy, and the sentiments associated with the different labels. Our findings suggest that migration issues are being framed not only through labels characterizing the crisis but also by their describing the individuals themselves. Using topic modeling and sentiment analysis jointly, our study offers valuable insights into the direction of public sentiment and the nature of discussions surrounding this significant societal crisis, as well as the nature of online opinion sharing. We conclude by proposing a four-dimensional model of label interpretation in relation to sentimentthat accounts for perceived agency, economic cost, permanence, and threat, and identifies threat and agency to be most impactful. This perspective reveals important influential aspects of labels and frames that may shape online public opinion and alter attitudes toward those directly affected by the crisis.

AB  - The health of democratic public spheres is challenged by the circulation of falsehoods. These epistemic problems are connected to social media and they raise a classic problem of how to understand the role of technology in political developments. We discuss three sets of technological affordances of social media that facilitate the spread of false beliefs: obscuring the provenance of information, facilitating deception about authorship, and providing for manipulation of social signals. We argue that these do not make social media a "cause" of problems with falsehoods, but explanations of epistemic problems should account for social media to understand the timing and widespread occurrence of epistemic problems. We argue that "the marketplace of ideas" cannot be adequate as a remedy for these problems, which require epistemic editing by the press.

KW  - Representation of Migrants
AB  - Increasing migration is a vital concern for a globalizing sociocultural environment in today's world. The UK and developed European countries have become an attractive destination for asylum seekers (labelled as "migrants") in the past decade. The rapid rise in the number of asylum seekers, which was labelled "migration crisis" (Ruz, 2015), made this topic an integral part of scientific discussion on sociocultural environment. There are different factors underlying the perception of migrants by local population. The given study is devoted to the review of the usage of different linguistic means and its strategies by mass media whilst the escalation of refugee crisis in Great Britain as compared to Russia. We implement situational approach to the non-fiction factual texts, in particular, texts representing a concrete (actual) situation. Today due to the development of neural network technology we can easily define thematic structure of the text, specify the central lexis, the near peripheral lexis and the far peripheral lexis and reveal implicit information. The data of British National Corpus and Russian National Corpus is analyzed using text mining software-TextAnalyst 2.01. The relationships and patterns among key words and their associations are cluster-analyzed and contextual interpretation of semantic core is provided. Associative structures enable us to define the lexical experience of its speakers (White & Abrams, 2004) while the analysis of associative network helps to study public opinion on different social issues (File, Keczer, Vancso et al., 2018). The data for the text mine is gathered from the website Ruscorpora.ru (data set 1) and British National Corpus (data set 2). The thematic network depicts the structure of the text and the most pertinent information in the data. The semantic network constructs a list of topics and their semantic weights. It is a tree structure of the concepts of the text and identifies the relationships in the text. Just like in data set 1 public attitudes in data set 2 towards refugees and migrants are complex. Representation of migrants and hence public opinion are complicated by predisposition to favor those using legal means to enter a country with national culture, traditional customs, laws and ability to speak the language of the host country being the key factor in integrating migrants.

AB  - The 2012 US Presidential debates were hybrid media events. Millions of viewers 'dual-screened' them, simultaneously watching their televisions and commenting on their social media feeds. In doing so, they helped transform verbal gaffes and zingers into debate-defining moments that may have influenced public opinion and media coverage. To examine this phenomenon, we apply network and qualitative textual analyses to a unique data set of over 1.9 million tweets from the first and third presidential debates. We address two questions of networked information flow within the debate-relevant Twittersphere: who was most responsible for spreading the 'Big Bird' and 'horses and bayonets' memes, and how did they use humour to discuss it? Our results reveal that non-traditional political actors were prominent network hubs in both debates and that humour was widespread in the first debate and among anti-Romney users.

AB  - Although political interviews have been a mainstay of U.S. television, they are undertheorized in the media effects tradition. This article seeks to ground possible interview effects into theory-particularly to recent developments in the study of incivility and its effect on public opinion. An experiment-based study finds that viewers are likely to think more negatively about journalists in an environment marked by uncivil interviewing. At the same time, exposure to interviews perceived as not sufficiently adversarial could also reduce trust in journalists, which suggests that the effect extends beyond the question of incivility, depending on viewers' expectations. Beyond the particular findings, this study indicates the possibilities of a research agenda centering on political televised interviews and their social implications.

KW  - YOUNG
AB  - The changes brought about by the Digital Age have not triggered significant increases in political participation or meaningful reductions in longstanding social power asymmetries, which are now increasingly negotiated in policy contexts that involve mass media (surveillance, big data, net neutrality). At the same time, new technology and communication patterns have opened fissures in public opinion about the limits of free expression while also creating new legal risks for citizen-communicators. This article suggests that universities need to recalibrate their curricula to meet the exigencies of this moment, which should include an increased emphasis on media law and policy courses and initiatives. The article outlines a rationale for action, and some strategies, based on the need to: (1) expand citizens' expressive agency by equipping them with the knowledge to shield themselves from overt restraints and subtle forms of coercion; (2) deepen citizens' civics knowledge, enhance their political efficacy and enable their political participation; (3) facilitate citizens' engagement in reemerging debates about the meaning and scope of the First Amendment; and (4) spur citizen involvement in confronting pressing constitutional and media policy issues whose resolution will ultimately shape the broader balance of social power.

KW  - the Moroccan woman
AB  - Of the many influences on how Moroccan people perceive the Moroccan woman, Moroccan digital media is presumably the most powerful tool used throughout; in fact, Moroccan digital media direct the public opinion, frame specific images, and perpetuate both realistic and unrealistic speculations about the Moroccan woman, whose voice is carefully selected and whose presence goes sometimes reported and at other times unreported. This article is a deep reflection of the overall images chosen to manufacture consensus about the Moroccan woman in the Moroccan digital media; more specifically, emphasis is going to be laid on how Hespress, as an emerging Moroccan news outlet, advertises different conceptions and representations about the Moroccan woman at home and overseas. The article is predicated on the notion of framing news stories, which propel journalists to decide on what is newsworthy and what is not. The researcher's pivotal argument is that a process of selection is obviously developed by Hespress in its dealing with and detailing on the question of the Moroccan woman. Put otherwise, a large space is arguably accorded to certain women who have outperformed their peers in many vital sectors of life and led successful stories nationwide. As for those women, whose stories do not correlate with the policy and the editorial line of Hespress, they are devoiced and still marginalized. To address this topic more effectively, the researcher suggests utilizing a multimodal analysis to the discourse of Hespress about the Moroccan woman. A preliminary examination of the literature documenting the media's discourse about her will be considered. Then, an elaboration of the methodology adopted will be explored. Finally some pedagogical recommendations will be advanced in this article to enable students promote critical reading and hone not only their analytical but also their interpretative skills as concerns Hespress discourse on the Moroccan woman.

AB  - India's official embrace of the soft power concept and the popular equation of Bollywood films with India's international image are discussed here with reference to their contemporary convergence. This article seeks to make the case that the underlying claims of the soft power doctrine necessitate an empirical test at the level of grassroots reception. Further, this article also seeks to shift the emphasis from 'impressing the West' towards interrogating the dynamics of India's cultural diplomacy in other Asian states. With these aims in mind, this article presents two qualitative case studies from Chiang Mai, Thailand and Metro Manila in the Philippines. The responses collected indicate the inherent complexities of Inter-Asian dialogues on culture and modernity as well as the importance of the local media environment in determining perceptions of contemporary India. Ultimately, the capacity of popular culture to create a positive impression and to counter existing prejudices and misconceptions is supported in a series of reception studies. At the same time, the 'moral superiority' and historical legacies that are assumed to underpin India's cultural prestige in the region are challenged by the content and tone of these responses from the general public. In the contemporary setting of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), it becomes clear that the mediation of Indian culture operates within an increasingly transnational media environment and a competitive modernity that informs comparative perspectives between Asian cultures.

AB  - We examine 575 randomly selected articles on Zimbabwean immigrants from the South African Media (SAM) database to expose discourses of exclusion and the production of the psycho-social condition - moral panic. We use critical discourse analysis, notions of remediation and immediacy to scrutinize discourse structures and other discursive strategies designed to conceal mediation and authorial prejudices, and to make the reader experience' the actual content. In addition to making the anti-immigrant rhetoric appear legitimate, and the danger immediate and real, we argue that the apparent seamless content is often biased by selection and structured in such a way as to deny voice to immigrants and their advocates. Among other things, we conclude that since the readers' interpretations are filtered through lenses of subjectivities defined by communicative contexts characterized by job scarcity, poverty, crime and wanting healthcare, the news content heightens anxiety and miseducates more than it enlightens readers on migration issues. Hence there is a danger of SAM becoming unwitting conveyors of the same vices they preach against.

AB  - For the last decade, undocumented or illegal immigration has been one of the most contested policy issues in the United States, with significant news attention on policies affecting the undocumented population, ranging from deportations to comprehensive immigration reform, the DREAM Act, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Despite these prominent and multifaceted policy debates, scholarship on media framing and public opinion remain more focused on the portrayal of immigrants rather than policies affecting them. In general, scholars find that policy frames are far more consequential to public opinion than equivalency frames (variations in how news media describe unauthorized immigrants, either as "illegal" or "undocumented") or episodic frames (whether news articles are heavy on human-interest stories rather than policy facts and statistics). Also, negative frames generally have stronger effects than positive frames, and these effects sometimes vary by partisanship and family migration history. Finally, the relative infrequency of powerful frames in news stories, like a life spent in the United States, provides opportunities for advocates to move public opinion on immigration policy. These findings have important implications for future battles over immigration policy in the United States, which show no signs of abating.

AB  - This article investigates why the governments of Australia and Poland decided to contribute military forces to the United States led invasion of Iraq in March 2003 when a majority of Australian and Polish citizens were opposed to national involvement in the invasion. The objective of the article is to increase understanding of the conditions under which governments ignore the public in their foreign policymaking. The article examines the explanatory power of four intervening variables: issue salience, elite debate, timing of the next election and the importance assigned to international gains by the government. On the basis of the Direct Method of Agreement, the article concludes that government perceptions of international gains and the timing of the next election were potentially necessary factors for the outcomes of the cases, while issue salience and elite debate were not necessary conditions. A distant election may, thus, provide sufficient electoral protection for a government that conducts a foreign policy to which the public is opposed.

Using a mixed method, the findings of the study show that Islam is more aggressively attacked than Christianity by three major communities, unlike Christianity, which is targeted much less by two main online groups. The online discussion around the two religions is politically polarized, and the negative language especially used against Islam includes the strategic use of hashtags and emojis, which have been weaponized to communicate violent messages and threats. The study is situated within the discussion of trolling and hateful content on social media. Aside from the empirical examination, the study refers to the differences in Twitter's and Instagram's policies, for the latter does not allow using hashtags such as #f***Christians and #f***Muslims, unlike Twitter, which accepts all types of hashtags to be used.

AB  - Legislation regarding the legalization of same-sex marriages has been advocated for and opposed across distinct states in the United States. Claims makers on either side of the issue have attempted to have their voices heard in local and national newspapers. Newspaper personnel determine how to frame the issue, deciding which meanings associated with same-sex marriage will be highlighted and which will go unrepresented. This paper analyzes the media framing of Proposition 8 in California, a voter initiative prohibiting same-sex marriage, comparing frames across three newspapers: one local to California, the San Francisco Chronicle, and two national, the New York Times and the Washington Post. The paper illustrates shifts in frames from May 2008 to August 2010, a time period extending from the vote on the initiative through two court challenges. Overall, the results indicate that these newspapers more frequently frame same-sex marriage as a civil rights issue and that those attempting to block same-sex marriage do so as a function of discrimination. Less frequently, they frame same-sex marriage as a threat to heterosexual marriage. The findings show that the frequency with which the frames appear shift across newspapers as well as the time period of study. (C) 2014 Western Social Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The tension between health and economic considerations regarding COVID-19 has resulted in a framing contest, in which proponents and adversaries of strong containment measures hold oppositional frames about the pandemic. This study examines the effects of competing news frames on social media users' policy preferences and the moderation of framing effects played by melodramatic news treatment. Results from a pre-registered online survey experiment in Chile (N= 518) show that participants exposed to Facebook posts with an economic frame were significantly less supportive of measures that restrict mobility (e.g., quarantines) than participants in the control group. Contrary to expectations, exposure to a public health frame also reduced support for stay-at-home orders, and the presence of melodramatic features had no significant impact on users' preferences. Other variables, however, did alter these framing effects, such as fear of COVID-19 and frequency of social media news use. These findings paint a rather complex picture of framing effects during the pandemic in a digital media environment.

AB  - The Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill (Anti-ELAB) movement in Hong Kong was marked by a significant degree of tactical radicalisation in its first six months. Yet the movement also succeeded in maintaining a high degree of solidarity and public support. This article explains how tactical radicalisation and public receptiveness toward radical actions was achieved. It does this by drawing upon protest onsite survey data, public opinion poll data, analysis of digital media contents and field observations. Theoretically, it combines a relational approach with an emphasis on the role of discursive negotiation. The article first reconstructs the trend of movement radicalisation in Hong Kong since the late 2000s. It then examines the interactional dynamics that drove the process of radicalisation along multiple pathways during the first six months of the Anti-ELAB movement. The articulation of justifications and discursive negotiation of collective restraints is then examined. Overall, the analysis reconstructs the process of stepwise and constrained radicalisation in the Anti-ELAB movement. General theoretical implications of the analysis are discussed.

AB  - Japan has one of the world's highest rates of psychiatric institutionalization, and popular images of mental health care and public attitudes toward mental illness there have been stigmatized for decades. However, there are transitions underway that are reshaping the mental health care landscape as well as affecting public representations of mental illness. Those transitions include attempts to promote community-based care, move away from long-term hospitalization, reduce stigma, increase utilization of services, and bring clinical psychological services under the national health insurance umbrella. This article discusses one cultural representation in which those transitions are brought into relief: a 2002 television series entitled PsychoDoctor that portrayed the clinical practice of a psychiatrist. The article analyzes the messages inherent in the series about the nature of mental illness, the everyday-ness of sufferers, and the expanded repertoire of treatments now available. In so doing, the article suggests that the efforts of progressive clinicians, pharmaceutical companies, and mental health activists to put forth new images of mental illness and mental health care are now having a degree of success in the arena of popular culture.

AB  - Proponents of biotechnology argue that citizens' opposition to innovations such as genetically modified (GM) foods is rooted in emotionalism, media and nongovernmental organizations' distortions of good science, and scientific ignorance. Critics charge that this "risk management discursive" is too reductionist, exaggerates scientific capacity, inappropriately privileges scientific values over social and political values, and inaccurately captures how citizens evaluate biotechnology. This article uses ordered logit analysis applied to the responses of Europeans to a 2005 Eurobarometer survey to test the validity of these competing perspectives in the area of GM foods. Our analysis supports the arguments of those calling for the inclusion of broader discursive social, political, and cultural elements in deliberations over GM foods. Analysis also shows that citizens are less emotional in evaluating GM foods than proponents claim and supports this "new politics of knowledge" perspective, but citizens also cling more tightly to hopes that science can resolve debates with objective analysis.

AB  - This essay examines the early career, up to 1960, of the Jewish-American filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, covering his first five features as well as his short films, his unrealised projects and also, very briefly, his initial work as a photojournalist. With detailed references to Fear and Desire (1953), Paths of Glory (1957) and The German Lieutenant (a script that came close to production in 1959), it discusses Kubrick's strong interest in twentieth-century German and Austrian culture and history, his 'procedural' approach to stories about World Wars I and II, and the increasing internationalisation of the content and production circumstances of his work. These developments are discussed in relation to box office trends and public opinion in the United States as well as to changes in Hollywood's mode of production and key markets in the post-war era.

AB  - Objectives:
   Increasing dentists' visibility in the media to make the case for sugary beverage taxes can help advance public policy that improves oral health outcomes. We assessed California dentists' media engagement behaviors related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention and correlates of engaging in such behavior.
   Methods:
   Survey items related to sugar policies and media engagement were embedded in an electronically distributed statewide survey of dentists' tobacco cessation counseling behaviors. Descriptive statistics were calculated for respondent characteristics, perceived professional responsibility to discuss selected topics with patients, and attitudes and behaviors related to sugar restriction policy and media communication. Multivariable models identified independent correlates of media engagement.
   Results:
   Of 624 respondents, most had never talked to traditional media (78%) or posted to social media (64%) about sugar or sugar policies for dental caries prevention. Respondents with the highest level of media engagement were more likely to agree that sugary beverage taxes are effective at reducing dental caries, that they had support from dental professional organizations to talk to the media, that it is realistic for patients to reduce their sugar consumption, and that sugar and sugary drinks are extremely harmful to health.
   Conclusions:
   Efforts to increase dentists' media engagement related to sugar restriction policies for dental caries prevention should address dentists' negative attitudes toward the effectiveness of sugar restriction policies and may require increased support from dental professional societies.
   Knowledge Transfer Statement:
   Study findings identify dentists' low engagement in media advocacy to support sugar restriction policy adoption. The results identify correlates of media engagement and of dentists' willingness and confidence to act, which could serve to inform interventions to support and enhance engagement.

AB  - This paper presents an analysis of interviews of participants in a political manifestation in Indonesia about the reasons for the rally and the resulting riot. The rally was held in the middle of the Jakarta gubernatorial election, against a non-Muslim incumbent who was accused of having insulted the Quran. We argue that there is a deep relationship between social identities and religion, which has implications for societal togetherness and political freedom. Using a snowball technique, we interviewed 16 Muslims who had participated in this rally. The findings suggest that 1) even though the rally was held in the middle of an election, the demonstrators denied that the rally was politically motivated; 2) Those demonstrators who thought that intruders had infiltrated the rally, maintained that the intruders are to be held responsible for any violence, but not the 'actual' participants. 3) Interviewees claimed that their actions were not motivated by anti-Chinese prejudice, although traces of racist thinking can be found in their statements. The findings are discussed before the background of social representations, social identity, theories of collective action, and the black sheep effect.

AB  - Research on de-radicalisation has been primarily concerned with the efficacy of de-radicalisation programmes and their negative consequences. However, there has been little research on how the public perceives de-radicalisation programmes and whether they are viewed as effective or desirable. It is important to understand public attitudes to de-radicalisation programmes because public opinion can affect the capacity to deliver the programmes. The following article takes a first step towards understanding these issues by examining how The Daily Mail has framed de-radicalisation in terms of whether or not the programmes are effective or desirable. We argue that an assumption of potential efficacy exists throughout the newspaper's framing of de-radicalisation which presents the policy as desirable, despite also framing de-radicalisation as ineffective. While practitioners are reluctant to promote de-radicalisation programmes, The Daily Mail's framing of de-radicalisation as natural, logical and desirable reflects the concept's ideological flexibility as both a rehabilitative and normative endeavour.

AB  - This article utilizes data from the Latino National Survey (2006) to analyze temporal and spatial variation in the effects of the immigrant rights marches in 2006 on Latino attitudes towards trust in government and self-efficacy. Using a unique protest dataset, we examine the effects of proximity and scale by mapping respondents' specific geographic location against the location of the marches as well as size of the protests using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). We find that local proximity to small marches had a positive impact on feelings of efficacy, whereas large-scale protests led to lower feelings of efficacy. The results shed light on the role localized political events can play in shaping feelings towards government, the importance of conceptions of space and time to the study of social movements, and the positive outcomes that can result from contentious politics.

AB  - Understanding the formation of prejudice, stereotypes, and discrimination has long been a core topic of social psychology. Since the seminal theorizing by Allport in 1954, different views on childhood origins of prejudice have been discussed, in which the role of parental socialization varies on a scale from fundamental to negligible. This meta-analysis integrates the available empirical evidence of the past 60 years and critically discusses the current state of knowledge on parental socialization of intergroup attitudes. A random-effects model analysis of data from 131 studies on over 45,000 parent-child dyads indicated a significant medium-sized average effect size for the correlation between parental and child intergroup attitudes. The average effect size was related to study-specific variables, such as the source of parental attitude report (self vs. child reported), the conceptual overlap between measures, and the privacy of assessment. We also found significant moderations by ingroup status and size as well as child age. The latter was, however, mediated by measurement overlap. No significant effect size differences were found in relation to different components of intergroup attitudes (i.e., affective, cognitive, behavioral), nor to child or parent gender. The results unequivocally demonstrate that parent-child attitudes are related throughout childhood and adolescence. We discuss in detail whether and to what extent this interrelation can be interpreted as an indicator of parent-child socialization to allow a critical evaluation of the available contradicting theories. We furthermore address limitations of the available research and the current meta-analysis and derive implications and suggestions for future research.

AB  - This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

AB  - This study aims to explore and discuss how Greek news media Twitter accounts reported and framed grassroots protest/support activities of the anti-austerity camp and the pro-"Europe" camp, and their protagonists, grievances, and demands in the days before and after the July 2015 bailout referendum. The Greek referendum offers a special case to study the protest paradigm in complex, hybrid and polarized protest arenas, where two opposing protest camps mobilize massively to achieve their political aims. In total, 1,999 media tweets with references to grassroots protest/support activities and public opinion/citizens' behavior in relation to the referendum were analyzed using content analysis processes and framing devices. Results show significant differences in frame coverage depending on the protest cycle challenging the protest paradigm, while the media emphasis on high-profile sources confirms key features of this paradigm.

AB  - Political interest is one of the most important individual-level predictors of news media use, public opinion formation, and engagement. When, how, and why some citizens develop a strong interest in politics is, however, less clear. This study analyzes the development of political interest during the formative years of adolescence, using a five-wave panel study among Swedish adolescents, covering a period of 4 years. Based on the citizen communication mediation model, we analyze how interest in political and current affairs news among family and friends influence adolescents' political interest. Taken together, while the findings lend support for several of the hypotheses, mechanisms, and processes derived from the communication mediation model, parents appear more important than peers when it comes to shaping adolescents' political interest.

AB  - In Canada, Atlantic salmon (S. salar) aquaculture has been growing rapidly and is consistently being promoted for its potential to support economic growth and employment opportunities, particularly in rural communities. However, salmon aquaculture is a controversial topic, making acquiring and maintaining social acceptance an enduring challenge. The factors that drive the acceptability of aquaculture by neighbouring communities and wider society are poorly understood and are influenced by local settings. This research investigated how salmon aquaculture has been portrayed in the media in Atlantic Canada over a 15-year time frame to explore potential factors influencing the social acceptability of salmon aquaculture in Atlantic Canada. Results highlight that perceived environmental risks were major factors influencing the portrayal of aquaculture by the media, while social and economic risks to local communities were also prominent. Comparing regions found differences in the tone in which aquaculture was portrayed, despite little difference in the topics discussed in the media. These findings suggest that acceptance may be affected by the age of the industry as areas with a longer history of aquaculture encounter less negative media. These findings may help bring to light the most relevant and prominent concerns that drive social acceptance of salmon aquaculture in Atlantic Canada, and how the surrounding communities may be affected by such government policies and decisions.

AB  - Feminists have frequently accused media outlets of not giving them enough coverage and/or portraying them negatively. Conversely, conservative women have argued that media suffer from liberal biases. While some studies have addressed the larger question of media and ideological prejudices, none have examined how media report women's activism in comparative terms. Since feminist and conservative women's organizations vie with one another over who represents women's interests, how media portray them has implications for how well they achieve this goal. Using data gathered from four major national newspapers, this study analyzes how print journalists depict feminist and conservative women's activism over a 14-year span. In so doing, it provides information about frequency of media coverage, as well as how advocates are labeled, on which issues they are getting visibility, and whether or not media present feminist and conservative women's organizations as being in direct conflict with each other. Implications for understanding women's political efforts, broadly speaking, are also explored.

AB  - This paper seeks to contribute to the analysis of the German-language media texts on school and university theme that came out in Germany during the period of the sound film birth till the end of the World War II using the comparative hermeneutic analysis. Analysis of the data demonstrates that the film authors in the period of Weimar Republic denounced the Prussian system of education. In the films of the national-socialist period, the main goal of national political education was not to help students accumulate academic knowledge, but to shape a national-socialist worldview. Weimar Republic films accentuated rebellious mood of the youth, encouraged mutinous acts against rules set by the insensitive world of adults. The films of Hitler's Germany formed the comradeship image as a moral value, some important outlook elements also included collectivism, honesty, service, and obedience.
   In teacher-student relationship in German films of the considered period from 1929 to 1945, relations between the state and the citizen are clearly outlined. The teacher acts in the interests of the state, on behalf of the political leadership. School is not a space out of politics, on the contrary, it is a place where the socio-political views of the corresponding epoch are projected and crystallized. National-socialist cinema widely used the technique of transcoding elements, borrowed in the films of the Weimar Republic and were often based on historical falsifications. The films did not reflect the actual realities of the school life of the Third Reich, but rather the desired, most appropriate from the point of view of the national-socialist doctrine of education and training.

AB  - This study examines how political cynicism and social media communications moderate the spillover effects of political scandals, that is, the extent to which a scandal surrounding one political figure may influence people's attitudes toward other political objects. Theoretically, spillover effects are understood as grounded in how people understand the interconnections among politicians and institutions. Analysis of a representative survey in Hong Kong documents the presence of spillover effects of scandals surrounding the Chief Executive of the government. The findings also illustrate the moderating role of political cynicism and, to a lesser extent, political communications via social media.

AB  - This study investigates the cross-media repertoires of news consumption of young adults in today's fragmented multi-media environment, and examines the interactions between those repertoires and the consumers' civic engagement and political participation. By using a Q-sort method, the respondents were asked to sort a number of elicitation cards on a relational scalar grid, which allowed for subsequent statistical factor analysis of these qualitative data and the generation of a sub-typology of media consumption repertoires as well as the discursive practices of the respondents. We also used a questionnaire which included questions about news consumption, political participation, and civic engagement. The findings revealed that most young adults used repertoires of digital and new media news consumption. The interviewees were highly conscious of their choices of news sources, and some young adults explicitly stated that they preferred to consume news from sources which reflected their own political views. In this study we were able to map news media repertoires of young adults in Israel and found that young adults do participate, and are largely involved, in activism and protests.

AB  - Background: Public attitudes and stigma toward epilepsy may limit people with epilepsy (PWE) in seeking treatment and participating in social activities. The prevalence of epilepsy is approximately 0.8% in Japan, similar to rates reported in other countries. Although epilepsy is relatively common, few studies have investigated public awareness about epilepsy in Japan. Recently, several serious car accidents in Japan involving PWE resulted in pedestrian fatalities. Traffic accidents involving PWE have been reported extensively and repeatedly in the media since 2011. In 2013 and 2017, our research group conducted a large investigation of awareness about epilepsy targeting the general public. Previous studies have reported that knowledge is one of the factors involved in improving attitudes and reducing stigma. The aim of the current study was to compare survey results, especially regarding knowledge of epilepsy, and capture changes in public awareness between 2013 and 2017.
   Methods: A total of 2160 people (1080 in each year) participated, with a total of 540 women in each year, aged 20-79 years. Participants lived in the greater Tokyo area as well as the Tohoku and Kansai regions of Japan. All participants answered survey questions online in January 2013 and April 2017. We analyzed five questions regarding the participants' demographic data, nine questions regarding knowledge about epilepsy, and five questions regarding experiences with epilepsy. For questions investigating the respondents' knowledge about epilepsy, we counted only the correct answers and scored these for each respondent.
   Results: Knowledge scores decreased from 2013 to 2017, demonstrated by statistical analysis. However, the effect size was very small. Knowledge scores among the following groups were higher in both 2013 and 2017: people who had read or heard about epilepsy, those who had witnessed people having an epileptic seizure, people who had acquaintances who were PWE, those who had PWE in their family, and people who had studied medicine or worked in a medical profession.
   Conclusion: We revealed that participants who had some experience with epilepsy had higher knowledge levels in both 2013 and 2017. This suggests that such experiences could be important for motivating people to seek appropriate and accurate knowledge about epilepsy, and could result in a reduction of stigma. Greater awareness is needed among the general public in Japan about various aspects of epilepsy. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Research has provided compelling evidence on the influence of issue involvement to mobilize individuals for collective action, but none has examined the social psychological factors linking issue involvement to such outcomes or how the process affects issue-based mobilization attempts by ideologically opposing groups on social media. To fill these gaps, the current study evaluated a mediated pathway model testing the influence of personal issue involvement via individual-group identification, perceived self-network issue opinion congruity, and perceived participative efficacy on expressive support for and against the LGBTQ issue on Facebook. Strong explanation for expressive support outcomes (commenting, 'liking,' 'sharing') between both groups, 90.1% (supporters of LGBTQ) and 74.9% (non-supporters of LGBTQ), was retrieved. Group identification is a robust mediator of issue involvement, predicting expressive support irrespective of users' attitude toward the issue. Perceived participative efficacy is the strongest predictor of support expression, but, like perceived self-network opinion congruity, vary between users with different issue attitudes and involvement. Findings suggest an intricate social media-based micromobilization process that needs to consider issue-group positions and counter-group dynamics.

AB  - Politics in the current era are replete with unreliable media stories which lack evidence, sometimes disparagingly dubbed "fake news". A survey on a sample of Muslims in Indonesia (N = 518) in this work found that participants' endorsement of collective action in of support issues with little to no empirical evidence (i.e., post-truth collective action) increased as a function of their belief in fake news and prejudice against the outgroup (i.e., non-Muslims). Belief in fake news stemmed from participants' generic and specific conspiratorial thinking, whereas prejudice was positively predicted by relative Muslim prototypicality, denoting how much Muslims in Indonesia view that their group is more representative than non-Muslims of the superordinate Indonesian identity that encompasses both groups. Additionally, our findings revealed that generic conspiratorial thinking and relative Muslim prototypicality were positively predicted by collective narcissism, which in turn spurred participants' support for collective action by augmenting belief in fake news.

AB  - Surrogacy is beginning to generate public debate, and the way the media approach it may have negative effects on social attitudes toward gay parenting. The news media play a key role in informing society, especially about topics such as surrogacy, of which most audiences have no direct experience. The aim of our research is to explore opinion formation of surrogacy and gay parenting by analyzing the audience interpretation of a TV news story in Spain. To do this we conducted four focus groups that were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis based on the discourse produced by the participants. The results show that the framing strategies used in the news story contribute to advocating an attitude of repudiation toward surrogacy, with an adverse sentiment also extending to homosexual couples who wish to become parents. This leads us to discuss the role of media in shaping public opinion and the resulting potential consequences in the case of surrogacy and gay parenting.

AB  - Terrorist attacks have the capacity to threaten our beliefs about the world, cause distress across populations and promote discrimination towards particular groups. We examined the impact of two different types of attacks in the same city and same year on psychological distress and probable post-traumatic stress symptoms, and the moderating effects of religion or media use on distress/post-traumatic symptoms and inter-group relations. Two panel surveys four weeks after the January 2015 Charlie Hebdo attack (N = 1981) and the November 2015 Bataclan concert hall/restaurant attacks (N = 1878), measured intrinsic religiosity, social and traditional media use, psychological distress (K6), probable posttraumatic stress symptoms (proposed ICD-11), symbolic racism and willingness to interact with Muslims by non-Muslims. Prevalence of serious mental illness (K6 score > 18) was higher after November 2015 attacks (7.0% after the first attack, 10.2% the second, chi 2 (1) = 5.67, p < 0.02), as were probable posttraumatic stress symptoms (11.9% vs. 14.1%; chi 2 (1) = 4.15, p < 0.04). In structural equation analyses, sex, age, geographic proximity, media use and religiosity were associated with distress, as was the interaction between event and religiosity. Distress was then associated with racism symbolism and willingness to interact with Muslims. Implications are considered for managing psychological trauma across populations, and protecting inter-group harmony. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although popular music and politics have been linked in various contexts, surprisingly little is known about whether and how popular songs can influence political attitudes. The present study provides initial empirical evidence that popular music affects public opinion by altering the standards for subsequent political judgments. Using an experiment of a national sample, the current study demonstrates that Lady Gaga's highly popularized song, "Born This Way," primes genetic explanations of homosexuality in citizens' ensuing evaluations of gay rights issues. The findings revealed that vocalized lyrics are the key element of the priming effect among other musical components.

AB  - Environmental protection is presumed to damper economic growth and media accounts of resource extraction often portray trade-offs between jobs and the environment. However, there is limited evidence that environmental protection universally costs jobs and heavily polluting industries provide few jobs in comparison to environmental impacts. Therefore, how has media discourse contributed to the taken-for-granted division between the economy and the environment? This paper uses the Keystone XL pipeline controversy as a case of the symbolical conflict between supporters of growth and conservation to explore the role of ideology and power in media discourse. I use frame analysis of newspaper articles to explore the representations of labor and the environment and how hegemonic ideology legitimizes resource extraction. My analysis reveals binary framing that constructed the pipeline as a political controversy over the trade-off between the environment and the economy, which made conflict between workers and environmentalists sensible, and silenced alternatives.

AB  - Canada is the only developed country that has established universal coverage for hospital care and physician services that excludes medically necessary prescription drugs. Lack of public interest in expanding universal coverage to prescription medicines may be one critical factor in explaining this policy puzzle. Historical levels and patterns of attention to financing issues in the media may have implications for public awareness and support for such major health reform. We thus examined the quantity, context, and patterns of coverage of public drug financing in national print media in Canada from 1990 to 2010. We conducted a time series analysis of monthly newspaper article counts to quantify trends in coverage and analyzed article content by applying Down's theory of the "issue-attention cycle" of political attention. We found that baseline coverage of this issue was low throughout the past twenty years with few cycles of increased attention, initiated by focusing events related to general health reform. Issue-attention cycles were driven by coverage of proposed policy solutions simultaneously accompanied by lower levels of coverage of policy problems and barriers to change, before fading rapidly from attention. The observed patterns of media coverage and the intrinsic characteristics of this policy issue suggest that any momentum for reform (or lack thereof) is likely to be driven by elite members of the policy community rather than by way of public engagement. This has implications for the probability of reform and which options may be considered or eventually implemented, as policies developed within elite policy communities may tend to reflect niche interests rather than being reflective of principled policy goals.

AB  - The power of social media may be best captured in high-profile criminal cases where the court of public opinion can comment, often anonymously, and instantly re-share case information. In a poignant example of how social media can generate national and international attention on criminal behavior, this research explores the 2012 Steubenville, Ohio sexual assault case. Using qualitative textual analysis, news articles and social media content were coded for to assess how existing rape myth narratives were depicted in the Steubenville case. Emphasis is placed on how reporting and social media responses characterized the victim, perpetrators, and the rape itself. The study found that depictions included both legitimizing rape myths and subverting myths through social media and news coverage. Implications for how social media materials were used as evidence in the Steubenville case are also discussed.

AB  - This paper presents a critical account of the representation of immigration in the Brexit corpus-a collective corpus of 108,452,923 words compiled mostly from blogs, tweets, and daily news related to Brexit debate. The study follows the methodological synergy approach proposed by Baker et al. (2008), a heuristic methodological approach that combines methods of discourse analysis and corpus-assisted statistical tools including keyword, collocation, and concordance analysis. Drawing on this methodological synergy approach, the investigation yields significant findings contextualized within the socio-economic-political context of the European Union (EU) leave referendum to trace how the issue of immigration is represented in the discourses of the Remain and Leave campaigns. The frequency results show that immigration is one of the most salient topics in the Brexit corpus. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants and collocation investigation of the word immigration reveal opposing attitudes toward immigration in the EU referendum debate. The analysis uncovers negative attitudes toward the uncontrolled flow of immigrants from other EU countries and public concerns about immigrants' negative impacts on wages, education, and health services. Other findings reveal positive attitudes toward immigrants emphasizing their positive contributions to the UK economy. The study concludes with an argument of the significant association between the political and socio-economic ideologies of a particular society and the language communicated in its media.

AB  - We study media representations of Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In particular, we train models of semantic memory on a large number of news media outlets that published online articles during the course of the election. Based on the structure of word co-occurrence in these media outlets, our models learn semantic representations for the two presidential candidates as well as for widely studied personality traits. We find that models trained on media outlets most read by Clinton voters and media outlets most read by Trump voters differ in the strength of association between the two candidates' names and trait words pertaining to morality. We observe some differences for trait words pertaining to warmth, but none for trait words pertaining to competence.

AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia - a stand-up comedian and a politician - this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu's daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings.

AB  - Muslim communities have frequently been the victim of vilification and discrimination in Australia and the broader Asian region. This article discusses and compares the narratives around Muslim vilification in Australia and Sri Lanka. Despite the fact that these two nations are vastly different in size, demographics and cultural history, I will argue that there are remarkable similarities in how Muslims are subject to attack in both nations. The hate speech occasioned against Muslims in Sri Lanka and Australia is shaped by almost identical narrative structures and is cultivated in similar online environments. In both cases, anti-Muslim animus is fuelled by a fear of displacement and perceived contamination of what nativists regard as ethnically sovereign territory. I will argue that the underlying sub-text in both cases is owed to a repulsion to the physical presence of Muslims which can be understood in terms of Mary Douglas' concept of the moral pollutant.

AB  - Purpose of the Study: Newspapers are an important source of information. The discourses within the media can influence public attitudes and support or discourage stereotypical portrayals of older individuals. This study critically examined discourses within a Canadian newspaper in terms of stereotypical depictions of age-related health conditions and assistive technology devices (ATDs).
   Design and Methods: Four years (2009-2013) of Globe and Mail articles were searched for terms relevant to the research question. A total of 65 articles were retained, and a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the texts was conducted. The articles were coded for stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions and ATDs, consequences of the stereotyping, and context (overall setting or background) of the discourse.
   Results: The primary code list included 4 contexts, 13 stereotypes, and 9 consequences of stereotyping. CDA revealed discourses relating to (a) maintaining autonomy in a stereotypical world, (b) ATDs as obstacles in employment, (c) barriers to help seeking for age-related conditions, and (d) people in power setting the stage for discrimination.
   Implications: Our findings indicate that discourses in the Canadian media include stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions. Further, depictions of health conditions and ATDs may exacerbate existing stereotypes about older individuals, limit the options available to them, lead to a reduction in help seeking, and lower ATD use. Education about the realities of age-related health changes and ATDs is needed in order to diminish stereotypes and encourage ATD uptake and use.

AB  - Background: Mass media such as newspapers and TV news affect mental health-related stigma. In Japan, the name of schizophrenia was changed in 2002 for the purposes of stigma reduction; however, little has been known about the effect of name change of schizophrenia on mass media. Method: Articles including old and new names of schizophrenia, depressive disorder, and diabetes mellitus (DM) in headlines and/or text were extracted from 23 169 092 articles in 4 major Japanese newspapers and 1 TV news program (1985-2013). The trajectory of the number of articles including each term was determined across years. Then, all text in news headlines was segmented as per part-of-speech level using text data mining. Segmented words were classified into 6 categories and in each category of extracted words by target term and period were also tested. Results: Total 51 789 and 1106 articles including target terms in newspaper articles and TV news segments were obtained, respectively. The number of articles including the target terms increased across years. Relative increase was observed in the articles published on schizophrenia since 2003 compared with those on DM and between 2000 and 2005 compared with those on depressive disorder. Word tendency used in headlines was equivalent before and after 2002 for the articles including each target term. Articles for schizophrenia contained more negative words than depressive disorder and DM (31.5%, 16.0%, and 8.2%, respectively). Conclusions: Name change of schizophrenia had a limited effect on the articles published and little effect on its contents.

AB  - Despite being rated as some of the world's most gender equal countries, Sweden and neighboring Nordic nations show high rates of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). As the news media contribute to the shaping of public attitudes, this article pursues a two-step discourse analysis of how IPVAW was represented in seven Swedish newspapers during 2018. Although an individualistic discourse on IPVAW was found to be most prevalent, articles where perpetrators were presented as non-Swedish more frequently contained a structural framing of IPVAW. This confirms previously noted tendencies toward individualization and othering of IPVAW in Sweden.

AB  - Political communication is the process of putting information, technology, and media in the service of power. Increasingly, political actors are automating such processes, through algorithms that obscure motives and authors yet reach immense networks of people through personal ties among friends and family. Not all political algorithms are used for manipulation and social control however. So what are the primary ways in which algorithmic political communication-organized by automated scripts on social media-may undermine elections in democracies? In the US context, what specific elements of communication policy or election law might regulate the behavior of such "bots," or the political actors who employ them? First, we describe computational propaganda and define political bots as automated scripts designed to manipulate public opinion. Second, we illustrate how political bots have been used to manipulate public opinion and explain how algorithms are an important new domain of analysis for scholars of political communication. Finally, we demonstrate how political bots are likely to interfere with political communication in the United States by allowing surreptitious campaign coordination, illegally soliciting either contributions or votes, or violating rules on disclosure.

AB  - Although mask-wearing can curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and protect others, the attitudes and behaviors regarding wearing a mask during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to differ between partisan groups. This study aimed to investigate whether wearing a mask in public can be elicited by uplifting media messages through increasing universal orientation and prosocial motivation. In addition, we tested whether uplifting videos focusing on patriotic American values (e.g., the flag, military) moderated partisan differences related to both feelings of inspiration and an individual's attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding mask-wearing. Participants (N = 446) were exposed to an uplifting video devoid of patriotic messages, an uplifting video featuring patriotic messages, or a control video. Results showed that both Democrats and Republicans found both uplifting videos inspiring, leading to greater universal orientations and prosocial motivations. Universal orientations were associated with more favorable attitudes and behavioral intentions regarding mask use among Republicans, and prosocial motivations lead to more favorable attitudes among members of both parties.
   Public Policy Relevance Statement An online experiment examined if uplifting videos that did or did not feature patriotic themes would lead to more favorable attitudes about wearing masks to curtail the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic among Democrats and Republicans. The results showed that both types of uplifting videos led to heightened feelings of connectedness with others and with prosocial motivations. These responses, in turn, were associated with more favorable attitudes about wearing masks.

AB  - The human psyche is profoundly shaped by its cultural milieu; however, few studies have examined the dynamics of cultural influence in everyday life, especially when it comes to shaping people's automatic, implicit attitudes. In this quasi-experimental field study, we investigated the effect of transient, but salient, cultural messages-the pop-cultural phenomenon of celebrity "fat-shaming"-on implicit anti-fat attitudes in the population. Adopting the "copycat suicide" methodology, we identified 20 fat-shaming events in the media; next, we obtained data from Project Implicit of participants who had completed the Weight Implicit Association Test from 2004 to 2015. As predicted, fat-shaming led to a spike in women's (N=93,239) implicit anti-fat attitudes, with events of greater notoriety producing greater spikes. We also observed a general increase in implicit anti-fat attitudes over time. Although these passing comments may appear harmless, we show that feedback at the cultural level can be registered by the "body politic."

AB  - In this paper, we analysed Hillary Clinton's relationship with the media starting from her first appointment at a US First Lady to her being the Democratic nominee for the US presidential elections in 2016. Thus, we analysed academic literature demonstrating Clinton's problems with the media bias, and then added our own discourse analysis of articles on Clinton and feminism in two main national newspapers that have consistently demonstrated the power of setting the agenda and forming public opinion in the U.S. - The Washington Post and The New York Times. Discourse analysis has been used to analyse 20 selected articles that discussed Clinton's feminist views in a period from September 2015 until September 2016, which was also a campaign period for 2016 U.S. elections. The findings add to the current research on the topic and show that the media undermined liberal feminism and its goals to undermine Hillary Clinton, whereas in the past Hillary was a subject of media criticism because of her refusal to fit into expected roles and be a supportive wife only. The discourse of criticism of Hillary Clinton has changed over time but every time with the same results, undermining the image and career advancement.

AB  - This study investigated parental decision making about non-parental child care programs based on the technological and quality components of the program, both child-focused and parent-focused. Child-focused variables related to children's access to technology such as computers, educational television programming, and the internet. Parent-focused variables related to parental access to observe the program via the internet, and methods of communication by teachers, as well as traditional indicators of quality such as experience and education of the caregivers and type of curriculum offered.
   The study investigated which of these variables were most influential to parents' decision-making processes when choosing programs based on hypothetical scenarios. The study sought to examine which variables emerged as most important to parents, and whether these technological variables were more important than traditional indicators of quality, such as staff education level.
   A sample of 82 parents of children between the ages of 1 and 6 years (M = 3.6) completed a questionnaire gathering demographic information, as well as information about their perceptions of their children's media usage. The questionnaire also included hypothetical scenarios created using the SPSS ORTHOPLAN procedure to examine technology related variables (both child-focused and parent-focused) and traditional quality indicators that emerged as most influential to the decision-making process when choosing a child care program.
   Using conjoint analysis, the results revealed that the child-focused technology variables that emerged as most influential to parents' decision making were educational software usage, television usage, and internet availability. In regard to parent-focused variables, conjoint analyses revealed that experience of the caregivers, type of curriculum offered, and education level of the caregivers were more influential to the decision making process than the ability to observe the program via the internet or method of communication used by the provider.
   The results provide additional support for the importance of well-trained and experienced staff in child care programs, as well as for a developmentally appropriate curriculum. These findings suggest that administrators interested in marketing early child care programs should continue to focus on these traditional indicators of quality, rather than on improving parental access to the program via technology.

AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

AB  - Electoral systems are assumed to enhance political efficacy and encourage participation through party mobilisation because they create incentives for parties (or candidates) to mobilise voters. This paper makes use of survey data collected after elections in more than 30 countries, spanning a variety of party systems in both established and new democracies, to examine how party mobilisation varies across context and what difference it makes. The results demonstrate that political efficacy and behaviour are enhanced when parties mobilise voters. This is most likely to occur in systems where parties compete in a narrow issue space. In contrast, citizens are less likely to come into contact with parties in polarised systems. This has consequences for both political attitudes and engagement.

AB  - Researchers recently have begun to examine how hostile media perceptions may promote discursive activities aimed at correcting the media's perceived negative influence. We use nationally representative survey data to test a moderated-mediation model that finds that hostile media perceptions significantly affect support for climate mitigation policies through the mediator of discussion and that the link between discussion and policy support is moderated in a three-way interaction with social network heterogeneity and political ideology. Discussion in homogeneous social networks increases opinion polarization between liberals and conservatives by intensifying conservatives' opinions, whereas discussion in heterogeneous social networks decreases polarization by moderating liberals' opinions.

AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

AB  - The homicide statistics of a popular UK television fictional crime series and the former Lothian & Borders police force region, Scotland were compared. This comparison was used to consider the implications for public attitudes which may influence the adoption of public health interventions to reduce homicide.
   217 homicides were identified by 105 perpetrators in the television series 'Midsomer Murders' between 1997 and 2011; these were compared to 55 homicides by 53 perpetrators in the regional sample between 2006 and 2011. The numbers of serial killings (p < 0.0001), planned homicides, female perpetrators (p < 0.0001), shootings (p = 0.0456) and poisonings (p = 0.0289) were higher in the fictional sample. Lothian & Borders cases were almost all single killings, mostly unplanned, with a far greater rate of homicide by kitchen knives (p < 0.0001) and hitting/kicking (p = 0.0005) by intoxicated perpetrators.
   Control of access to pointed kitchen knives by members of certain groups may reduce homicide rates.

AB  - This article undertakes a literature review on such articles on social media and citizen-centric e-government services. This research uses 139 articles to perform the intended literature review. The keywords analysis of these articles indicates that Web 2.0, participation and open government/open data were some of the frequently used keywords in addition to the two major themes of e-government and social media on which all the articles were searched for. The analysis of research methods indicated that majority of the studies were analytical, conceptual, descriptive, or theoretical in nature. The theoretical analysis however indicated that there is a lack of theory-based research in this area. The review of literature indicated that research themes such as electronic participation, engagement, transparency, communication/interaction, trust, security and collaboration are some of the most frequently used categories under this area of research. A research framework has also been proposed from the key themes emerging from the review.

AB  - The spiral of silence persists as a major explanatory mechanism in public opinion research, linking individuals' perception of the opinion climate and their likelihood of speaking out. However, how locally expressed opinions (or, remaining silent) translate into global opinion distributions and the conditions affecting such generative processes have rarely been examined. Using agent-based modeling, this study attempts to explore a boundary condition affecting opinion dynamics-the distributions of individuals' communication network size, which is affected by the widespread use of social media. The results suggest that the spiraling phenomenon on a global scale becomes more likely when enough people exist between those who have different perceptions of the opinion distribution, keeping the population from being polarized.

TI  - Absent Bodies: The AIDS Memorial Quilt as Social Melancholia
T2  - JOURNAL OF AMERICAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - Far from being apolitical, self-indulgent or ineffective, as was suggested by some in the activist community, the NAMES Project Quilt became a symbol of the decimation of AIDS and a beacon for those in the AIDS-affected community, and challenged and transformed public attitudes towards people with AIDS. The NAMES Project Quilt risked sanitizing and homogenizing the particularities of the deceased, but I shall argue that the spectacle of the quilt changed public opinion through its mechanisms of publicity and meaning-making. Building on Michael Warner's notion of the 'Mass Subject', the quilt, I will suggest, transformed the mainstream, effectively forcing the formerly abject AIDS-affected community into public consciousness through the mechanisms of mass media.

AB  - Media attention to marine plastic pollution is increasing, yet it is unclear which topics are being discussed. This paper analyses all 2019 news articles referencing marine plastics in the four leading UK online newspapers. Examining 943 articles in a structural topic model, this is the first analysis to depict what is being reported and how this varied according to political alignment (right vs. left-wing), type (broadsheet vs. tabloid), and publication date. We identified 36 topics, suggesting a large variety in the coverage, with plastic pollution ranging from the primary focus to only mentioned in passing. Greater emphasis was on explaining current issues of marine plastics, with limited reference to actionable reduction measures or producer responsibility. Many topics? prevalence varied across the media outlets. We discuss how this coverage varies across media outlets, and how it relates to a broader context (i.e. potential links to behaviour and current policy efforts).

AB  - The question of how to implement medical triages has become highly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be actively discussed. It is important to know how members of the general public think about this issue. For one, knowledge about the public's standpoint can help resolve important questions where ethical considerations are by themselves not sufficient, for instance whether the patient's age should matter. It can also help identify if more communication with the public about medical ethics is needed. We study how members of the Swiss public would allocate intensive medical care among COVID-19 patients using data from two original conjoint survey experiments conducted in Switzerland in the context of the first and second pandemic waves in 2020 (N = 1457 & N = 1450). We find that our participants would not base triage decisions on the patient's age. However, they do give much importance to the patient's behavior prior and during illness, discriminate against non-nationals, and assign only a relatively small and inconsistent role to medical considerations. Our findings suggest that there is a need for more communication with the public about the ethics of medical triage.

AB  - This article examines the peer-to-peer dynamics of Washington political journalists as Communities of Practice (CoPs) to better understand how journalists connect to and learn from each other and establish conventional knowledge. We employ inductive computational analysis that combines social network analysis of journalists' Twitter interactions with a qualitative, thematic analysis of journalists' work histories, organizational affiliations, and self-descriptions to identify nine major clusters of Beltway journalists. Among these are an elite/legacy community, a television producer community inclusive of Fox producers, and CNN, as its own self-referential community. Findings suggest Washington journalists may be operating in even smaller, more insular microbubbles than previously thought, raising additional concerns about vulnerability to groupthink and blind spots.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the degree of homogeneity versus heterogeneity of individuals' political information environments across offline and online media types and relations with sociodemographic variables, personality, and political attitudes. In two online surveys, German participants (sample 1: N = 686; sample 2: N = 702) provided information on sociodemographic variables, consumption of political news, and voting intentions, and completed the Big Five Inventory and Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) scales. Results revealed that absolutely homogeneous political news consumption was evident for a small proportion of individuals (2.04% and 0.43%). Openness (positively) and Agreeableness (negatively) exhibited significant associations with the degree of heterogeneity of political information environments across samples. No consistent patterns of relations with either the ideological attitudes of RWA and SDO or voting intentions were observed. The findings shed light on the existence of absolutely homogeneous political information environments and "who" might be prone to a more homogeneous versus more heterogeneous information environment.

AB  - The current study explores how online media framed the police shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in Cleveland, OH. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of a large sample of online news articles published in the first 48 hours following the event. In doing so, we consider how online media outlets used headlines, narrative, quotes, and images to frame this emerging story. We find that the online news media framed the shooting of Rice in ways that largely supported the official police narrative of the event. Rice was projected as a noncompliant and threatening subject and the police as reacting out of concerns for public safety. Unlike international sources, relatively few domestic news sources linked this incident to the larger issues of race and police use of force in the United States. The dominant frame promotes a moral evaluation of the event that downplays police responsibility and promotes localized, nonsystemic solutions as opposed to wide-spread policing reform.

Interactive media outperformed traditional texts in increasing levels of support for JWST construction. However, the traditional text and interactive media showed no difference in other measures of support for JWST construction. No texts increased support for NASA funding or prompted participant advocacy.

AB  - Despite significant advances in recent years, Argentina's transgender community still faces structural social exclusion. For a vast majority of transvestites and transgender women, early expulsion from the family home and the educational system results in having to resort to prostitution as their only option for surviving. Police edicts and other similar devices are used to penalize prostitution and persecute transgender people in public places, showing that prejudice and violence against their identities also manifest in the control of urban space. Here I present the results of an in-depth qualitative linguistic analysis of a 2018 television news report about the temporary relocation of the transgender sex workers from their usual location in the Bosques de Palermo, the biggest public park in the City of Buenos Aires. The theoretical frame is Critical Discourse Analysis and the methodology is inductive and qualitative. The analysis centers on the linguistic resources that define the socio-discursive representation about the transgender sex workers in relation with urban space and the city's government. The bases of the analysis are the Synchronic-Diachronic Method for the Linguistic Analysis of Texts and the Method of Converging Linguistic Approaches. These methods revealed, in the first place, that the transvestites and transgender women are represented as mere occupants of public space through their close association with the discursive category of Space. In the second place, they are represented as fundamentally passive in relation to the Government of the City of Buenos Aires; while, at the same time, the government's responsibility for their displacement is systematically mitigated. Finally, the lack of work alternatives to prostitution for the transgender community is naturalized through the persistent association of the discursive categories connected with transgender people, prostitution and urban space. If we compare these results with those of previous research, we can see that these discursive features-none of which challenge the status quo-remain one of the basic components of the socio-discursive representation of transgender people elaborated by the mainstream media.

AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

TI  - The war of the 60 stamps: the battle for public opinion - how the Nakba influenced Jordanian postage stamps
T2  - BRITISH JOURNAL OF MIDDLE EASTERN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - In December 1969, the Jordanian government issued an unusually large set of postage stamps, containing 60 stamps. The issue commemorated two closely related experiences, which together form one of the most politically sensitive topics in Jordanian history: the memory of the defeat in the 1948 war against Israel and the problem of Palestinian refugees, hundreds of thousands of whom fled to Jordan during the war, following which the term Nakba (e.g. catastrophe) was coined, denoting the disaster that the Palestinians experienced. Commemorative postage stamps are a multi-faceted means and vehicles through which governments may utilize the state-owned this mass media for propaganda purposes. This study attempts to analyse the stamps, within the context of the historic period of the issue, and their articulation within the complex trilateral relations between Jordan, the Palestinians and Israel.

AB  - This study explored the impact of advertisements featuring individuals either with or without a physical disability on attitudes towards sexuality and disability. In addition, the authors sought to determine whether there is a relationship between these attitudes and endorsement of traditional versus egalitarian gender role beliefs. A total of 707 online participants completed the Gender Role Belief Scale, then rated a series of ads featuring individuals with or without a disability (or served as a no ad control), and completed the Attitudes toward Sexuality Questionnaire and Perceptions of Sexuality Scale. Results demonstrated a complex relationship between gender role beliefs and exposure to advertisements on attitudes towards the sexuality of women and men with physical disabilities. As hypothesized, the endorsement of traditional gender role beliefs was related to more negative attitudes towards the sexuality of women with physical disabilities.

AB  - How do citizens in authoritarian states feel about their leaders? While some dictators rule through terror, others seem genuinely popular. Using the Gallup World Poll's panel of more than one hundred-forty countries in 2006-2016, the authors show that the drivers of political approval differ across regime types. Although brutal repression in overt dictatorships could cause respondents to falsify their preferences, in milder informational autocracies, greater repression actually predicts lower approval. In autocracies as in democracies, economic performance matters and citizens' economic perceptions, while not perfectly accurate, track objective indicators. Dictators also benefit from greater perceived public safety, but the authors find no such effect in democracies. Covert censorship of the media and the Internet is associated with higher approval in autocracies-in particular, in informational ones-but ratings fall when citizens recognize censorship. In informational autocracies, executive elections trigger a ratings surge if there is leader turnover, but, unlike in democracies, reelected autocrats enjoy little honeymoon.

KW  - IMPACT
AB  - Objective: To examine how video messages from a recent media campaign affected public attitudes about obesity prevention and weight-based stigma toward obese children.
   Design and Methods: A survey-embedded experiment in May-June 2012 with nationally representative sample (N = 1,677) was conducted. Participants were randomized to view one of three messages of children recounting struggles with obesity, or to a control group. It was examined whether message exposure affected attitudes about: 1) the seriousness of childhood obesity and its consequences; 2) responsibility for addressing obesity; 3) support for prevention policies, and 4) stigma toward obese children.
   Results: Participants viewing the messages attributed greater responsibility for addressing childhood obesity to the food and beverage industry, schools, and the government, compared to those in the control group. Overweight and female respondents viewing the messages reported lower weight-based stigma compared with overweight and female respondents in the control group, but messages had no effect on healthy weight and male respondents. Messages did not affect attitudes about the seriousness of childhood obesity, its consequences, or support for obesity prevention policies.
   Conclusions: It will be critical to assess on an ongoing basis how communication campaigns addressing childhood obesity shape public attitudes about obesity prevention.

AB  - Objective: The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of nonstigmatizing visual portrayals of obesity on support for a discriminatory weight-based medical policy. Method: Participants read an online news story about a policy to deny fertility treatment to obese women that was accompanied by a nonstigmatizing, stigmatizing, or no image of an obese couple. A balanced discussion of the policy was presented, with information both questioning the policy as discriminatory and supporting the policy because of weight-related medical complications. Results: Results revealed that participants who viewed the nonstigmatizing image were less supportive of the policy to deny obese women fertility treatment and recommended the policy less strongly than participants who viewed the stigmatizing image. Furthermore, weaker perceptions of medical risk mediated the effect of the nonstigmatizing image on policy ratings. Conclusion: The findings indicate that simply eliminating stigmatizing media portrayals of obesity may help reduce bias.

AB  - In many Arab countries, political and media discourse about the rise of the Islamic State (ISIS) tended to blend discussions of root causes with conspiratorial narratives about the perceived malign actions and motives of external actors. Investigating the role which conspiratorial narratives play in (de)stabilizing political order across the Arab world, this analysis demonstrates that distrust in the political system and support for Islamist ideas are associated with the willingness to blame external actors such as the United States and Israel for the creation of the Islamic State. The results thus demonstrate how closely intertwined the production and spread of conspiracy theories are with the crisis of Islamist ideology and authoritarian governance in the Arab world.

AB  - Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of politicians' parental status on candidate viability. Building on the concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates' parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates' spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using 2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of such portrayals for establishing candidates' relatability and electoral viability.

AB  - This study employs the cognitive miser model and science literacy model as theoretical frameworks to investigate motivations behind public willingness to use driverless cars in Singapore. Findings from a large-scale survey of 1,006 adult Singaporeans indicate that public willingness to use driverless cars was strongly related to value predispositions, especially affect. Aside from having a direct relationship with willingness to use driverless cars, this study found that affect also had an indirect relationship with willingness to use driverless cars via benefit perceptions. Meanwhile, findings failed to reveal significant relationships between two types of science knowledge and willingness to use driverless cars. The findings shed light on the current public opinion on driverless cars in Singapore and lend support to the cognitive miser model over the scientific literacy model. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the development of social networks, the complexity of the factors affecting the users' information dissemination is increasing and the complexity of online social networks and influencing factors of individual behaviors and attitudes make the development of online public opinion present a dynamic, complex, and multifactor evolution. Analyzing the influencing factors of public opinion dissemination is conducive to optimize company management and information diffusion management. However, there has been no comprehensive analysis of the complex factors that influence the dissemination of information; this study focused on synthesizing 20 empirical studies on the influencing factors of China public opinion dissemination from the perspective of the user, and a meta-analysis was conducted. We establish the influencing factors of users' information adoption model from three aspects of information source reliability, perceived information quality, and the heat of public opinion events based on elaboration likelihood model. The results indicated that the main influencing factors of public opinion communication are authority, reliability, quality of information form, quality of information editing, quality of information utility, and event attendance preference. Among the factors, authority and quality of information editing have more significant impacts on users' information adoption behavior in the dissemination of public opinion. In addition, whether the type of event was a public emergency had a moderating effect. The results are helpful to explore the universality of the influencing factors so as to help related regulators better build a multiangle supervision mechanism and conduct early warning of information diffusion.

AB  - Direct potable water recycling (DPR) is increasingly recognized as an important strategy in the face of water shortage. DPR often is challenged by a lack of public support and in some cases has been overturned by public opposition alone. Severe drought in Texas in recent years has resulted in several cities in that state considering and passing DPR policies for the first time in the United States. We present three case studies-two from cities that passed and implemented DPR policies and one that considered and ultimately tabled a DPR plan. We use multiple data sources including public surveys and policy maker interviews, newspaper articles, and city meeting minutes to examine the discourse on these policies in public, media, and political spheres. Importantly, we explore the connection between regulatory, structural, environmental, political, and communication factors in each case as they intersect with public attitudes, including expressions of disgust and perceived risk which have featured in experimental research on perceptions of water recycling. By exploring these factors holistically, we are able to examine some of the ways these public attitudinal factors interact in real-world contexts with implications for future policy making and studies of local decision-making under uncertainty.

AB  - Messaging about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has seemingly produced a variety of outcomes: millions of Americans gained access to health insurance, yet much of the US public remains confused about major components of the law, and there remain stark and persistent political divides in support of the law. Our analysis of the volume and content of ACA-related media (including both ads and news) helps explain these phenomena, with three conclusions. First, the information environment around the ACA has been complex and competitive, with messaging originating from diverse sponsors with multiple objectives. Second, partisan cues in news and political ads are abundant, likely contributing to the crystallized politically polarized opinion about the law. Third, partisan discussions of the ACA in political ads have shifted in volume, direction, and tone over the decade, presenting divergent views regarding which party is accountable for the law's successes (or failures). We offer evidence for each of these conclusions from longitudinal analyses of the volume and content of ACA messaging, also referencing studies that have linked these messages to attitudes and behavior. We conclude with implications for health communication, political science, and the future outlook for health reform.

AB  - Recent mass shootings by persons seemingly afflicted with serious mental illness (SMI) have received extensive news media coverage and prompted national dialogue about the causes of, and policy responses to, mass shootings. News media framing of SMI as a cause of gun violence may influence public attitudes about persons with SMI and support for gun violence prevention proposals. We analyzed the content of a 25% random sample of news stories on SMI and gun violence published in 14 national and regional news sources from 1997 to 2012. Across the study period, most news coverage occurred in the wake of mass shootings, and "dangerous people" with SMI were more likely than "dangerous weapons" to be mentioned as a cause of gun violence.

AB  - The attention and prominence given to issues in media outlets may affect the importance citizens attribute to them, so the actors who influence mass media coverage decisions may have political power in society generally. This article seeks to measure the relative influence of journalists, social trends, events, government officials, editors, and owners on the New York Times coverage of lesbians and gays from 1960 to 1995. Although many factors affected the nature and frequency of such coverage, the findings of this article show that the owners of the Times exerted decisive influence. Documentary evidence reveals that the Times' owners actively intervened to suppress coverage of lesbians and gays until 1987, even as reporters and editors recognized that increased social visibility made them newsworthy. Statistical analysis confirms that, although some actual events and statements of officials attracted attention from the newspaper throughout the period, they were more likely to generate prominent coverage after 1987 when the stories were consistent with the enthusiasms of the owners.

AB  - Media plays a major role in molding US public opinions about Muslims. This paper assesses the effect of 9/11 events on the US media's framing of the Muslim nonprofit sector. Overall it finds that the press was more likely to represent the Muslim nonprofit negatively post 9/11. However, post 9/11, the media framing of Muslim nonprofits was mixed. While the media was more likely to associate Muslim nonprofits and terrorism, they were also more likely to represent Muslim nonprofits as organizations that faced persecution because of Islamophobia, government scrutiny, or hate attacks against them. These media frames may have contributed to public perceptions that Muslim organizations support terrorism while also raising the alarm amongst various stakeholders that the government and the general public are persecuting the Muslim nonprofit sector.

AB  - Intergroup threat harms attitudes toward the outgroup, leading to greater levels of prejudice and outgroup derogation (Rothgerber, 1997). Two experiments were conducted to examine (1) if perspective taking mitigates the negative influence of threat on explicit and implicit intergenerational attitudes and, if so, (2) whether this buffering effect would be stronger for participants who embodied an elderly person in an immersive virtual environment (IVE) compared to those who engaged in a traditional perspective taking exercise via mental simulation (MS). When intergroup threat was presented without intergroup contact (Study 1), the negative effect of threat on ageism dissipated when participants engaged in a perspective taking exercise. Differential effects were found depending on the perspective taking medium. However, when participants were exposed to a concrete and experiential intergroup threat (Study 2), neither modality of perspective taking (IVE and MS) buffered negative intergenerational attitudes.

AB  - Social media influencers promote not only products and brands but also their opinions on serious topics like party politics or climate change. These so-called digital opinion leaders may exert a powerful impact on their followers' political attitudes. Accordingly, we explore new directions to explain how influencers' communication is related to political outcomes by proposing the concept of perceived simplification of politics (PSP). We argue that PSP may fuel political cynicism but also stimulate youth's interest in politics. We also explore important boundary conditions of these associations. We use data from three studies, a two-wave panel survey of adolescents (N-T2 = 294), a cross-sectional survey of young adults (N = 632), and a two-wave panel survey of young adults (N-T2 = 496) in Germany between 2019 and 2020. Findings of all three studies show that the frequency of exposure to social media influencers' content increases PSP. In Studies 1 and 2, PSP is related to higher political cynicism, while in Study 3, this relationship is restricted to influencers' communication about environmental topics and gender equality. Furthermore, Studies 2 and 3 suggest that PSP also increases political interest-yet this association requires a certain level of parasocial interaction (PSI) with the influencer and is contingent on specific political topics.

AB  - Agent-based models of political party competition in a multidimensional policy space have been developed in order to reflect adaptive learning by party leaders with very limited information feedback. The key assumption is that two categories of actors continually make decisions: voters choose which party to support and party leaders offer citizens a certain policy package. After reviewing the arguments for using agent-based models, I elaborate two ways forward in the development of these models for political party competition. Firstly, theoretical progress is made in this article by taking the role of the mass media into account. In previous work it is implicitly assumed that all parties are equally visible for citizens, whereas I will start from the more realistic assumption that there is also competition for attention in the public sphere. With this addition, it is possible to address the question why new parties are seldom able to successfully compete with political actors already within the political system. Secondly, I argue that, if we really want to learn useful lessons from simulations, we should seek to empirically falsify models by confronting outcomes with real data. So far, most of the agent-based models of party competition have been an exclusively theoretical exercise. Therefore, I evaluate the empirical relevance of different simulations of Dutch party competition in the period from May 1998 until May 2002. Using independent data on party positions, I measure the extent to which simulations generate mean party sizes that resemble public opinion polls. The results demonstrate that it is feasible and realistic to simulate party competition in the Netherlands with agent-based models, even when a rather unstable period is investigated.

AB  - Growing concern about the climate crisis comes with increased scrutiny of flying as an emission-intensive activity. This study conceptualises a modern communication system and draws on social media data to examine pre-COVID-19 (September to December 2019) public conversations about aviation and climate change. The analysis of >326,000 Twitter posts reveals that issue salience can be considerable at times, especially during key events such as United Nation climate summits and for users from countries such as Portugal, Puerto Rico, Qatar, France and Spain. Topic modelling identified five key frames: economy and industry, public opinion, fairness and conflict, consequences and responsibility. The fairness and conflict frame recorded the largest number of tweets, and was noteworthy for its negative sentiment. It also had the highest retweet rate and the densest network in terms of average users per community. The responsibility frame was interesting for its positive sentiment, and perhaps the opportunity for aviation stakeholders to contribute proactively to the conversations by sharing climate action success stories. Given the importance of public opinion (voters and consumers), and the link between media activity and policy decisions, the ongoing monitoring of issue salience, frames and peer groups related to flying and climate change seems beneficial.

AB  - Purpose Voice assistant (VA) technology is one of the fastest-growing artificial intelligence applications at present. However, the burgeoning scholarship argues that there are ethical challenges relating to this new technology, not the least related to privacy, which affects the technology's acceptance. Given that the media impacts public opinion and acceptance of VA and that there are no studies on media coverage of VA, the study focuses on media coverage. In addition, this study aims to focus on media coverage in Indonesia, a country that has been underrepresented in earlier research. Design/methodology/approach The authors used critical discourse analysis of media texts, focusing on three levels (text, discourse practice and social practice) to study how VA technology was discussed in the Indonesian context and what power relations frame the representation. In total, 501 articles were collected from seven national media in Indonesia from 2010 to 2020 and the authors particularly focus on the 45 articles that concern ethics. Findings The ethical topics covered are gender issues, false marketing, ethical wrongdoing, ethically positive effects, misuse, privacy and security. More importantly, when they are discussed, they are presented as presenting no real critical problem. Regarding discursive practices, the media coverage is highly influenced by foreign media and most of the articles are directed to well-educated Indonesians. Finally, regarding social practices, the authors hold that the government ideology of technological advancement is related to this positive portrayal of VAs. Originality/value First, to provide the first media discourse study about ethical issues of VAs. Second, to provide insights from a non-Western context, namely, Indonesia, which is underrepresented in the research on ethics of VAs.

AB  - Effective public engagement with complex technologies requires a nuanced understanding of how different audiences make sense of and communicate disruptive technologies with immense social implications. Using latent class analysis (LCA) on nationally-representative survey data (N = 2,700), we examine public attitudes on different aspects of AI, and segment the U.S. population based on their AI-related risk and benefit perceptions. Our analysis reveals five segments: the negative, perceiving risks outweighing benefits; the ambivalent, seeing high risks and benefits; the tepid, perceiving slightly more benefits than risks; the ambiguous, perceiving moderate risks and benefits; and the indifferent, perceiving low risks and benefits. For societal debates surrounding a deeply disruptive issue like AI, our findings suggest potential opportunities for engagement by soliciting input from individuals in segments with varying levels of support for AI, as well as a way to widen representation of voices and ensure responsible innovation of AI.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to examine how exposure to a presidential candidate's high engagement Instagram images influences a citizen's candidate evaluations. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected via Amazon MTurk. A 3 x 2 experimental design was employed to test the persuasive effect of exposure of the "most liked" and "most commented on" images of the top four 2016 US presidential primary candidates on a US citizen's candidate evaluation. Findings Results reveal that highly engaging Instagram images of unfamiliar presidential candidates positively influenced candidate evaluations. However, the same was not true for more well-known presidential candidates. Research limitations/implications This study was not conducted during a live campaign and only examined four of the top 2016 presidential primary candidates. Practical implications The research includes implications for marketers seeking to increase engagement and reach in Instagram marketing campaigns. This study shows that even brief exposure to a highly engaged post involving an unfamiliar person/product on social media can significantly alter evaluations of that person or product. Originality/value To the authors' knowledge, no experimental designs have addressed how Instagram posts influence users' political attitudes and behaviors within the political marketing and communications literature.

AB  - Background: Global efforts toward the development and deployment of a vaccine for COVID-19 are rapidly advancing. To achieve herd immunity, widespread administration of vaccines is required, which necessitates significant cooperation from the general public. As such, it is crucial that governments and public health agencies understand public sentiments toward vaccines, which can help guide educational campaigns and other targeted policy interventions.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and apply an artificial intelligence-based approach to analyze public sentiments on social media in the United Kingdom and the United States toward COVID-19 vaccines to better understand the public attitude and concerns regarding COVID-19 vaccines.
   Methods: Over 300,000 social media posts related to COVID-19 vaccines were extracted, including 23,571 Facebook posts from the United Kingdom and 144,864 from the United States, along with 40,268 tweets from the United Kingdom and 98,385 from the United States from March 1 to November 22, 2020. We used natural language processing and deep learning-based techniques to predict average sentiments, sentiment trends, and topics of discussion. These factors were analyzed longitudinally and geospatially, and manual reading of randomly selected posts on points of interest helped identify underlying themes and validated insights from the analysis.
   Results: Overall averaged positive, negative, and neutral sentiments were at 58%, 22%, and 17% in the United Kingdom, compared to 56%, 24%, and 18% in the United States, respectively. Public optimism over vaccine development, effectiveness, and trials as well as concerns over their safety, economic viability, and corporation control were identified. We compared our findings to those of nationwide surveys in both countries and found them to correlate broadly.
   Conclusions: Artificial intelligence-enabled social media analysis should be considered for adoption by institutions and governments alongside surveys and other conventional methods of assessing public attitude. Such analyses could enable real-time assessment, at scale, of public confidence and trust in COVID-19 vaccines, help address the concerns of vaccine sceptics, and help develop more effective policies and communication strategies to maximize uptake.

AB  - Although past work suggests that having a parasocial relationship with a celebrity can affect attitudes toward that celebrity, no work has yet examined if people are consciously aware that this is occurring and if this can explain the effects of Twitter on attitudes about Donald Trump. The current research examined the psychological mechanisms and attitudinal consequences of engaging with Donald Trump on Twitter and the degree to which people were consciously aware of the effects of their parasocial bond on their attitudes. Across an experiment (N = 243) and two correlational studies (N = 373; N = 384), we found that participants with preexisting political attitudes similar to Trump's showed increased liking of Trump with exposure to his Twitter feed. Those effects were mediated by a parasocial bond. In other words, when people with a political ideology similar to Trump's read his Twitter feed, they felt like they knew him personally (i.e., formed a parasocial relationship with him), which predicted them liking him even more. Conversely, people with political ideologies not similar to Trump's liked him less when exposed to his tweets. Importantly, individuals were unaware that engaging with Trump on Twitter was affecting their views of him. Implications for how the unconscious formation of parasocial relationships may affect attitude polarization and political processes in the modem world are discussed.

AB  - Background Media can influence public and policy-makers' perceptions of causes of, and solutions to, public health issues through selective presentation and framing. Childhood obesity is a health issue with both individual-level and societal-level drivers and solutions, but public opinion and mass media representations of obesity have typically focused on individual-level framings, at the cost of acknowledgement of a need for regulatory action.
   Objective and setting To understand the salience and framing of childhood obesity across 19 years of UK national newspaper content.
   Design and outcome measures Quantitative content analysis of 757 articles about childhood obesity obtained from six daily and five Sunday newspapers. Articles were coded manually for definitions, drivers and potential solutions. Data were analysed statistically, including analysis of time trends and variations by political alignment of source.
   Results The frequency of articles grew from a low of two in 1996 to a peak of 82 in 2008, before declining to 40 in 2010. Individual-level drivers (59.8%) and solutions (36.5%) were mentioned more frequently than societal-level drivers (28.3%) and solutions (28.3%) across the sample, but societal solutions were mentioned more frequently during the final 8 years, coinciding with a marked decline in yearly frequency of articles.
   Conclusions Increased focus on societal solutions aligns with public health goals, but coincided with a reduction in the issue's salience in the media. Those advocating public policy solutions to childhood obesity may benefit from seeking to raise the issue's media profile while continuing to promote structural conceptualisations of childhood obesity.

AB  - Metadebates concerning how the news media deal with extremism have intensified in the digital media landscape. This article analyzes metajournalistic discourse following a controversial studio interview with the spokesperson of a Norwegian Salafi-jihadist group. To illuminate how boundaries of appropriate public debate are negotiated, the article analyzes how this journalistic performance was debated among journalists and commentators, news sources, and readers in online comments sections. The study demonstrates how editorial legacy media invite a broad metadebate but control and define the debate by positioning themselves as defenders against extremism, evoking normative ideals of the role of journalism in democracy and foregrounding the preventive, clarifying, and cohesive effects of including extremist voices. News sources and online commenters are notably more critical, emphasizing the negative consequences of inclusion and warning that inclusion may serve to consolidate extremist views, amplify threats and prejudice, and make extremists the symbolic representatives of Muslims in general. Theoretically, the article contributes to the literature on media and extremism, media criticism, and mediated negotiations of the boundaries of public debate.

AB  - Governments worldwide are promoting the deployment of low-carbon energy generation and associated infrastructures, such as wind farms and high voltage power lines. These are mainly large-scale and built in rural areas, where more space and resources are available. When specific infrastructures are constructed in rural places, opposition is often found, namely from the local communities living nearby, revealing how energy transitions create socio-spatial justice conflicts. Social sciences' research on energy transitions and rural studies have been increasingly highlighting how diverse imaginaries of the rural are mobilized in siting disputes, by community members and developers alike, either to contest the deployment of energy infrastructures or to promote them. However, an examination of the role of the media - an important actor reflecting and shaping public opinion - in re-presenting the rural in relation to energy transitions has been largely overlooked so far. This paper analyses UK newspapers' (Guardian, Times, Sun) discourses on the rural within post-carbon energy transitions, in the period from 2008 (pre-Renewables Directive 2009) to 2014. Based on these analyses, the role of new energy landscapes in (re-)interpretations of rurality and the role of these in post-carbon energy transitions will be discussed.

AB  - Media portrayals of sex offenders are often negative, suggesting that public attitudes share a one-dimensional portrait. But past scholarship has regularly relied on a single newspaper or combined national-regional newspapers when investigating the media framing of sex offenders, which has possibly masked the disparate discourse of sex crimes across geographies and outlets. Our qualitative content analysis of sex crime depictions in articles published between 2012-2016 from six daily newspaper outlets of major metropolitan areas demonstrates that the media framing of sex offenders is varied and multidimensional. Our analysis indicates four salient sex offender frames: the monstrous sex offender, the psychotic sex offender, the sex offender versus the victim, and the humanized sex offender. Each frame is constructed by distinctive scripts, or a sequence of events and actions to describe sex offenders and their offenses. As parts of the interpretative repertoire, sex offender frames and scripts are connected to specific policy initiatives from a conservative to a progressive orientation.

AB  - This paper addresses the talk of the leader of the British National Party, Nick Griffin, when he spoke on the BBC following a surge in electoral success for the party. Inclusion in these programmes demonstrated political progress for the BNP, yet ironically facilitated breadth of criticism for the party, as his appearances were met with widespread hostility and accusations of extremism. Reactive rhetoric to these criticisms is central to Griffin rebranding the party and becoming part of mainstream UK politics. Discourse analysis is used to explore how Griffin responds to such criticism during two radio programmes and one television programme between 2009 and 2010. The analysis shows how Griffin uses two interconnected strategies of (1) presenting British people as the victims, rather than the perpetrators, of racism, and (2) blaming this racism not on outside groups, but on an ill-defined 'ruling elite'. These strategies are not independent of one another and function in response to criticism to present Griffin and the BNP as not racist aggressors but respondents to anti-white racism. The implications of this strategy for the presentation and attempted rebranding of the BNP, alongside other far right and mainstream parties, are discussed. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

TI  - Public attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines on English-language Twitter: A sentiment analysis
T2  - VACCINE
LA  - English
KW  - SOCIAL MEDIA
AB  - Objective: To identify themes and temporal trends in the sentiment of COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets and to explore variations in sentiment at world national and United States state levels.
   Methods: We collected English-language tweets related to COVID-19 vaccines posted between November 1, 2020, and January 31, 2021. We applied the Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner tool to calculate the compound score to determine whether the sentiment mentioned in each tweet was positive (compound >= 0.05), neutral (-0.05 < compound < 0.05), or negative (compound <= -0.05). We applied the latent Dirichlet allocation analysis to extract main topics for tweets with positive and negative sentiment. Then we performed a temporal analysis to identify time trends and a geographic analysis to explore sentiment differences in tweets posted in different locations.
   Results: Out of a total of 2,678,372 COVID-19 vaccine-related tweets, tweets with positive, neutral, and negative sentiments were 42.8%, 26.9%, and 30.3%, respectively. We identified five themes for positive sentiment tweets (trial results, administration, life, information, and efficacy) and five themes for negative sentiment tweets (trial results, conspiracy, trust, effectiveness, and administration). On November 9, 2020, the sentiment score increased significantly (score = 0.234, p = 0.001), then slowly decreased to a neutral sentiment in late December and was maintained until the end of January. At the country level, tweets posted in Brazil had the lowest sentiment score of -0.002, while tweets posted in the United Arab Emirates had the highest sentiment score of 0.162. The overall average sentiment score for the United States was 0.089, with Washington, DC having the highest sentiment score of 0.144 and Wyoming having the lowest sentiment score of 0.036.
   Conclusions: Public sentiment on COVID-19 vaccines varied significantly over time and geography. Sentiment analysis can provide timely insights into public sentiment toward the COVID-19 vaccine and guide public health policymakers in designing locally tailored vaccine education programs.

AB  - Interest groups campaign to influence public opinion on climate change, yet few studies have empirically examined whether they are successful in their aims. The current study investigates the extent to which characteristic arguments used by environmental and industry-backed interest groups are able to influence the public's climate policy preferences. Using an original online survey experiment conducted in the UK (N = 796), we find that interest group messages can affect climate policy preferences. After reading an argument supporting a policy, respondents were significantly more likely than the control group to support the (strong or weak) policy endorsed by the argument, although broader policy views were unaffected. Policy endorsements had the same effect on policy preferences whether or not emphasis frames were used, and the effects were not moderated by the personal importance of climate change. Overall, the moderate effect sizes suggest that interest groups have limited influence over the public's climate policy preferences.

AB  - Does social influence exerted through role modeling of collective action impact social change in contexts that are not conducive to collective action, such as long-lasting violent conflicts? We examined this question in two field experiments in the Eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. We created two versions of an episode of an existing media intervention (a show aiming to promote positive social change), in which fictional characters either planned collective action (role modeling condition), or did not plan action (control condition) to address grievances. In Study 1, role modeling affected individual-level outcomes: it increased perceived collective efficacy and willingness to take action, but exacerbated intergroup attitudes and reduced tolerance. Study 2 tested the influence of role modeling on a group-level outcome (group discussions). Discussions following the role modeling show focused less on grievances, and included more positive lessons of the show, as well as more statements about collective efficacy and collective action. The findings highlight the influence of role modeling of collective action through media on efficacy and action for social change, but caution against unintended consequences on intergroup attitudes.

AB  - This article sets out findings from a project focused on #stopIslam, a hashtag that gained prominence following the Brussels terror attack of 2016. We initially outline a big data analysis which shows how counter-narratives - criticizing #stopIslam - momentarily subverted negative news reporting of Muslims. The rest of the article details qualitative findings that complicate this initial positive picture. We set out key tactics engaged in by right-wing actors, self-identified Muslim users, would-be allies and celebrities and elucidate how these tactics were instrumental in the direction, dynamics and legacies of the hashtag. We argue that the tactical interventions of tightly bound networks of right-wing actors, as well as the structural constraints of the platform, not only undermined the longevity and coherence of the counter-narratives but subtly modulated the affordances of Twitter in ways that enabled these users to extend their voice outwards, reinforcing long-standing representational inequalities in the process.

AB  - In an era of big data, explosive growth of online posts makes the judgment of their qualities harder while more important. In many cases, people want to quickly identify those most informative posts, which contain details, insights or in-depth criticisms, to help them make better decisions. To meet this demand, a three-stage model is proposed. First, a super-network model is introduced to accommodate the multidimensional attributes of online posts, including keywords, user ID, emotions and the related event. Second, a corpus updating mechanism is introduced to generate event specific corpora, which help to discriminate the informative quality of posts in the next stage. Third, machine learning algorithms are applied, where the posts are first filtered by a linear discriminant classifier and then assessed by a multilayer perceptron neural network. To test the model, we chose six online public opinion events that fell into two categories: major public safety crisis and online controversies about public policies. Experimental results showed the effectiveness of the proposed model, where majority of errors are less than 0.05, on a 0-1 measuring scale. In the future, this model may also be adapted to areas including evaluation of informative quality of websites, product reviews and answers in question and answer communities. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Of the three Khans that dominate Bombay cinema, Salman Khan enjoys fan popularity amongst Muslims in India. This adoration and identification for Khan is surprising particularly because he has been publicly decried as a Muslim since his implicit support of prime minister Narendra Modi. And yet, his films often get released on the Muslim festival of Eid to tremendous box office success. This article analyzes the intersection of fandom and stardom of Salman Khan to discuss how his stardom is a product of negotiations between the public discussions of his religious identity, interviews that seek to convey his star image as authentic, and the cinematic construction of the star as articulated through his roles. An analysis of media coverage of his films across newspapers that cross nations (India and Pakistan), languages (English, Hindi, and Urdu), and urban-rural divides, I examine the paratextual construction of him as a bhaijaan/brother that then impacts interpretation of his films within local, national, and global imaginaries. I argue that the implicit positioning of Salman Khan across the Hindu-Muslim divide becomes explicit through his roles in Ek tha Tiger (2012), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015), and even Sultan (2016). This article proposes that the discourse around what I call his "bhaijaanification" serves as an interruption to the fundamentalist trends within India and Bombay cinema that have become worse as a result of large-scale transnational Islamophobia since 2001, and indicates the extent of stardom's auteurist function where it influences meanings that go beyond the cinematic and into the political.

AB  - Political communication research in the United States, despite two decades of change in how the public receives information, follows theories that rely on definitions of citizenship from a century ago and on metaphors growing out of communication techniques and practices of five decades ago. A review of the state of news media, facing technical, labor, and economic crises, and the state of political science, illustrated through research methods, leads to a reexamination of communication at the intersection of media and politics. Political communication theory has come to rely on functional metaphors, economic background assumptions, an emphasis on method, and a legacy of structuralism. The crisis presents current theories with challenges for the representation of citizens and the press in democracy. Especially as young adults reject older forms of information, political communication can renew itself by deepening existing theory and shifting from old effects rationality to a new "media affect" sensibility.

Results based on a two-wave panel survey among a national sample of 1,199 Chinese adults provide strong support for the CCMM in the Chinese context. In addition, embracing the democratic citizenship norm significantly enhances the CCMM effect, whereas embracing the pro-government citizenship norm that encourages pro-government speech does not show the same effect.

KW  - technology
AB  - The development of technology affects all spheres of human life, including children's play. The changes resulting from the fast development of technology and new media leave a huge dent in the process of children's play.
   This paper tends to answer the question how the development of technology and new media influences the changes in the context of children's play, whether the new media has become just a good excuse for some other, deeper social changes taking place in a society and influencing all segments of human life, including children. It is concluded that, with the development of technology, children's play has evolved in another direction, a direction that has not been sufficiently explored, often unfavourably judged and blamed for all the negative changes in children's life. A basic developmental characteristic of children is their openness to something new and different. Children are by nature explorers who investigate everything in their environment and beyond. The possibilities of technology and new media in children's play are just another segment that requires exploration and investigation, and that is interesting for children to research. Simplicity and openness to new things is something one needs to appreciate and nurture in children. On the trail of these changes adults are faced with new tasks, such as showing complete openness to new things and discarding all prejudices, limitations and ignorance. When all of this is behind us, we can help children get into great exploration of the new media as a new and inevitable part of their new play. Accepting the strong impact of the new media on children's play allows us a certain amount of control over the quality of play in order to protect children.
   Technology and the new media have become part of children's play, of the way children play in the 21st century.

AB  - Is popular antagonism towards Muslim veils in Europe rooted in an exclusionary enlightenment liberalism'? By examining different conceptions of liberalism and readings of veiling in a Dutch survey from 2014, we present the first study that investigates this question empirically. We thus bring together two hitherto largely unconnected literatures. The first is the work on immigration and ethnicity, which has shown the centrality of enlightenment liberalism in anti-Muslim media and policy discourses. The second is the literature on anti-Muslim attitudes in public opinion, which explains support for veil bans as the result of perceiving veils as threatening the respondent's own, supposedly liberal, values - but has failed to distinguish between different conceptions of liberalism and thus reached inconclusive results. This, we show, can be remedied by distinguishing between enlightenment liberals', who hold negative attitudes, and reformation liberals', who hold positive attitudes towards Muslim veils.

AB  - With new forms of media such as Twitter becoming increasingly popular, the Internet is now the main conduit of individual and interpersonal messages. A considerable amount of people express their personal opinions about news-related subject through Twitter, a popular SNS platform based on human relationships. It provides us a data source that we can use to extract peoples' opinions which are important for product review and public opinion monitoring. In this paper, a hybrid sentimental entity recognition model (HSERM) has been designed. Utilizing 100 million collected messages from Twitter, the hashtag is regarded as the label for sentimental classification. In the meanwhile, features as emoji and N-grams have been extracted and classified the collected topic messages into four different sentiment categories based on the circumplex sentimental model. Finally, machine learning methods are used to classify the sentimental data set, and an 89 % precise result has been achieved. Further, entities that are behind emotions could be gotten with the help of SENNA deep learning model.

AB  - The predictors of social closeness toward refugees are rarely examined. In this study (N = 337), higher cultural intelligence (CQ) and higher empathy were defined as predictors of higher social closeness (lower social distance [the Social Distance Scale] and warmer feelings [the Feeling Thermometer]) toward refugees from Syria. This is the target group of prejudice and intensive coverage in the European mass media. The obtained results indicated that other-oriented empathy (empathic concern and perspective taking) and the motivational CQ predicted higher social closeness and warmer feelings toward refugees from Syria. Empathic personal distress predicted lower social closeness and colder feelings toward this group. Motivational CQ consistently served as the mediator of the relationship between empathy dimensions and social closeness toward Syrian refugees. Our findings reveal the previously unexplored correlations between empathy dimensions and cultural intelligence factors, including the mediational effects in predicting social closeness toward Syrian refugees.

AB  - Purpose: Public stigma is an important barrier to the recovery of patients with psychosis. This study aimed to explore public stigma associated with a newly adopted Chinese name for psychosis si-jue-shi-tiao' in a representative Chinese population in Hong Kong, focusing on factors contributing to public stigma. Exposure to mass media and its relationship with the stigma were explored in detail.
   Methods: Random telephone survey of general population in Hong Kong was conducted. Information including basic demographics, psychosis literacy, recent news recall about psychosis and stigma, measured with the revised Link's Perceived Discrimination-Devaluation Scale (LPDDS) were obtained. Univariate analysis of LPDDS score and demographic variables, news exposure, previous contacts with people with psychosis and knowledge about psychosis were conducted. Further hierarchical regression analysis was performed.
   Results: A total of 1,016 subjects were interviewed. The sample was comparable with the whole Hong Kong population aged 18 years and above. Those of female gender, with higher educational level and better knowledge about symptoms and treatment of psychosis had higher score of LPDDS. The model significantly explained 8.3% of variance of LPDDS score (F(7, 895)=12.606, p<.0001, p<.0001). The negative news recall had trend significance in the model.
   Conclusion: The finding suggested that discrimination among the general public against people with psychosis was still common. Specific strategies will need to be established in targeting media news reporting about psychosis, knowledge disseminating and needs of specific population. Further researches should be conducted to understand the mechanisms of the stigma development in relation to these factors so that more focused and effective strategies could be developed.

AB  - Background: Harm reduction programs are often vulnerable to political and vocal opposition despite documented evidence of their effectiveness and economic benefit. It is not well understood if opponents to harm reduction represent the general public's attitudes.
   Objective: To understand the attitudes of the people of British Columbia (BC) towards various harm reduction strategies and services, and factors associated with support for harm reduction.
   Methods: A random-digit dialing telephone survey assessing attitudes towards various harm reduction strategies was administered to British Columbians in August 2011 (n = 2000). We compared the level of support for general harm reduction by sex, age, education level, and area of residence (Health Authority region) (chi(2)). Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess odds of support for harm reduction.
   Results: Overall support for general harm reduction among participants was 76%; needle distribution 72%; needle distribution in one's local community 65%; and safer inhalation equipment distribution 52%. In the multivariate analysis, those with significantly lower odds of supporting harm reduction were male, older, had equal or less than high school education or completed a certificate/diploma program, and resided in the Fraser Health Authority region. The Health Authority region with a municipality that has introduced a bylaw prohibiting the implementation of harm reduction services was found to have 69% support for harm reduction. Another Health Authority region with a municipality that closed a long-standing needle distribution site was found to have over 78% support.
   Conclusion: In contrast to some local policies, our results show the British Columbians surveyed in our study support harm reduction. It is unclear whether policy makers are swayed by a vocal minority or block harm reduction activities for other reasons. Tailoring messages towards segments of the public less likely to support harm reduction, as well civic policy-makers and the media, may help to reduce stigma and gain support for harm reduction services designed to protect and improve the health of the individual and the public.

AB  - In June/July 2010, South Africa successfully hosted the FIFA Soccer World Cup, the largest sporting and media event on earth. It was the first time the mega-spectacle was held on African soil. It offered the host country the opportunity to showcase it as a successful 'African event', hereby celebrating contemporary African culture while simultaneously challenging commonly held prejudices about the continent. Within South Africa itself, the event - as was the case with previous such mega-events like the 1995 Rugby World Cup - created imaginaries of a cohesive, shared national identity. And yet, when one explores the contours of the (mediated) public debate leading to the hosting of the 2010 event, it becomes possible to see the cohesion as transient in a country in which a segregated racial past keeps lurking beneath the surface of a fractured post-apartheid transition. This article critically examines one site of public contestation ahead of the hosting of the World Cup: the debate around the merits of building the Green Point Stadium in Cape Town for the semi-final match as it was framed by readers of the Cape Argus newspaper in 2007 through published short message service (SMS) messages. A framing analysis of the text messages reveals the different ways in which the stadium emerges, not just as a piece of infrastructure but as an embodiment of the conflicting racial, class, political and sporting identities in the Western Cape and South Africa more broadly.

AB  - Media framing of social protests can influence public opinion and governmental response. An extensive line of scholarly work had pointed to the existence of two alternative news frames; public order and debate. We argue that prior work may have been limited by the reliance on deductive strategies using predefined, theoretically-driven frames. Using a data-driven computational method, the Analysis of Topic Model Networks (ANTMN), we examine mainstream news' framing of two contentious protests that took place during Donald Trump's presidency; Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, VA (n = 1231 news articles), and the Black Lives Matter protests (n = 2810). In addition to the frames found in past research, we identify a prominent Politics frame, often focussing on the role of Trump in inciting and reacting to racial tensions. An in-depth analysis of the application of frames to each protest revealed a nuanced use of the Protest Paradigm. We suggest possible revisions to existing theories, and discuss the potential social and political implications of our findings.

AB  - Another major focus on communication development is to streamline existing media so that more people can access and participate in the development process. New Media has been able to prove its ability to assist and improve social media in the form of a quick response that allows almost anyone anywhere with online resources to not only access media but also produce and distribute content instantly without a direct link. It is because of this unique feature that most communications professionals and attorneys adopt the approach to seeing it as the most effective and fast way to access and disseminate messages aimed at informing their programs, influencing public opinion and generating support. Clearly, these new direct two-way communication has empowered many people to participate, speak for themselves and make other meaningful contributions by adding their voice to the ongoing campaign. As a result, New Media itself poses challenges to lawyers as well as users and supporters as fraudsters have used the benefits of the various spaces in it to deceive, deceive and mislead people. This has led to general disrespect, distrust and distrust of the authenticity and integrity of many lawyers; the challenge of knowing who to believe and how to identify and reject lies. This research project is designed to address the various challenges users face as a result of the current state of affairs in order to provide a lasting solution and restore the credibility of the advocacy project and the difficulty of knowing which media message is truly designed by real lawyers and not fraudsters or perpetrators.

AB  - Each year thousands of women are trafficked for sexual exploitation. To understand how the mass media represent trafficking, a qualitative framing analysis of magazines, published from 2000 through to 2010, was conducted. Results showed magazines presented complementary frames of victimization and benevolence. Magazine articles shed light on trafficking, which operates in society's shadows and is far removed from many people's lives, but articles reinforce hierarchies and divisions: between women and men; among women; and among "good" prostitutes who deserve help and "bad" prostitutes who do not. Articles imply that the problem of trafficking is one of individual vulnerability, which can be remedied by charitable efforts, and ignore the larger cultural, political, economic, and educational systems of sex discrimination. Traffickers and men who buy sex were largely absent from magazine stories, and focus on the sale of sexual services, rather than the purchase, emphasized women's role in the trafficking process while making men's roles invisible. Because the mass media can shape public opinion and public policy, such incomplete reports may lead to ineffective policies.

AB  - Public opinion polls have long played an important role in the study and conduct of elections. In this essay, I outline the evolution of polling as used for three different functions in U.S. presidential elections: forecasting election outcomes, understanding voter behavior, and planning campaign strategy. Since the introduction of scientific polling in the 1936 election, technology has altered the way polls are used by the media, public, candidates, and scholars. Today, polls and surveys remain vital to electoral behavior and our understanding of it, but they are being increasingly supplemented or replaced by alternate measures and methods.

AB  - Background: Since the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic in China in December 2019, information and discussions about COVID-19 have spread rapidly on the internet and have quickly become the focus of worldwide attention, especially on social media.
   Objective: This study aims to investigate and analyze the public's attention to events related to COVID-19 in China at the beginning of the COVID-19 epidemic (December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020) through the Sina Microblog hot search list.
   Methods: We collected topics related to the COVID-19 epidemic on the Sina Microblog hot search list from December 31, 2019, to February 20, 2020, and described the trend of public attention on COVID-19 epidemic-related topics. ROST Content Mining System version 6.0 was used to analyze the collected text for word segmentation, word frequency, and sentiment analysis. We further described the hot topic keywords and sentiment trends of public attention. We used VOSviewer to implement a visual cluster analysis of hot keywords and build a social network of public opinion content.
   Results: The study has four main findings. First, we analyzed the changing trend of the public's attention to the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be divided into three stages. Second, the hot topic keywords of public attention at each stage were slightly different. Third, the emotional tendency of the public toward the COVID-19 epidemic-related hot topics changed from negative to neutral, with negative emotions weakening and positive emotions increasing as a whole. Fourth, we divided the COVID-19 topics with the most public concern into five categories: the situation of the new cases of COVID-19 and its impact, frontline reporting of the epidemic and the measures of prevention and control, expert interpretation and discussion on the source of infection, medical services on the frontline of the epidemic, and focus on the worldwide epidemic and the search for suspected cases.
   Conclusions: Our study found that social media (eg, Sina Microblog) can be used to measure public attention toward public health emergencies. During the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, a large amount of information about the COVID-19 epidemic was disseminated on Sina Microblog and received widespread public attention. We have learned about the hotspots of public concern regarding the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings can help the government and health departments better communicate with the public on health and translate public health needs into practice to create targeted measures to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.

AB  - The current article addresses bystander action to confront disparaging humor as a form of moral courage. We ask: When is disparaging humor seen as harmless fun or as a pernicious form of prejudice? What are the social and psychological processes through which bystanders confront, evade, or collaborate in disparaging humor? Three experiments (Ns = 95, 213, 220), involving a novel paradigm (`the shared media paradigm') test the role of bystander emotional responses (anger/amusement) in shaping action to confront disparagement humor, through emotion-based social influence. Study 1 demonstrates that bystander action to confront disparagement humor as prejudice is shaped by the angry (but not amused) responses of co-present others. Study 2 considers a moderator of the influence process: the role of one's own emotional reaction to disparagement humor (angry/amused). Bystander confrontation was more intense when one's own angry reaction was validated by that of other bystanders but there was otherwise mixed evidence that the two interacted to promote collaboration/confrontation. Study 3 tests the claim that disparagement humor is especially challenging to confront because humor disarms opposition. Intergroup commentary was seen as more amusing and confrontation was more strongly resisted when humor was used (vs. a non-humorous control remark). Overall, the results show that the reactions of bystanders play an important role in shaping what is (or is not) perceived to be prejudice. Courageous action to confront the disparagement of members of minority groups is enabled by the emotional signals of others who are co-present.

AB  - English-medium instruction (EMI) has been implemented in higher-education institutions around the world. This study examines the states of EMI-related professional development (PD) for Korean science and engineering professors and their perceptions of such programs. Faculty members at the three major science and engineering schools in Korea participated in a questionnaire survey and the follow-up interviews. The results show that the vast majority of them had not participated in pre- or in-service PD programs and had negative attitudes towards certified EMI-related PD programs mainly due to their institution's strong emphasis on their research performance rather than the quality of their teaching. The study offers suggestions for future directions of EMI-related PD at institutions with a similar tendency.

AB  - Public opinion about LGBT rights has shifted dramatically in the last 30 years. This study, a content analysis of 659 news articles from The New York Times and The Washington Post from 1977-2013, examined the use of pro- and anti-LGBT organizations as sources to explore how coverage changed over time and to examine if there were differences in coverage of mainstream LGBT advocacy organizations versus those that are more radical in nature. Results showed that stories about the topics of marriage/families, entertainment, AIDS, politics and protests were the most likely to use LGBT advocacy organizations as sources. Use of radical organizations as sources peaked in the 1990s, when the majority of AIDS and protest stories were published. Anti-LGBT organizations were used as sources in just under 20 percent of the coded stories but stories covering some topics like marriage/families saw much higher rates of anti-LGBT organizational sourcing. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Politics, rather than disease characteristics, complicated the United States response to Ebola virus disease and Zika virus. We analyze how media and political elites shaped public opinion of the two outbreaks. We conducted a retrospective analysis of media coverage, Congressional floor speech, and public opinion polls to explain elite cueing and public perceptions of Ebola and Zika. We find evidence of elite cueing by Congress and the media on public opinion. Public opinion of both disease outbreaks initially followed partisan patterns. However, while Ebola public opinion remained partisan, ultimately, opinion emerged of a bipartisan nature for Zika, mirroring elite framing. Public health officials should be aware of how elite cueing shapes policy and prioritizes partisan strategies. Politics and public opinion can focus attention on or away from infectious disease; it can also undermine public health responses by biasing the public's view of a diseases' relative risk.

AB  - Two studies examine disparagement humor in online television and reasons people enjoy witnessing the comedic ridicule of other people. In Study 1, a quantitative content analysis, coders documented the prevalence and characteristics of disparagement humor in online television clips and its reception by audiences. Disparagement humor appeared in one in four video clips, often targeting physical appearance and weight. Studio audiences, other television characters, and online commenters often validated disparagement humor. Study 2, an experiment, investigated the contribution of existing prejudice and third-party audience reaction to the reported enjoyment of disparagement humor and willingness to share the insulting humor with others. Both validating audience reaction and existing prejudice positively predicted enjoyment of disparagement humor. Further, enjoyment of the disparagement humor significantly predicted participants' self-reported likelihood to share the insulting jokes with acquaintances.

AB  - Digital contact tracing (DCT) has become an efficient method for authorities to curb COVID-19. However, the current public opinion studies on the adoption of DCT primarily focus on Western countries and rarely explore citizen attitudes in Asian contexts where DCT is often mandatory. Moreover, the existing literature extensively explores how privacy concern negates the adoption of DCT without illuminating the solutions to such barriers. To unveil the mechanisms of DCT adoption, this study explores how Singaporeans' privacy concern, political trust, and technology literacy can influence their attitudes toward TraceTogether (a local DCT program). An analysis of survey data suggests that privacy concern is positively associated with negative attitudes toward DCT. Those with high levels of political distrust also hold negative attitudes toward DCT. Political distrust is also found to positively mediate the relationship between privacy concerns and negative attitudes toward DCT. Finally, moderated mediation findings suggest that the indirect effects of privacy concern on negative attitudes toward DCT via political distrust increase with an increase in technological literacy. Simply put, the indirect effects are stronger for those with higher-tech literacy. We discuss the tension between privacy concerns and public health during the pandemic and propose policy suggestions.

AB  - Obesity is one of the fastest growing and most serious public health challenges facing the world in the 21st century. Correspondingly, over the past decade there has been increased interest in how the obesity epidemic has been framed by the media. This study offers the first large-scale examination of the evolution and framing of the obesity epidemic in UK newspapers, identifying shifts in news coverage about the causal drivers of and potential solutions to the obesity epidemic. Seven UK newspapers were selected and 2,414 articles published between 1 January 1996 and 31 December 2010 were retrieved from electronic databases using keyword searches. The thematic content of articles was examined using manifest content analysis. Over the 15-year period there was an increase in media reporting on obesity and in particular on childhood obesity. There was evidence of a trend away from a focus on individuals towards a greater level of reporting on societal solutions such as regulatory change, with the greatest shift in reporting occurring in mid-market and serious newspapers. Given that the media have a huge influence in shaping public opinion, this shift in reporting might be an early indicator to policymakers of a growing public discourse around a need for regulatory change to tackle the obesogenic environment.

AB  - Background: News media portrayals of doctors (co-) construct public opinion on the medical profession. There have been only a few studies on media representations of doctors, which researched the quality press only and did not use quantitative methods to measure evaluations of doctors.
   Methods: The study tries to fill this research gap by an analysis of doctors' representation in five most-read Slovenian daily newspapers from 15 March to 15 September 2010. Quantitative content analysis and qualitative critical discourse analysis were used to verify the hypothesis that among media there are statistically significant differences in doctors' evaluations.
   Results: The dailies mostly represented doctors neutrally (41.6 %); a negative evaluation was found in 38.4 % and positive in 20.0 % of news items. Statistically significant differences were established among the media. The tabloid Slovenske novice published the majority of news items that negatively evaluated doctors (33.2 %), and the least with a positive evaluation (1.7 %). Among actors, Fides and the Medical Chamber of Slovenia were evaluated particularly negatively. All dailies published black and white images of doctors: "hardworking" and "overburdened" young residents work overtime, senior physicians are "lazy", "blackmailers", and "the greedy ones".
   Conclusions: There is an ambivalent and oversimplified coverage of doctors in the Slovenian press. They are represented both negatively and positively. A challenge for the future research would be a study on views about doctors in diverse media and public opinion.

AB  - People's interpretations of media reports about crimes may be biased by their motivations to construct and protect their worldviews and, relatedly, by criminals' group membership. Two large-scale experiments (Ns = 248 and 1,115) investigated how American adults interpret reports of crimes committed by either a Christian or Muslim, and how these interpretations depend on political ideology. Results show liberals attributing crimes more to religion for Christian rather than Muslim offenders, with the opposite effect for conservatives. Importantly, these biases also influenced how people communicated the news report to others. Additionally, evidence suggests that attitudes toward Islam and not toward Muslims may explain these effects. Implications for how political ideology affects interpretation and communication of media portrayals of Muslims are discussed.

AB  - Through two studies conducted with cross-cultural samples (the United States and China), this research examines the psychological mechanism of consumer hoarding during COVID-19. Findings from Study 1 suggest that consumer hoarding is differently affected by legacy and social media information seeking, perceived scarcity, and scarcity attributions in the United States versus China. For China, while social media information seeking has a negative downstream relationship to hoarding, legacy media information seeking has a positive relationship with hoarding. In the United States, only social media information seeking has a positive relationship with hoarding. Further, these effects are significant when consumers attribute the scarcity responsibility to insufficient supply but not high demand. Study 2 shows that when the cause of scarcity is stated directly, perceived scarcity increases hoarding intention for Chinese consumers when the scarcity cause is due to supply but not demand, whereas U.S. consumers' hoarding intention does not vary with the scarcity cause. The findings underscore cross-cultural differences in how legacy and social media information seeking influence consumer hoarding and highlight implications for situations in which hoarding is likely.

AB  - The circulation of misinformation, lies, propaganda, and other kinds of falsehood has, to varying degrees, become a challenge to democratic publics. We are interested in the question of what publics believe about their own exposure to falsehoods in news, and about what contributes to similarities and differences in these beliefs across countries. We are also interested in the question of whether publics report attempting to verify news that is suspect to them. Here we report on a comparative election survey in the United States, the United Kingdom, and France. We find three key predictors of publics' beliefs that they have been exposed to falsehoods: discussion of news, use of social media for political purposes, and exposure to counter-attitudinal information. The nexus between these three predictors and beliefs about falsehoods exists in all three countries, as we anticipate that it likely exists elsewhere. We do not find voters on the right to be different from those on the left in the United Kingdom and France, but do find a substantial difference in the United States, which is likely due to the 2016 Trump campaign. We conclude with concerns about the imbalance in beliefs about exposure to falsehoods in the United States and the apparent capacity of a single leader, in the right context, to shape public beliefs about what is to be believed.

AB  - Over the past decade, voter fraud has emerged as a salient issue in American politics and elections. Despite minimal evidence of fraud cases and non-existent effects on election outcomes, Americans continue to believe in the existence and impact of voter fraud on elections. In this paper, we examine a potentially key source of this disconnect - the U.S. news media. How the media cover voter fraud likely affects citizens' beliefs and opinions on the subject. However, little research exists exploring voter fraud coverage. In this paper, we examine the patterns and themes of voter fraud coverage in local newspapers for each of the 50 states during the 2012 elections. Amongst the results, we show that voter identification and registration were dominant topics in coverage. Further, battleground states and states that recently passed restrictive voting laws affected which topics related to voter fraud received the most attention. Finally, we find that the number of fraud cases in each state was unrelated to voter fraud news coverage. From an agenda setting and framing standpoint, our results suggest Republicans may have been successful in making voter identification and fraud a salient issue in the news during the 2012 elections.

AB  - Much is known about the negative consequences of exposure to ethnic/racial stereotypes in the media, on White audiences. However, there is substantially less research addressing the effects of such media content on members of racial/ethnic minority groups. The present study examines this question using repeated cross-sectional national level data alongside a content analysis of top prime time shows between 1987 and 2008. Multi-level modeling analyses reveal that media representations of Latinos and Blacks were associated with Latinos' and Blacks' ingroup attitudes, however effects on attitudes towards Whites were not significant.

AB  - The nature of surveillance is changing. It is becoming gamified. This article charts a shift in thinking about surveillance culture, from the panopticon models advanced by Jeremy Bentham and Michel Foucault to current analyses of the increasingly participatory and gamified models of surveillance in the age of big data. That shift is played out literally in Theatre Conspiracy's immersive play Foreign Radical, in which participants are led through a game environment in which they reveal aspects of their online behaviour and judge each other in a way that replicates the kinds of social sorting that take place in both social media and surveillance. The game leads them to deliberate on the case of an Iranian-Canadian man named Hesam, who stands accused of terrorism. As the case against Hesam comes to rest increasingly on his Middle Eastern and Islamic identity, the show reveals the role that racism and Islamophobia come to play in the interpretation of surveillance data. Although surveillance operates on a seemingly empirical basis, the stories it tells about people nevertheless remain fictions, assembled from statistical probability and speculation. In this way, surveillance adds to the sense that we live in a post-truth society.

AB  - This study investigates how Burmese refugees were framed by Fort Wayne's The Journal Gazette located in one of Indiana's cities where refugee resettlement has taken place over the last two decades. We analyzed 335 stories and 286 accompanying images to identify salient textual and visual frames. Results show that the human interest and attribution of responsibility were most salient textual frames, while the visual frame of exotic was dominant. Feature stories were more likely to have a human interest frame and, if an image is included, to reflect the visual frame of Burmese as being exotic. As a global refugee crisis continues to unfold, this study presents implications for how media coverage of future refugees in the United States will evolve based on public opinion.

AB  - Newspaper Op-Ed articles are an important form of intellectual debate that communicate views on public policy matters and help shape public opinion. They are challenging, information-rich and persuasive short media texts imbued with worldviews, arguments, sarcasms and biases, hence providing salience cues regarding key national and international affairs. Recent police killings of citizens in the US have attracted mass coverage in the media, predominantly in the Op-Ed section of The New York Times in 2015. Informed by Critical Discourse Analysis, this case study is a multi-layered qualitative analysis of the Baltimore unrest media coverage, particularly in one article authored by a guest contributor in The New York Times. To identify how the nation-wide case of the Baltimore unrest is rhetorically represented in media discourse, the study is premised on Appraisal Theory and Conceptual Metaphor Theory. The paper aims to: first, pinpoint the inherent appraisal resources used by the author to frame his argument and dialogically position the intended audiences in (dis)alignment with his worldviews; second, showcase the metaphoric repertoire that serves his ideological stance.

TI  - Do the Ladies Run This Mutha? The Relationship between Political Rap and Black Feminist Attitudes
T2  - NEW POLITICAL SCIENCE
LA  - English
KW  - HIP-HOP
AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College; a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women.

AB  - Purpose
   Unconscious biases against certain groups aid in forming assumptions which may be promulgated in the USA via popular news media linking rare but memorable violent acts with specific groups. However, the relationship between marginalized group association, assumptions regarding the motive for violent acts and individual media consumption has never been directly examined. This study aims to directly examine this relationship.
   Design/methodology/approach
   In the present study, individuals read a vignette of a mass shooting in which the perpetrator's implied religion (i.e. Islam or unknown religion) was manipulated. Participants then indicated their assumptions regarding motive (i.e. terrorism or mental illness) and personal media consumption habits.
   Findings
   Contrary to hypotheses, differences in assumed motive based on implied religion were not found; participants were not more likely to associate an assumed Muslim perpetrator with terrorism as a motive or consider the assumed non-Muslim perpetrator to be mentally ill.
   Originality/value
   These unexpected findings are discussed in the context of the data-collection period, which coincidentally overlapped with a well-publicized act of domestic terrorism that led to a unique national debate regarding biased news coverage and associations between religion, ethnicity, terrorism and mental illness.

AB  - Background Twenty miles per hour (20mph) speed limits (equivalent to roughly 30kmh) have become part of public health policies to reduce urban road collisions and casualties, especially in Western countries. Public opinion plays a crucial role in opposition to and acceptance of policies that are advocated for improving public health. Twenty miles per hour speed limit policies were implemented in Edinburgh and Belfast from 2016 to 2018. In this paper, we extract public opinion and sentiments expressed about the new 20mph speed limits in those cities using publicly available Twitter data. Methods We analysed public sentiments from Twitter data and classified the public comments in plain English into the categories 'positive', 'neutral', and 'negative'. We also explored the frequency and sources of the tweets. Results The total volume of tweets was higher for Edinburgh than for Belfast, but the volume of tweets followed a similar pattern, peaking around 2016, which is when the schemes were implemented. Overall, the tone of the tweets was positive or neutral towards the implementation of the speed limit policies. This finding was surprising as there is a perception among policymakers that there would have been public backlash against these sorts of policy changes. The commonly used hashtags focused largely on road safety and other potential benefits, for example to air pollution. Conclusions Overall, public attitudes towards the policies were positive, thus policymakers should be less anxious about potential public backlash when considering the scale-up of 20mph speed restrictions.

AB  - This article studies the stereotypes of co-ethnic versus other-ethnic foreign immigrant groups based on the stereotype content model. An online survey (N = 424) was conducted to examine Singaporean citizens' perceptions of two prominent migrant groups (co-ethnic Chinese nationals and other-ethnic Caucasians) and the influence of social media on stereotype formation. Results showed that status is associated with competence for both groups, while competition was related to warmth only for Chinese nationals. The cross-constructs of status warmth were found for co-ethnic immigrants only, and a competition-competence correlation was found for other-ethnic. Chinese nationals were perceived as moderate regarding competence and warmth, indicating that being co-ethnic immigrants may not result in in-group inclusivity. Caucasians were viewed as an in-group with high competence and warmth. Social media consumption and heterogeneous discussion were significantly associated with stereotypes for co-ethnic immigrants. For other-ethnic immigrants, social media consumption was associated with competence. Implications for theory and policy are discussed.

AB  - Since the 2016 US presidential election, the deliberate spread of misinformation online, and on social media in particular, has generated extraordinary concern, in large part because of its potential effects on public opinion, political polarization, and ultimately democratic decision making. Recently, however, a handful of papers have argued that both the prevalence and consumption of "fake news" per se is extremely low compared with other types of news and news-relevant content. Although neither prevalence nor consumption is a direct measure of influence, this work suggests that proper understanding of misinformation and its effects requires a much broader view of the problem, encompassing biased and misleading"but not necessarily factually incorrect"information that is routinely produced or amplified by mainstream news organizations. In this paper, we propose an ambitious collective research agenda to measure the origins, nature, and prevalence of misinformation, broadly construed, as well as its impact on democracy. We also sketch out some illustrative examples of completed, ongoing, or planned research projects that contribute to this agenda.

AB  - The aim of this sociolinguistically-oriented study is to explore the Arabizi phenomenon which is characterized by spelling Arabic words using the Latin script. It is prevalent in the text-based computer-mediated communications among Saudi Arabians. The study focuses on why Arabizi is used, how, particularly in respect to with whom and in which topics, it is used, the attitudes of its users toward its use and the perceived advantages and disadvantages of its use. Using an online survey, data were collected from 241 participants, 72 of which were users of Arabizi. The findings revealed that the primary reasons for using Arabizi were its being a communication code among youths and a compensation for the lack of Arabic keyboard from technological devices as well as being more expressive than Arabic language. It was also found that Arabizi was primarily used to communicate with friends and individuals of the same age, but not with parents and older people or in formal relationships. In addition, the study revealed that Arabizi is used in occasional conversations and social matters, but not in academic, scientific, business, economic, religious or poetry and literature- related topics. Arabizi users were found to hold both positive and negative attitudes based on different advantages and disadvantages of the phenomenon. These findings will be discussed and recommendations for future research will be given.

AB  - On 7 April, 2017 a terrorist attack occurred, in central Stockholm. A hijacked lorry was intentionally driven into crowds along a pedestrian street. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively explore how media framed this terrorist attack. The data collection approach was inductive and explorative mainly involving searching electronic media databases. The qualitative analysis of 1294 articles resulted in four overarching themes describing how the terrorist attack was framed in the media. These frames are as follows: the incident, framed as confirmed, unconfirmed and denied information; the perception of leadership and authorities as trustworthy; the site perceived as a place of sorrow; and crisis management framed as the initial and sequential framing of the professionals, the heroes and the villains. The primary conclusion is that true as well as fake news affects crisis management and public opinion, which may create challenges for the entire society within the crisis management area.

AB  - Persuasion is a vital part of politics-who wins elections and policy disputes often depends on which side can persuade more people. Given this centrality, the study of persuasion has a long history with an enormous number of theories and empirical inquiries. However, the literature is fragmented, with few generalizable findings. I unify previously disparate dimensions of this topic by presenting a framework focusing on actors (speakers and receivers), treatments (topics, content, media), outcomes (attitudes, behaviors, emotions, identities), and settings (competition, space, time, process, culture). This Generalizing Persuasion (GP) Framework organizes distinct findings and offers researchers a structure in which to situate their work. I conclude with a discussion of the normative implications of persuasion.

T2  - AUSTRALIAN HISTORICAL STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - The 1951 referendum campaign to ban communism produced a massive shift of public opinion, from Yes to No. This article attempts to explain why. It examines the political appeals and rhetoric of the Liberal and Labor Party leaders, their coverage across the entire metropolitan press, and their use of radio. Breaking with earlier interpretations, it argues that Evatt's campaign encompassed wider issues than civil liberties, suggests that Menzies' campaign was damaged by unruly meetings and shows that neither side appealed exclusively to reason' or to passion'. Ultimately, the success of the No campaign rested on its capacity to mobilise most Labor voters and to attract some Liberals. This was an extraordinary achievement, but it was secured using routine forms of electioneering.

AB  - The US welfare state provides key benefits indirectly. The Affordable Care Act (ACA), for example, uses a package including exchanges, subsidies, and penalties to increase health insurance enrollment. Prior research indicates that indirect policies do not produce feedback effects on public opinion, but the ACA was unusually salient and complex. Can such indirect policies produce feedback effects, and are any such effects heterogeneous? Here, we use several data sets and inferential strategies to show that groups especially affected by the exchanges and the associated insurance mandate did shift their ACA attitudes, albeit in opposing directions and with more limited effects than descriptive analyses suggest. Those who experienced rising local prices became more opposed to the ACA, while those who stood to benefit from some changes to the individual markets became more favorable. Overall, positive changes in attitudes were offset by demographically concentrated, negative shifts among the uninsured.

AB  - This study explores how agenda-setting theory works in a fragmented media environment while examining psychological motivations that drive selective exposure and information processing in an electoral context. The data suggest that regardless of motivational goals, people with a moderate active need for orientation (NFO) spent more time engaged in cross-network exposure to news media than the other groups. However, driven by directional goals, they were more apt to engage in biased information processing that increased agenda-setting outcomes on candidate attributes. Overall, this study suggests that NFO predicts information-seeking behavior, while motivated reasoning explains how people processed information. Exposure to partisan news reporting on cable television exhibited the strongest agenda-setting associations on candidate attributes.

AB  - Groundwater is a common pool resource that supports agriculture, human communities, and the environment. Public participation in common pool natural resources management can be affected by media representation of stakeholders and perceptions of identity as a stakeholder. Newspaper media has an outsized influence on framing subject matter, expertise, organizations, and who should participate. Media shapes individual, local, and regional perspectives around resource management and defines potential solutions to natural resources management. This study analyzes media coverage about California's new Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) to understand impacts on public participation in common pool natural resources management and to identify represented stakeholders and solutions involved in groundwater sustainability. A total of 365 newspaper articles were collected from California newspapers in three readership locations. We also searched for representation of SGMA in Spanish-language publications. Article characteristics were analyzed through qualitative content analysis and quantitative nonparametric analysis. Results indicate bias for featuring agricultural industry, politician, and water managers' voices. Solutions for managing water resources were focused on new supply, demand reduction and infrastructure investment, though novel solutions were also presented. Most newspaper articles included few stakeholders and solutions, illustrating isolated, short narratives about a common pool resource. The trends and gaps in representation in California media coverage may contribute to the public's low levels of engagement in groundwater planning. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The rapid development of different social media and content-sharing platforms has been largely exploited to spread misinformation and fake news that make people believing in harmful stories, which allow to influence public opinion, and could cause panic and chaos among population. Thus, fake news detection has become an important research topic, aiming at flagging a specific content as fake or legitimate. The fake news detection solutions can be divided into three main categories: content-based, social context-based, and knowledge-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid fake news detection system that combines linguistic and knowledge-based approaches and inherits their advantages, by employing two different sets of features: (1) linguistic features (i.e., title, number of words, reading ease, lexical diversity,and sentiment), and (2) a novel set of knowledge-based features, called fact-verification features that comprise three types of information namely, (i) reputation of the website where the news is published, (ii) coverage, i.e., number of sources that published the news, and (iii) fact-check, i.e., opinion of well-known fact-checking websites about the news, i.e., true or false. The proposed system only employs eight features, which is less than most of the state-of-the-art approaches. Also, the evaluation results on a fake news dataset show that the proposed system employing both types of features can reach an accuracy of 94.4%, which is better compared to that obtained from separately employing linguistic features (i.e., accuracy=89.4%) and fact-verification features (i.e., accuracy=81.2%).

AB  - A content analysis was conducted to examine depression-related discourses by public opinion leaders and mainstream media in the Chinese social media platform Sina Weibo, as well as the impact of these discourses on their followers. The study revealed that stereotypical presentations of people with depression by influential sources often promoted stigmatization of or reduced support for depressed individuals among their followers. Environmental and genetic attributions for the disease in the original posts reduced stigmatization in the response posts. Information about recovery and treatment proved to be a double-edged sword, reducing stigmatization and support among followers at the same time. The use of a crime context to discuss depression in the original posts often promoted stigmatization, while discussing it in a health context increased support in the response posts.

AB  - Using framing theory and research on sexual violence and the media, this study looks at media representations of three "high profile" sexual violence cases in two popular American newspapers. It explores key words, frames, and whether or not there have been any changes from 2014 to 2018. While laws exist in the U.S. to prevent sexual violence (e.g. Violence Against Women Act of 1994), sexual violence is a major public health issue in the U.S. According to the CDC, every 98 seconds someone is sexually assaulted; more than 570 people experience sexual violence in the country every day. In 2017, the #MeToo movement brought sexual violence to the limelight. The media plays an important role in practice, policy, and public perception of sexual violence; it is suggested that policies are influenced by public opinion. A qualitative content analysis was conducted on articles between 2014 and 2018 about Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, and Brock Turner published in the Washington Post and New York Times. While Cosby and Turner's cases are officially closed, Weinstein is awaiting trial. In total, 195 articles were coded. The results are supported by previous theories and studies. The analysis shows that articles about sexual assault often still use euphemisms, portray stereotypes, favour the perpetrator, show scepticism towards the survivors, and unnecessarily sensationalise the crimes. However, there seems to be a slight change after the Weinstein case and #MeToo. Articles from 2017 to 2018 employed the social science frame more. Additionally, thematic news framing was prevalent. This study ultimately aims to introduce a theory: that current media representations of sexual violence are inappropriate and may affect public opinion, thus playing a role in impeding policy change.

AB  - Journalists and readers of celebrity news regularly bash celebrities online, a behavior that is easily accepted among adolescents. This study investigates whether these attitudes of acceptance differ according to the perpetrator of the bashing (media versus public) and the likeability of the involved celebrity (liked versus disliked). Using a vignette study, we examine adolescent girls' attitudes toward media (journalists') and public (readers') bashing of a generally disliked celebrity (Miley Cyrus) and a generally liked celebrity (Selena Gomez). All participants read an identical negative news story (media bashing) and two related negative reader comments (public bashing). Participants were randomly assigned to read this information about either Miley Cyrus or Selena Gomez. Results of a mixed-design ANOVA showed that the girls had less negative attitudes toward media bashing compared with public bashing. Moreover, they more easily accepted the bashing of a disliked celebrity than the bashing of a liked celebrity.

AB  - Homonegative prejudice has long been connected with poor psychological outcomes. These have often been purported to include internalized homonegativity (IH), an outcome regarded as especially detrimental given its association with a large number of adverse mental health correlates. Given the evidence that homonegative prejudice often prevails most strongly within many mainstream religious contexts, the current study examined whether religious lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) individuals would possess higher levels of internalized homonegativity than their nonreligious, and formerly religious, LGB counterparts. To test this hypothesis, Christian, formerly Christian, and nonreligious Australian LGB respondents (N = 579), recruited through social media platforms and a diverse range of community groups, completed an online survey assessing IH; religion-sexuality distress; religious and familial homonegativity; sense of self; and outness. Ordinal logistic regressions revealed that Christian LGB respondents possessed significantly more IH than nonreligious respondents. Furthermore, perceiving greater homonegativity in one's religious and familial environments predicted higher levels of distress and IH among Christians specifically. Despite having apostatized, former Christians still reported greater religion-sexuality distress than nonreligious individuals, suggesting that the psychological effects of homonegative religious environments are potentially enduring. Across all respondents, IH was also greater for males, those who were less "out," and those who possessed a weaker sense of self. Findings generally support the premise that religious homonegativity places LGB Christians at additional psychological risk, with particular regard to IH and religion-sexuality identity conflict, and that both personal and interpersonal characteristics may exacerbate this risk.

AB  - In this essay, I describe and evaluate the contemporary debate over support for Confederate icons. This debate is often stylized as "heritage" versus "hatred." In this debate, one side alleges that their favored Confederate symbols represent pride in Southern-Confederate identity, whereas the other urges that Confederate symbols represent racial hatred and white supremacy. I argue that the "heritage versus hatred" framing that typifies the public debate and the academic literature is not helpful. Additionally, the literature has largely ignored the views of Black Southerners, who have far more negative attitudes toward Confederate symbols compared to whites. Thus, many works implicitly assume a distinctly white southern past. Together, these shortcomings mean that existing research has likely overestimated overall public support for Confederate symbols and overstated the importance of Southern pride or heritage in informing that support, while at the same time underestimating the extent to which racial animus undergirds pro-Confederate views among whites.

AB  - Racial and ethnic division is a mainstay of the American social structure, and today these strains are exacerbated by political binaries. Moreover, the media has become increasingly polarized whereby certain media outlets intensify perceived differences between racial and ethnic groups, political alignments, and religious affiliations. Using data from a recent psychological study of the Alt-Right, we assess the associations between perceptions of social issues, feelings of status threat, trust in conservative media, and affiliation with the Alt-Right among White Americans. We find concern over more conservative social issues along with trust in conservative media explain a large portion of the variation in feelings of status threat among White Americans. Furthermore, more conservative social issues plus feeling of status threat significantly increase the odds of Alt-Right affiliation. Most surprisingly, however, trust in conservative media mitigated, instead of amplified, these associations. Implications and calls for future research are discussed.

AB  - One of the most important activities of the European Union (EU) has been widening the Union, that is, enlargement. Tapping to what extent and why EU citizens support future enlargement rounds has become a popular endeavour among researchers and EU officials. During recent years, a number of studies have indicated that public support for EU integration is likely to also depend on how the national news media portray the EU. Based on an experimental survey design, we test the effects of two news frames on support for future Serbian EU candidacy. We find that exposure to news frames has considerable impact on general understanding of Serbian EU candidacy, issue interpretation, and policy support. This effect is moderated by political knowledge. Knowledgeable participants were able to express their thoughts on Serbian EU candidacy more elaborately, whereas low-knowledge individuals were overall more susceptible to framing effects. We discuss the implications of our findings for current debates such as Euroskepticism and decreasing public support for EU integration.

KW  - METAANALYSIS
KW  - NIMBY
AB  - Europe recently experienced a large influx of refugees, spurring much public debate about the admission and integration of refugees and migrants into society. Previous research based on cross-sectional data found that European citizens generally favour asylum seekers with high employability, severe vulnerabilities, and Christians over Muslims. These preferences and attitudes were found to be homogeneous across countries and socio-demographic groups. Here, we do not study the general acceptance of asylum seekers, but the acceptance of refugee and migrant homes in citizens' vicinity and how it changes over time. Based on a repeated stated choice experiment on preferences for refugee and migrant homes, we show that the initially promoted "welcome culture" towards refugees in Germany was not reflected in the views of a majority of a sample of German citizens who rather disapproved refugee homes in their vicinity. Their preferences have not changed between November 2015, the peak of "welcome culture," and November 2016, after political debates, media reporting and public discourse had shifted towards limiting admission of immigrants. A minority of one fifth of the sample population, who were initially rather approving of refugee and migrant homes being established in their vicinity, were more likely to change their preferences towards a rather disapproving position in 2016. Experience of contact with refugees and migrants, higher education, and general pro-immigration attitudes explain acceptance of refugee and migrant homes as well as preference stability over time. Country of origin and religion of refugees and migrants are considered less important than decent housing conditions and whether refugee and migrants arrive as families or single persons. In this respect our results highlight the importance of humanitarian aspects of sheltering and integration of refugees and other migrants into society.

AB  - Based on the persuasive press inference, this study examined the role of partisan sources and audiences' involvement in their perceptions of public opinion. An online experiment (N = 221) was conducted in South Korea. This study found that partisan sources indirectly affected audiences' perceptions of public opinion by influencing their perceived news slant. Audiences' value-relevant involvement, rather than outcome-relevant involvement, significantly moderated the effect of perceived news slant on their perceptions of public opinion. Moreover, the indirect effect of partisan sources on the perceptions of public opinion was stronger for those with higher levels of value-relevant involvement. The implications of these findings were discussed.

Using Web-resources derived from social media platforms, the CSS uses a spatially-situated social network graph to harvest user-generated content from selected organizations and members of the public. This allows passively' contributed social media-based opinions, along with different variables, such as time, location, social interaction, service usage, and human activities to be examined and used to identify trending views and influential citizens. The data model and CSS are used for demonstration purposes to identify geotopics and community interests relevant to municipal affairs in the City of Toronto, Canada.

AB  - Public opinion researchers often find changing attitudes about pressing public health issues to be a difficult task and even when attitudes do change, behaviors often do not. However, salient real-world events have the ability to bring public health crises to the fore in unique ways. To assess the impact of localized public health events on individuals' self-reported behavior, this paper examines Floridians' intentions to take preventative measures against the Zika virus before and after the first locally transmit- ted case of Zika emerged in Florida. We find that local and national media coverage of Zika increased significantly following its first transmission in the U.S. Critically, we also find that Floridians surveyed after this increase in media coverage were more likely to pay attention to Zika-related news, and self-report intentions to take protective action against the virus. These results suggest that behavioral intentions can shift as health threats become more proximate.

AB  - From its publication in 1978, Edward Said's magnum opusOrientalismhas generated fierce and unrelenting debates regarding its epistemology and scope, and the interpretive validity of its Western cultural representations of the self and other. Since then, however, the world has become increasingly governed by different sets of assumptions, ideologies, relations of production and reproduction, and matrixes of power relations. This article considers whether orientalism has kept its hold on Western public opinion, media presentations, political elites, and sections of the scholarly community's mode of thinking in the current neo-liberal, globalised, digitalised and securitised world. It also considers whether its mutation has shifted to engender a paradigmatic change and argues that alongside the old-style orientalism, a more sophisticated, subtle, and up-to-date perspective has appeared. Although its emphases, concerns and methodologies might represent a certain departure from old orientalist dogmas, its objective seems to remain largely intact.

AB  - The media often link Black characters and violence. This is especially true in video games, in which Black male characters are virtually always violent. This research tested the effects of playing a violent game as a Black (vs. White) avatar on racial stereotypes and aggression. In Experiment 1, White participants (N = 126) who played a violent video game as a Black avatar displayed stronger implicit and explicit negative attitudes toward Blacks than did participants who played a violent video game as a White avatar or a nonviolent game as a Black or White avatar. In Experiment 2, White participants (N = 141) who played a violent video game as a Black (vs. White) avatar displayed stronger implicit attitudes linking Blacks to weapons. Implicit attitudes, in turn, related to subsequent aggression. Black violent video game avatars not only make players more aggressive than do White avatars, they also reinforce stereotypes that Blacks are violent.

AB  - Through a focus on the media's role in constructing and maintaining stereotypes of white privilege and racism, this paper investigates the stereotyping of the Sutherland Shire, Sydney, Australia, and its residents. Print media plays a significant role in constructing social identities, shaping public opinion and typecasting public perception. Using a media content analysis and surveys with residents and non-residents of the Sutherland Shire we (de)construct the area's positioning in media discourse as white, insular and privileged. Pivotal to this investigation was the 2005 Cronulla riots and their influence on assertions of white privilege and racism, in the media and by non-Sutherland Shire residents. While not vindicating some resident's roles in the riots, we reason that such typecasting provides an avenue for the predominately white media, and white Sydney to deflect responsibility for their own whiteness by attributing and spatializing racist sentiment to elsewhere in Sydney.

AB  - Online social networks have been incorporated into people's work and daily lives as social media and services continue to develop. Opinion leaders are social media activists who forward and filter messages in mass communication. Therefore, competent monitoring of opinion leaders may, to some extent, influence the spread and growth of public opinion. Most traditional opinion leader mining approaches focus solely on the user's network structure, neglecting the significance and role of semantic information in the generation of opinion leaders. Furthermore, these methods rank the influence of users globally and lack effectiveness in detecting local opinion leaders with low influence. This paper presents a community-based opinion leader mining approach in semantic social networks to address these issues. Firstly, we present a new node semantic feature representation method and community detection algorithm to generate the local public opinion circle. Then, a novel influence calculation method is proposed to find local opinion leaders by combining the global structure of the network and local structure of the public opinion circle. Finally, nodes with high comprehensive influence are identified as opinion leaders. Experiments on real social networks indicate that the proposed method can accurately measure global and local influence in social networks, as well as increase the accuracy of local opinion leader mining.

AB  - The purpose is to improve the power and innovate the communication mode of mainstream I&P (Ideological and Political) education in C&U (Colleges and Universities). The opportunities and challenges that I&P education is facing or will face in media times are analyzed from three factors: the subjective, the mediator, and the environment, which affect the power of mainstream I&P in C&U. Educational means, carriers, resources, places and times, and the interactions between educators and the educated can bring opportunities for the improvement of the educational power of C&U. However, there are great challenges in all aspects of the mainstream ideology, such as education methods, education ideas, education content, education leadership and discourse power, and network public opinion control. Finally, a series of measures are proposed to improve the power of mainstream I&P education in C&U in media times, and they are updating the concept of media education, strengthening the ideological guidance, ensuring the direction of mainstream I&P education, and optimizing the media environment so that a more perfect innovative mode of I&P education is constructed. The research enriches and develops the theory of mainstream I&P education in C&U, innovates the methods of mainstream I&P education in C&U, and enhances the power of mainstream I&P education.

AB  - East Asia has rarely been an object of media framing studies, despite its coherent cultural heritage and political importance. Seizing upon the media's intensive attention on the Pivot to Asia Strategy of the Obama administration, this study looked into the U.S. media's framing of East Asia and how it has changed over time. A mixed-method analysis of editorials and op-ed articles of U.S. national newspapers between 1997 and 2013 identified two contrasting macro frames. The ideological frame that reflects U.S. hegemonic interest has been gradually replaced by the transactional frame as the dominant frame of East Asia. Under the transactional frame, the media were less likely than under the ideological frame to highlight the values such as democracy, human rights, and free economic market. In each issue-specific frame, focus shifted from maintaining global status quo to regional balance of power, from global free market to bilateral economic competition. Implications on the recent foreign policy developments are discussed.

AB  - This paper examines how Muslim American advocacy organizations have responded to recent spikes in anti-Muslim discrimination, particularly in the context of the 2016 elections. It asks how Muslim American interest groups have helped frame and communicate the policy interests of U.S. Muslims and, consequently, the collective claims of the group on whose behalf they claim to speak. Relying on political ethnography as the main method of inquiry, I conduct in-depth participant observation, qualitative interviews with Muslim American leaders, and an analysis of primary documents and social media communication produced by Muslim American organizations. This data was collected between June 2016 and July 2017, and transcribed and coded using Nvivo. Through this analysis, I find that being targeted as "other" has driven Muslim advocacy organizations to rely on constituent empowerment strategies, mobilize in demand of Muslim American group rights, defend their constitutional rights, and claim their place as an American minority.

AB  - Literature on agenda-building dynamics has neglected to assess the impact of contextual factors on the interplays between the issue attention of political actors and of the media. I fill the void by highlighting how media storms cause significant changes to the electoral communicational environment. Using a custom dataset compiled through an automated content analysis, I empirically examine patterns of issue salience during the 2015 Canadian federal election. The results support three main points. First, media storms do emerge during election campaigns. Second, media storms cause two main types of changes in the informational environment that characterize nonstorm periods: (1) a reduction in the variety of issues included in the daily campaign coverage, and (2) a higher concentration of media attention on the storm-generating issues. Third, coverage of media storms compels political parties to engage with them, especially if they can exploit these storms with minimal risks. These findings suggest that some electoral contexts may be less conducive to political actors' influence. They also offer evidence in support of the mediatization theory, according to which media market logic can take precedence over political normative logic in guiding the decisions of political actors.

AB  - The media is widely recognised as contributing to stigma associated with mental illness by portraying it in connection with violence and/or undesirable traits. In response, campaigns directed at policing language use, imagery and story content in the media have been implemented. But these interventions can themselves perpetuate stereotypes and assumptions that ultimately run counter to the original intent of challenging stigma. By way of illustration this paper analyses an Australian campaign that I argue invites people to see stigma in innocuous uses of ordinary language and imagery, effectively associating mental illness with that which it seeks to challenge. The grounds for its criticism and praise of stories about mental illness are also often tenuous and based on a limited approach to determining the impact of story content. The pitfalls of this type of campaign can be avoided by taking heed of the shifts in thinking advocated by postpsychiatry and the deconstructionist strategies employed by activists in the mental health field.

AB  - This study assesses the relationship between political partisanship and attitudes and behavior with respect to the H1N1 virus (swine flu) crisis of 2009 in general, and the U. S. mass vaccination program in particular. I argue that even seemingly nonpartisan political issues like public health are increasingly characterized by partisan polarization in public attitudes and that such polarization is attributable, at least partly, to the breakdown of the information commons that characterized the U. S. mass media from roughly the 1950s until the early 1990s. In its place has arisen an increasingly fragmented and niche-oriented media marketplace in which individuals are better able to limit their information exposure to attitudes and opinions that reinforce, rather than challenge, their preexisting beliefs. I test my argument against a variety of data sources, including opinion surveys and state-level swine flu vaccination rate data.

AB  - Objectives: The aims of this study were to (a) assess knowledge of official vaccination recommendations and attitudes towards vaccinations among adults and (b) examine their association with vaccination uptake among adults.
   Methods: This study was part of the HaBIDS study (Hygiene and Behaviour Infectious Diseases Survey), which is an online panel established in March 2014 in Lower Saxony, Germany with males and females aged between 15 and 69 years (n = 2379). Every few months, participants completed questionnaires on different aspects of infectious diseases. In September 2014, knowledge of vaccination recommendations, attitudes towards vaccinations and information on uptake of vaccinations in the last 10 years (practice) were collected using a knowledge-attitude-practice (KAP) questionnaire. Multiple correspondence analysis was applied to identify underlying structures in each KAP domain and fractional polynomial regression analysis to examine the associations of knowledge and attitudes with vaccination uptake.
   Results: Of the 2379 panel members, 1698 (71%) completed the KAP questionnaire on vaccinations. The majority of participants (80%) knew that the vaccine against diphtheria and tetanus should be administered every 10 years. Regarding other recommendations, the proportion of correct answers varied between 35% and 60%. 82% of participants agreed that adult vaccinations should be mandatory for selected groups such as health care workers and 40% stated that vaccinations should be mandatory for all adults. For the different vaccines, the odds of being unvaccinated were 1.5- to 5-times higher among participants with poor knowledge of vaccination recommendations compared to participants with good knowledge. Participants with negative attitudes towards vaccinations were also more likely to be unvaccinated.
   Conclusions: Efforts should be undertaken to improve knowledge of official vaccination recommendations in the general population and reduce common misconceptions about vaccinations. This information can be provided during general practitioner visits or through media campaigns. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Major political events around the globe have been subject to disinformation campaigns that leverage intentionally misleading content to influence public opinion. The disruption created by the micro-targeted dissemination of disinformation presents a problem for democracies: how should democracies, where legitimacy is derived from free and fair elections, respond to this phenomenon? In the United Kingdom, Westminster's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) Committee opened an inquiry into the role of disinformation in the Brexit vote that culminated with numerous recommendations. Using securitization theory as a framework for analysis, this article explores the work of the DCMS Committee and its reception by the UK Government, Facebook, and the general public. It contributes to a deeper understanding of how democracies can respond to disinformation, providing a building block for future studies on state strategies to regulate technology platforms. The findings suggest the Committee successfully established a securitizing frame around disinformation.

AB  - Drawing from the tripartite sociocultural model of body image, the researchers examined whether direct messages and modeling from peers, parents, and media were concurrently and prospectively associated with appearance-based rejection sensitivity (appearance-RS) in young adolescents (M-age=12.0years). Appearance-RS was higher among those who concurrently reported more appearance-related teasing and pressure by peers, more parent teasing, and greater acceptance of media appearance ideals. In prospective analyses, greater increases in appearance-RS over 1year were found for adolescents who perceived higher levels of parental appearance-related teasing and negative attitudes about their own appearance. Moderation analyses indicated the positive prospective association between parental negative appearance attitudes and appearance-RS was found in younger but not older participants. Gender did not moderate associations.

AB  - This study investigates the effects of media frames on attitudes toward video games, perceptions of their users, and consequences. Prior research has shown that gaming is a controversial issue, with media coverage focusing on either risks or opportunities. To examine the effects of these portrayals, the present study used a 2 x 2 experimental design and exposed participants (N = 360) to a news article that framed gaming in terms of risk or opportunity on the journalistic level and on the level of a corresponding expert statement. By examining the perceived negative effects of games, this study extends previous research by combining framing and third-person research. Results showed that framing gaming indeed had an effect on participants' attitudes. This framing effect was moderated by individual video game use. Despite identifying a traditional third-person perception regarding negative video game effects, we found framing to have no significant influence on third-person perceptions.

AB  - In order to design a more efficient way for media to report the environmental risk affairs, a comparison study was designed to analysis how the idea of public might influence the news narration. This paper analysis the frame of Chinese and Japanese reports about NIMBY. Results shows that the media frame are influenced by the concept of public: the two countries' reports about NIMBY have their own characteristics, the number and form of public and private frames are different. In the end, from the theory of public, the difference of the two country had been explained, and the importance for how media should report environmental risk affairs had been discussed. That is the media should hold the idea of new public when doing the NIMBY or relevant environmental risk news report, which should balance the relationship between government, people and the public.

AB  - Using Weblog files and an online survey on Sina Weibo (N = 754), this article (1) empirically examined Chinese social media credibility in validated indexes; (2) compared the credibility of 12 types of media, which yielded three genres: traditional media, Web 1.0, and social media; and (3) explored the predictors of social media credibility. Results indicated SW users rate social media moderately high, especially on its fairness and unbiasedness, rather than accuracy. Comparatively, they trust traditional media most (especially newspaper) and social media least (especially SNS), although social media are more popular and rated fairly credible alone. Users' frequency of traditional media use and social media use, information-seeking motivation, and innovativeness has a positive impact on social media credibility. Reversely, users' join date, participation, trust inclination, education, and age negatively influence social media credibility.

AB  - In July 2018, the socialist government asked the Spanish Royal Academy for a report on a possible wording of the Spanish Constitution with inclusive language, a report that was published on 16 January 2020. The aim of this article is to analyse the media impact in the Spanish press of both the news about the request for the report (2018) and the report itself (2020) and to demonstrate how the information focused by the headlines, the lexical selection, the elements of assessment and the people who interact in them can condition public opinion and further contribute to the polarisation of the existing debate between Academia and Feminism. For this purpose, we have analysed a corpus of 216 Spanish digital press texts obtained from the DISMUPREN database. The analysis shows that ideological biases exist not only in opinion journalism, but also in the news.

AB  - Labor unions play a prominent role in the economy and in politics, and have long been depicted by opponents as an overly powerful, corrupt and economically harmful institution. In labor-related news in recent years, anti-union rhetoric has regularly focused on union workers themselves, frequently portraying them as overpaid, greedy and undeserving of their wealth, while also drawing a contrast between the compensation of union vs. non-union workers. This type of rhetoric is referred to here as class-based anti-union rhetoric (CAR). Despite its prevalence, it remains unknown whether CAR affects public opinion toward unions. This study uses a series of national survey experiments to demonstrate that exposure to CAR reduces the perceived similarity of targeted union workers, unions' perceived deservingness of public support and support for pro-union legislation. Moreover, CAR repeatedly nullified or reversed the otherwise positive relationship between the strength of worker identity and solidarity with union workers.

AB  - In an era of multiplatform journalism and the extraordinary ease of presenting views online, democracies face a key challenge, namely convincing citizens of the rightness of the solutions put forward. The concepts of "deliberative communication" offer a seemingly simple solution to the search for social consensus. However, citizens are much more exposed than in the past to disinformation, misdirection and purposeful manipulation. This study examines the quality of public debate in the adoption of major health legislation in the Slovak Republic. The aim is to highlight the different attitudes of the participants to the debate and the different motivations of the participants in the broad public debate. The study presents an analysis of the outputs of professional organisations and political representatives at national and regional level. It highlights the biased coverage of local media and the level of debate involving an exceptionally large range of speakers.

AB  - Introduction: This study tries to visualize the Twitter activism networks and their opinion leader with the case of #FreeWestPapua activism. This study is important to find out who the opinion leaders and their networks are. This study also provides an overview of how the opinion leader frames opinions about #FreeWestPapua activism on Twitter.
   Methods: This research used Social Media Network Analysis (SMNA). The SMNA method is the application of the Social Network Analysis (SNA) method to examine conversations on social media. Data collection and data processing are collected and visualised with Netlytic.
   Findings: The results showed that there are 13 opinion leaders and all of the opinion leaders are from outside Papua. This study concluded that there is alienation in separatist activism in the case of #FreeWestPapua on Twitter. The most influential opinion leader in the separatist activism on Twitter is @VeronicaKoman who has the biggest values and is also active to frame public opinion. #FreeWestpapua activism framed Indonesia as a colonial in diagnostic framing and #FreeWestPapua as a solution in prognostic framing. To attract support from the international community, opinion leaders in #FreeWestPapua activism took advantage of the various #BlackLivesMatter issue and other international moments such as Korindo news by BBC.com .
   Originality: Although a lot of research on the Free Papua Movement has been done, there has never been a study explains about who opinion leaders and their networks and also how they are framed public opinion about #FreeWestPapua activism on social media.

AB  - With police facing constant negative publicity, concerns have been raised that officers working the street will draw back on their efforts. Prior research relying on official data has not found increases in crime as a result of this so-called Ferguson or de-policing effect. In the present study, it is argued that officers' own reported willingness to initiate proactive enforcement activities should be added to this body of research. If there is a Ferguson effect, it most likely exists in the realm of high-discretion, low-visibility decision making. Data are from surveys administered in-person to officers in a large, urban department. Results show that officers who perceive higher levels of negative publicity feel that police are less likely to self-initiate stops. Those who feared being filmed unfairly also reported reluctance among their colleagues. Perceptions of being supported by top management appeared to be a protective factor, with those experiencing strong support from managers reporting less concern about self-initiated enforcement. Findings support the existence of a de-policing or Ferguson effect insofar as intense scrutiny from the public and media appear to discourage some officers from initiating proactive stops. This indicates that when de-policing occurs, it is likely concentrated among high-discretion, low-visibility decisions.

AB  - Social media platforms such as blogs, Twitter (R) accounts, and online discussion sites are large-scale forums where every individual can potentially voice an influential public opinion. According to recent surveys, a massive number of Internet users are turning to such forums to collect recommendations and reviews for products and services, and to shape their individual choices and stances by the commentary of the online community as a whole. The unsupervised extraction of insight from unstructured user-generated web content requires new methodologies that are likely to be rooted in natural language processing and machine-learning techniques. Furthermore, the unprecedented scale of data begging to be analyzed necessitates the implementation of these methodologies on modern distributed computing platforms. In this paper, we describe a flexible new family of low-rank matrix approximation algorithms for modeling topics in a given corpus of documents (e.g., blog posts and tweets). We benchmark distributed optimization algorithms for running these models in a Hadoop (TM)-enabled cluster environment. We describe online learning strategies for tracking the evolution of ongoing topics and rapidly detecting the emergence of new themes in a streaming setting.

AB  - Shark attacks have increased globally and are one of the most widely reported human-wildlife conflicts. Reflecting global trends, the number of recorded attacks has increased in Australian waters. Whether positively or negatively affected, stakeholders potentially often pressure authorities to mitigate economic and human risks when developing shark management policies. This article used discourse analysis to review how attitudes toward management approaches were attributed in Australian newspapers to a range of stakeholders. The most frequently attributed stakeholders were journalists and public office holders; victims, commercial operators, and scientists were least attributed. Although most measures were portrayed as supported by a majority of stakeholders, there was apparent misalignment between reported public and policymaker attitudes, especially regarding lethal control. Despite the ramifications (e.g., social, biological) of shark management and policymaking, reporting of science-informed facts and use of scientists to inform debate were low. Opportunities exist for increased engagement among scientists, journalists, and policymakers.

KW  - BIAS
AB  - Social scientists have documented rapid polarization in public opinion about COVID-19 policies. Such polarization is somewhat unsurprising given experimental studies that show opinions on novel issues can diverge quickly in the presence of partisan frames. In this paper I describe a different process that operates alongside polarization: not centrism but a lack of opinion formation. Drawing on four rounds of in-depth interviews with 86 Midwesterners, conducted between June 2019 and November 2020, I take an inductive approach to understanding variation in the processes by which people gathered and interpreted information about COVID-19. I find that those with universal distrust in all media struggled to adjudicate between conflicting interpretations of reality, particularly if they also had low political knowledge. The result was that they felt little confidence in any opinions they formed. These findings suggest that deteriorating trust in media is an important and understudied factor shaping trajectories of opinion formation.

AB  - The European Parliament (EP) is the only directly elected institution at the European Union (EU) level, and its empowerment was long regarded to quasi-automatically lead to greater legitimacy of EU politics. The strength of the EP has grown continuously. However, this has not translated into greater appreciation of a crisis-ridden EU which seems more fundamentally questioned than ever before. Starting from the assumption that mass media serve as the most important source of political information and therefore as a crucial connective interface, we explore newspaper contents about the EP and their effects on public support for it to assess the actual link between the people's representation at EU level and the people at home. The analysis is conducted for EP elections of 2009 and 2014 in Finland, Germany and the UK. Results suggest that effects of coverage on public support of the EP became stronger and more direct in 2014, which is explained by the increased salience of EU politics in times of crisis. However, expectations of what the EP is or should be may have to be adapted to the reality of a second-order parliament.

AB  - Various online contents on Internet platforms or search engines are related to the corporate reputation. Facing the huge amount of online contents, we need a mining method that can automatically extract and analyze a large number of network-related information and obtain the real reliability of aspect for the content claimed by companies. In this paper, we propose to generate a ranking model to verify whether the sales-rankings claimed by companies are trustworthy. The key idea is that the company that has higher confidence score should be supported by the online media. We use a unique data set of public opinion data related with a specific company, which we supplement with data from various online news platform and retrieval webpages using a distributed and generic Web crawler. Meanwhile, basic information and open financial data of companies are also collected for auxiliary analysis. We present a Maximal Marginal Relevance-based ranking model to compute the confidence score of each company, taking into consideration the two technologies of word embedding and KL-Divergence to filter the irrelevant documents. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art MMR-based method, and we showcase three representative cases about the corporate reputation built by us that gives positive, neutral, and negative support respectively to the sales-ranking claim of companies.

AB  - The construction of certain country images and identities is traditionally studied in relation to public diplomacy, strategic communication and nation branding practices of state and non-state actors. However, we notice the increased instrumentalization of country images and identities in debates on issues beyond strategic promotional practices, such as those articulated around elections, referendums or migration. We analyse how Swiss media constructed Switzerland's image and identity in the debate following the 2014 referendum on 'stop mass immigration' initiative, in times of populism, a communication phenomenon and ideology discursively articulated by political and media actors. Thus, we: (1) bridge streams of research on country images, identities, migration and populism that have yet to be integrated; (2) propose critical discourse analysis to identify specific discursive strategies (offering insights into alternative methodologies for studying populist political communication content and style); (3) highlight the role of media in reproducing populist discourses on country images and identities.

AB  - This study analyzes how perceptions of the popularity of political parties (i.e., the current opinion climate) and expectations about parties' future electoral performance (i.e., the future opinion climate) are formed. Theoretically, the paper integrates research on the sources of public opinion perception and empirically draws on a representative survey carried out before the 2013 German federal election. We show that the perceived media slant and opinions perceived in one's personal surroundings are closely related to perceptions of party popularity, whereas individual recall of poll results and personal opinions about the parties are not. However, poll results are shown to be the single most important predictor of expectations about the parties' future electoral success.

AB  - This project analyzed print news articles on cannabis legalization that were published in 2015 (N = 295) from newspapers across the United States. The following year, 2016, saw more states legalize cannabis for adult use and medical use than before. Therefore, one goal of this research was to investigate the relationship between reports on cannabis legalization and subsequent legal changes that occurred in states that reformed their cannabis laws. Findings reveal that cannabis legalization issues are reported in the media with tones that favor, oppose, or are neutral toward cannabis legalization. Overall, cannabis legalization stories were reported with a neutral tone. Additionally, arguments about whether cannabis should be legalized are framed using criminological, economic, medical, and political themes. The political theme emerged most frequently in all reports. Findings indicate that there is an association between the tone of positive reporting and subsequent cannabis legalization in states where those reports originated. These findings have implications for allowing policymakers and healthcare professionals to build on their existing knowledge of the relationship between media, public opinion, and emerging cannabis policy. Finally, this study provides some context for the connection between a story's theme, tone, and how they can shed light on cannabis legalization outcomes.

KW  - KNOWLEDGE
KW  - DYNAMICS
AB  - Objective Democratic governance requires that policy outcomes and public demand for policy be linked. While studies have shown empirical support for such a relationship in various policy domains, empirical evidence also indicates that the public is relatively unaware of policy outputs. This raises a puzzle: Why do policy outputs influence public attitudes if the public knows little about them? Methods This study seeks to address this paradox by examining the conditioning role of media coverage. We rely on data derived from the Policy Agendas Project in the United States, allowing us to analyze the relationship between policy outcomes, public preferences, and newspaper content across a long span of time (1972-2007). Results Our results indicate that public policy preferences respond to policy outputs, and that this relationship is strengthened by greater media attention to a policy area. Importantly, our findings also indicate that without media attention to a policy area, there is no direct effect of policy outputs on public demand for policy. Conclusions Media coverage appears to be a key factor for public responsiveness to occur. In the absence of policy coverage by the media, public responsiveness to policy outputs is greatly reduced.

AB  - Media plays an important role in illustrating the issue of interpersonal violence. Online media such as news portals and social media platforms are highly used in spreading the information virtually and digitally. However, the issue of interpersonal violence is still growing and has recently shown a significant spike. There are not many studies analyzing the exchange of information between these platforms digitally due to online news portals, which are operated by traditional media, and social media being treated as different entities. Yet, real-time posting may lead to an exchange of contents as they follow each other's agenda. A study on intermedia agenda-setting (IAS) - through issues published, agenda-setter, and sentiment - will enable us to understand how agenda setting plays a role in illustrating the issue of interpersonal violence. A content analysis study was conducted on six selected online media, consisting of mainstream and independent news portals and social media. A total of 815 samples of online news, articles and social media postings from five distinct issues were extracted to investigate the content and every 40 relevant comments from each news item were selected to identify how public opinion the portrayal of the issue in these selected online media. Indepth interview was conducted to eight field experts to gain clarification of the result from the content analysis study. Chi-square analysis on three hypotheses were significantly associated. Results revealed that public officials played a major role as the agenda setter. The Star which represents mainstream online news led in setting the agenda on interpersonal violence issues while Facebook which represents social media followed next in setting the agenda. During the process of intermedia agendasetting, negative sentiments were hugely expressed and exchanged which indicated the uneasiness, feeling disturbed and dissatisfaction on the interpersonal violence cases, which in the end resulted in the sharing and exchanging of news between mainstream news portals and social media. The agenda on social media was set by the public. This confirmed the effects of the flow of elite-non-elite-elite on IAS. Hence, this study contributed to the understanding of the agenda pattern used that also coexisted in different types of media which were created through the intermedia process.

AB  - People's opinion around social and political issues is currently witnessed by messages ordinarily posted on social media. With reference to a specific case study, namely the vaccination topic in Italy, this article discusses a crucial aspect in structuring the data processing pipeline in intelligent systems aimed at monitoring the public opinion through Twitter messages: A plain analysis of tweet contents is not sufficient to grasp the diversity of behavior across users. To get a sharper picture of the public opinion as expressed on social media, user-related information must be incorporated in the analysis. Relying on a dataset of tweets about vaccination and on an established text classification system, we present the results of a stance monitoring campaign with advanced analysis on temporal and spatial scales. The overall methodological workflow provides a sound solution for public opinion assessment from Twitter data.

AB  - Existing research into nativist populist (NP) rhetoric has shown that elite outgroups can be used by politicians to further anti-immigration agendas. The social identity functions of elite outgroups outside of cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, however, remain poorly understood. In addition, whether populist news media can be considered social identity entrepreneurs in their own right remains an underexplored topic. This study examines the rhetorical use of elite outgroups in the United Kingdom, United States, and Australia from a social identity perspective, focusing on political leaders and newspapers op-eds. Our findings demonstrate shared strategies across the countries and source types: (1) NPs depict elites as working through collusion to undermine trust in information production within society and vie for control of the ingroup informational influence; (2) NPs present themselves as nonelite and more ingroup prototypical on dimensions relevant to the elite collusion (being under attack and equally susceptible); (3) NPs contest ingroup norms through constructions of an anti-immigrant consensus which is suppressed by elites. We conclude that social identity researchers should pay more attention to the rhetorical functions of elite outgroups in addition to cultivating anti-immigrant prejudice, and that the media-as-identity-entrepreneur is an important aspect of constructing shared social realities, and mobilizing support, within populism.

AB  - The article contributes to the literature on the political use of hashtags. We argue that hashtag assemblages could be understood in the tradition of representing public opinion through datafication in the context of democratic politics. While traditional data-based epistemic practices like polls lead to the 'passivation' of citizens, in the digital constellation this tendency is currently challenged. In media like Twitter, hashtags serve as a technical operator to order the discursive fabrication of diverse publicly articulated opinions that manifest in the assemblage of tweets, algorithms and criticisms. We conceptualize such a critical public as an epistemic sensorium for dislocations based on the expression of experienced social imbalances and its political amplification. On the level of opinion formation, this constitutes a process of democratization, allowing for the expression of diverse opinions and issues even under singular hashtags. Despite this diversity, we see a strong tendency of publicly relevant actors such as news outlets to represent digital forms of opinion expression as unified movements. We argue that this tendency can partly be explained by the affordances of networked media, relating the process of objectification to the network position of the observer. We make this argument empirically plausible by applying methods of network analysis and topic modelling to a dataset of 196,987 tweets sampled via the hashtag #metwo that emerged in the German Twittersphere in the summer of 2018 and united a discourse concerned with racism and identity. In light of this data, we not only demonstrate the hashtag assemblage's heterogeneity and potential for subaltern agency; we also make visible how hashtag assemblages as epistemic practices are inherently dynamic, distinguishing it from opinion polling through the limited observational capacities and active participation of the actors representing its claims within the hybrid media system.

AB  - This article responds to Gozdziak's (2015: 30) call to explore how the knowledge that informs public debates about human trafficking is generated. Media imagery and narratives play a significant role in constructing both knowledge and ignorance. This article reflects on the construction of such knowledge by analysing how anti-trafficking docufiction videos from the Unchosen competition dramatize trafficking. We draw on Goffman's (1974) work on frames to analyse how these videos present a simplified interpretation of reality, where certain constructed aspects of trafficking and exploitation are represented by video-makers as illustrating the general. In doing so, we highlight how anti-trafficking docufictions help efface everyday exploitation. The article contributes both to the empirical research on the construction of knowledge about trafficking, and to critical conceptual work on (anti)trafficking, exploitation and ignorance. It is part of a broader project to challenge exceptionalizing and individualizing representations of human trafficking - aiming to engage better with everyday exploitation.

AB  - Research on coverage of the economic developments in the run-up to the 2008 crisis concludes that the media did not warn of the risks involved, failing in their watchdog role by not anticipating the crisis. However, a key issue remains unaddressed: what would have happened if the media had warned about the factors of instability that led to the crisis? This article explores some answers to this question, for the 2008 crisis and for economic crises in general. To do this, we perform a joint critical review of the literature on watchdog journalism, on economic crises theories, and on media effects on the economy. More specifically, we consider the media's influence on financial markets, on macroeconomic dynamics (via conditioning the households' and firms' behavior), and on economic policy; discussing, at the theoretical level and supported by the empirical evidence available, the ways each kind of media influence could (or not) prevent a structural economic crisis. If the crisis is interpreted as the consequence of dysfunctions in the economic model, or specific errors by agents, it is logical to think that the media could have helped prevent it, by warning of the dangers and promoting changes in public policies and investment decisions. If, on the other hand, the crisis is understood as a necessary readjustment of capitalism in the face of an exhausted accumulation model, the media's influence would have been very limited in terms of preventing it.

AB  - Public feelings toward sharks are expected to grow negatively following shark bites on humans. Media and government responses are often predicated on this presumptive emotional response; however, there have been no published data on attitudes toward sharks following shark bite incidents. This study shows that levels of "pride" in white shark populations in the absence of an incident remained steady after a shark bite occurred. This was consistent across response areas regarding other marine life and "confidence" in beach safety programs. Results are based on a pilot survey conducted in the Cape Town beach suburbs of Fish Hoek and Muizenberg before and after a shark bite at Fish Hoek beach. The study found no statistical significance between survey responses and the occurrence of the shark bite incident. The results indicate a previously undocumented level of public sophistication following these events. This data challenges the underlying basis of policy responses to shark bites and suggests that new considerations of public knowledge, endemic value and causal narratives should be incorporated into decision making.

AB  - Opioid pain reliever addiction has increased among women of reproductive age over the last fifteen years. News media and public attention have focused on the implications of this trend for infants exposed to opioids prenatally, with state policy responses varying in the extent to which they are punitive or public health oriented. We fielded a six-group randomized experiment among a nationally representative sample of US adults to test the effects of narratives portraying a woman with opioid pain reliever addiction during pregnancy on beliefs about people addicted to opioid pain relievers, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, policy attitudes, and emotional responses. Portraying a high socioeconomic status (SES) woman in the narrative lowered perceptions of individual blame for addiction and reduced public support for punitive policies. Depicting the barriers to treatment faced by a low SES woman lowered support for punitive policies and increased support for expanded insurance coverage for treatment. The extent to which narratives portraying successfully treated addiction affected public attitudes depended on the SES of the woman portrayed. These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma toward this population, reduce support for punitive policies, and increase support for more public health oriented approaches to addressing this problem.

AB  - Popular social media platforms have faced recent criticism because of the tendency for users to exhibit strongly negative behaviors, threatening the open, prodemocratic discourse that proponents believe was made possible when social media sites first gained widespread adoption a decade ago. A conceptual model suggests that the microblogging site Twitter, and especially sport-themed debate through hashtags, can still realize these ideals. Analyzing a dataset of tweets about the firing of former Major League Baseball pitcher Curt Schilling by ESPN on April 20, 2016, as well as a qualitative questionnaire given to the users of the hashtag, this study attempted to ascertain how closely the discourse comes to realizing the ideal of the Habermasian public sphere. The findings demonstrate that although users draw value from participation in the discussion, they are less inclined to desire interaction with other hashtag users, particularly those who disagree with them. This suggests that Twitter hashtags provide an open forum that approaches the participatory requirement of the public sphere, but the lack of back-and-forth engagement suggests the medium is not ideal for the generation of deliberative public opinion.

T2  - JOHNS HOPKINS APL TECHNICAL DIGEST
LA  - English
AB  - Sentiment analysis-the automated extraction of expressions of positive or negative attitudes from text-has received considerable attention from researchers during the past 10 years. During the same period, the widespread growth of social media has resulted in an explosion of publicly available, user-generated text on the World Wide Web. These data can potentially be utilized to provide real-time insights into the aggregated sentiments of people. The tools provided by statistical natural language processing and machine learning, along with exciting new scalable approaches to working with large volumes of text, make it possible to begin extracting sentiments from the web. We discuss some of the challenges of sentiment extraction and some of the approaches employed to address these challenges. In particular, we describe work we have done to annotate sentiment in blogs at the levels of sentences and subsentences (clauses); to classify subjectivity at the level of sentences; and to identify the targets, or topics, of sentiment at the level of clauses.

AB  - Recent work has explored how individual and institutional factors affect the gap in perceptions of political legitimacy between electoral winners and electoral losers, but has ignored the role that the political information environment, in general, and ideologically biased media, in particular, plays in exacerbating or diminishing this gap. By combining individual-level public opinion data in 28 countries, an expert survey on media systems, and a variety of country-level indicators, I find that higher levels of political parallelism in a country are associated with a larger winner-loser gap in institutional trust and satisfaction with democracy. The relationship is contingent on whether or not people are actually exposed to said media. This research, which links the study of political communication with the study of comparative political behavior, indicates that the increasing availability of partisan news around the world is a cause for concern.

AB  - Information systems such as social media strongly influence public opinion formation. Additionally, communication on the internet is shaped by individuals and organisations with various aims. This environment has given rise to phenomena such as manipulated content, fake news, and social bots. To examine the influence of manipulated opinions, we draw on the spiral of silence theory and complex adaptive systems. We translate empirical evidence of individual behaviour into an agent-based model and show that the model results in the emergence of a consensus on the collective level. In contrast to most previous approaches, this model explicitly represents interactions as a network. The most central actor in the network determines the final consensus 60-70% of the time. We then use the model to examine the influence of manipulative actors such as social bots on public opinion formation. The results indicate that, in a highly polarised setting, depending on their network position and the overall network density, bot participation by as little as 2-4% of a communication network can be sufficient to tip over the opinion climate in two out of three cases. These findings demonstrate a mechanism by which bots could shape the norms adopted by social media users.

AB  - Research on media framing of policy issues has flourished. Yet the varied approaches to conceptualizing and operationalizing issue frames that make this literature rich also hinder its advancement. Here, we document the benefits of a two-tiered method: the first level accounts for issue-specific frames, while the second level tracks frames that generalize across issues. For this study, we draw on generalizable frames from prospect theory (loss vs. gain frames) and social identity theory (self-referential vs. other-referential frames). We discuss the theoretical merits of a two-tiered approach, arguing that it should yield compound insights greater than the sum of its parts. Applying this method to newspaper coverage of the war on terror, we find a strong trend at the generalizable level: media framing of the war shifted over time from a predominant use of fear (self-referential loss) frames to an increasing use of charity (other-referential gain) frames. Our approach further reveals that the fear frames used in the lead-up to the Iraq War were not driven by issue-specific frames related to terrorism or weapons of mass destruction as we might have thought, but rather by frames related to the anticipated threats to U.S. troops. This study sharpens our understanding of how framing of the war evolved, but more broadly it suggests that a two-tiered approach could be applied both within and across policy issues to advance our understanding of the framing process.

AB  - We explore the implications of online social endorsement for the Covid-19 vaccination program in the United Kingdom. Vaccine hesitancy is a long-standing problem, but it has assumed great urgency due to the pandemic. By early 2021, the United Kingdom had the world's highest Covid-19 mortality per million of population. Our survey of a nationally representative sample of UK adults (N = 5,114) measured socio-demographics, social and political attitudes, media diet for getting news about Covid-19, and intention to use social media and personal messaging apps to encourage or discourage vaccination against Covid-19. Cluster analysis identified six distinct media diet groups: news avoiders, mainstream/official news samplers, super seekers, omnivores, the social media dependent, and the TV dependent. We assessed whether these media diets, together with key attitudes, including Covid-19 vaccine hesitancy, conspiracy mentality, and the news-finds-me attitude (meaning giving less priority to active monitoring of news and relying more on one's online networks of friends for information), predict the intention to encourage or discourage vaccination. Overall, super-seeker and omnivorous media diets are more likely than other media diets to be associated with the online encouragement of vaccination. Combinations of (a) news avoidance and high levels of the news-finds-me attitude and (b) social media dependence and high levels of conspiracy mentality are most likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination. In the direct statistical model, a TV-dependent media diet is more likely to be associated with online discouragement of vaccination, but the moderation model shows that a TV-dependent diet most strongly attenuates the relationship between vaccine hesitancy and discouraging vaccination. Our findings support public health communication based on four main methods. First, direct contact, through the post, workplace, or community structures, and through phone counseling via local health services, could reach the news avoiders. Second, TV public information advertisements should point to authoritative information sources, such as National Health Service (NHS) and other public health websites, which should then feature clear and simple ways for people to share material among their online social networks. Third, informative social media campaigns will provide super seekers with good resources to share, while also encouraging the social media dependent to browse away from social media platforms and visit reliable and authoritative online sources. Fourth, social media companies should expand and intensify their removal of vaccine disinformation and anti-vax accounts, and such efforts should be monitored by well-resourced, independent organizations.

AB  - There is a lively debate whether to consider vote decisions based on leader evaluations a threat to democracy, as this has long been assumed to constitute irrational decision-making behavior. Empirical evidence indicating that leader effects are not necessarily expressions of irrationality has recently mounted up, though skepticism towards leader effects remains resilient especially when considering voters being influenced through media coverage of party leaders. This paper studies some of the core assumptions of the 'irrationality of leader effects' thesis, by testing the conditionality of mediated leader effects based upon four voter characteristics: education, political interest, ideological distance to the leader's party and political cynicism. Two datasets are combined: a manual content analysis of leadership images in television coverage and a five-wave panel-dataset in the four months preceding the 2012 Parliamentary elections in the Netherlands. The results are mixed: one the one hand, being influenced by leadership images through the media is not a shortcut for voters who are incapable of understanding politics, while ideological considerations and other political attitudes are not completely excluded from the decision-making process, but, on the other hand, mediated leader effects are found to be strongest for voters who care least about politics. Thus, the empirical evidence can be brought to bear on both sides of the discussion, and, hence, does not conclusively settle the issue how mediated leader effects must be considered in relation to the irrationality of the vote decision.

AB  - Keeping within the temperature limits set by the Paris Agreement on climate action will be a significant challenge. Nuclear power generation may contribute to achieving these targets, however, there are significant environmental, economic and health risks attached. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this paper explores how nuclear power generation is framed in the Irish print media, and discusses the implications of these frames for how nuclear power is perceived within the context of climate change mitigation in Ireland. Two Irish broadsheet papers, the Irish Times and the Irish Independent were selected for data collection, focusing on Chernobyl and Fukushima incidents. The prevalence of informational and balanced articles suggest that to some extent, an open debate on nuclear is already occurring. Nevertheless, significantly more articles take an antinuclear stance (34% in 1986 and 27.5% in 2011) than pro-nuclear (2.1% in 1986 and 3.3% in 2011), reflecting the lack of public appetite for nuclear power. This may limit the potential for a wider debate to occur within the context of reducing domestic emissions. Considering the urgency of addressing climate change, a full and balanced societal debate on how nuclear power, other energy alternatives (e.g. wind) and the energy sector more generally, can contribute to national climate policy targets may be necessary.

AB  - The public salience of crime has wide-ranging political and social implications; it influences public trust in the government and citizens' everyday routines and interactions, and it may affect policy responsiveness to punitive attitudes. Identifying the sources of crime salience is thus important. Two competing theoretical models exist: the objectivist model and the social constructionist model. According to the first, crime salience is a function of the crime rate. According to the second, crime salience is a function of media coverage and political rhetoric, and trends in crime salience differ across population subgroups as a result of differences in their responsiveness to elite initiatives. In both theories, period-level effects predominate. Variation in crime salience, however, may also reflect age and cohort effects. Using data from 422,504 respondents interviewed between 1960 and 2014, we first examine the nature of crime salience using hierarchical age-period-cohort (HAPC) models and then analyze period-level predictors using first differences. We find that 1) crime salience varies mostly at the period level; 2) crime salience trends are parallel (cointegrated) across demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan groups; and 3) crime salience trends within every population subgroup are most consistent with the constructionist model. The crime rate does not exert a significant effect in any subgroup.

AB  - Recently, several mainstream media organizations have moved away from using "illegal immigrant" in their immigration coverage. While this shift in immigration coverage is positive, seemingly positive language may still be exclusionary, particularly if the content of stories remains the same. We investigate whether newspaper articles that describe immigrants as "illegal" are more negative in content than articles that present immigrants as "undocumented" by analyzing 1,616 newspaper articles and letters to the editor in The Arizona Republic between 2000 and 2016, a critical period of immigration legislative activity in Arizona. We find that The Arizona Republic inundated readers with negative news coverage and that this coverage is baked into the content of stories and transcends the use of either term, "illegal" or "undocumented." We then draw on letters to the editor and original interview data to consider how social forces outside of the media may influence coverage.

AB  - This study investigates the causes of fluctuations in public concern about immigration and contends that issues emphasized in media coverage explain these fluctuations. Drawing on agenda-setting research and theories about issue attributes, it is argued that media emphasis on aspects of immigration that are likely to be unobtrusive but with potentially concrete consequences for the public is likely to raise concern about immigration far more than unobtrusive but abstract issues. The analysis, based on public opinion data and newspaper articles on the topic of immigration to the U.K., shows that press emphasis on two unobtrusive but concrete issues within the theme of immigration-the economy and education-appears to increase concern about immigration; emphasis on more abstract issues evokes little reaction from the British public.

AB  - Making sound food and agriculture decisions is important for global society and the environment. Experts tend to view crop genetic engineering, a technology that can improve yields and minimize impacts on the environment, more favorably than the public. Because there is a causal relationship between public opinion and public policy, it is important to understand how opinions about genetically engineered (GE) crops are influenced. The public increasingly seeks science information on the Internet. Here, semantic network analysis is performed to characterize the presentation of the term "GMO (genetically modified organism)," a proxy for food developed from GE crops, on the web. Texts from three sources are analyzed: U.S. federal websites, top pages from a Google search, and online news titles. We found that the framing and sentiment (positive, neutral, or negative attitudes) of "GMO" varies across these sources. It is described how differences in the portrayal of GE food by each source might affect public opinion. A current understanding of the types of information individuals may encounter online can provide insight into public opinion toward GE food. In turn, this knowledge can guide teaching and communication efforts by the scientific community to promote informed decision-making about agricultural biotechnologies.

AB  - Winston Churchill once said, 'it is better to jaw-jaw than to war-war.' However, negotiations are particularly difficult when they are enmeshed in public opinion precommitments. The sharpest crisis between China and Vietnam in the last 30 years concerned the placement of a Chinese oil rig into contested waters in 2014. This study analyses the Chinese and Vietnamese propaganda efforts surrounding the crisis as examples of the instrumental use of propaganda in managing domestic public opinion on diplomatic crises. The article argues that despite very different approaches to public diplomacy during the crisis, both states were primarily concerned with avoiding escalation and ending the confrontation. The authors show how propaganda function as a pacifying device in dealing with rising domestic nationalism when executing a moderate foreign policy.

AB  - This research explores the effects of visual representations of immigrants and refugees in U.S. news outlets. Study 1 examined news photographs about immigrants and refugees that were shared on Twitter by regional news outlets in all 50 states. Most photos contained either a human interest frame, featuring immigrants and refugees as everyday people, or a political frame, showcasing politicians. Study 2's experiment determined the effects of these visuals on participants' emotions and, in turn, their attitudes toward immigrants and refugees. The political frame increased negative emotions, leading to negative attitudes. The human interest frame increased positive emotions, enhancing positive attitudes.

AB  - A cursory look at Indian prime-time news tells us much about the tone and tenor of the people associated with it. Exaggerations, hyperbole, and tempers run wild, and news anchors flail in theatrical rage. News channels and news editors display their ideological affiliations subliminally. These affiliationsa factor of personal political stances, funding bodies, and investorslead to partisan bias in the framing of news and, in some cases, can easily translate into racial prejudice. In this paper, I examine news coverage related to Muslims in India. I study the coverage of two issues specificallylove jihad and triple talaqin prime-time English news of two channels: Times Now and Republic TV. Love jihad is a term used to describe alleged campaigns carried out by Muslim men targeting non-Muslim women for conversion to Islam by feigning love. Triple talaq is a form of divorce that has been interpreted to allow Muslim men to legally divorce their wives by stating the word talaq three times. My analysis of the content, tone, and tenor of their coverage shows that these channels propagate associations between Islam and backwardness, ignorance, and violence through consistent employment of the following tropes: Muslim women need to be saved from Muslim men; Hindu women need to be saved from Muslim men; and, Muslims are not fully Indianthey are anti-national. I place this study of news media within the current political climate in India and briefly touch on the conversations it guides and provokes. This is a first step in detailing a problem. It is also a call for further analysis on this subject to examine and evaluate if and how discourse manipulates public conversations and policy decisions.

AB  - Echo chambers in online social networks, whereby users' beliefs are reinforced by interactions with like-minded peers and insulation from others' points of view, have been decried as a cause of political polarization. Here, we investigate their role in the debate around the 2016 US elections on Reddit, a fundamental platform for the success of Donald Trump. We identify Trump vs Clinton supporters and reconstruct their political interaction network. We observe a preference for cross-cutting political interactions between the two communities rather than within-group interactions, thus contradicting the echo chamber narrative. Furthermore, these interactions are asymmetrical: Clinton supporters are particularly eager to answer comments by Trump supporters. Beside asymmetric heterophily, users show assortative behavior for activity, and disassortative, asymmetric behavior for popularity. Our findings are tested against a null model of random interactions, by using two different approaches: a network rewiring which preserves the activity of nodes, and a logit regression which takes into account possible confounding factors. Finally, we explore possible socio-demographic implications. Users show a tendency for geographical homophily and a small positive correlation between cross-interactions and voter abstention. Our findings shed light on public opinion formation on social media, calling for a better understanding of the social dynamics at play in this context.

AB  - Public opinion polls show that political trust tends to be higher in authoritarian regimes compared to liberal democracies. Many scholars have argued that respondents may provide false answers out of fear about repercussions by the state, thereby skewing survey results in a positive direction. Using an unobtrusive measure based on affect transfer, we find that adult participants in experiments conducted in China transfer positive affect toward the state onto evaluations of television advertisements upon mere exposure to the name of a central party institution. Participants did not have incentives to lie because they did not associate the advertisements with the state. Furthermore, people who evaluated the ads more positively upon viewing the name of the state also reported more positive levels of trust in government. Together, these findings raise doubt that Chinese misrepresent political trust in surveys out of political fear.

This exploratory study, however, analyses how the far right in Norway framed the unprecedented global crisis of COVID-19. The data encompasses 149 Facebook posts, online op-eds, columns, letters to the editor and YouTube videos about COVID-19 published between 1 January and 31 May 2020 by two radical-right parties, three anti-immigration/anti-Islam groups, one neo-Nazi social movement, one long-time neo-Nazi solo activist and a leading alternative media website in Norway. They represent the full range of established and new, minor and leading, and radical and extreme far-right actors from the last four decades. Based on the material analysed, Mjelde identifies four overarching frames related to the world order, governance, immigration and conspiracies, as well as nine subframes. A main finding is that conspiratorial distrust of the government constitutes a master frame that both the radical and the extreme right combine with other frames that reflect key tenets of their world-view. The findings underscore, first, the rigidity of the far right's world-view; second, contradictory views within the far right about the remedy for the pandemic and the state's role; and, finally, that China is emerging as a bogeyman on the US/Trump-friendly far right.

AB  - This paper shows how contemporary believers are negotiating a new identity of Islamic piety in Bulgarian Muslim communities. Driven by communal memory of repression and contemporary Islamophobia, Bulgarian Muslims have created communities of practice (Wenger 1998), participatory groups that share a common interest in learning more about their faith. Communities function on multiple levels: there are small pockets of Islamic activity at the local level, and at a broader level, an imagined community of Bulgarian-speaking Muslims connected to an imagined global Islamic community, the ummah. The practices examined here include face-to-face activities, such as learning to read the Qur'an and prayers in Arabic, learning Islamic principles and practice, and talking about faith in mosques and homes in Bulgaria. This paper also examines virtual practices, such as discussing faith on social media. The article focuses on women's and girls' Qur'an reading groups and discussions about wearing hijab, and it examines an online mixed-gender discussion of daily prayers. Such grassroots practice of Islam fosters a newly articulate and participatory version of religion, embracing and encouraging believers' literacy and knowledge, activism, and agency. The mutual goals, repertoires, and activities of this community of practice create a sense of commonality and cohesiveness, while leaving room for some diversity of focus.

AB  - Media framing of an event can have a significant impact on both reader response and public opinion. Through an examination of the deadliest gang-related murder to ever occur in British Columbia, the current study extends previous research by analyzing the influence of victim characteristics on the development of a problem frame. We analyze all newspaper articles published in the Vancouver Sun mentioning at least one of the murder victims between October 19, 2007, and December 31, 2016 (N = 210). Results suggest that journalists use a number of techniques when creating a problem frame, including victim differentiation, purposeful inclusion of sources, and use of specific language. We argue that the extensive coverage of the murders provided an opportunity for the media to develop a problem frame that dichotomized victims, capitalized on societal fear of crime, and, consequently, affected calls for policy change.

AB  - Scholarship on the representation of Islam in the media has rightly focused on its negative dimensions, particularly since the events of 9/11. However, Islam has not always been a negative construct. During the Cold War, the United States sought to promote Islam as a bulwark against secular nationalism. Saudi Arabia was central to this policy. In this paper, I study the coverage of the US-Saudi policy of harnessing Islam to serve larger political agendas in five news media outletsThe New York Times, The Washington Post, Time, National Review, and The Nation. I focus on two pivotal moments: (1) the Eisenhower Doctrine of 1957 when the US Islam policy was crystalized; and (2) the era of the Saudi monarch King Faisal, when the policy was instituted. My analysis of several hundred news media articles, editorials, and op-eds shows that while the coverage is contradictory, lapsing sometimes into Orientalist frames, overall Saudi Arabia is consistently presented as embodying the right kind of Islam. I argue further that Islam as a short-hand to designate the Middle East entered US media discourse in the 1960s, and that its meaning has evolved to suit shifting US foreign policy objectives.

AB  - Recent scholarship has shown the importance of political conservatism, perceived (in)security, and communication channels (i.e. mass media) in increased or decreased tolerance toward certain groups. This study advances our knowledge in this area by integrating the importance of media exposure, interpersonal communication and attitudes toward political elites in shaping tolerance levels toward the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army (FARC, after the initials in Spanish). For this, the authors analyze national survey data collected in Colombia and carry out a path analysis to explore the formation of political (in)tolerance toward FARC. Results from exploring tolerance toward FARC, a rebel group transitioning from a military force to a political one, show the importance of interpersonal discussion and attitudes toward political elites in fostering tolerance both directly and indirectly via increased preference for a peace negotiation over a military solution. The implications of these findings are discussed.

AB  - Statements in which a one-sided partisan media source criticizes a politician aligned with it-friendly fire-are particularly persuasive. This literature assumes a bipartisan context. We argue that when there is a dominant party on one side of the political spectrum with a strong link with a media outlet, voters treat attacks against a co-partisan candidate as friendly fire. But when there is a fragmented opposition, we expect that the strength of the signal conveyed by the friendly fire is diminished. Based on a survey experiment conducted in Argentina, we find the fragmented nature of the opposition changes the dynamic of friendly fire. Only partisan and sophisticated opposition voters treat attacks on opposition candidates as friendly fire. These voters are better able to overcome the lack of clear partisan link with the opposition newspaper and punish their co-partisan candidate.

KW  - regression analysis
KW  - mediation analysis
AB  - This paper explores how an alternative media narrative of general partisan agreement can spill over onto individuals' perceptions of how much partisan groups agree on specific issues. Consistent with the idea that a media narrative emphasizing partisan differences leads individuals to hold inaccurate views of what partisans think, recent national probability sample surveys showed that Americans inaccurately perceived that most Democrats and most Republicans held opposing beliefs about whether global warming has been occurring when, in fact, the majorities of both parties agree that the world is warming. To determine if an alternative narrative can rectify this misperception, experiments that exposed some participants to a message highlighting areas in which Democrats and Republicans agree were embedded in a series of non-probability sample surveys (Study 1, N =1,000; Study 2, N = 3,007). Study 1 demonstrates that this alternative narrative, compared to a narrative highlighting disagreement, leads people to perceive more Republicans to think that the world has been warming and, in turn, a decreased partisan gap on the issue. Study 2 replicates these findings and provides evidence that respondents enter the study already exposed to a narrative emphasizing disagreement. Mediation analyses of both studies suggest that the alternative narrative can indirectly lead Republican respondents to express the belief that global warming exists via updating their perceptions of what co-partisans think. Thus, a narrative emphasizing the ways in which partisans agree rather than disagree can help address the misperception that Republicans and Democrats hold opposing beliefs on global warming.

AB  - This study analyses the legal action taken for defamation in the case of the 'human zoo', an alleged defamatory portrayal of the Paiwan people, a Taiwanese indigenous group, by Japan's public broadcaster, NHK. The analysis of this case is presented in two stages, the first of which employs a critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the covert racist discourse regarding the Paiwan people in a four-episode NHK documentary series on the history of the modernization of Japan. Second, the study evaluates the discursive patterns of the legal documents resulting from the subsequent lawsuits. The analysis incorporates the findings of interviews with key stakeholders in the human zoo case in its investigation of the presence of insidious racial prejudice against the Paiwan people, combined with a lack of sensitivity towards indigenous peoples in general, both in the documentary and in the responses from NHK in the subsequent lawsuits.

AB  - Background & aims: Depression is a common and sometimes severe form of mental illness, and public attitudes towards depression can impact the psychological and social functioning of depressed patients. The purpose of the present study was to investigate public attitudes toward depression and three-year trends in these attitudes using big data analysis of social media posts in China.
   Methods: A search of publically available Sina Weibo posts from January 2014 to July 2017 identified 20,129 hot posts with the keyword term "depression". We first used a Chinese Linguistic Psychological Text Analysis System (TextMind) to analyze linguistic features of the posts. And, then we used topic models to conduct semantic content analysis to identify specific themes in Weibo users' attitudes toward depression.
   Results: Linguistic features analysis showed a significant increase over time in the frequency of terms related to affect, positive emotion, anger, cognition (including the subcategory of insight), and conjunctions. Semantic content analysis identified five common themes: severe effects of depression, stigma, combating stigma, appeals for understanding, and providing support. There was a significant increase over time in references to social (as opposed to professional) support, and a significant decrease over time in references to the severe consequences of depression.
   Conclusions: Big data analysis of Weibo posts is likely to provide less biased information than other methods about the public's attitudes toward depression. The results suggest that although there is ongoing stigma about depression, there is also an upward trend in mentions of social support for depressed persons. A supervised learning statistical model can be developed in future research to provide an even more precise analysis of specific attitudes.

AB  - Autocracies are widely assumed to have a counterterrorism advantage because they can censor media and are insulated from public opinion, thereby depriving terrorists of both their audience and political leverage. However, institutionalized autocracies such as China draw legitimacy from public approval and feature partially free media environments, meaning that their information strategies must be much more sophisticated than simple censorship. To better understand the strategic considerations that govern decisions about transparency in this context, this article explores the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) treatment of domestic terrorist incidents in the official party mouthpiece - the People's Daily. Drawing on original, comprehensive datasets of all known Uyghur terrorist violence in China and the official coverage of that violence, the findings demonstrate that the CCP promptly acknowledges terrorist violence only when both domestic and international conditions are favorable. The authors attribute this pattern to the entrenched prioritization of short-term social stability over longer-term legitimacy.

AB  - Integrating the Spiral of Silence and the Situational Theory of Problem Solving, this study examines the relationships among fear of isolation, public segmentation, and willingness to express COVID-19 opinions amidst a public climate polarized by social media. An online survey sampled 338 U.S. participants. Findings revealed that fear of isolation predicted COVID-19 opinion expression. Additionally, segmentation of publics predicted COVID-19 online information-seeking behavior while situational variables moderated the relationship between fear of isolation and opinion expression engagement. Findings provide practical implications for effective health messaging and social media literacy efforts to combat opposing public opinion judgments about adhering to public health guidelines.

AB  - In adopting a deontological lens to assess message ethicality, this study identifies and explicates the ethical dimensions of fast food advertising through five principles of the TARES framework of persuasion ethics. In moral weight, fast foodwith its high calories and low nutritional valueis negatively prejudiced. A deontological-ethical perspective, by focusing on the quality of the advertising message, shifts the focus from the product to a more measured deliberation about the moral responsibility of fast food advertisers to reposition them as moral agents who are accountable for their messages. A content analysis of 380 television and print ads for fast food in Singapore shows that few ads met the TARES's expectations. Ads targeting children and teenagers are associated with lower message ethicality than ads targeting adults and the general audience, lending empirical support to the literature critical of fast food advertising's insidious approach of targeting the young.

AB  - Most studies of online incivility report negative effects on attitudes and behaviors of both the victims and the audiences who are exposed to it. But while we have extensive insights about the attitudinal and behavioral consequences of incivility, less emphasis has been paid on its emotional effects. We conduct a series of survey experiments using statements posted on Twitter by elite actors along with the comments they receive and measure the emotional reactions of the public in relation to the content of the original post. We find that when the raw information is accompanied by uncivil commentary (compared to civil or no commentary), respondents express higher levels of positive and lower levels of negative emotions. Further analysis of heterogeneous effects focusing on partisanship shows that the effects are primarily driven by those who are generally expected to agree with the expert's claim. The broader consequences of incivility as entertainment on social media platforms are discussed.

AB  - This study extends the boundary conditions of the work on media effects on polarization by (1) examining whether exposure to news coverage about a contentious political issue polarizes attitudes, especially among the already-polarized citizens; (2) analyzing "easy" and "hard" dimensions of EU attitudes; and (3) offering causal and generalizable evidence in a non-US context. Individual-level data from a representative four-wave panel survey are matched with coded content data on the amount of coverage about the EU in numerous news outlets. Results show that strongly opinionated citizens exposed to news about the EU polarize following exposure, and that the "easy" dimensions of EU attitudes polarize more than the "hard" attitude dimensions. Moreover, polarization emerges among strong EU supporters and opponents alike. These results extend the polarization literature to naturalistic settings and suggest that the polarizing effects of the media may be greater than previously acknowledged.

AB  - Leonardo DiCaprio has a considerable track record as a fervent campaigner to save the environment and combat climate change. Drawing from his more recent activist engagements to endorse Formula E, the world's first fully electric racing series, this contribution aims to analyse how and in what ways this generates additional exposure and appreciation for the series, the environment and DiCaprio. To this end, a qualitative and inductive framing approach is used to examine a sample of online media articles and accompanying audience comments from 2013, 2015 and 2017, resulting in a range of frames found in media coverage and audience reactions. It shows how framing of Leonardo DiCaprio is influenced by both his life story as an actor, activist and party boy, the appreciation he receives from audiences as well as by audiences' own personal experiences with health-related issues and their conversations with peers. Finally, this contribution discusses varying tendencies by media articles and audiences to frame Leonardo DiCaprio as both hero and hypocrite as well as its wider implications.

AB  - Purpose The purpose of this paper is to understand how the 2015 Tianjin Port explosion - which resulted in more than 100 deaths - changed local residents' acceptance, perceived benefit and risk and trust related to hazardous goods warehouses and chemical plants (HGWCPs) and how it influenced local residents' decisions about accepting HGWCPs through the lens of the trust heuristic.
   Design/methodology/approach A survey was conducted eight months after the disaster. Respondents were classified into two groups: involved (with direct experience of the explosion) and uninvolved (without direct experience). Their trust in those responsible for HGWCPs, and perceived benefit, perceived risk and acceptance associated with HGWCPs were surveyed.
   Findings The disaster reduced public acceptance of HGWCPs and trust and increased perceived risk. Trust retained an indirect effect on acceptance through perceived benefit in both groups and a direct effect on acceptance in the involved group. Trust partly accounted for the reduction in acceptance of HGWCPs.
   Practical implications Results remind the local government of the medium-term psychological consequences of the Tianjin Port explosion (e.g. increased perceived risk and reduced trust) and suggest the importance of building trust in mitigating risk perceptions of relevant technological hazards.
   Originality/value It represents a valuable addition to the literature on the medium-term psychological consequences of technological disasters and on the public's decision making about hazardous technologies.

AB  - Although prior work has demonstrated a link between online political engagement and offline participation, less is known about which mechanisms might influence online political opinion expression. This study examined specific constructs that might lead to increased social media engagement among Latinos-a demographic group with high social media adoption, but lower levels of political participation. Results from this study, using data from the 2016 presidential election, suggest that acculturation processes can explain the likelihood of online political engagement, willingness to share opinions, and offline political participation. Findings indicate that for Latinos, the ethnic heterogeneity of one's social media network and perceptions of commonality between one's own ethnic group and other ethnic and racial groups drive willingness to share opinions, online political engagement, and, indirectly, offline political participatory behaviors. Results are contextualized in relation to the ways Latinos uniquely integrate with U.S. political culture through online engagement.

Controlling for demographics, political interest, efficacy, knowledge, ideological extremity, and Internet use, this study provides evidence that both third-person perceptions and hostile media perceptions are consistently related to a series of offline and online behaviors that seek to enrich public debate and "correct" what are seen as potential biases in the public sphere. Based on a national probability sample collected in Colombia, these results offer a strong case of behavioral consequences for third-person perceptions outside the realm of willingness to censor.

AB  - As governments take measures against COVID-19, the epidemic situation is expected to improve, but public sentiment is likely to fluctuate during this process, potentially influencing the best course of action. Social media has become a prevalent way for the public to express emotions and opinions in recent times. So that, the sentiment analysis on top of it may detect and provide valuable evidence of public attitude and help governments subsequent formulation of measures and policies. We present Senti-COVID19, an interactive visual analytic system for reflecting and analyzing public sentiment and detecting sentiment fluctuation triggers on social media. Senti-COVID19 adopts lexicon-based sentiment analysis to divulge the public opinion to COVID-19 events, employing libraries to extract keywords and statistics for providing detailed information. In addition, it offers visualizations for presenting the analysis, allowing users to quickly discover relevant information. Our results show that Senti-COVID19 can be used effectively to analyze sentiment from social media text, allowing users to explore derived data and identify insights from the collected tweets.

AB  - The relationship between communication and society has been extensively studied in the 20th Century, following the dissemination of mass media announced already during the 19th Century (photography, cinema, comics, radio, telephone, etc.). However, communication has always been one of the key variables of the entire human history, and not only of modernity. Through a retrospective survey, the essay analyses communication as an adaptive invention of mankind to the environment. A winning answer to the primordial struggles for survival, communication distinguishes the human species from earlier times for the structuring of a shared oral language. Starting from the extraordinary flexibility of the human body as a multi-media and multi-meaningful tool, the essay offers a communicative revisionism that involves the antiquity, the Middle Ages and modernity. Sharing the idea of "the media as human extension" (McLuhan), the author proposes some examples for a new reading of single tales of the Odyssey, i.e. the sirens' and the Cyclops' episode. Eventually, five directions are proposed to run for a wide- ranging investigation of the relationship "communication-society" in the past: invention of symbols, sharing of meanings, creation of networks, construction of knowledge and exercise of power.

AB  - Background: The development and approval of COVID-19 vaccines have generated optimism for the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and a return to normalcy. However, vaccine hesitancy, often fueled by misinformation, poses a major barrier to achieving herd immunity.
   Objective: We aim to investigate Twitter users' attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination in Canada after vaccine rollout.
   Methods: We applied a weakly supervised aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) technique, which involves the human-in-the-loop system, on COVID-19 vaccination-related tweets in Canada. Automatically generated aspect and opinion terms were manually corrected by public health experts to ensure the accuracy of the terms and make them more domain-specific. Then, based on these manually corrected terms, the system inferred sentiments toward the aspects. We observed sentiments toward key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination, and investigated how sentiments toward "vaccination" changed over time. In addition, we analyzed the most retweeted or liked tweets by observing most frequent nouns and sentiments toward key aspects.
   Results: After applying the ABSA system, we obtained 170 aspect terms (eg, "immunity" and "pfizer") and 6775 opinion terms (eg, "trustworthy" for the positive sentiment and "jeopardize" for the negative sentiment). While manually verifying or editing these terms, our public health experts selected 20 key aspects related to COVID-19 vaccination for analysis. The sentiment analysis results for the 20 key aspects revealed negative sentiments related to "vaccine distribution," "side effects," "allergy," "reactions," and "anti-vaxxer," and positive sentiments related to "vaccine campaign," "vaccine candidates," and "immune response." These results indicate that the Twitter users express concerns about the safety of vaccines but still consider vaccines as the option to end the pandemic. In addition, compared to the sentiment of the remaining tweets, the most retweeted or liked tweets showed more positive sentiment overall toward key aspects (P<.001), especially vaccines (P<.001) and vaccination (P=.009). Further investigation of the most retweeted or liked tweets revealed two opposing trends in Twitter users who showed negative sentiments toward vaccines: the "anti-vaxxer" population that used negative sentiments as a means to discourage vaccination and the "Covid Zero" population that used negative sentiments to encourage vaccinations while critiquing the public health response.
   Conclusions: Our study examined public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccination on tweets over an extended period in Canada. Our findings could inform public health agencies to design and implement interventions to promote vaccination.

AB  - Immigration policy, arrival modes, human rights, and international obligations have all been part of the debate that has ensued over the Australian Government's policy response towards refugees and asylum seekers. This debate was a central campaign focus in the lead up to the 2013 Australian federal election and was accompanied by extensive media coverage. This media coverage is a significant contributor to the representation of refugees and asylum seekers to the Australian public. This study explores how refugees and asylum seekers were represented in Australian print news media in the period immediately before and after the 2013 federal election. Using news framing and critical discourse analysis, this study examined 162 articles, published between 7 August and 8 October 2013, in Australian newspapers. The analysis revealed two opposing themes in the representation of asylum seekers: refugees and asylum seekers were represented as either a threat requiring a military intervention or as victims requiring management. The findings of this study demonstrate the ways in which the print media contribute to a polarised representation of refugees and asylum seekers and the potential deleterious effect of this dichotomous construction to an informed public opinion.

AB  - Transfer Entropy was applied to analyze the correlations and flow of information between 200,500 tweets and 23 of the largest capitalized companies during 6 years along the period 2013-2018. The set of tweets were obtained applying a text mining algorithm and classified according to daily date and company mentioned. We proposed the construction of a Sentiment Index applying a Natural Processing Language algorithm and structuring the sentiment polarity for each data set. Bootstrapped Simulations of Transfer Entropy were performed between stock prices and Sentiment Indexes. The results of the Transfer Entropy simulations show a clear information flux between general public opinion and companies' stock prices. There is a considerable amount of information flowing from general opinion to stock prices, even between different Sentiment Indexes. Our results suggest a deep relationship between general public opinion and stock prices. This is important for trading strategies and the information release policies for each company.

AB  - The mysterious disappearance of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 in March 2014 was a test of the bilateral relations between Malaysia and China. Two thirds of passengers on the flight were Chinese citizens. Immediately after the tragedy, many in China accused Malaysia of being incompetent, dubious and even deceitful due to its authorities' missteps and contradictory press statements. Meanwhile, some Malaysians saw China's reactions as unfriendly and hypocritical. Through the professional selection and presentation of news items, the media communicates a host of salience cues that the public can use to organise and determine the importance of these issues, and this subsequently forms the initial stage of public opinion. In light of the events surrounding the missing flight MH370, the critical importance of studying media representations across Malaysia and China has become all the more essential to understand the role of media in bilateral relations. Based on a comparative content analysis, this paper investigated the framing of the MH370 incident as well as Malaysia-China bilateral relations by mainstream Malay- ,English- and Chinese-language newspapers in Malaysia as well as by mainstream Chinese-language newspapers in China. The findings indicate that the newspapers carried an unequal weighting on the MH370 incident as well as the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. By employing different news sources, the newspapers also allowed different parties to act as opinion leaders to define or interpret the MH370 incident as well as the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. The two salient frames found in this study were "search and rescue operation" as well as "friendship, ties and understanding". The coverage of the newspapers was also dominated by positive valence towards the Malaysia-China bilateral relations. Implications of the findings to the understanding of the framing and bilateral relations were also discussed.

TI  - Public Perspectives of Using Social Media Data to Improve Adverse Drug Reaction Reporting: A Mixed-Methods Study
T2  - DRUG SAFETY
LA  - English
AB  - Introduction Information on suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) voluntarily submitted by patients can be a valuable source of information for improving drug safety; however, public awareness of reporting mechanisms remains low. Whilst methods to automatically detect ADR mentions from social media posts using text mining techniques have been proposed to improve reporting rates, it is unclear how acceptable these would be to social media users. Objective The objective of this study was to explore public opinion about using automated methods to detect and report mentions of ADRs on social media to enhance pharmacovigilance efforts. Methods Users of the online health discussion forum HealthUnlocked participated in an online survey (N = 1359) about experiences with ADRs, knowledge of pharmacovigilance methods, and opinions about using automated data mining methods to detect and report ADRs. To further explore responses, five qualitative focus groups were conducted with 20 social media users with long-term health conditions. Results Participant responses indicated a low awareness of pharmacovigilance methods and ADR reporting. They showed a strong willingness to share health-related social media data about ADRs with researchers and regulators, but were cautious about automated text mining methods of detecting and reporting ADRs. Conclusions Social media users value public-facing pharmacovigilance schemes, even if they do not understand the current framework of pharmacovigilance within the UK. Ongoing engagement with users is essential to understand views, share knowledge and respect users' privacy expectations to optimise future ADR reporting from online health communities.

AB  - While concerns about the public's receptivity to factual information are widespread, much less attention has been paid to the factual receptivity, or lack thereof, of elected officials. Recent survey research has made clear that US legislators and legislative staff systematically misperceive their constituents' opinions on salient public policies. This study reports the results from two field experiments designed to correct misperceptions of sitting US legislators. The legislators (n = 2,346) were invited to access a dashboard of constituent opinion generated using the 2016 Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Despite extensive outreach efforts, only 11 per cent accessed the information in Study 1 and only 2.3 per cent did so in Study 2. More troubling for democratic norms, legislators who accessed constituent opinion data were no more accurate at perceiving their constituents' opinions. The findings underscore the challenges confronting efforts to improve the accuracy of elected officials' perceptions and suggest that elected officials may indeed resist factual information.

AB  - Candidate appearances have long been a staple of American campaigns, yet we don't know much about what happens when elites meet the masses. In 2006, we conducted a statewide field experiment assessing the effectiveness of personal appearances by the incumbent governor. Republican Rick Perry's campaign appearances were randomly assigned to specific media markets for 3 days in January 2006, while we simultaneously collected public opinion, media coverage, contribution, and volunteer data. We find increased public support for Perry, but also increased support for his Democratic opponent. Contrary to some recent studies of TV advertising, appearance effects persisted for at least 1 week. The tone of news media coverage of the governor's appearances doesn't influence the mobilization of Perry voters, but less favorable stories might exacerbate countermobilization effects. Perry's appearances were more unambiguously effective in generating contributions and volunteers.

AB  - The use of disinformation in political campaigns is not a new phenomenon, but the issue has acquired renewed attention because digital media makes it relatively easier to spread disinformation. Through a cross-sectional survey (N = 1,820) on the 2019 Indonesian national elections, we analyze the relationship among belief in misinformation, social media use, and partisanship. The analysis shows that although the political use of social media is not associated with belief in misinformation, partisanship is strongly associated with belief in various types of misinformation, depending on whether their own candidate or the opposing candidate is targeted. The findings are interpreted through the concept of selective belief. This study contributes to theoretical debates on the association among belief in misinformation, social media use, and partisanship, and addresses the role of disinformation in electoral politics in Indonesia.

The article also examines the rather surprising descriptions of agency, personal strength and coping offered by the research participants when discussing their reactions to experiences of hate crime and prejudice. An examination of these reactions was informed by emerging psychological and sociological literatures concerning the concept of resilience.

AB  - Introduction Under austerity, governments shift responsibilities for social welfare to individuals. Such responsibilization can be intertwined with pre-existing social stigmas, with sexually stigmatized individuals blamed more for health problems due to "irresponsible" sexual behavior. To understand how sexual stigma affects attitudes on government healthcare expenditures, we examine public support for government-provisioned PrEP in England at a time when media narratives cast the drug as an expensive benefit for a small, irresponsible social group and the National Health Service's long-term sustainability was in doubt. Methods This paper uses data from an original survey (N = 738) conducted in September 2016, when public opinion should be most sensitive to sexual stigma. A survey experiment tests how the way beneficiaries of PrEP were described affected support for NHS provision of it. Contrary to expectations, we found that support was high (mean = 3.86 on a scale of 1 to 5) irrespective of language used or beneficiary group mentioned. Differences between conditions were negligible. Discussion Sexual stigma does not diminish support for government-funded PrEP, which may be due to reverence for the NHS; resistance to responsibilization generally; or just to HIV, with the public influenced by sympathy and counter-messaging.

AB  - Despite significant research on the role that media coverage of human suffering has on foreign policymaking, no study to date has examined the news media's impact on the use of economic sanctions, a widely used policy tool to address humanitarian problems. This study explores whether news media coverage of human rights abuses in Newsweek and the New York Times increases the likelihood of US economic sanctions. Synthesizing insights from agenda-setting theory with recent work on the domestic origins of sanction policy, we argue that press attention to human rights violations increases the threat and imposition of sanctions by mobilizing the public to pressure leaders to take action against abusive regimes. We find support for this argument in statistical tests of US sanction cases between the 1976 and 2000 period. The results also indicate that the media's effect is conditioned by US strategic ties to potential targets: the effect of critical press coverage is stronger for US non-allies than allies. Further, this conditional effect occurs even though abusive allies receive more media attention than abusive non-allies. Overall, this manuscript shows that nonstate actors can have an important role on foreign policy decision making generally, and specifically that news media influence the US decision to use economic sanctions. Our analyses also suggest that leaders balance the public's demand for action with the security imperative to maintain good relations with allies.

AB  - This study examines ethnic preferences using data from the television cooking show Come Dine With Me in Sweden. Amateur chefs compete by hosting dinner parties. Contestants rate each others' performance and the host with the highest ratings wins a cash prize. The show gives an unorthodox opportunity to study ethnic preferences in a high-stakes game environment. The analysis of the collected data shows that native Swedish contestants rate co-ethnic hosts significantly more favourably than they rate other hosts, demonstrating the existence of co-ethnic preferences. This observation seems to be an outcome of own-group favouritism rather than dislike against other groups. Also, the observed co-ethnic preference is assumed to be subtle or non-conscious based on the nature of the analysed data.

AB  - Background: The rollout of vaccines for COVID-19 in the United Kingdom started in December 2020. Uptake has been high, and there has been a subsequent reduction in infections, hospitalizations, and deaths among vaccinated individuals. However, vaccine hesitancy remains a concern, in particular relating to adverse effects following immunization (AEFIs). Social media analysis has the potential to inform policy makers about AEFIs being discussed by the public as well as public attitudes toward the national immunization campaign. Objective: We sought to assess the frequency and nature of AEFI-related mentions on social media in the United Kingdom and to provide insights on public sentiments toward COVID-19 vaccines. Methods: We extracted and analyzed over 121,406 relevant Twitter and Facebook posts, from December 8, 2020, to April 30, 2021. These were thematically filtered using a 2-step approach, initially using COVID-19-related keywords and then using vaccine-and manufacturer-related keywords. We identified AEFI-related keywords and modeled their word frequency to monitor their trends over 2-week periods. We also adapted and utilized our recently developed hybrid ensemble model, which combines state-of-the-art lexicon rule-based and deep learning-based approaches, to analyze sentiment trends relating to the main vaccines available in the United Kingdom. Results: Our COVID-19 AEFI search strategy identified 46,762 unique Facebook posts by 14,346 users and 74,644 tweets (excluding retweets) by 36,446 users over the 4-month period. We identified an increasing trend in the number of mentions for each AEFI on social media over the study period. The most frequent AEFI mentions were found to be symptoms related to appetite (n=79,132, 14%), allergy (n=53,924, 9%), injection site (n=56,152, 10%), and clots (n=43,907, 8%). We also found some rarely reported AEFIs such as Bell palsy (n=11,909, 2%) and Guillain-Barre syndrome (n=9576, 2%) being discussed as frequently as more well-known side effects like headache (n=10,641, 2%), fever (n=12,707, 2%), and diarrhea (n=16,559, 3%). Overall, we found public sentiment toward vaccines and their manufacturers to be largely positive (58%), with a near equal split between negative (22%) and neutral (19%) sentiments. The sentiment trend was relatively steady over time and had minor variations, likely based on political and regulatory announcements and debates. Conclusions: The most frequently discussed COVID-19 AEFIs on social media were found to be broadly consistent with those reported in the literature and by government pharmacovigilance. We also detected potential safety signals from our analysis that have been detected elsewhere and are currently being investigated. As such, we believe our findings support the use of social media analysis to provide a complementary data source to conventional knowledge sources being used for pharmacovigilance purposes.

This article articulates four problems associated with bots in politics: identification, evidence, attribution, and enforcement. It then explores policy solutions, arguing the solutions must align with the type of disruption bots contribute to.

AB  - Driven by economic exigencies, the Korean government began to strategize entering the rapidly expanding Islamic economy during the early 2000s. Subsequently, decisions to invest into the global halal market ignited public opposition from Korean evangelicals who rejected the positive economic framing of halal-an Islamic concept most commonly used to inform Muslim dietary laws. Based on fieldwork in Korea and analysis of Korean media sources, this article tracks the development of this "halal discourse" through a frame analysis of the discourses created by the Korean government, economic actors, and anti-halal evangelicals, and evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of their arguments. As these competing voices debated halal's place in Korean society, the supporters of halal had to respond to evangelical pushback against halal, leading to notable shifts in the public discourse on halal, an issue that was rooted in deeper underlying debates concerning multiculturalism, globalization, and competing visions of Korea.

AB  - This article investigates how three of the most popular and influential mainstream American situation comedies of the 1990s (Seinfeld, Frasier and Friends) explored and developed societal attitudes to sexual identities. None of these sitcoms feature gay male characters in leading roles, yet (the odd camp restaurant critic aside) they may be seen as pioneering popular televisual representations of attitudes towards male homosexuality. This article argues that these sitcoms (which are today considered homophobic by some) may, in their exploration of problematic responses to differences in sexual identities, be (in effect) more progressive than those series of that period (such as Ellen[1994-98] and Will & Grace 11998-2006, 2017-201) whose representations of central gay characters in positive but often stereotypical ways tended to avoid (or posited that they had no need to engage in) discussions of the prejudices of wider society (of homophobic ridicule, discrimination and violence).

AB  - Fact-checking has spread internationally, in part to confront the rise of digital disinformation campaigns. American studies suggests ideological asymmetry in attitudes toward fact-checking, as well as greater acceptance of the practice among those more interested in and knowledgeable about politics. We examine attitudes toward fact-checking across six European counties to put these findings in a broader context (N = 6,067). We find greater familiarity with and acceptance of fact-checking in Northern Europe (Sweden and Germany) than elsewhere (Italy, Spain, France, and Poland). We further find two dimensions of political antipathy: a left-right dimension and an "anti-elite" dimension (including dissatisfaction with democracy and negative feelings toward the European Union), the latter of which more consistently predicts negative feelings toward fact-checkers in the countries examined. Our findings demonstrate that despite general acceptance of the movement, significant political divides remain. Those less likely to trust fact-checkers could be more vulnerable to disinformation targeting these divides, leading to a spiral of cynicism.

AB  - This article reports a case study of the legislative and media discourse surrounding the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity language to the employment nondiscrimination ordinance of a city in the heart of the Bible Belt. The purpose of the study is to uncover how different identities were constructed and contested at city council meetings and in the news media on the way to passing legal protection for LGBT city employees in a region that is often characterized by anti-gay prejudice. This debate over the nondiscrimination ordinance centered on the question of whether LGBT identities are equivalent to identity categories based on race, gender, or religious belief, and it was shaped by various intergroup communication dynamics, specifically between members of the LGBT minority and the straight majority, between LGBT and Christian identities, and between true and false Christian identities.

TI  - To Vote or Not? Testing Micro-level Theories of Voter Turnout in South Africa's 2014 General Elections
T2  - POLITIKON
LA  - English
KW  - CONTEXT
AB  - Empirical studies rarely examine the reasons why some South Africans choose to vote at elections and others not. In South Africa's early democratic elections scholars assumed that voting was an expression of group loyalties or strong party loyalties. However, the decline in turnout in recent elections appears to contradict these socio-psychological explanations. Using 2014 post-election public opinion data, the paper addresses this research lacuna in the South African literature by testing several theories of voter participation. It finds that the influence of one's social networks and, to a lesser extent, psychological engagement with politics are central to voter turnout. Trade unions and churches, and political parties, despite their obvious efforts to mobilise voters, make little impact on the decision to vote. Media exposure is a weak mobiliser but perceptions of media bias are important, suggesting that people filter out or select among media sources to suit their partisan proclivities, and this exercise in itself encourages turnout.

AB  - When asked to pick a typical human, people are more likely to pick a man than a woman, a phenomenon reflecting androcentrism. Social media websites provide a relevant context in which to study androcentrism since many websites aim to provide users with an ostensibly gender-neutral icon if users do not upload one of their own images. In our first study, 50 male and female online participants (M-age = 35.70) rated whether actual avatar icons from highly trafficked social media websites are perceived as gender-neutral. Using bi-polar scales from woman to man participants reported that overall the icons appeared to be more male-typed than gender neutral. In Study 2, we investigated whether adding more female-typed icons would discourage or promote androcentric thinking. An online sample of 608 male and female participants (M-age = 33.76) viewed either 12 avatar icons that reflected the over-representation of male-typed icons or 12 that included an equal number of male and female-typed icons. Participants were then asked to produce an example of a typical person. Finally, we measured political ideology on two liberal-conservative scales. We found evidence that exposure to an equal number of male-typed and female-typed avatar icons generated reactance among political conservatives, and thus may have constituted an ideological threat. Conservatives who saw an equal number of male-typed and female-typed icons were twice as likely to come up with a man as a typical person compared to conservatives who saw an over-representation of male-typed avatar icons. Consistent with system justification theory, these findings show how male-centric thinking is also evident in a seemingly gender-neutral online context.

AB  - With this paper we discuss the differences between sustainability-related media agendas across different countries and regions. Utilising a sample of 115 leading national newspapers covering forty-one countries, we show that typically no homogeneous global trends exist with regard to sustainability-related media agendas. Instead, significant differences exist regarding the national-level prioritisations of sustainability-related issues in the countries under review. To some extent, these observed differences can be attributed to different levels of socioeconomic development as measured by Human Development Index scores and gross domestic product per capita. Here, generic differences can be identified between newspapers from the Global North and South, with a range of issues such as climate change emerging as typically Northern issues, whereas issues such as corruption and poverty show significantly higher levels of coverage across newspapers from the Global South. We conclude with a discussion of the results in the context of global environmental governance.

AB  - Purpose This study seeks to understand the opinions of internet users toward extreme speech on social media platforms and their willingness to censor such speech. The purpose of this paper is to examine how norms of freedom of expression are changing in an online communication environment dominated by these platforms.
   Design/methodology/approach Four focus groups were conducted in this study. Participants needed to use at least one social media platform daily. Groups were homogeneous in terms of race and gender: African-American females, African-American males, white females and white males.
   Findings Participants in general did not report a strong willingness to censor extreme speech on social media platforms. Rather, they expressed apathy and cynicism toward both their own and social media companies' ability to combat extreme speech and make online discourse more positive. Female participants tended to value the overall health of public discourse and protection of more vulnerable social media users on social media platforms. African-American female participants called for platforms to recognize a special duty to protect minority users, whom they saw as responsible for the platforms' success.
   Research limitations/implications Focus groups are useful for providing exploratory rather than generalizable data. However, by increasing the understanding of how individuals define extreme speech on social media, these data can reveal how individuals rhetorically shape the social media platforms and interpret their role in democratic discourse.
   Originality/value This research takes the rich field of studying tolerance toward extreme speech to new territory: the online realm where public discourse (and especially extreme discourse) is hosted more and more.

AB  - In March 2012 ABC World News Report aired a series of reports on lean finely textured beef (LFTB) that resulted in a 10-year low for beef prices and the bankruptcy of a major firm that produced LFTB.
   Using a random sample survey, we tested the effects of the media frame "pink slime" and industry frame "lean finely textured beef," alongside media use, food-related knowledge, trust in food-related institutions and preference for local, fresh, organic and GMO-free foods on perceptions of risk related to ground beef containing pink slime/LFTB, processed foods and red meat. The "pink slime" frame was strongly and positively associated with risk related to ground beef, but not risk related to red meat or processed foods. Attention to news stories about pink slime/LFTB was strongly associated with risk related to ground beef and processed foods, but not red meat. We found varying effects of food values, knowledge and trust on all three dependent variables. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Public opinion is among the critical types of information that often inform policy changes and political strategies. Extreme public opinion is of particular importance due to the potential it has in leading to radical behaviors and violent actions. The monitoring and analysis of extreme public opinion are therefore of great interest to government officials seeking to maintain public order and preempt violent actions. Radicalization is the process employed to influence individuals to develop extreme views and behaviors. Due to their global reach and popularity, social media platforms are used tools for recruitment and radicalization. Recently, data mining and natural language processing techniques have been employed for the detection of extremism and radicalization online. However, the existing approaches focus on the classification of individuals as extremists or non extremists, thus simplifying the concept of radicalization to a binary problem. Such approaches fail to capture the nuances and the complexity of the radicalization process that is influenced by many aspects such as peer pressure, social interactions, and the impact of prominent figures. Aiming at addressing those limitations, this work proposed a sophisticated approach for the analysis of extreme views expressed on social media. The proposed approach combines the power of artificial intelligence and natural language processing techniques with expert content analysis to achieve a fine-grained and detailed analysis of Twitter extremist content related to the Far-right ideology as a case study. A dataset of over 259,000 tweets collected over five years was used to test our approach, leading to sophisticated analytics and insights about Far-right extremism. The proposed approach can serve as a powerful decision support tool for governments for the analysis of extreme public opinion that is expressed online, and open the door for more effective and responsive decision making.

AB  - A country's budget is one of the most important public policy instruments, as it establishes the government's policy priorities and has the potential to determine winners and losers. The budget, however, is a mixture of different components and these get varying degrees of attention in the media. Drawing on sociology of news research, this paper seeks to explain this heterogeneous coverage of a budget's policy decisions. To do so, it uses a unique data set of over 5,000 articles of press coverage of six UK budgets (2008-2012). These articles are coded for the presence/absence of each of the budget's policy decision, via automated content analysis. On the basis of a multivariate negative binomial model, we find that the salience of a policy decision in the coverage is determined by its cost, whether it is negative (i.e., tax hikes and spending cuts) or positive, the income group that is the most affected by it, and the level of attention given to it by the government.

AB  - The opioid epidemic has had a profound effect on American public health, and studies suggest it has had a profound effect on American politics as well. Research suggests a relationship between the severity of the opioid crisis in a community and aggregate-level political behavior, including voting for Donald Trump in 2016, but there is very little individual-level data establishing the mechanism for this relationship. Using a question on a nationally representative survey fielded after the 2018 election, we explore Americans' perceptions of the severity of the opioid epidemic in their community, and whether these perceptions predict political behavior and attitudes. We find that relative estimates of local opioid overdoses are significantly influenced by the actual county-level overdose death rate, and that the relationship between reality and perception is strongest for the most knowledgeable and informed citizens. There is also evidence that the social construction of the opioid epidemic as a crisis primarily affecting White suburban or rural Americans affects these perceptions, as both White and non-urban respondents are significantly more attentive to objective mortality rates than others. Turning to political behavior, we find no evidence that these estimates affected validated voter turnout or U.S. House vote choice in the 2018 midterm election. Assessing public approval outcomes, we found a nonlinear effect of these estimates on support for President Trump, a pattern which is partially consistent with the existing literature. We also observed that those who believed the opioid epidemic to be worse than average in their communities reported lower approval of their state legislatures, though we found no such relationship for ratings of governors. These findings raise important questions about the micro-level mechanisms that link aggregatelevel public health with political outcomes.

AB  - This study emerged from an incidental, and somewhat surprising, finding that 15 percent of working journalists who attend training on improving the ways that mainstream new media report stories about Islam and Muslims, wrongly associated Sikhism with Islam. We wondered if this was indicative of the Australian population and, through a random stratified survey of the Australian population, found that it was. The question about the extent to which populations wrongly associate Sikhism with Islam is an important one. In Australia, Muslims and Sikhs are minorities. Ignorance of Islam and its religious diversity coupled with ignorance of Muslims and their ethnic and cultural diversity underpins the intolerance of Islam in the West and the concomitant animus directed at Muslims. Intolerance and violence directed at Muslims and people wrongly assumed to be Muslims (such as Sikhs) increased after the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 (9/11). This speaks to religious literacy, the treatment of religious minorities and raises important questions around educating various publics (including the news media) about both Islam and Sikhism. It also speaks to the role of the mainstream news media in perpetuating Islamophobia, and its detrimental flow-on effects to Muslims and Sikhs.

TI  - Social representation of palliative care in the Spanish printed media: A qualitative analysis
T2  - PLOS ONE
LA  - English
KW  - COVERAGE
KW  - BARRIERS
AB  - Background
   Lack of social awareness is a major barrier to the development of palliative care. Mass media influences public opinion, and frequently deal with palliative care contributing to its image and public understanding.
   Aim
   To analyse how palliative care is portrayed in Spanish newspapers, as well as the contribution made by the press to its social representation.
   Design
   Based on criteria of scope and editorial plurality, four print newspapers were selected. Using the newspaper archive MyNews (www.mynews.es), articles published between 2009 and 2014 containing the words "palliative care" or "palliative medicine" were identified. Sociological discourse analysis was performed on the identified texts on two levels: a) contextual analysis, focusing on the message as a statement; b) interpretative analysis, considering the discourse as a social product.
   Results
   We examined 262 articles. Politician and healthcare professionals were the main representatives transmitting messages on palliative care. The discourses identified were characterised by: strong ideological and moral content focusing on social debate, strong ties linking palliative care and death and, to a lesser degree, as a healthcare service. The messages transmitted by representatives with direct experience in palliative care (professionals, patients and families) contributed the most to building a positive image of this healthcare practice. Overall, media reflect different interests in framing public understanding about palliative care.
   Conclusion
   The knowledge generated about how palliative care is reflected in the printed media may help to understand better one of the main barriers to its development not only in Spain, but also in other contexts.

AB  - The use of renewable energies has been rapidly expanding worldwide; however, in numerous countries this has resulted in public controversy. Building upon Entman's framing concept, a quantitative content analysis was conducted to examine the media's framing of renewable energies in 11 countries between 2010 and 2012. To explain the observed differences in media coverage, we considered national structural conditions. Furthermore, we investigated whether media framing changed after an external shock, the Fukushima accident. The findings show that renewable energies were covered through three different frames, (1) the first highlighting economic and technological problems, (2) the second focusing on environmental and social problems and (3) the third considering positive aspects of the technologies. To some extent, the occurrence of these frames is influenced by the national structural conditions. The study revealed that the Fukushima accident did not cause the expected changes in framing.

KW  - culture
AB  - Background National and international polices promote the acceptance, integration and inclusion of people with intellectual disabilities into mainstream society. However, there is little systematic research into general population attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities, and even less research, which considers the impact of culture on attitudes. The aim of this study was to explore how young people from White British and South Asian backgrounds differ in their attitudes towards people with intellectual disabilities and above all, how they arrive at their beliefs.
   Materials and Method A qualitative design utilizing focus groups and individual interviews with White British and South Asian adolescents aged 16-19 years (N = 61) was employed. Questionnaire data were collected to compare this sample to findings from a larger study run concurrently (Attitudes to people with intellectual disabilities: a cross cultural study. Thesis, University College London). Interview and focus group data were analysed using thematic analysis.
   Results Thematic analysis yielded five themes and pointed to widespread confusion about the concept of 'intellectual disability', not helped by the continuing invisibility of people with intellectual disabilities in the media. Participants expressed many positive beliefs, yet closer analysis revealed that underlying these may be more ambivalent or even hostile attitudes. Key differences between the two cultural groups are discussed.
   Conclusions The findings highlight the need for raising public awareness and the importance of culturally sensitive support.

AB  - This study examines the media framings of immigration in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using a content analysis of over 1700 newspaper articles published in 2014 in different cases, my findings show that, regardless of context, the media use a small number of frames to stereotype, generalize and reduce immigration to a singular dimension. My analysis also suggests that the media do not always only have a binary representation of bad or good immigrants. Instead, the media's othering of immigrants is a complex process, suggesting ambivalence despite superficial affirmation. Although my findings also demonstrate that some national differences exist, common patterns can be found across contexts that share similar historical, cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions of immigration. As one of the first cross-regional comparisons of media framings, this research reflects the power dynamics between the elites and immigrants and offers implications for how the media's reinforcement of stereotypes and outsider status of immigrants could potentially shape public opinion and policies regarding immigration.

AB  - Energy storage (ES) is a keystone technology for advancing low-carbon energy transitions, yet energy system change continues to be influenced by socio-political acceptance of emerging innovations such as storage. An initial Canadian contribution to the social-scientific study of ES, we conduct a comparative media analysis of news coverage on storage technologies in the provinces of Alberta and Ontario. Applying the Socio-Political Evaluation of Energy Deployment (SPEED) framework, we analyse representations of ES risks and benefits in 143 articles drawn from top-circulating Canadian newspapers between 2007-2017. We then evaluate frame and narrative trends describing ES in these provinces. In doing so, we identify: (1) a generally optimistic national perspective on ES, despite regional variance in risk and benefit framing; (2) greater attention paid to high-profile, smaller-scale ES technologies; (3) a prominence of sustainability and transition narratives around ES; and (4) a positive temporal shift in ES discourse, reflecting changing regional energy priorities and Canada's increasing commitment to clean energy development. Our findings provide insight on interprovincial differences in social perception on ES and identify possible drivers for these variations to help inform future ES research, deployment and policy strategies in Canada and other evolving national energy markets.

AB  - Objective: To explore normative aspects of the Norwegian discourse on obesity.
   Methods: We conducted a qualitative study with data from five Norwegian newspapers, focusing normative entries about body weight. Discourse analysis provided a focus on the cultural attitudes when systematic text condensation was conducted. Data comprised 26 normative messages (prescriptions or comments on how obese people are or should be, messages mediating or discussing values prescribing a 'good' body).
   Results: Two main normative domains within the obesity discourse were identified. One group of entries warned about obesity from an aesthetic point of view, notifying the reader that beauty would suffer when weight increases, due to reduced attractiveness. These texts appealed to bodily conformity, linking leanness with attractiveness and delight, suggesting that fat people are ugly and unhappy. The other group referred to lack of control in the obese person, linking greediness to lack of responsibility and bad health. Fat people were displayed as undisciplined and greedy individuals who should be ashamed.
   Conclusions: Cultural messages of blame and shame are associated with obesity, but also spreading from body weight to the very scene of life. People with obesity cannot escape this cultural context, only find a way of coping with it.
   Practice implications: Quality care for people with obesity implies that public health and clinical medicine acknowledge the burden of cultural stigma. Developing awareness for cultural prejudices on body weight, doctors could counteract stigmatization and contribute to empowerment and health. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study demonstrates how a hegemonic party learns from its early missteps to become an adept social media user, competing and expanding its digital influence. Singapore's long-standing People's Action Party (PAP) government has extended existing laws and co-opted social media as an information tool to shape public opinion and repress dissent. Its digital innovations include hiring social media consultants, "Internet Brigade" and "influencers" to soft-sell public policies and counter anti-establishment online comments. Based on a comparative analysis of four Facebook activities of four key political parties over the last decade, this study finds Facebook use to have raised electoral competitiveness, albeit temporarily. Singapore's evolving legal framework, coordinated media strategy and lack of transparency governing digital campaign tools enabled the PAP to overtake the opposition parties in expanding social network.

AB  - Ahonen attempts to provide some historical contextualization for the refugee crisis that has dominated much of European public and political debate since 2015. He draws comparisons between the crisis-ridden present and the decade of the previous century that was particularly laden with anticipation of disaster and doom: the 1930s. More specifically, his article explores parallels in public discussions of refugees by European political leaders and media commentators in 1938, on the one hand, and 2015-16, on the other. The coverage of 1938 focuses on the Evian Conference, organized to discuss the problem of Jewish refugees from Nazi Germany, while the analysis of 2015-16 concerns the period from the rapid acceleration of the refugee influx into Europe in the late summer of 2015 to the Brexit referendum of June 2016. Ahonen contends that, despite obvious and significant structural and contextual differences between the late 1930s and the mid-2010s, recent public discussions of the refugee crisis in Europe have closely resembled those conducted around the time of the Evian Conference. Fear and a sense of threat have been the dominant sentiments in the mid-2010s, as they were in the late 1930s, with many similarities in the language and analytical categories in which those sentiments have been publicly expressed. He also provides observations about the potential benefits and pitfalls of diachronic historical comparison, suggesting that an analysis of the failings of refugee policy during the 1930s can provide lessons for better practice today. Aggressive, racialist language about refugees of the kind that was common in the 1930s should have no place in today's public discourses in Europe. Awareness of the continuities that exist in this area can provide important historical perspective, highlighting the persistence of prejudice and the urgency of the need to reject and resist it.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study is to develop and initially validate a psychometrically sound instrument to assess the extent to which Latinx immigrants are viewed as a threat. Method: Drawing on the integrated threat theory (ITT), we developed an initial pool of scale items to represent realistic and symbolic threats. Following best practices in scale construction, we used exploratory factor analysis followed by confirmatory factor analysis to identify, calibrate, and cross-validate the scale structure. A triadic random split of the sample (N = 958) of U.S.-born white college students was used to carry out the three-stage study. Results: Across all stages, findings support the unidimensionality of the 12-item Latinx Immigrant Threat Attitudes Scale (LITAS). Offering evidence of criterion validity, higher LITAS scores were associated with lower support for policies integrating unauthorized immigrants. Conclusions: The LITAS fills a significant gap in the measurement literature. The instrument supports the design and testing of interventions aimed at improving inter-group relations and the lived experience of Latinx immigrants in the United States. Contrary to the widely-used ITT, an undifferentiated, global notion of threat perception is salient; the implications of empirical divergence from the ITT are discussed.

AB  - U.S. Latinx youth from immigrant backgrounds bring to schools their transnational literacies, complex lived experiences of marginalization and resistance, and politicized translanguaging practices that are seldom recognized in classrooms. This article examines U.S. Latinx bilingual youth who participated in a podcast project within a Chicanx/Latinx Studies high school course that mobilized their bilingualism for literacy instruction. This ethnographic classroom study explores a curricular unit that allowed young people to use new media technologies to tell important stories of themselves and their social worlds at a time of heightened anti-immigrant sentiments in the United States. Through translanguaging and translingual frames, I demonstrate how Latinx young people contest racist narratives, reclaim who they are, and author new spaces for solidarity. Findings detail the ways that students utilized podcasts as a tool to promote creativity and self-expression, and to connect personal experiences to broader pressing discourses about immigration, language, racialization processes, and resistance.

TI  - How We Know What We Know about Pakistan: New York Times news production, 1954-71
T2  - MODERN ASIAN STUDIES
LA  - English
AB  - This article explores public knowledge creation by examining how the New York Times produced Pakistan news between 1954 and 1971, the formative period of United States of America (USA)-Pakistan relations. These years encapsulate not only the heyday of cooperation between the two governments, but also the American public's first major introduction to the South Asian country by the increasingly intrepid news media. A leader in shaping that introduction was the New York Times. While most studies of the American media focus on measuring the effect of news exposure and content on public opinion, this article focuses on the theoretically underexplored aspect of news production: foreign news gathering. With a lens on South Asia, it shows that foreign news gathering involves the straddling of on-the-ground political and logistical constraints that generate an atmosphere of high uncertainty. By exploring the limitations on news gathering faced by America's leading newspaper's foreign correspondents in Pakistan in the 1950s and 1960s, this article identifies an important historical source of the ambiguity characterizing USA-Pakistan relations. The findings are based on recently released archival material that offers rare insight into the news-production process.

AB  - Romantic jealousy, a complex response to a real or perceived threat to a romantic relationship, can have serious negative consequences for individuals, partners and perceived rivals. The likelihood of a jealous response is heightened among individuals who experience attachment anxiety, and online communication and social media provide unique fodder for romantic jealousy. The purpose of the current study is to test whether the association between attachment anxiety and online jealousy (jealous response to ambiguous hypothetical online scenarios) is moderated by negative attitudes about online communication. Individuals in dating relationships were asked about attachment anxiety and attitudes about online communication (i.e., apprehension and concern about misunderstandings) as well as emotional, cognitive, and behavioral online jealousy. Hierarchical linear regression revealed an attachment anxiety-attitude interaction, such that the link between attachment anxiety and jealousy was stronger for participants with relatively low levels of negative attitudes about online communication compared to participants with relatively high levels of negative attitudes. The current study expands knowledge about attachment anxiety and jealousy in the context of online communication and social media, and highlights the importance of considering attitudes about online communication when studying relationship processes in the digital arena.

AB  - News media have the power to influence public opinion and economic growth. News coverage of landmark urban parks may influence public support of such parks, potentially increasing economic growth. However, some landmark urban parks have been associated with gentrification and displacement. News media may implicitly support local economic growth to the detriment of vulnerable residents through uncritical, positive coverage of park projects. However, the nature of press coverage of landmark urban parks has been scantly studied. This study analyzed news coverage of three landmark urban parks to understand how news media portray such parks and the voices they represent, using comparative thematic analysis. We found both broad support of parks, contributing to a societal master narrative of parks as a universal good, and some critique. Altogether, positive press coverage outweighed criticism. Uncritical promotion of parks could result in continued creation of landmark parks that threaten to facilitate gentrification and displacement.

AB  - As foreign sources in the news might help the public assess their home country's foreign policies, scholars have recently turned attention to the effects of foreign source cues on domestic public opinion. Using original survey experiments, we explore the effects of domestic (United States) and foreign (Israeli, British, and Palestinian) criticism of Israel's military actions and settlements on US attitudes towards the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We find that foreign cues by government officials and non-governmental organisations have modest effects, and are generally not more influential than domestic cues. We also show that individuals might discount foreign criticism of Israel in the context of US bipartisan support for Israel. While our experiments reveal some heterogeneous effects related to partisanship, we are sceptical of significant movement in opinion in response to foreign cues. These findings provide insights into foreign source cue effects beyond the context of the use of military force.

AB  - Aims: To explore how policy actors attempted to deliberately frame public debate around alcohol minimum unit pricing (MUP) in the UK by comparing and contrasting their constructions of the policy in public (newspapers), semi-public (evidence submissions) and private (interviews). Methods: Content analysis was conducted on articles published in ten national newspapers between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2012. Newsprint data were contrasted with alcohol policy documents, evidence submissions to the Scottish Parliament's Health and Sport Committee and 36 confidential interviews with policy stakeholders (academics, advocates, industry representatives, politicians and civil servants). Findings: A range of policy actors exerted influence both directly (through Parliamentary institutions and political representatives) and indirectly through the mass media. Policy actors were acutely aware of mass media's importance in shaping public opinion and used it tactically to influence policy. They often framed messages in subtly different ways, depending on target audiences. In general, newspapers presented the policy debate in a "balanced'' way, but this arguably over-represented hostile perspective and suggested greater disagreement around the evidence base than is the case. Conclusions: The roles of policy actors vary between public and policy spheres, and how messages are communicated in policy debates depends on perceived strategic advantage.

TI  - Short-Term Communication Effects or Longstanding Dispositions? The Public's Response to the Financial Crisis of 2008
T2  - JOURNAL OF POLITICS
LA  - English
KW  - DELIBERATION
AB  - Economic interests and party identification are two key, long-standing factors that shape people's attitudes on government policy. Recent research has increasingly focused on how short-term communication effects (e.g., issue framing, media priming) also influence public opinion. Rather than posit that political attitudes reflect one source of considerations more than another, we argue that the two interact in a significant and theoretically predictable manner. To explore this claim, we examine the American public's attitudes towards the government's response to the financial crisis of 2008. We designed three survey experiments conducted on a large national sample, in which we examine the influence of (1) group-serving biases, (2) goal framing, and (3) threshold sensitivity. We find that economic standing and partisanship moderate the impact of communication effects as a function of their content. Our results demonstrate how people's sensitivity to peripheral presentational features interacts with more fundamental dispositions in shaping attitudes on complex policy issues.

AB  - This paper analyses the role of news media in (re)producing geopolitical narratives of food insecurity in relation to the 2007-2008 global food price spike. News content and textual analysis suggests that the media's representation of the food price spike is partly framed by Western geopolitical anxieties of the threatening rise of Asia', and features fast growing' Asian appetites among the main culprits of the crisis. Seeking to explain the widespread circulation of such representation, this paper analyses media-source relationship within the context of market-driven journalism, and suggests that the changing role of news media has in turn contributed to a rapid and uncritical circulation of elite-based interpretation of, and neoliberal geopolitical approach to, food security. The paper points at the importance of critical enquiries into geopolitical representations of food insecurity and of opening media space for a counter-geopolitics of food security'.

AB  - With significant nuclear policy changes between the United States and Germany after the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, this article examines journalistic coverage of consumption, economic systems, alternative energy, regulation, and public opinion in relation to nuclear energy within a broader political and media-structural analysis. Using W. L. Bennett's (1990) indexing hypothesis as its theoretical foundation, we conduct a content analysis of 362 articles from The New York Times and 2 German papers, the Suddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) and the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ). Our results indicate there is a vast discrepancy between the countries' newspapers concerning the diversity and the quality of nuclear-oriented information. We then explain these differences in the context of the indexing hypothesis and offer detailed media policy recommendations.

AB  - The London Riots of August 2011 were notable for the prominence of closed-circuit television (CCTV) images of offenders in investigation and prosecution, and in social media and news publicity. The systematic use of CCTV footage in criminal investigations was not new, however. London's Metropolitan Police had pioneered specialist units tasked with acting upon image evidence in the five years prior to the riots, an approach deemed so effective it was termed the Third Forensics'. This article discusses the significance of this claim and its implications for the justice system. The use of images in the investigation of the riots was highly effective, suggesting claims for substantially improved impact in investigation and prosecution are valid, and earlier scepticism regarding both utility and surveillance society agendas in public area CCTV studies was justified. Systematic procedural use of CCTV footage is not new, however, as demonstrated following riots in Vancouver, Canada, and earlier in Bradford, UK. Furthermore, identification in the Third Forensics is eyewitness recognition, and not scientifically or technologically similar to fingerprints or DNA. The article suggests this difference affects risks of prejudice and miscarriages of justice, and profiling of individuals and social categories images appear to represent. The article concludes that while forensic investigation of CCTV images may not meet scientific criteria of a third forensic discipline, it defines nascent development in police investigation, where improvements in procedure have combined with proliferating CCTV systems and social media, leading to a novel set of circumstances raising a number of unexplored issues of such significance that Third Forensics' is a suitable term to use to symbolise them.

AB  - After the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011, there was confusion among the public caused by uncoordinated information about radiation provided by diverse channels. We explored the association between information sources regarding reconstruction progress after the disaster and mental fatigue in Fukushima. We used data from the annual public opinion survey by the Fukushima Prefectural Government on its policies from 2013 to 2015, which contained survey responses from 1,300 community residents randomly selected from the 28 municipalities in the Fukushima Prefecture. The survey contained a question assessing mental fatigue: "How often do you usually feel mentally tired or depressed?" In total, 2,130 participants (758 participants in 2013, 699 participants in 2014, and 673 participants in 2015) were analyzed. The respondents were classified as two categories, "high mental fatigue" and "low mental fatigue," based on their responses to this question. Overall, the proportion of participants with high mental fatigue was 13.2%. There was no association between the year of survey or occupation and high mental fatigue. Cluster analysis was performed to classify information sources. Then, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the associations between clusters of information sources and high mental fatigue. We found that unreliable information sources, such as "Internet" and "a combination of TV, radio, and word of mouth," were significantly associated with high mental fatigue, compared with reliable information sources, such as "municipal public relations in addition to major media (newspaper, TV, and radio)." These findings provide important insights into how information sources affect mental fatigue following a disaster.

AB  - Within the current hybrid media system, in which the old and new media coexist, the role of social networks in the consumption of news has become increasingly important in recent years. Previous research has highlighted the importance and the transformational potential of user interactions in social networks in the traditional news cycle, when exchanging or discussing content related to news or public affairs, jeopardizing the traditional hegemony of the journalists and media as gatekeepers of public affairs. Our research follows a mixed methodological approach (survey plus focus groups) that reach relevant conclusions that expands the body of research about the role of news sites and social networks within the formulation of public opinion and its effects on audiences and journalism. Results showed how news sites and social networks, through links posted by friends, relatives, or acquaintances, facilitate people to access news outside their usual patterns of news consumption. Social networks, in this way, could break with the preestablished dynamics of selective exposure of individuals.

AB  - In this study, we report on changes to reported attitudes, knowledge, and empathy immediately after and 3 months following a round-robin conversation between "askers" and "answerers" in intergroup sessions created by a local public radio station. Listeners were invited to have short one-on-one in-person conversations with people who were members of an identifiable out-group. These were "Ask A" sessions with Muslims, transgender people, Trump supporters, police officers, formerly homeless, newcomers, immigrants, gun owners, foster parents, journalists, and Special Olympians. We found correlations among our assessed variables for askers (N = 113) going into the interactions and increases in the variables as reported after the event. Two of the expectancy variables remained high three months after the sessions.

AB  - Objectives We hypothesise that patients have a positive sentiment regarding biological/targeted synthetic disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) and a negative sentiment towards conventional synthetic agents (csDMARDs). We analysed discussions on social media platforms regarding DMARDs to understand the collective sentiment expressed towards these medications.
   Methods Treato analytics were used to download all available posts on social media about DMARDs in the context of rheumatoid arthritis. Strict filters ensured that user generated content was downloaded. The sentiment (positive or negative) expressed in these posts was analysed for each DMARD using sentiment analysis. We also analysed the reason(s) for this sentiment for each DMARD, looking specifically at efficacy and side effects.
   Results Computer algorithms analysed millions of social media posts and included 54 742 posts about DMARDs. We found that both classes had an overall positive sentiment. The ratio of positive to negative posts was higher for b/tsDMARDs (1.210) than for csDMARDs (1.048). Efficacy was the most commonly mentioned reason in posts with a positive sentiment and lack of efficacy was the most commonly mentioned reason for a negative sentiment. These were followed by the presence/absence of side effects in negative or positive posts, respectively.
   Conclusions Public opinion on social media is generally positive about DMARDs. Lack of efficacy followed by side effects were the most common themes in posts with a negative sentiment. There are clear reasons why a DMARD generates a positive or negative sentiment, as the sentiment analysis technology becomes more refined, targeted studies could be done to analyse these reasons and allow clinicians to tailor DMARDs to match patient needs.

AB  - This study attempts to further our understanding of the contextual sources of anti-immigrant sentiments by simultaneously examining the impact of immigrant group size, negative immigration-related news reports and their interaction on natives' perceived group threat. We test our theoretical assumptions using repeated cross-sectional survey data from Spain during the time period 1996-2007, enriched with regional statistics on immigrant group size and information from a longitudinal content analysis of newspaper reports. Drawing on multilevel regression models, our findings show that a greater number of negative immigration-related news reports increases perceived group threat over and above the influence of immigrant group size. Additionally, our findings indicate that the impact of negative immigration-related news reports on perceived group threat is amplified (weakened) in regions with a smaller (larger) immigrant group size. Collectively, these results testify to the importance of immigrant group size and negative immigration-related news reports as key contextual sources of natives' perceived group threat.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has been paired with a global misinformation "infodemic." Citizens in authoritarian countries, where most media is state controlled, often do not have access to credible information sources to help combat misinformation. In fact, the news media in these countries may be the primary drivers of misinformation while digital media may be sources of more accurate information. We test how news and digital media in an authoritarian context are associated with endorsing misinformation while introducing the concept of informational learned helplessness as an additional factor driving inaccurate beliefs. We test our hypotheses employing data from a nationally representative telephone survey of the Russian public (N=1600) and discuss the implications of our findings for Russian attitudes about COVID-19 vaccination.

AB  - As millions of people turn to social media for health information, better understanding the factors that guide health-related judgments and perceptions in this context is imperative. We report on two Web experiments (n > 400 total) examining the power of society's widespread weight bias and related stereotypes to influence nutrition judgments in social media spaces. In Experiment 1, meals were judged as lower in nutritional quality when the person who recommended them (the source) was depicted as obese rather than of normal weight, an effect mediated by stereotypic beliefs about the source as a generally unhealthy person. Experiment 2 replicated this effect, whichnotablyremained significant when controlling for objective nutritional information (calories and fat content). Results highlight spillover effects of weight bias that extend beyond person perception to color impressions of objects (here, food) that are associated with stigmatized attributes. Implications for everyday nutrition judgments and public health are considered.

AB  - Foreign policy events, including secessionism and independence movements, become objectified for most citizens through media coverage. Accordingly, I look at the coverage of Kosovo's and Scotland's bids for independence in the two top national newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Scholarship in international law, democratic theory, and comparative politics might have valuable insights on independence processes, but it is the media frames inspired by these strands of theoretical literature that shape public opinion and/or reflect policy-makers' preferences (and biases) in the foreign policy arena. I find that print media can engage in theoretically sophisticated coverage of secessionist movements, which often echoes scholarly insights derived from the relevant academic literature. The two European case studies show consistent application of tropes and frames that one would find in the academic publications on the subject. Yet these cases also illustrate profound differences in media framing not reducible to objective legal and political differences between the two events. US foreign policy considerations also appear to play a role in explaining variance in media frames.

AB  - Due to its peculiar nature, the economic and financial press, throughout history, has had a particular liberty of action in times of tight media controls imposed by the authorities. Both the type of content that it spreads - technical information useful for markets and businesses - and its limited public visibility - with tiny, but influential, audiences - have facilitated this media's carte blanche to influence elite public opinion in moments of profound political and economic change. This phenomenon can be analysed in some detail around the processes of the political transitions experienced in many authoritarian and totalitarian regimes in the last third of the 20th century. As discussed in this article, economic publications played an important role in changing the mindset of the ruling classes in Argentina, Spain, Russia, China and South Africa, before and after political changes, during times when freedom of the press was restricted for other media.

KW  - linguistic prejudices
KW  - gender
AB  - This paper analyzes the resistant stances enacted by six recently-graduated, Hindi medium educated (HME) Indian women against the primacy accorded to English medium educated (EME) individuals in urban professional hiring practices. The data were collected in face-to-face, audio-recorded interviews by the researcher in the summer of 2013 from New Delhi. Aligning with Jaffe's (2009) argument that a salient role of stance-based research is to theorize the relationship between stancetaking and sociocultural conditions and adopting a critical constructivist perspective (while withholding claims about participants' inner psychological states), this paper shows that within the postcolonial context of urban India, the liminal, hybrid, third spaces of participants' locations are discursively connected to the exigencies and inequalities characteristic of their local social structures. Analysis of participants' resistant stances demonstrates their complex, multi-layered, and context-specific characteristics elucidating the ways in which these stance performances are achieved by variously intertwining discourses about linguistic prejudices, nationalism, colonialism, gender and socioeconomic conditions. Specifically, these sociopolitical issues are related to (i) gender-based personal safety anxieties, (ii) neoliberal discourses about India's demographic dividend (i. e. the public celebration of the increase in the country's 'young' population), (iii) arguments about justice, citizenship and national language, (iv) discourses of colonialism and government apathy, (v) group rights, ethics and responsibilities, and (vi) an unvarnished shaming of the ubiquity of EME preference in local hiring practices. The paper argues that HME-associated linguistic exclusionary practices, whether driven by economic necessities or by biased linguistic ideologies, perpetuate and deepen existing class-based divides, fail the aspirational needs of a growing urban, youthful, and vernacular medium educated population while further complicating the challenges faced by women in a historically patriarchal society.

TI  - Tragic Form in Kamila Shamsie's Home Fire
T2  - CLASSICAL RECEPTIONS JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - This article examines Kamila Shamsie's adaptation of Sophocles' Antigone in Home Fire (2017), a novel focused on Muslim identity, Islamophobia, and citizenship rights in contemporary Britain. It demonstrates that this novel is a multimedia work full of theatrical traces: a literary archive that preserves the dramatic quality of Sophocles' play but also encompasses multiple other forms of media and performance, from theatre and television to social media. The article focuses not so much on how Shamsie has adapted the plot of Antigone but on her reworking of tragedy's formal features or structures, such as dialogue, the chorus, and the messenger speech. In this polyphonic novel, such multimedia theatricality facilitates something that Greek tragedy itself produces: a contestation of multiple voices for audiences to hear, critique, and put against their own. Shamsie's manipulation of tragic form thus contributes to Home Fire's political import.

AB  - This article examines selected print media coverage of a domestic natural disaster and domestic industrial failure in each of three Westminster countries: Australia, Canada, and the UK. It studies this coverage from several perspectives: the volume of coverage; the rate at which the articles were published; the tone of the headlines; and a content analysis of the perceived performance of key public and private institutions during and following the events. Its initial findings reveal that the natural disasters received more coverage than the industrial failures in each of the newspapers considered. There was also no significant difference in the publication rate across event type or newspaper. In each case, government was assessed at least as frequently and negatively as non-government actors, particularly during and following industrial failures. The manner in which government and non-government actors were assessed following these events suggests that, contrary to government claims that owners and operators of critical infrastructure (CI) are responsible for its successful operation, government in fact is "in the frame" as frequently as the industry owners and operators are. In addition, the negative assessments of governments following industrial failures in particular may prompt over-reaction by policy makers to industrial failures and under-reaction to natural disasters. This inconsistency is indeed ironic because the latter occur more often and cost more, both financially and socially. We reviewed 340 newspaper articles from three different newspapers: The Australian's coverage of the Canberra bushfires and the Waterfall train accident, The Globe and Mail's (Canada) coverage of Hurricane Juan and the de la Concorde overpass collapse, and The Daily Telegraph's (UK) coverage of the 2007 floods and the Potters Bar train wreck. Our sample size is small; our ability to compare across newspapers and countries limited. Further research is warranted.

AB  - While much recent attention has been focused on the impact of incarceration on ex-prisoners, less has been paid to the general public's informal attitudes and responses to crime and offenders. This article begins to fill this void by exploring the impact of individual and neighborhood characteristics on attitudes toward crime and prisoner reentry. The article is based on two phases of data collection. During phase one, residents of four Massachusetts communities were surveyed about their attitudes and experiences with crime and prisoner reentry. During phase two, qualitative interviews and participant observation were used to explore how crime and reentry issues are framed across community context. The survey data suggest both that individual-level predictors (e.g. political affiliation, sex, parenthood, and several crime-related factors) of punitiveness are significant, and that there is a neighborhood context to these beliefs. The focus in analyzing the qualitative data is on two contrasting communities. These data suggest varying ways of framing 'the crime problem' that help explain the neighborhood context of these attitudes. Specifically, a localized framing shapes less punitive attitudes, while a focus on a general crime problem contributes to greater punitiveness.

TI  - Stance polarity in political debates: A diachronic perspective of network homophily and conversations on Twitter
T2  - DATA & KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING
LA  - English
KW  - Stance
KW  - Political debates
KW  - Homophily
KW  - Twitter
AB  - In the last decade, social media gained a very significant role in public debates, and despite the many intrinsic difficulties of analyzing data streaming from on-line platforms that are poisoned by bots, trolls, and low-quality information, it is undeniable that such data can still be used to test the public opinion and overall mood and to investigate how individuals communicate with each other. With the aim of analyzing the debate in Twitter on the 2016 referendum on the reform of the Italian Constitution, we created an Italian annotated corpus for stance detection for automatically estimating the stance of a relevant number of users. We take into account a diachronic perspective to shed lights on users' opinion dynamics. Furthermore, different types of social network communities, based on friendships, retweets, quotes, and replies were investigated, in order to analyze the communication among users with similar and divergent viewpoints. We observe particular aspects of users' behavior. First, our analysis suggests that users tend to be less explicit in expressing their stances after the outcome of the vote; simultaneously, users who exhibit a high number of cross-stance relations tend to become less polarized or to adopt a more neutral style in the following phase of the debate. Second, despite social media networks are generally aggregated in homogeneous communities, we highlight that the structure of the network can strongly change when different types of social relations are considered. In particular, networks defined by means of reply-to messages exhibit inverse homophily by stance, and users use more often replies for expressing diverging opinions, instead of other forms of communication. Interestingly, we also observe that the political polarization increases forthcoming the election and decreases after the election day.

AB  - Issues related to ethnic-cultural diversity often make the news headlines in popular media and have attracted extensive attention in the political arena, as well as in academic research in psychology, political sciences, and sociology. Political scientist Robert Putnam reported that increased diversity is associated with a range of negative outcomes, including less trust, a decreased sense of community, more prejudice, and more cynicism and mistrust toward politics and politicians. Yet given that follow-up studies have often revealed mixed results, a novel approach to understanding the effects of diversity is needed. Here, we address the impact of diversity from a Person x Context interaction perspective, demonstrating that diversity aggravates the negative attitudes that already exist among certain individuals. Specifically, we review the accumulated evidence showing that people high in authoritarian attitudes are particularly sensitive to diversity and prone to react with increased negativity to out-groups, politicians, the political system, and democracy.

AB  - In the context of increasing concerns about false and deceptive information in public opinion, this research note explores which causes and sources news users associate with the dissemination of misinformation. Based on representative survey data collected in the Netherlands (N = 1,994), we found that news users distinguish unintentional causes related to uncertain evidence and lacking expert knowledge from politically or financially motivated falsehoods. People on the left-wing of the political spectrum associate falsehoods more with the radical-right, whereas those on the right-wing tend to associate misinformation with the radical-left. Right-wing participants, however, are most likely to perceive misinformation as driven by a deliberate attempt to hide reality. Our findings point to an ideological bias in information credibility that could foster polarization along epistemic lines.

LA  - English
KW  - Surgical mesh
KW  - Hernia repair
KW  - Patient internet self-education
AB  - Background As internet access improves, patient self-education continues to increase. However, patient surgical background, e-literacy, and media exposure potentially influence what information patients search online. This impacts patient concern, healthcare decisions, and subsequent patient-physician interactions. The purpose of this pilot study is to characterize hernia patients' use and the impact of internet self-education regarding surgical mesh. Methods The target population included patients presenting for evaluation of hernia repair with mesh. A total of 30 patients were enrolled. Patients took surveys before and after the initial surgical consult. The surveys evaluated internet use, mesh research completed, the impact on patient opinions/decisions, and the impact of research on the patient-physician interaction. Results The average age of the patients was 58.7 years; sixteen had prior surgery with surgical mesh. 93% of patients were aware of surgical mesh through the media, and 60% were motivated by the media to conduct research. 90% of patients conducted research, and 67% used the internet. Patients with negative attitudes toward mesh had more media exposure in comparison to those with neutral or positive attitudes (p = 0.046), and they were more likely to have researched surgical mesh because of media influence (p = 0.033). This group had the highest rate of perceived knowledge on mesh risks and the lowest regarding benefits (p = 0.013). Patients who had prior surgery without complication had the most positive attitude toward surgical mesh (p = 0.010) and were less likely to plan to do future internet research (p = 0.041) in comparison to patients who had surgery with complications or no prior surgery. Conclusions Patients' attitudes and perceived knowledge regarding surgical mesh are associated with media exposure and internet research. These attributes along with prior surgical experience impact the patient-physician relationship and shared decision-making model regarding patient care.

AB  - The emergence of Donald Trump as an anti-Muslim-Islam presidential candidate and victory over Hillary Clinton is an issue of debate and division in the United States' political sphere. Many commentators and political pundits criticize Trump for his disparaging rhetoric on Twitter and present him as an example of how Twitter can be an effective tool for the construction and extension of political polarization. The current study analyzes the selected tweets by Donald Trump posted on Twitter to unmask how he uses language to construct Islamophobic discourse structures and attempts to form his ideological structures along with. The researchers hypothesize that Islamophobia is a marked feature of Trump's political career realized by specific rhetorical and discursive devices. Therefore, the study purposively takes 40 most controversial tweets of Donald Trump against Islam and Muslims and carried out a critical discourse analysis with the help of macro-strategies of the discourse given by Wodak and Meyer and van Dijk's referential strategies of political discourse. The findings reveal that Trump uses language rhetorically to exclude people of different ethnic identities, especially Muslims, through demagogic language to create a difference of "us" vs. "them" and making in this way "America Great Again".

AB  - Background Understanding public attitudes towards death and dying is important to inform public policies around End of Life Care (EoLC). We studied the public attitudes towards death and dying in Wales. Methods An online survey was conducted in 2018. Social media and the HealthWiseWales platform were used to recruit participants. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Results 2,210 people participated. Loss of independence (84%), manner of death, and leaving their beloved behind were the biggest fears around death and dying. In terms of EoLC, participants sought timely access to care (84%) and being surrounded by loved ones (62%). Being at home was less of a priority (24%). Only 50% were familiar with Advance Care Planning (ACP). A lack of standard procedures as well as of support for the execution of plans and the ability to revisit those plans hindered uptake. The taboo around death conversations, the lack of opportunities and skills to initiate discussion, and personal fear and discomfort inhibited talking about death and dying. 72% felt that we do not talk enough about death and dying and advocated normalising talking by demystifying death with a positive approach. Health professionals could initiate and support this conversation, but this depended on communication skills and manageable workload pressure. Participants encouraged a public health approach and endorsed the use of: a) social media and other public platforms, b) formal education, c) formal and legal actions, and d) signposting and access to information. Conclusions People are ready to talk about death and dying and COVID-19 has increased awareness. A combination of top-down and bottom-up initiatives across levels and settings can increase awareness, knowledge, and service-utilisation-drivers to support health professionals and people towards shared decisions which align with people's end of life wishes and preferences.

AB  - Modern sports have increasingly acquired more social relevance, amplified as it is by the media and, especially, advertising, thereby making sports closer than ever to the average citizen. In 2015 the sports brand Reebok initiated a campaign to promote fitness by highlighting and valuing the human side of sports.The objective of this study is to analyze this campaign, assessing the existence of sexist prejudices, if any. Content analysis has been chosen as the method of study. A total of 439 images uploaded by Instagram users between January 2015 and May 2016 that were employed in Reebok's campaign have been evaluated.The results indicate that photos of single, thin, and white women predominate. We can conclude that although the photos in Reebok's campaign portray women in attitudes contrary to what sexist prejudices dictate - e.g. sweaty, tired - there is a clear adjustment to the canons of beauty that have traditionally been projected onto women.

TI  - Meaningful messaging: Sentiment in elite social media communication with the public on the COVID-19 pandemic
T2  - SCIENCE ADVANCES
LA  - English
AB  - Elite messaging plays a crucial role in shaping public debate and spreading information. We examine elite political communication during an emergent international crisis to investigate the role of tone in messaging, information spread, and public reaction. By measuring tone in social media messages from members of the U.S. Congress related to the COVID-19 pandemic, we find clear partisan differences and a differential impact of tone on message engagement and information spread. This suggests that even in the midst of an international health crisis, partisanship and emotional rhetoric play a critical part in elite communications and contribute to the attention messages receive. The messaging on COVID-19 is polarized and fractured. The valenced messaging provokes divergence in public engagement, reaction, and information spread. These results have important implications for studies of representation, public opinion, and how government can effectively engage individuals in emergent situations or pivotal moments.

AB  - This paper examines how young people are constructed as media pirates in three Canadian newspapers during two publication periods, 1998-2000 and 2010-2012. These periods bookend copyright law modernization in the United States and Canada, represented by the American Digital Millennium Copyright Act, passed in 1998, and the Canadian Copyright Modernization Act, passed in 2012. Drawing on a corpus of articles from The Globe and Mail, The Toronto Star, and the Calgary Herald as primary texts, I use critical discourse analysis and media frame analysis to argue that the discursive construction in print media of the young person as pirate reveals public attitudes toward copyright law.

AB  - This article examines the dynamics of political participation on the We Are All Khaled Said' Facebook page, which hosted the call for Egypt's 25 January 2011 revolution. It shows that the page served as a proto-democratic instrument by introducing both qualitative and quantitative polls and following up with actions based on majority opinion. This argument is developed through an analysis of discussion threads and polls from the page, selected from a data set of 14,072 posts, 6,810,357 comments and 32,030,731 likes made by 1,892,118 users, extracted via a customized version of Netvizz. The analysis demonstrates that the page provided a basic lesson in democratic participation to its users. We Are All Khaled Said' constituted an unprecedented public space for active discussions on fighting corruption, torture and police brutality. Moreover, it served as a practical example of shared governance and political participation, which became a model for its users to strive to apply to their country.

AB  - Based on complex adaptive system theory and information theory for investigating heterogeneous situations, this paper develops an outlier knowledge management framework based on three aspects-dimension, object, and situation-for dealing with extreme public health events. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, we apply advanced natural language processing (NLP) technology to conduct data mining and feature extraction on the microblog data from the Wuhan area and the imported case province (Henan Province) during the high and median operating periods of the epidemic. Our experiment indicates that the semantic and sentiment vocabulary of words, the sentiment curve, and the portrait of patients seeking help were all heterogeneous in the context of COVID-19. We extract and acquire the outlier knowledge of COVID-19 and incorporate it into the outlier knowledge base of extreme public health events for knowledge sharing and transformation. The knowledge base serves as a think tank for public opinion guidance and platform suggestions for dealing with extreme public health events. This paper provides novel ideas and methods for outlier knowledge management in healthcare contexts.

AB  - Between pro-retrenchment politicians and segments of the media, exaggerated claims about the generous benefits enjoyed by those on welfare are relatively common. But to what extent, and under what conditions, can they actually shape attitudes towards welfare? This study explores these questions via a survey experiment conducted in the UK, examining: (1) the extent to which the value of the claimed figure matters; (2) if the presence of anchoring information about minimum wage income has an impact; and (3) whether these effects differ based on egalitarianism and political knowledge. Results suggest that increasing the size of the claimed figure decreases support in a broadly linear fashion, with anchoring information important only when (asserted) benefit levels are modestly above the minimum wage income. Egalitarianism, in turn, primarily matters when especially low figures are placed alongside information about minimum wage, while low-knowledge respondents were more susceptible to anchoring effects than high-knowledge ones.

AB  - This study analyzed the agenda-building capacity of political public relations messages of the Saudi and the U.S. governments during Donald Trump's visit to the Middle East and scrutinized their influence on the media coverage and public opinion. The findings indicate that all three levels of agenda-building received solid empirical support from the data: governmental information subsidies significantly influenced media coverage and public opinion on the level of issues and stakeholders (1st level), their attributes (2nd level), and networked co-occurrences of issues/stakeholders (3rd level of agenda-building). Traditional information subsidies emerged as a powerful tool driving the agenda-building process. The study confirms the effective capacity of public relations communication to build the media and the public agendas in non-Western media culture and expands the applicability of the agenda-building network analysis research to the Middle Eastern media market.

AB  - Opinionated news targets communities of likeminded viewers, relies on dramaturgical storytelling techniques, and shares characteristics with political satire. Accordingly, opinionated news should be understood as a specific form of political entertainment. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of opinionated news on political attitudes using an experimental design that employed manipulated television news items. Findings confirm that opinionated news positively affects policy attitudes via its presumed influence on others and subsequent perceptions of the opinion climate. However, opinionated news also negatively affects attitudes via hostile media perceptions and evoked anger, especially for people with incongruent political preferences. Due to these opposing processes, we found no total effect of opinionated news on policy attitudes. Conditions are discussed under which either the positive or the negative indirect effect is likely to dominate.

A part of the article deals with terrorism in the media over time, common stereotypes, and how they affect the representation of Arabs and Muslims. The article then discusses Sleeper Cell (2005), a mini-series which focuses on a Jihad terror group. The article addresses questions including: How are Arabs and non-Arab Muslims portrayed in the series? Can a real change be observed over time in the method of portraying them? Twentieth-century historical considerations precede the pointed topical discussion.

AB  - This article examines whether media portrayals of Islam and Muslims are overwhelmingly negative, whether they have evolved over time, and what factors most consistently affect their tone. We analyse every fourth New York Times headline about Islam or Muslims between 1985 and 2013. We find that headlines have not been predominantly negative. In addition, New York Times headlines about Islam and Muslims have become more positive over the long term, even after the 9/11 attacks. Most counter-intuitively, we find that terrorist attacks have had a systematic positive effect on headline tone. During the first four weeks after each Islamist terrorist attack on an American target, the tone of New York Times headlines became significantly more positive compared to the four weeks prior to the attack. However, over the subsequent few months, coverage reverted back toward the tone that prevailed during the weeks before the event.

AB  - The refugee crisis and the rising number of asylum seekers is one of the primary concerns of the EU. Political discussions reflect humanitarian, social and economic implications of the constant influx of new asylum seekers coming mainly from Syria. Within the political sphere in the V4 countries it is possible to observe negative attitudes. In this context, it is very important to emphasize that we are living in a democratic society, where media represent the role of democracy guardians. On the other hand, social media offer space for expression to the general public opinions, and their potential is also fully exploited by political leaders. The potential of social media must be perceived also against the backdrop of risks stemming mainly from disinformation and manipulative tendencies. In order to identify and clarify the presence of manipulative techniques in the communication of political and social groups to the attitudes of Generation Y in the sphere of migrant tolerance we present some introductory findings under the scope of project VEGA 1/0192/18.

AB  - University students represent a highly active group in terms of their social activity in the community and in the propagation of information on social media. We aimed to map the knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions of University students in Cyprus about severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) and Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) to guide targeted future measures and information campaigns. We used a cross-sectional online survey targeting all students in conventional, not distance-learning, programs in five major universities in the Republic of Cyprus. Students were invited to participate through the respective Studies and Student Welfare Office of each institution. The survey was made available in English and Greek on REDCap. Participation was voluntary and anonymous. The questionnaire was developed based on a consensus to cover the main factual information directed by official channels toward the general public in Cyprus at the time of the survey. In addition to sociodemographic information (N = 8), the self-administered questionnaire consisted of 19 questions, assessing the knowledge regarding the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, infection prevention and control measures (N = 10), perceptions related to COVID-19, for instance, whether strict travel measures are necessary (N = 4), and attitudes toward a hypothetical person infected (N = 2). Furthermore, participants were asked to provide their own assessment of their knowledge about COVID-19 and specifically with regard to the main symptoms and ways of transmission (N = 3). The number of students who completed the survey was 3,641 (41% studying Health/Life Sciences). Amongst them, 68.8% responded correctly to at least 60% of knowledge-related questions. Misconceptions were identified in 30%. Only 29.1% expressed a positive attitude toward a hypothetical person with COVID-19 without projecting judgment (9.2%) or blame (38%). Odds of expressing a positive attitude increased by 18% (95% CI 13-24%; p < 0.001) per unit increase in knowledge. Postgraduate level education was predictive of better knowledge (odds ratio (OR) 1.81; 95% CI 1.34-2.46; p < 0.001 among doctoral students] and positive attitude [OR 1.35; 95% CI 1.01-1.80; p = 0.04). In this study, we show that specific knowledge gaps and misconceptions exist among University students about SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 and their prevalence is associated with negative attitudes toward people with COVID-19. Our findings highlight the integrated nature of knowledge and attitude and suggest that improvements to the former could contribute to improvements in the latter.

AB  - Protected areas rate among the most popular nature conservation measures according to general public opinion in Germany. However, people living close to these sites do not always share this positive view In fact, the implementation of such measures often leads to conflicts between the local resident population and management staff, which in many cases emanate from the failure to actively involve locals in the decision processes. Communication and participation are now acknowledged as crucial for the acceptance of nature conservation measures and are applied more and more in practice, but these factors do not guarantee the successful cooperation between the protected areas' administration units and their inhabitants. Past experiences and events may have planted mistrust and antipathies now thoroughly embedded in the collective memory, and thus hinder successful results in future decision-making processes. By means of discourse analysis, we examined a bottom-up process initiated in the Bavarian Forest National Park (southern Germany) concerning the future management of its red deer population. This exemplary study reveals the pivotal role the media plays in presenting the public discourse on nature conservation issues in general, and which discursive elements may have led to the final failure of the project in the case study presented.

AB  - The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion concerning political leaders by either selecting or negating what to report. Extensive research has shown that apart from informing the public about issues of interest, the media is a socio-political institution responsible for framing events and issues to influence the audience engagement with news. This article reports on a study that used a qualitative case study approach to investigate how Independent Online (IOL) and News24 frames were used to either legitimise or de-legitimise the political and leadership qualities of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma who was appointed as the Minister of Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation on 27 February 2018. The study interrogated whether IOL and News24 frames reinforced the gender biases normally assigned to South African women in the news. The two key questions asked in the study were: "How were Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma's leadership and political characteristics portrayed by the media?" and "Did the portrayal of Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma evoke any gendered media biases?" An analysis of 100 electronic online news articles purposively retrieved from IOL and News24 archives was conducted. The study identified that the media evoked cultural constituted frames that were replete with gender stereotypes to discredit Dlamini-Zuma's leadership and political qualities. Thus, the study has contributed to research on the framing of women leaders by demonstrating how IOL and News24 frames were infused with gendered stereotypes.

AB  - Objective: To identify attitudes towards pharmacy characteristics and promotional methods for selected pharmacy public health services (lifestyle advice and screening for cardiovascular risk factors) among different sectors of the general public.
   Study design: Cross-sectional survey, using a previously validated questionnaire.
   Methods: Three survey methods were used, across 15 areas of England, to maximize diversity: face-to-face; telephone; and self-completion of paper questionnaires. Responses to closed questions regarding characteristics and promotion were quantified and differences among sub-groups explored by univariate and multivariate analysis.
   Results: In total, 2661 responses were available for analysis: 2047 face-to-face; 301 telephone; and 313 paper. There were strong preferences for a pharmacy near to home or doctor's surgery and for long opening hours, particularly among employed people and non whites. Fifty percent preferred not to use a pharmacy in a supermarket, particularly older people, the retired, those of lower education and frequent pharmacy users. Personal recommendation by health professionals or family/friends was reported as most likely to encourage uptake of pharmacy public health services, with older people and males being less likely and frequent pharmacy users more likely to perceive any promotional method as influential. Posters/leaflets were preferred over mass-media methods, with fewer than 30% perceiving the latter as potentially influential.
   Conclusion: Pharmacists, pharmacy companies and service commissioners should use promotional methods favoured by potential users of pharmacy public health services and be aware of differences in attitudes when trying to reach specific population sub-groups. For personal recommendation to be successful, good inter-professional working and a pro-active approach to existing customers are needed. (C) 2016 The Royal Society for Public Health.

AB  - Public perceptions and expectations towards ecosystems are an important part of environmental management and planning. This article focuses on the media representations that disseminate information, create framings and influence public attitudes. More specifically, the focus is on print media representations of ecosystem disservices. Ecosystem disservices are functions or properties of ecosystems that cause negative effects on human well-being or that are perceived as harmful, unpleasant or unwanted. Results from a case study focusing on the Finnish newspaper coverage of ecosystem disservices are presented. The results show that a wide variety of harms and nuisances related to ecosystems are brought up and discussed by the media. Implications for environmental management are discussed. The key claim is that taking into account the full repertoire of media representations of ecosystem functions is vital for preventing, anticipating and solving controversies related to environmental management and planning.

KW  - LANGUAGE
AB  - With global attention currently focused on the challenge of providing Education for All (UNESCO 2000), we must ensure that the language of teaching and learning remains a topic on the agenda towards making sure that the education being provided is effective. This is therefore a critical time to review medium of instruction debates, and to reassess what empirical evidence exists to guide policymaking that is both appropriate and achievable. Contributing to this endeavour, this paper argues for the approximate replication of two key studies. The first is Afolayan (1976), a widely-cited study conducted in Ife, Nigeria to test the effectiveness of teaching children in the mother tongue for six years of primary education. We argue that the frequency with which the success of this study is cited, without due attention paid to the details of its methodological procedure, may actually be detrimental to the success of other experiments, thus necessitating the careful replication of the original study. The second study is Siegel (1997b), one of the few studies that have been conducted to evaluate the impact of initial education in an English-based pidgin on the subsequent learning of English. We argue that there is an urgent need for replication of one of the few available studies of pidgins and creoles in education, given the prevalence of negative attitudes towards this category of languages.

AB  - This qualitative case study utilized critical media literacy to guide the analysis of the depiction of racially and ethnically diverse college students in contemporary popular films. Participants in this study were racially and ethnically diverse undergraduate students enrolled at a private, predominantly White institution in the United States. Three primary themes emerged from this study. First, students of color were more apt to recognize stereotypical portrayals of people of color in the films, whereas White students' responses were more attuned with color-blind racial ideology (CBRI). Second, media-centered discussions provided an outlet for students of color to share their personal experiences with racism, stereotyping, and prejudice. In doing so, students of color seek to build the cultural competence of peers who may hold CBRI beliefs. Finally, this study presents a need for critical media literacy. Regardless of race and/or ethnicity, the undergraduates who participated in our study communicated an importance of examining media messages, such as stereotypes of people of color, from a critical perspective. For college and university administrators, such as chief diversity officers, this study is significant in presenting a means for engaging students, faculty, and other stakeholders in dialogue about racial issues in the hopes of fostering a more welcoming campus racial climate for students of color.

AB  - The firm Masglo sells nail polish in several regions of the Americas, predominantly in its home of Colombia. Some of Masglo's colors have been marketed through words associated with "slut-shaming" and other misogynistic concepts, which stimulated a 2015 consumer debate on Twitter and Facebook. We analyze the tweets from those exchanges and relate them to feminism, anti-feminism, and the status of women in Colombian society. Our results show that female clients, who were the main participants in the debate, most favored the company's strategy. Some nodes highlighted deeply rooted Colombian gender roles or reflected on sociocultural status and femininity as political issues. Nail varnishes that suggested associations with feminism, such as "empowered", "diverse," or "human," were practically ignored. The debate changed little: in keeping with the nation's macho culture and commercially narrow beauty norms, the company continues to exploit invidious stereotypes. In the future, a cross-class women's solidarity with all of those engaged in the beauty industry must emerge.

AB  - With more people using social media on a daily basis and the prevalence of racial discrimination online, it becomes imperative to understand what factors impact minority individuals' perceptions of these transgressions in an online context. Confrontation to discrimination in the form of comments on social media may meaningfully shape perceptions of racism online. Across three studies, we examine how confrontation type (aggressive vs. passive) and confronter group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) influence Asian Americans' perceptions of online prejudice and attitudes towards the confronters. In Study 1, we find that aggressive confrontations alter perceptions of a racist online post to be more offensive as compared to passive confrontations. In Study 2, these findings extend to participants' likelihood to report the content as offensive. Lastly, in Study 3, we find that aggressive confronters are evaluated more positively than passive confronters. These findings have important implications for understanding racial discrimination in an online context by demonstrating the impact of confrontation type on minority individuals' perceptions and behaviors.

AB  - In decision-making for major emergencies, the risk of a decision is caused by both the uncertainty of the decision maker and his or her deviation from group consistency. In this paper, a two-stage risk emergency decision-making method for large groups based on social media big data is hence proposed. In this method, the user-generated content related to major emergencies is first collected from social media. Then, an emergency decision attribute system is constructed based on the public opinion information about events, which is obtained by natural language processing. Term frequency-inverse document frequency and expert evaluation are used to determine the weights of the attributes. Second, an open two-stage decision-making process is designed to quantify decision risk according to the reliability and accuracy of decision makers' opinions. Here, clustering is used to calculate the value of group members. Then, the technique for order preference by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPSIS) method is employed to rank decision alternatives. Finally, a case analysis and comparison of the major explosions in Tianjin Port on August 12, 2015, demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method.

We tested the mediation effect of perceived social support, influencing the sense of power/control and in turn affecting their willingness to share opinions on their personal Social Networking Sites. We found that people are more willing to speak out on social media when their perceived social support enhances perceived sense of power/control through their opinion congruency with others' online comments. The findings suggest that individuals' perceived sense of power serves as an underlying mechanism that accounts for why people share their opinions in a social media setting. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed in the study. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Understanding how exposure and information affect public attitudes towards returning large carnivores in Europe is critical for human-carnivore coexistence, especially for developing efficient and de-escalating communication strategies. The ongoing recolonization of wolves (Canis lupus) in Germany provides a unique opportunity to test the role of different information sources and trust on people's attitudes towards wolves. We conducted a phone survey (n = 1250) and compared country-wide attitudes towards wolves with attitudes in a specific region where wolves initially recolonized and have been present since 2000. In particular, we investigate the relationship between information sources, trust and people's attitudes while accounting for factors like knowledge, exposure and socio-cultural determinants of respondents. We found significant differences in attitudes and knowledge about wolves as well as in the use and frequency of information sources between the two population samples. Higher knowledge, information from books and films, science-based information, and higher trust in information sources related positively with positive attitudes towards wolves. Comparatively, information from press or TV news was associated with more negative attitudes. Providing science-based information to the public and building trust in information is likely to be one measure, among others, to dampen extreme attitudes and improve people's appreciation of costs and benefits of human-carnivore coexistence. Management of conflictual situations emerging from large carnivore recolonization in Europe and beyond should consider incorporating assessments of people's use of and trust in information in addition to existing tools to pave new ways for constructive human-carnivore coexistence.

AB  - This study examined the press coverage and audience understanding of the costs and benefits of stem cell research/treatment in Hungary. A content analysis of five newspapers and a focus group study was conducted. The way participants talked about the costs and benefits in many aspects echoed the dominant framing of the issue in the press (medical benefits = main benefit, high expense of treatment = dominant negative aspect). Even though participants applied analogical reasoning to formulate some risks that were missing from the reporting on stem cells, many gaps of the media coverage were echoed in gaps in lay discussions.

AB  - This paper examines how exposure to messages about the cause of seasonal air pollution in Korea influences the Korean public's satisfaction with efforts to address the problem. It also assesses the impact of frames that accentuate the costs and benefits of the nation's coal usage on individuals' support for coal-based energy development. It draws from framing theory to develop hypotheses tested in two distinct survey experiments that recruited a representative sample of residents living in the Seoul Metropolitan area. We find that frames that highlight the need for immediate policy action, by blaming China, Korea or both nations, decreases satisfaction with existing national efforts. Moreover, frames that attribute blame exclusively to China decrease satisfaction with China's efforts to combat the problem. On the domestic front, we find that Koreans' views toward increased coal use are a function of exposure to a coal-costs or coal-benefits frame; however, when the frames appear simultaneously in competition, considerations about the economic benefits overpower concerns about the negative health effects. The results emphasize how frames can shift perceptions about the need for policy action as well as in securing public support or opposition toward a specific "polluting" energy source.

AB  - This study explored responses to Monk, a television series about a detective with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), from the perspective of parasocial relationships and the influence of presumed influence model. Series fans completed an online survey. A stronger parasocial relationship to Monk was associated with lower OCD stereotypes and less desired social distance from people with OCD. Perceived influence of Monk on respondents' own and others' attitudes toward OCD was related to behavioral and psychological outcomes, including willingness to seek and disclose mental health treatment and perceived self-esteem benefits. Different patterns were observed based on experience with mental illness and with OCD specifically.

AB  - Depuis la fin des annees 1980, le genre litteraire de la << femme musulmane opprimee >> connait un succes phenomenal dans le monde occidental. L'objectif de cet article est de faire la sociologie de sa genese a partir du cas francais, qui est surement le pays qui publient le plus de livres de ce genre. Il s'agit ainsi d'analyser les conditions de production et de diffusion de ces livres, en laissant de cote leur contenu textuel et sa reception par les lectrices. Dans un premier temps, l'enjeu est d'inscrire ce nouveau genre litterature dans l'histoire du champ de l'edition francaise marque par un phenomene de concentration mediatique, de financiarisation et de changement du metier d'editeur. Le << temoignage >> devient ainsi un genre litteraire particulierement rentable, comme l'illustre le cas du club de lecture France Loisirs, veritable << machine >> a best-sellers a destination d'un public essentiellement feminin. Dans un second temps, il s'agit d'etudier le contenu des catalogues de France Loisirs depuis 1976 en se focalisant sur le type de temoignages promus. Cette analyse revele le passage, dans les annees 1980, de la figure du << repenti communiste >> a celle de la << repentie musulmane >>. Dans un dernier temps, l'attention se porte sur Jamais sans ma fille de Betty Mahmoody, veritable modele a suivre pour de nombreuses maisons d'edition francaises. Il se met alors en place un veritable systeme de decouverte de nouvelles histoires de femmes musulmanes, de traduction/reecriture de la part de prete-plume (ghostwriters) experimentes, et de campagne publicitaire massive dans la presse, la radio et la television, qui font de ce genre litteraire un produit de consommation. Ce genre litteraire est revelateur de l'imbrication de la logique de marche et du processus de racialisation des musulmans, debouchant sur la diffusion massive de representations islamophobes.

AB  - Over the last 25 years, the appraisal of psychotropic drugs within the scientific community and their representation in the media has changed considerably. The initial optimism in the wake of the introduction of second-generation drugs has increasingly made room for a more critical evaluation of alleged advantages of these drugs. The question arises as to what extent this is reflected in similar changes in the public's attitudes towards psychiatric medication. Three representative population surveys on attitudes towards psychotropic medication were carried out in Germany in 1990 (N = 3075), 2001 (N = 2610) and 2011 (N = 1223), using the same sampling procedure, interview mode and instrument for assessing attitudes. In order to disentangle time-related effects, an age-period-cohort analysis was performed. Over the time period of 21 years, the German public's evaluation of psychotropic medication has become markedly more favourable. This change was mostly due to a period effect, i.e. concurrent influences of the social environment people are exposed to. Changes were much more pronounced in the 1990s, while over the following decade only a small, although statistically significant, increase in the favourable appraisal of medication was found. Age and birth cohort had only a minor effect on public attitudes. Our findings suggest that changes in the evaluation of the effects of psychotropic drugs within the psychiatric community and their representation in the media also affect public opinion. Given the ongoing debate about side effects and efficacy of psychiatric medication, future changes of public opinion can be expected.

AB  - Background: Groups and individuals that seek to negatively influence public opinion about the safety and value of vaccination are active in online and social media and may influence decision making within some communities.
   Objective: We sought to measure whether exposure to negative opinions about human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines in Twitter communities is associated with the subsequent expression of negative opinions by explicitly measuring potential information exposure over the social structure of Twitter communities.
   Methods: We hypothesized that prior exposure to opinions rejecting the safety or value of HPV vaccines would be associated with an increased risk of posting similar opinions and tested this hypothesis by analyzing temporal sequences of messages posted on Twitter (tweets). The study design was a retrospective analysis of tweets related to HPV vaccines and the social connections between users. Between October 2013 and April 2014, we collected 83,551 English-language tweets that included terms related to HPV vaccines and the 957,865 social connections among 30,621 users posting or reposting the tweets. Tweets were classified as expressing negative or neutral/positive opinions using a machine learning classifier previously trained on a manually labeled sample.
   Results: During the 6-month period, 25.13% (20,994/83,551) of tweets were classified as negative; among the 30,621 users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, 9046 (29.54%) were exposed to a majority of negative tweets. The likelihood of a user posting a negative tweet after exposure to a majority of negative opinions was 37.78% (2780/7361) compared to 10.92% (1234/11,296) for users who were exposed to a majority of positive and neutral tweets corresponding to a relative risk of 3.46 (95% CI 3.25-3.67, P<.001).
   Conclusions: The heterogeneous community structure on Twitter appears to skew the information to which users are exposed in relation to HPV vaccines. We found that among users that tweeted about HPV vaccines, those who were more often exposed to negative opinions were more likely to subsequently post negative opinions. Although this research may be useful for identifying individuals and groups currently at risk of disproportionate exposure to misinformation about HPV vaccines, there is a clear need for studies capable of determining the factors that affect the formation and adoption of beliefs about public health interventions.

AB  - This article develops an attention-based model of party mandates and policy agendas, where parties and governments are faced with an abundance of issues and must divide their scarce attention across them. In government, parties must balance their desire to deliver on their electoral mandate (i.e. the promissory agenda') with a need to continuously adapt their policy priorities in response to changes in public concerns and to deal with unexpected events and the emergence of new problems (i.e. the anticipatory agenda'). Parties elected to office also have incentives to respond to issues prioritized by the platforms of their rivals. To test this theory, time series cross-sectional models are used to investigate how the policy content of the legislative program of British government responds to governing and opposition party platforms, the executive agenda, issue priorities of the public and mass media.

AB  - The article explains the sociological theory of immigration risks. Despite the fact that domestic sociology has been recently attracting more attention to the risk theory, risks of migration processes have not yet been properly considered. According to the authors, such a theory must consider social risks for all participants of the migration process: host countries, countries of origin and immigrants. The typological model of immigration risks is based on the theory of integration by H. Esser and F. Heckmann. The model describes how various risks are manifested at the micro, meso and macro level of social reality taking into account the four dimensions of social integration: cultural, structural, interactional and identification. Based on the theoretical model the authors identify several groups of risks for the host population: risks based on local and migrant population interaction at the micro level and perceived risks which can be formed by the media under the influence of certain political forces at the macro level. These risk groups were examined using a telephone survey of public opinion of Saint Petersburg residents (N = 1017). The study shows the importance of a cultural distance between the host community and the migrants manifested in increased attention to the standards and values of the host population, whereas risks associated with the labor market and violent behavior remain at the background of public attention. The authors also note a high level of social risk for the part of the host community involved in daily interaction with migrants. Members of community are scared of being involved in the migration process and try to shield themselves from it - they "ignore" the presence of migrants in their everyday life, "do not get involved" in their work and life focusing only on very general view of events which they are actually part of. According to the authors, analysis of social risks of international immigration should be one of the leading areas in sociology of risk and sociology of migration; moreover, this issue may become an independent area of risk assessment and migration theories.

AB  - The belief gap hypothesis focuses on why individuals differ in beliefs about the causes and consequences of issues despite expert consensus. Offering ideological rationalization and media use as an explanation for diverting beliefs, it, so far, has focused on ideological priors that describe traditional socio-economic cleavages-even if scientific and environmental issues go beyond monetary questions. In this study, we aim to counter this shortcoming by introducing a socio-cultural dimension of ideology to research on the belief gap hypothesis. Comparing two issues of man-made threats-climate change and antimicrobial resistance-and emphasizing more strongly the role of media use for belief gaps, we find that a socio-cultural dimension of ideology serves as a better predictor for diverting beliefs about climate change but not for antimicrobial resistance. In contrast to left-leaning media, using right-leaning media outlets widens climate change belief gaps.

AB  - This study expands the consequences of agenda-setting theory beyond political attitudes, arguing its significance as a mediator between media use and political participation. The results suggest that citizens learn from the media about the efficacy and integrity of political institutions, and their performance on key issues. Consequently, the information acquired through news media becomes an important factor for trust formation and participation in different forms of political actions, which are not limited to electoral activities. The implications of these results for democracy building are discussed.

AB  - Exposure to hate material is related to a host of negative outcomes. Young people might be especially vulnerable to the deleterious effects of such exposure. With that in mind, this article examines factors associated with the frequency that youth and young adults, ages 15 to 24, see material online that expresses negative views toward a social group. We use an online survey of individuals recruited from a demographically balanced sample of Americans for this project. Our analysis controls for variables that approximate online routines, social, political, and economic grievances, and sociodemographic traits. Findings show that spending more time online, using particular social media sites, interacting with close friends online, and espousing political views online all correlate with increased exposure to online hate. Harboring political grievances is likewise associated with seeing hate material online frequently. Finally, Whites are more likely than other race/ethnic groups to be exposed to online hate frequently.

AB  - This article focuses on online assessments of a controversial British television advertisement. Across blogs, websites and forums, a range of stances emerged in debates about its possible 'sexism', 'humour', 'misogyny', or 'realism'. The analytic interest here is in the ways that assessors invoked 'f-' categories (e.g. 'feminism', 'feminist') as part of their assessments: across the data corpus, people would locate themselves or others in relation to 'feminism', where 'feminism' was variously old-fashioned, modern, prejudiced, vital, dogmatic, complex and/or many other things besides. To account for this variability, the article pursues an ethnomethodologically oriented policy of treating categories not as vectors for in-the-head social attitudes, but as resources for on-the-screen social actions. Categories thus became analysable not for what they revealed about their authors' real thoughts vis-a-vis feminism, but for how they functioned as crucial components of recipient-designed online assessments. Studying examples of positive and negative assessments, the paper subsequently shows that and how users claimed or denied their own (or some others') allegiance to 'f-' categories as a method for strengthening their own (or undermining others') assessments. A concluding discussion considers the wider applications of a categorial approach to feminism in a world of increasingly mediated interaction.

AB  - Understanding how the news media portray controversial natural resource issues is an important area of environmental policy research due to the media's ability to influence public opinion and policymaking. Automated media coding is becoming increasingly used as an alternative or supplement to the human coding of these portrayals. However, the comparability of human versus automated coding of the news media has not been well documented. This research note provides a comparison of an automated method to human coding of newspaper articles on the controversial issue of hydraulic fracturing. It describes the methods and results of coding 1,037 articles from four newspapers in New York and Pennsylvania. This research note compares the automated method to a human coding method and describes the proportion of coverage of New York and Pennsylvania newspapers on economic, environmental, and social topics related to hydraulic fracturing.

AB  - There is a negative approach and perception of the black South African accent in Drama Departments of higher education institutions in South Africa. The purpose was to discover the experiences of being an actor-in-training at a Drama Department at the University of Cape Town (UCT) and The South African School of Motion Picture Medium and Live Performance (AFDA). The research method was a qualitative design, and the sampling method was purposive. The inclusion criteria considered participants who could speak at least one South African language other than English. In other words, the researcher selected black South African natives from the Nguni language groups (isiZulu, isiXhosa, Siswati, isiNdebele) and Bantu language groups (Sesotho, Northern Sotho or Sepedi, Setswana). The exclusion criteria considered anyone registered at UCT or AFDA or already graduated with a degree certificate from those institutions. The researcher analysed the data using the Tesch analysis method. The study has communicated the effects of a voice-training syllabus that ignores authentic black South African vocal abilities. The participants' experiences have shown a lack of interest in honing and encouraging black South African accents in the voice-training syllabus at Drama Departments in South African universities. It was concluded that there is more emphasis and attention given to British and American accents in the voice-training syllabus in South African universities and that black actors-in-training are encouraged to perform in these accents. The participants expressed that they do not feel prepared to perform characters with black South African accents because of this training.

AB  - Achieving the goal of carbon neutrality and carbon peak as scheduled puts forward new demands for the green transition of low-carbon lifestyle in Chinese society. In-depth practice of green consumption (GC) behavior can effectively promote the supply-side and consumption-side emission reduction work, but the phenomenon of "high awareness, low practice" is widespread in GC. The causes of consumers' low practice of GC need to be analyzed from the perspective of time and space from the actual media data. Furthermore, this process assists policymakers and stakeholders to understand the general attitude of the public towards GC, clarifying the propagation path of public emotions and the source of negative emotions. Based on the data from Sina Weibo, this paper applied text mining, a hybrid model of convolu-tional neural network and long and short-term memory neural network to analyze the public's attention, sentiment tendency and hot topics on GC. The results show that the vast majority of the Chinese public has a positive attitude toward GC; women and economically developed regions are more concerned about GC; the drivers of positive public sentiment toward GC include environmental awareness education, air pollution prevention and control, and online shopping; high green product prices, excessive time costs, chaotic sharing economy and one-size-fits-all solutions lead to negative public sentiment toward GC. By providing public sentiment analysis of GC, this research would assist decision-makers to understand the dissemination mechanism of public will in social media and clarify targeted solutions, which is of great significance for policy formulation and improvement.(c) 2021 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - In this article we examine in real time the political selective exposure process involved when the public confronted the walrus haul out of October 2014, a news event attributed by some climate change researchers to the effects of the climate change-driven reduction of Arctic sea ice. Analyzing data assessing the amount of major TV and cable news network coverage of the haul out, and evaluating public opinion data collected from a rolling cross-sectional survey of US adults take at the time, we show that coverage of this event was not equitably distributed across news media news sources, that exposure to news source is related to the respondents' ideological dispositions, and that exposure to coverage of the walrus haul out is related to ideology, the selectivity of political news habits, and climate change knowledge. We conclude with a discussion of the apparent inevitability of selective exposure to media coverage of climate change-related events and the implications for effective climate change communication.

AB  - Politweeting is becoming increasingly popular globally. It offers benefits to politicians and to citizens, especially during election periods. Twitter users in Africa are five times more likely to use the platform to voice their political views than those in the US and UK. Yet, few studies from African countries provide insight into such use. This paper attempts to provide insight into the use of the African National Congress (ANC) Twitter account by citizens and politicians in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. The Adaptive Structuration Theory is relevant to the study and netnography was applied to the study. Findings show that the platform was mostly used by citizens rather than the political party and its politicians. Citizens mostly engaged in political commentary amongst each other about party activities and officials. The political organisation mostly used it for image management for the party and its officials. If harnessed through planned design and implementation of digital communication strategies, social media has the potential to be used as effectively for mass communication, yet simultaneously enable interpersonal persuasion between participants, especially during times of elections.

AB  - Many European countries have seen a growth of populism in recent years. Extant research shows that populist parties are increasingly successful, and that populist messages appear more frequently in the media. This raises the question to what extent populist messages affect public opinion. The aim of this study is to assess whether populist messages fuel political cynicism by arguing that an arrogant, selfish and complacent political elite does not listen to what ordinary people find important. Moreover, it assesses whether populist messages affect only those already favourably predisposed towards populist parties, or whether it affects citizens across the board. The results of a survey experiment, conducted in the Netherlands, suggests that individuals who are exposed to populist messages are indeed more cynical afterwards than individuals who are exposed to a very similar, but more 'neutrally formulated' message. However, the effects seem to be restricted to supporters of populist parties.

AB  - This paper describes selected outcomes of media monitoring for anti-minority hate speech in the Czech Republic. In keeping with the agenda of critical discourse analysis, we aim to integrate historical, linguistic and cultural specificities with their linguistic manifestations in news articles about minorities, and here we present findings from a long-term study devoted to tracking xenophobia against two of the main minority groups. The AntiMetrics project, of which the work described here is one part, is designed to detect signs of anti-minority rhetoric in a society, with a view to taking steps to prevent such indicators from developing into more embedded prejudice and ultimately inter-group violence. The paper aims to provide a snapshot of what is a broad, long-term interdisciplinary project. Using a critical discourse toolkit, we analyse a sample news story about the Roma community, and identify a number of discursive and linguistic features that indicate the entrenchment of "new racism" in media at some levels. The toolkit also seeks to go beyond lexical signs to identify more implicit rhetorical devices, such as framing and (de-)contextualization of news events, and to quantify lack of balance in the selection of witnesses and other primary definers. Our ongoing content survey indicates the embedding of linguistic patterns that raise concern about leakage of far right discourse via media into everyday communication.

AB  - Cultivation research suggests that media use, particularly TV, is associated with a wide range of politically relevant views and attitudes, including perceptions of the world as a mean and dangerous place, authoritarianism, and perceived meritocracy. However, little attempt has been made to understand how these effects relate to one another and to broader models of political psychology. We present a new Cultivation-Political Psychology Interface Model, which uses Duckitt's Dual Process Model (2001) of political psychology as a lens to understand cultivation research. Many seemingly distinct cultivation effects related to political attitudes can thus be reduced to two overall dimensions: dangerous and competitive worldviews. We identify evidence gaps, particularly in terms of competitive-worldview effects and related political attitudes. Our model generates a landscape of attitudes and beliefs, whereby some attitudes are hypothesized to be more upstream than others, leading to testable hypotheses for future research.

AB  - This paper simulates the effect of the strategies implemented by politicians after the terrorists attacks in Madrid on 11 March 2004 on the ideological distance between voters and political parties. The attacks took place three days before the elections and changed the campaign's agenda, which centered around the issue of who was responsible for the attack: ETA or Al Qaeda. It also altered the agenda of the mass media, which focused its informative activity on broadcasting news related to this issue. We did an exhaustive selection process of all the news broadcast on television, radio, and newspapers that made reference to the authorship of the attack. Using these messages we developed an agent-based model for explaining how the political strategies implemented by political parties influenced the ideological distance. The proposed model is based on the ideological proximity model by Downs (1957). After calibrating and validating the model with real data, we simulated the effect of three political strategies from the theory of terror management on the ideological distance between voters and political parties: the rally around the flag, the opinion leadership, and the priming of public opinion and media coverage. The results show that these strategies have a significant and stable impact on the ideological distance. In particular, the rally around the flag can have a lasting effect, capable of changing the ideological distance in the short term after a terrorist attack.

AB  - The call for more males to work with children in their formative years remains prevalent in education discourse across the globe. Assertions that these men will positively address boys' poor behaviour and underachievement, as well as serving as father figures and role models for boys, continue to fuel international policy making and shape media reporting and public opinion. This paper interrogates findings from original research which set out to explore the perceptions of white male primary school educators in England (both teaching and training) in relation to the term 'role model'. The results, drawn from a rigorous analysis of in-depth focus group interviews, highlight intriguing similarities and differences in professional thinking and suggest the need for a re-imaging of the term. The research has large-scale implications in terms of suggesting important revisions to 'more-men' policy making, for work-based professional training and development, and in informing societal discourse.

AB  - This study examines newspaper coverage of online videos in Hong Kong. Drawing upon the extant literature on media usages of online user-generated content, newspaper coverage of online videos is expected to exhibit signs of professional incorporation and content standardization over time. Findings from content and textual analyses show that Hong Kong newspapers seldom based their judgment of the newsworthiness of online videos solely on the videos' online currency. Rather, newspapers used the reporting of online videos to meet a variety of existing professional and/or organizational needs, such as filling news space, reporting on newsworthy events, performing as a watchdog, and representing public opinion. Furthermore, the contents of the reported videos and the sourcing patterns in the news coverage of different newspapers showed signs of standardization over time. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of how mainstream media coverage of online videos could shape the social and cultural significance of new media in a society.

AB  - Habermas's amendments to his original public sphere thesis have been recognized by a number of media scholars in recent years. His original thesis of a decline or refeudalization of the public sphere where politics is played out in front of the public has been modified, under the influence of Bernhard Peters' work, to incorporate the possibility of action from the periphery of the public sphere influencing, if not exclusively determining, decisions made at the administrative core via sluice-gates. There has been limited work, however, on exploring the operation of the sluices in greater detail, and particularly on the role of the mass media in acting as a communication channel between peripheral publics and core elites. The purpose of this article is to do so via a case study of the mass media public debate in the UK about the existence and extent of the national DNA database as it is a prima facie candidate for observing the operation of the sluice-gates.

AB  - The vast literature on the impact of democratic political institutions on foreign policy behavior has yielded some of the most important developments in our understanding of violence and war over the past thirty years. The Journal of Conflict Resolution has played a prominent role in this growth and development. Critics of the democratic peace have dismissed this literature as a correlation in search of an explanation. However, I argue that the democratic peace literature and its various descendants represent a surprisingly productive example of an empirically focused and puzzle-oriented research program that has produced cumulative scientific knowledge regarding our understanding of international politics. This sustained investigation of democracy and foreign policy has yielded an increasingly robust and sophisticated model of democratic constraint that is the consequence of a progressive research program that compares favorably to earlier research programs that emphasized clashing paradigms of international politics.

AB  - In the past years the Netherlands have witnessed turbulent debates on immigration and integration, characterized by high levels of negativity and containing a variety of different viewpoints, i.e., frames, of the issue. We use a 4 x 2 between subjects experiment to investigate, which responses four salient immigration frames elicit among Dutch citizens. The results show that, whereas the willingness to support collective action is affected by the valence of the story, attitudes towards immigrants and intercultural behavioural intentions are affected by the frame of the story: the multicultural frame exerts positive, and the victimization frame exerts negative effects, regardless of the valence of the story.

AB  - 1 June 2018 marked a historic moment in Spanish politics, when the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (Partido Socialista Obrero Espanol, PSOE) announced a cabinet with the largest proportion of female ministers in the world. This announcement received extensive coverage in the traditional media. The objective of this research was to measure whether the news had an equivalent impact on Twitter users. To this end, we analyzed the reaction to the appointments based on the popularity of the hashtags #GobiernoSanchez ("Sanchez Government"), #GobiernoFeminista ("Feminist Government") and #ConsejoMinistras ("Council of Female Ministers"). The most significant findings are that women had even less visibility than they were given in traditional media because of what is not retweeted does not exist, and that the extreme polarization of political life and the media in the public sphere appears to extend to the digital environment of Twitter.

AB  - The prolific growth of social media in recent years has provided new forums which allow engagement in local town discussions; particularly via community Facebook groups. This study seeks to understand the role of community Facebook groups in a regional town in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia; particularly how they are used to portray youth, and their relevance to a grassroots youth justice reinvestment process. This research arose due to direct concern from a community working group. Seventeen semi-structured interviews, with 18 participants, were conducted with service providers in Katherine, NT. The data was then inductively thematically analyzed, resulting in six themes: staying informed in a regional context; vilifying youth and combating this; racism; impact on youth; tensions in positioning youth: right versus left; and adopting a strengths-based approach to youth. Community Facebook groups were noted as an important factor for staying informed in a remote context. As a key medium within the town, Facebook groups should be considered a source of community discussion and an appropriate avenue to influence community opinion. The racialization of community discussions about "problem youth" indicates a segregation issue in the town, which has been noted for many years. Community education and the promotion of the youth justice work currently being implemented in the town were considered key in changing mindsets and ultimately behaviors. Importantly, research and community development programs alike should consider the community Facebook group as a medium for positive social action.

AB  - Contexts of violent, intractable conflict such as those present in Israel, Nigeria, or Iraq represent times of severe crisis. Reducing the high indices of violence is very urgent, but the attempts of establishing peaceful arrangements in the short- or medium-term usually fail. Peace education, by contrast, is a long-term endeavor to resolve violent, intractable conflicts that aims at affecting moral stances that the conflicting parties take vis-a-vis each other. Unfortunately, however, peace education in times of severe crisis also faces many impediments. These impediments concern the agential, cultural, financial, and legal aspects of educative institutions within context of violent and intractable conflicts. Although these impediments strongly put into question the practice of peace education, this article shows that four reasons nevertheless strongly support this practice. These reasons refer to (1) humanity's natural goodness, (2) the symbolic importance of peace education, (3) the peace-promoting experiences facilitated through peace education, and (4) peace education's contribution to overcoming prejudices.

AB  - ObjectiveThe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak has threatened the state's governance and public safety. This study investigates whether and how public participation can affect central government policy response to this pandemic in the context of China. MethodsThis study constructs the theoretical framework based on theoretical analysis, and Social Network Analysis is used to analyze data on the public participation, New Media, and the central government response in this pandemic. ResultsFindings show that the Chinese central government does not always adopt top-down elitist governance strategies in risk management. The central government will also adopt the bottom-up governance strategy triggered by public participation. In this process, New Media acts as a catalyst. Specifically, when faced with a public emergency and needs a policy response from the central government, public participation firstly creates "participation" with the authority of the media, forms public opinion, and then the prompt policy response from the central government. ConclusionThis study confirms that the central government will refer to public participation to decide the policy response. It also shows that the theory of government response applies to both the local government and the central government.

AB  - Despite concerns about politicization and polarization in climate change news, previous work has not been able to offer evidence concerning long-term trends. Using computer-assisted content analyses of all climate change articles from major newspapers in the United States between 1985 and 2017, we find that media representations of climate change have become (a) increasingly politicized, whereby political actors are increasingly featured and scientific actors less so and (b) increasingly polarized, in that Democratic and Republican discourses are markedly different. These findings parallel trends in U.S. public opinion, pointing to these features of news coverage as polarizing influences on climate attitudes.

AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media's portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security's placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue.

AB  - Psychology has begun contributing to social theory by providing empirical measures of actually existing cosmopolitanism that complements more purely theoretical conceptions of the construct common in philosophy and sociology. Drawing from two waves of research on representative adult samples from 19 countries (N = 8740), metric invariance was found for the three factors of cosmopolitan orientation (COS): cultural openness (CO), global prosociality (GP), and respect for cultural diversity (RCD). In terms of etiology, among Wave 1 measures, the personality factor of agreeableness was the best predictor of the cosmopolitan factors of GP and RCD at Wave 2, whereas openness of personality best predicted CO. Wave 1 measures of education, political liberalism, and self-reported social status independently also explained a small amount of variance in COS. Functionally, COS was shown to predict less prejudice against immigrants, and more support for global civil society, even after controlling for social dominance orientation. All three COS factors independently predicted better attitudes towards immigrants. GP was the best predictor of trust in the United Nations, whereas RCD was the best predictor of support for environmental protection. The three-factor model of COS appears well-calibrated for assessing actually existing cosmopolitanism across cultures.

AB  - In this paper, I investigate the contribution of healthy living blogs to discourse about healthy eating, seeking to understand how blogs compare to mass-media magazine sources. This is done by comparatively analysing 459 healthy living blog posts and 141 health and fitness magazine articles. These were collected between 2011 and 2013 and provide rich data about what food content looks like in media designed for an audience of American women. I analyze how each source establishes the purpose of healthy eating and what foods are considered part of a healthy diet. While both sites are embedded in an overarching discourse of healthy eating, there are important contrasts between the frames used and ideologies they draw from. The magazines largely frame food as pathogenic, emphasizing food's connection to overweight/obesity, positioning particular foods (`scapegoat foods') as related to weight gain, and encouraging restriction of these foods. In contrast, the blogs predominantly frame food as "salutogenic" meaning that it is capable of promoting health and wellbeing. The blogs position food as a conduit for pleasure and an inclusive, varied diet is modelled. The pathogenic frame in the magazines reflects values inherent to hegemonic anti-obesity ideology while the salutogenic frame in blogs reflects a Health at Every Size (R) ideology. This paper argues that healthy living bloggers are able to broaden the range of mainstream healthy eating discourses, albeit without critiquing the moralization of health or thinness, because of their race, class and body privilege.

AB  - In conflicts of the information age success in the application of force depends less on the outcome of tactical operations on the battlefields but more on how the war's purpose, course and conduct is viewed by public opinion at home as well as within the theatre of operations. Therefore western allies in Iraq and Afghanistan are not only involved in a physical struggle but also in a struggle over perceptions, for no long-term engagement of troops is possible without support from home, nor can a counterinsurgency succeed without the support of the local population. While the ability to exert influence upon various relevant target groups - opponents, the local population and the home front - has always been crucially important during conflicts, with the more recent globalized media this has led to previously unknown potential opportunities to influence audiences. With the intermixing of target audiences and the successes achieved by terrorists in the field of communication, the importance of the ideological struggle has increased enormously. In this context the concept of strategic communication has become relevant, which refers to the consistency of strategy, activities, themes and messages, and the aim of obtaining legitimacy and support. The heart of a strategic communication strategy is formed by a strategic narrative, a compelling storyline which can explain events convincingly and from which inferences can be drawn. Through a case study about the effectiveness of the execution of strategic communication during the mission in Afghanistan, the author wishes to increase the understanding of the concept.

AB  - Objectives This study examines how characteristics of victims and types of incidents described in a media account of gun violence affect public support for three categories of policies that regulate firearms.
   Methods A randomized experiment with a sample of US public (N = 3410).
   Results Victim race, particularly if the victim was Black, was a strong predictor of less public support for all tested categories of firearm regulation. Respondents were less supportive of policies to address gun suicide or accidents and more supportive of policy solutions to mass shootings, compared to street-level gun homicides. Depictions of victim gender, mental illness, prior incarceration, and age were less salient to support across categories of firearm regulation, compared to race and type of incident.
   Conclusions Media coverage of gun violence has heterogenous effects on public support for firearm regulation and may influence support for policies aimed at reducing specific types of gun violence.

AB  - We analyse a market where newspaper publishers compete for advertising as well as for readership. Publishers first choose the political position of their newspaper then set cover prices and advertising tariffs. We build on the duopoly model of Gabszewicz et al. (2001, 2002) who show that advertising financing can lead to minimum political differentiation of the newspapers and hence a lack of plurality of political views or pensee unique. We extend their model to more than two newspapers and show that, contrary popular belief in competition policy, concern for such lack of plurality may diminish but does not disappear as the number of firms increases.

AB  - This paper analyzes representations of Simone Biles in media coverage of two major gymnastics events in 2019. It asks which, if any, gendered and racial stereotypes identified in previous scholarship about media coverage of Black and women athletes are also present in coverage of Biles. It also interrogates in what ways these stereotypes intersect as distinct forms of representation of Biles as a Black woman. Employing the tenets of feminist theory and Black feminist thought through an intersectional lens, a qualitative textual analysis of 34 articles revealed that both gendered and racial stereotypes were present in coverage of Biles. The most prominent stereotypes include feminized emotions, lack of mental fortitude, negative attitudes, and physicality. These intersecting representations underscore the persistence of these stereotypes in contemporary discourse. This paper contributes to, and advances, the literature on media representations of women athletes, Black athletes, and Black women athletes.

AB  - This article studies the asymmetric effects of credit and blame attributions in economic news on government evaluations. We rely on a dataset combining a manual content analysis of Dutch economic news (print, television, online; N = 5,630) with a three-wave panel survey (N = 3,240) that was fielded in 2015. Results show that people who are exposed to news in which the government is blamed for the economy tend to adopt this frame by assigning responsibility to the government for the economic crisis. In addition, exposure to blame attributions leads to more negative government evaluations. This effect is partly mediated through the attribution of crisis responsibility. Credit attributions in the news do not have any effect on public opinion.

AB  - Background Vaccination against COVID-19 has been available in Germany since December 2020. However, about 30% of the population report not wanting to be vaccinated. In order to increase the willingness of the population to get vaccinated, data on the acceptance of vaccination and its influencing factors are necessary. Little is known about why individuals refuse the COVID-19 vaccination. The aim of this study was to investigate the reasons leading to rejecting vaccination, based on posts from three social media sites. Methods The German-language versions of Instagram, Twitter and YouTube were searched regarding negative attitudes towards COVID-19 vaccination. Data was extracted until a saturation effect could be observed. The data included posts created from January 20, 2020 to May 2, 2021. This time frame roughly covers the period from the first reports of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 up to the general availability of vaccines against COVID-19 in Germany. We used an interpretive thematic approach to analyze the data and to inductively generate codes, subcategories and categories. Results Based on 333 posts written by 323 contributing users, we identified six main categories of reasons for refusing a COVID-19 vaccination: Low perceived benefit of vaccination, low perceived risk of contracting COVID-19, health concerns, lack of information, systemic mistrust and spiritual or religious reasons. The analysis reveals a lack of information among users and the spread of misinformation with regard to COVID-19 and vaccination. Users feel inadequately informed about vaccination or do not understand the information available. These information gaps may be related to information not being sufficiently sensitive to the needs of the target group. In addition to limited information for the general population, misinformation on the internet can also be an important reason for refusing vaccination. Conclusions The study emphasizes the relevance of providing trustworthy and quality-assured information on COVID-19 and COVID-19 vaccination to all population groups. In addition, vaccinations should be easily accessible in order to promote the population's willingness to be vaccinated.

KW  - fluidity and diversities
KW  - 'otherizing'
KW  - multiplicity of identities
AB  - Islamophobia has, of late, created a tendency to conflate all Muslims as belonging to a single nation of Islam that does not recognize and respect boundaries imposed by western geopolitics. This has been done by some to create and by others to generate a sense of exclusive unity that would separate all Muslims and make them into others within western societies. It is the contention of this paper that such calls both embody and ignore the diversities of Islam as understood and practised by its adherents. Furthermore by otherizing the entire community of Muslims in the West, the singular label of Islamism marginalizes and may even silence the vibrant contestations among Muslims about their faith and its teachings; these include questions posed by women who may be described as feminists. The attributes of Islamism, ascribed to the faith by public, the media and politicians in the West and adopted by some Muslims primarily as a politically unifying force, are very different from the fluidity and flexibility that has been a historic part of lived Islam. Many Muslims may well aspire to belong to the umma: people of Islam conceptualized as crossing ethnic, racial, geographical and political boundaries. But Muslims in general and Muslim women in particular do not wish to do so at the expense of being otherized and conforming to the negative stereotypes ascribed to them that mask their fluid identities and, in the case of white women, their close ties with their kinship networks. The multiplicity of Muslim's identities sits more easily within the permeable unbounded umma applicable to the global as well as the local without necessarily always privileging one or other identity.

AB  - A large body of evidence supports the effectiveness of larger health warnings on cigarette packages. However, there is limited research examining attitudes toward such warning labels, which has potential implications for implementation of larger warning labels. The purpose of the current study was to examine attitudes toward larger warning sizes on cigarette packages and examine variables associated with more favorable attitudes. In a nationally representative survey of U.S. adults (N = 5,014), participants were randomized to different warning size conditions, assessing attitude toward "a health warning that covered (25, 50, 75)% of a cigarette pack." SAS logistic regression survey procedures were used to account for the complex survey design and sampling weights. Across experimental groups, nearly three-quarters (72%) of adults had attitudes supportive of larger warning labels on cigarette packs. Among the full sample and smokers only (N = 1,511), most adults had favorable attitudes toward labels that covered 25% (78.2% and 75.2%, respectively), 50% (70% and 58.4%, respectively), and 75% (67.9% and 61%, respectively) of a cigarette pack. Young adults, females, racial/ethnic minorities, and non-smokers were more likely to have favorable attitudes toward larger warning sizes. Among smokers only, females and those with higher quit intentions held more favorable attitudes toward larger warning sizes. Widespread support exists for larger warning labels on cigarette packages among U.S. adults, including among smokers. Our findings support the implementation of larger health warnings on cigarette packs in the U.S. as required by the 2009 Tobacco Control Act.

AB  - This paper explores how citizen-users think and communicate about public opinion polling through an analysis of tweets published during and just after the 2010 UK General Election leaders' debate broadcast on Sky News on 22 April 2010, the second of three debates. For those who comment on events in real time through social media such as Twitter, a category we call the 'viewertariat', this event was notable for Sky News's immediate coverage of a YouGov poll that seemed discrepant. Indeed, within an hour of the end of the debate, various mainstream media published a number of polls apparently at odds with each other. Such discrepancies opened a space for lay theories to emerge about relationships between political parties, media, polling firms, and the wider public itself. Individuals were pushed to find explanations and quick to publish them in a public assembly of views. Analysis of these data illuminates not just what people think, but how they think about long-term concerns of scholars and practitioners of politics and political communication, such as credibility, trust and power, and how citizens manage expectations during events where the outcome is uncertain. Accounting for viewertariat behaviour develops recent research on mediatized politics in important ways. First, we find some viewertariat members performing a lay tutelage role, providing information and explanations about polling and elections to fellow citizens who express confusion. This indicates the continued importance of informed public discussion to some citizens. Second, we find a blurring of elite/non-elite interactions alongside persistent theories about elite conspiracies.

AB  - Theoretical discussions about the Chinese citizenship rights suggest four distinctive aspects: rural-urban inequality, state-granted rather than natural born, socioeconomic rights prior to political entitlement, and collectivism overriding individualism. From a longitudinal and comparative perspective, this study examines how the most authoritarian party newspaper - thePeople's Daily- has constructed the idea of citizenship rights and manifested the four characteristics between 1978 and 2012, covering the three administrations of Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. Through content analysis and discourse analysis, we find that the official construction of citizenship rights enduringly employs instrumentalism to maintain the Party's authority. Nevertheless, in each leadership, there exists a dominant political rhetoric that fundamentally shapes the construction and function of citizenship rights: rights were constructed upon the socialist ideology and legal system in Deng's administration; under Jiang, the strong diplomatic strategy prioritized national sovereignty over rights and reinforced rule by law; in Hu's era, socioeconomic rights were emphasized and good governance highlighted. Political goals, the development of legal system and the style of political leadership have contributed to the periodical changes of the construction of citizenship rights.

AB  - Purpose - Drawing upon the communicative ecology theory (CET), this study aims to identify the potential precursors of social media health information seeking intentions (ISI) and examine their effects on health information re-sharing behaviors and PHH during coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.
   Design/methodology/approach - The data is collected through an online survey conducted in two different universities situated in highly COVID-19-affected cities - Wuhan and Zhengzhou, China. The valid data consists of 230 useful responses from WeChat users and to analyze the final data set structural equation modeling (SEM) is used.
   Findings - The results indicate that perceived health information credibility (PIC), trust on the medium (TRM) and peer influence (PI) significantly affect health ISI which further affects health information re-sharing behaviors (IRB) and personal health-care habits (PHH). Besides, the results also identify that PI has a direct, positive and significant effect on health IRB via social media during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Research limitations/implications - This study investigates the health information intentional behavior precursors and their consequences via WeChat (taken as social media platform) during COVID-19 pandemic. Future studies may conduct research by examining online information behaviors on other social media platforms - Twitter, WhatsApp, Facebook, etc. - in health emergency situations.
   Practical implications - The health information producers and providers have to deal with communicative ecology sentiments elegantly in emergency situations such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. They need to do collective efforts by introducing new tools or social apps which deal with valuable, reliable and accurate health content and information generated by the pandemic experts and health professionals. In such a way, the social apps and tools (Information providers) will act as mediators between the health professionals (Information producers) and general social media users (information seekers). Such initiatives will ultimately bring forth positive effect on individuals' PHH as a whole within a network, community, environment or nations during a health emergency - COVID-19 pandemic.
   Originality/value - This research is one of the first studies to examine the potential precursors of social media health ISIs and their resultant effects on individual's health IRB and PHH during the COVID-19 pandemic. As currently it is noticed, an incredible upsurge of health information via social media has intense impacts on personal health-care research and practice, particularly during health emergency situations such as COVID-19 pandemic conditions.

AB  - The aim of this research is to make evaluation about sporting editors' attribute at daily newspapers to victory and defeat, success and failure at football matches. Two of 5 newspapers, which have a reputation all around Turkey and have more than 100.000 circulations were randomly selected. The two newspapers which have been selected for their articles of sporting editors to be analyzed are Hurriyet and Sabah. In this figurative research, the news published during 2010 January, February and March in Hurriyet and Sabah have been scanned. Total of 365 (196 from Hurriyet, 169 from Sabah) critique have been accumulated, analyzed and evaluated. During the research, sporting editors' assessments about victory and defeat, success and failure have been classified with statistical method. As a result of this classification, effects of match results on sporting editors' opinions and articles have been evaluated by the analysis. The findings, which have been acquired, show that sporting editors attribute victory of football teams to internal reasons and attribute defeats to external reasons. Furthermore, they are only interested in results. The educational discipline of sport-press employees is significant to generate a conscious public opinion. Studies and plans needs to be constituted in this direction.

AB  - The efforts of peace-building and reconciliation between historical enemies are faced with many structural and psychological obstacles. Scholars have identified mechanisms that can induce improvements in psychological aspects of intergroup relations, such as intergroup contact. However, establishing direct contact with everyone is impossible. Therefore, the mass media represents an important source through which groups learn about each other. Numerous studies have shown that stereotypical and often negative portrayals of specific social groups through the media produce or reinforce negative intergroup outcomes. In this research, the authors report results from an experimental study conducted in a post-conflict society of Bosnia and Herzegovina (N=119). It examined the effects of stereotypical and counter-stereotypical representations of former enemy groups (Bosniaks) through the media on intergroup behavior (reported by Bosnian Serbs). More specifically, in this research the authors explored the effects of representing out-group individuals as immoral (the stereotypical condition) and moral (the counter-stereotypical condition) on specific behavioral tendencies toward the historical enemy group. The results indicate that exposure to primarily moral information about the out-group target facilitated important positive intergroup outcomes. This study extends the literature and research on moral exemplars by demonstrating the effects on relevant intergroup outcomes whilst utilizing current (vs. historical) moral exemplar stories.

AB  - How do cultural norms, ideologies, and beliefs shape public opinion and media framing of race-based athletic activism? This paper uses media coverage of and commentary on the 1968 American 'revolt of the Black athlete' to explicate the deep cultural structures that help explain both support and opposition. The paper begins with a brief, schematic overview of the proposal for a Black Olympic boycott that was the centrepiece of 1968 organising and how it was reported by sports journalists and in the mainstream media. The second section identifies the reasons American reporters were, on the whole, so opposed to the proposed boycott: the inherent lack of support for the athletes' racial change agenda and the far-more-familiar arguments that sports were not the proper venue for activism. The third section argues that a whole constellation of cultural norms and beliefs-about sport culture, colour-blind visions of racial justice, and liberal democratic ideals about politics and social change-coalesced to make race-based sport protest appear both unnecessary and inappropriate. The conclusion summarises the implications for understanding both public reception of and media responses to contemporary, race-based athletic activism as well as for tracking institutional changes and cultural shifts unfolding in the Black Lives Matter era.

AB  - Current policies to manage ethnic minority unrest in Xinjiang are not working, and do not address the core root causes behind ethnic tensions. Drawing upon lessons learned from global approaches to improving inter-ethnic relations, and factoring in China's institutional behaviour and norms, this essay looks at policy responses that could be entertained by the state to improve the conditions of ethnic minorities in Xinjiang. It suggests that in the short-term (under a year) the state could be more responsible in using the big data it collects for targeted surveillance, in tandem with a community engagement approach. In the medium-term (one to three years), the state could employ practices to reduce ethnic prejudice by encouraging increased meaningful intergroup contact, and promoting a positive media portrayal of ethnic minorities. In the long-term (three years plus), improving the relative socioeconomic ethnic inequalities is paramount.

AB  - The past decade saw a changing political landscape in Southeast Asia. From a promising turn towards democracy, marked by episodes of backsliding and authoritarian tendencies, and recently threats of democratic regression and political decay in most parts of the region, have dominated current discourse. Central to these changes is the evolution of information and communications technology, and the ubiquity of social media platforms as sources of news and information, as well as shaping public opinion. The paper looks into three cases in Southeast Asia: online hate along ethnic lines in Myanmar; Duterte populism and broad forms of disinformation in the Philippines; and increasing fake news and online radical Islamism in Indonesia. Trends, common areas of concern, and possible patterns would be gleaned from the case studies; and from there, distil prospects for engagement and better approaches against the growing concern for disinformation in the region. The research recommends that a more concerted and inclusive regional approach would help turn the tide against an increasingly deceived public.

AB  - Socially mediated visibility refers to technical features of social media platforms and the strategic actions of individuals or groups to manage the content and associations visible on social media channels, as well as inferences and consequences resulting from that visibility. As a root affordance, the visibility of content and associations shared in mediated settings can vary, with users typically retaining only partial control over visibility. Understanding how social and technical factors affect visibility plays a critical role in managing one's online self-presentation. This qualitative study of young dissident Azerbaijanis (N = 29) considers the management strategies as well as the risks and benefits associated with increased visibility when sharing marginalized political views through social media. Socially mediated visibility helps dissidents advocate and connect with like-minded others, but also increases the likelihood that their dissent is visible to those who may disagree with it and can punish them for it. This study considers the effect of the visibility of dissent on peer relationships.

AB  - During 2015, New South Wales (N.S.W), Australia experienced an unprecedented spike in human-shark interactions. These interactions saw the escalation of public anxieties surrounding water safety and the implementation of the state's $16 m Shark Management Strategy. Of the 14 human-shark interactions that occurred in N.S.W, eight were recorded on the state's North Coast. The interactions ignited considerable public debate, which sought to explain the spike in interactions and how to best manage the risk of human-shark interaction. This controversy was documented by the media. This study takes its lead from McCagh et. al (2015) to examine the media's reporting of public and political response to human-shark interactions in N.S.W. Discourse analysis was used to investigate two newspaper's reportage of human-shark interactions on the North Coast. This paper outlines that the discourse used by the media examined was not fear-laden, sensationalized or emotive, which previous studies have emphasized. It highlights the importance of investigating local media as means of investigating public and political response to environmental issues. The W.A shark cull seems to be a turning point in public and political attitudes towards shark management. The N.S.W government did not offer lethal or seemingly knee-jerk policy, but insisted on the investigation of non-lethal, scientifically and conservationally focused management. The N.S.W government appeared to be successful in consulting the local community and delivering policy that reflects the values and interests of the North Coast public. Our research reflects Neff & Wynter's (2018a) suggestion that the 'save the sharks' movement has indeed arrived.

AB  - Purpose In recent times, several instances of anti-immigration-related hate crimes and religious bullying have been reported where South Asian expatriates have been victimized. The accompanying children of such expatriates may find such hostile perceptions very difficult to deal with due to their tender age and sensitive ego, which may also lead to the premature return of the expatriate. In this study, a qualitative investigation is conducted to understand the specific problems faced by South Asian expat kids with respect to religious stigma and anti-immigration sentiments. Design/methodology/approach A latent thematic analysis was adopted as the research method in this study. Responses were obtained from 27 South Asian adolescent expat kids through audiovisual interviews. Findings A total of three central themes were identified from the analysis: (1) coping against social stigma, (2) dealing with social isolation and (3) assimilating with host culture. The findings indicated that the expat kids from South Asia were mentally well prepared to cope with bullying related to the religious or political sentiment using several self-reflective orientations and through optimal use of technical resources. Research limitations/implications This study applies a qualitative exploratory design. Hence, a follow-up study backed by quantifiable data is needed to enhance generalizability of the findings. Practical implications Corporate practitioners may develop dedicated social media page for expat kids or an online community of such individuals as a support system. Originality/value The paper applies a critical lens on some deep-rooted sociopolitical issues which have not been addressed in extant literature on expat adjustment.

Imagining that the "magic circle" of a subcultural platform can insulate users from racism is deeply misguided. We examine this thesis through a mixed-methods approach combining an online survey assessing perceived experiences of racism online and willingness to communicate with people of different ethnicities, discourse analysis of crafters' online posts, and ethnographic interviews. As the e-commerce platform Etsy allowed "manufactured goods" to be sold in their marketplace as handmade, Western crafters channel their frustrations with a broken platform economy into racist sentiment against Chinese crafters. This study explores the implications of these Orientalist sentiments as a reinforcement of Western exceptionalism around originality and creativity, and it analyzes White fragility and the assumption of Whiteness within the crafting subculture.

TI  - "Outside Lobbying" over the Airwaves: A Randomized Field Experiment on Televised Issue Ads
T2  - AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW
LA  - English
AB  - We present the first field experiment on how organized interest groups' television ads affect issue opinions. We randomized 31,404 voters to three weeks of interest group ads about either immigration or transgender nondiscrimination. We then randomly assigned voters to receive ostensibly unrelated surveys either while the ads aired, one day after they stopped, or three days afterwards. Voters recalled the ads, but three ads had a minimal influence on public opinion, whereas a fourth's effects decayed within one day. However, voters remembered a fact from one ad. Our results suggest issue ads can affect public opinion but that not every ad persuades and that persuasive effects decay. Despite the vast sums spent on television ads, our results are the first field experiment on their persuasive power on issues, shedding light on the mechanisms underpinning-and limits on-both televised persuasion and interest group influence.

AB  - This article analyzes media representation of minority offenders, and argues that media practice associates a minority status with criminal propensity through a process of minority signification. The focal point of the analysis is newspaper reporting of the 2003 Fukuoka family murder in Japan, in which three students from China killed a Japanese family. Close examination of two major Japanese newspapers suggests that their reporting of the Fukuoka case connects crime and a minority group in two ways. First, the newspapers frequently utilize nationality and immigration status as descriptors of the Fukuoka case suspects, and thus encourage an intuitive mental connection between foreignness and crime. Furthermore, opinion pieces and editorial articles interpret the murder in the context of immigration policies and the financial hardship often experienced by international students, suggesting that the Fukuoka case is one manifestation of international student criminality. The article concludes that signification of nationality and immigration status in the media may help explain the disparity between the relatively minor presence of foreign national offenders in Japan's crime scene and their major presence in the Japanese crime discourse.

AB  - Terrorist attacks often fuel online hate and increase the expression of xenophobic and antiminority messages. Previous research has focused on the impact of terrorist attacks on prejudiced attitudes toward groups linked to the perpetrators as the cause of this increase. We argue that social norms can contain the expression of prejudice after the attacks. We report the results of a combination of a natural and a laboratory-in-the-field (lab-in-the-field) experiment in which we exploit data collected about the occurrence of two consecutive Islamist terrorist attacks in Germany, the Wurzburg and Ansbach attacks, in July 2016. The experiment compares the effect of the terrorist attacks in hate speech toward refugees in contexts where a descriptive norm against the use of hate speech is evidently in place to contexts in which the norm is ambiguous because participants observe antiminority comments. Hate toward refugees, but not toward other minority groups, increased as a result of the attacks only in the absence of a strong norm. These results imply that attitudinal changes due to terrorist attacks are more likely to be voiced if norms erode.

AB  - Recent theories of foreign aid assume that moral motives drive voters' preferences about foreign aid. However, little is known about how moral concerns interact with the widely accepted instrumental goals that aid serves. Moreover, what effects does this interplay have on preferences over policy actions? This article assesses these questions using a survey experiment in which respondents evaluate foreign aid policies toward nasty recipient regimes (those that violate human rights, rig elections, crack down on media, etc.). The results indicate that the public does have a strong aversion to providing aid to nasty recipient regimes, but that it also appreciates the instrumental benefits that aid helps acquire. Contrary to a mainstay assertion in the literature, the study finds that moral aversion can largely be reversed if the donor government engages more with the nasty country. These findings call into question the micro-foundations of recent theories of foreign aid, and produce several implications for the aid literature.

T2  - JOURNAL OF MODERN ITALIAN STUDIES

KW  - Political polarization
KW  - dramatization
KW  - media system
KW  - segmentation
AB  - This contribution is organized along two main interpretive lines. First: the Italian public sphere is very polarized because of well-established historical attitudes, a crowded media market and new technologies that push towards segmentation of the audience. The arrival of Berlusconi has only reinforced the already existing polarization that goes well beyond the borders of partisanship involving the content of news, the structure and professionalism of news outlets and also the recipients that divide themselves along the lines of political attitudes. The second characteristic feature of the Italian public sphere involves the tendency towards dramatization, which is also produced by the sudden commercialization of the entire mass media system that started in 1980. This article's thesis is supported by examples of dramatization and extreme political discourse. The consequences that derive from this situation are discussed in the conclusion.

AB  - This paper asks why the extreme real-world weather events of the summer of 1988 created a social scare in the USA while the comparable weather impacts of 2012 did not. It uses these two summers to exemplify the importance of the broader context surrounding the media. The key background factors are: the dominant issue culture in which the media function; grassroots environmental social movements; and both political and scientific claims-making on climate change. The paper seeks to show that these factors affected reporting opportunities related to the formation of reproducing stories and the (investigative) stance assumed by the media.

AB  - In response to the Trump trade war, China, the EU, and other countries enacted politically-targeted trade retaliation (PTTR) against swing states and Republican strongholds in the United States. We argue that PTTR increases public concerns about foreign election interference and assess the effects of such retaliation across partisan affiliations. We test our predictions using a national survey experiment in the United States fielded before the 2020 election. In contrast to findings about sanctions and foreign endorsements, we find strong evidence that PTTR increases fears of election interference among both Republicans and Democrats. Partisan double standards in reaction to PTTR were strongest for retaliation targeting swing states and smaller for retaliation targeting the President's base. Overall, the evidence shows that economic policies which are not primarily intended to influence elections may nevertheless come to be viewed by the public as foreign election interference.

AB  - The recent migration of refugees from Muslim majority countries to Central Europe has prompted an almost unprecedented dynamic in the British and German public sphere and political culture. However, there exists a lack of understanding how the "refugee crisis" and Islam are linked to each other in public discourse. This paper addresses this lacuna by seeking to answer the question how the current refugee situation has been interpreted with regards to Islam in British and German newspapers. A critical analysis allows to identify three major discursive patterns that contribute to the securitisation of the refugee situation. Moreover, the study reveals the construction of Muslim refugees as the culturally inferior "other" to an exclusive "European Christian Culture".

The two sides of this military conflict, Russia and Ukraine, are trying to shape public opinion in their own countries as well as abroad. Depending on the leaning of a media outlet, its audiences see very different pictures of this crisis. This study examined a year's worth of coverage dealing with the Eastern Ukraine military conflict in major Russian, Ukrainian, and American newscasts. The analysis revealed significant differences in the choice of on-camera sources, reporting of civilian and military fatalities, and framing of the different sides of this conflict in these media.

AB  - Hydraulic fracturing, often called fracking, is a drilling technique that accesses previously inaccessible oil/gas reserves. Although the process could aid U.S. energy independence, it is controversial and public opinion is divided. Guided by agenda-setting and framing, this study content analyses news coverage of fracking (N = 524) across cable networks (CNN, Fox News, MSNBC). Results show cable news lacks substance and relies on thematic framing. While all networks failed to provide factual information, issue-related topics discussed and sources used vary ideologically. Theoretical and practical implications, which include the potential for priming audiences and influencing future behaviors and judgments, are discussed.

AB  - Online news sharing has become an important process through which contemporary citizens experience news.News sharing is not only a behavioral outcome of news consumption but also an essential form of political engagement that reshapes the online information environment. This study offers empirical evidence regarding important article perceptions that drive online news sharing. Specifically, we examine how issue frame perceptions shape user-directed dissemination of news information. Using an online survey that exposes respondents to multiple news articles on a given public issue, this study found that perceptions of issue frame believability, bias, importance and influence significantly affected audience intention to share a news article. However, perceiving an issue frame to be believable is not sufficient for readers to forward that article. Moreover, these frame perceptions are formed through the lens of one's political ideology. The relationship between issue frame perceptions and the likelihood of sharing is more pronounced for value-based frames and among partisans. Implications for online political participation and news exposure are discussed.

AB  - The corrective action hypothesis predicts that people will take political action in response to media content they perceive to be biased against them, and evidence has accumulated in favor of it. However, research has not yet investigated the hypothesis in comparative context. This study fills that gap in the literature, relying on the Comparative National Election Project (N = 23,527), and analyzing data from 17 countries. Results show evidence of an overall positive relationship between perceived media bias and political action, and they also show evidence that this relationship varies in strength between countries. Moreover, press freedom partially explains this variation. Results are discussed in light of the theory of corrective action and recent trends in political participation worldwide.

AB  - A substantial body of research suggests that some news media outlets depict certain social groups stereotypically. We hypothesize that long-term exposure to such news influences viewers' automatically activated gut feelings (i.e., implicit attitudes) toward this social group, which, in turn, may be used as a basis for overtly expressed evaluations (i.e., explicit attitudes). This prediction was investigated in three empirical studies in two cultural contexts. In the United States and Austria, results suggest that regular exposure to stereotypical news coverage creates negative implicit attitudes, which, in turn, alter explicit attitudes. A better understanding of the news stereotype effects will allow us to develop strategies to reduce prejudice, which may contribute to the improvement of a humane and open society.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic put clinical research in the media spotlight globally. This article proposes a first measure of familiarity with and attitude toward clinical research in France. Drawing from the "Health Literacy Survey 2019" (HLS19) conducted online between 27 May and 5 June 2020 on a sample of the French adult population (N = 1003), we show that a significant proportion of the French population claimed some familiarity with clinical trials (64.8%) and had positive attitudes (72%) toward them. One of the important findings of this study is that positive attitudes toward clinical research exist side by side with a strong distancing from the pharmaceutical industry. While respondents acknowledged that the pharmaceutical industry plays an important role in clinical research (68.3%), only one-quarter indicated that they trust the industry (25.7%). Positive attitudes toward clinical trials were associated with familiarity with clinical trials (Odds Ratio, OR 2.97 [1.90-4.63]), financial difficulties (OR 0.63 [0.46-0.85]), as well as mistrust of doctors (0.48 [0.27-0.85]) and of scientists (OR 0.62 [0.38-0.99]). Although the French media provided a great deal of information on how clinical research works during the first months of the pandemic, there remains profound mistrust of the pharmaceutical industry in France. This suspicion can undermine crisis management, especially in the areas of vaccine development and preparation for future pandemics.

AB  - In 2014, the fully electric racing series Formula E, aimed at promoting clean energy and sustainability, was launched in Beijing (China), at that time the world's most polluted city. Despite Formula E's sustainability credentials, the question remains whether one of its core values, i.e. environmental sustainability (ES), is picked up on by sports television broadcasters. Using a qualitative framing analysis, I identified, compared and contrasted frames, and the significance of ES herein, in three UK broadcasts of Formula E's first three season opening races. Results indicate that, although the narrative of ES was introduced minimally during the inaugural broadcast, ES was neglected as a frame during consecutive broadcasts. Results suggest that this is because sports broadcasters prefer audiences to align Formula E according to more traditional values and ideas associated with broadcasting of motor sport, and, as such, to avoid affecting, i.e. reducing, audience confidence and ratings.

AB  - Online news and social media are transforming the process of news production and reading. While research has shown that news media play an important role in providing information to the public in democratic societies, research investigating the impact of sharing news online on the process of public opinion formation is in a nascent stage. This study examines the impact of viewing and sharing online news on two dimensions of political knowledge: factual knowledge and structural knowledge. Results from survey data collected over 3-waves during the 2012 US Presidential Election from an online panel of 403 US adult Internet users show that reading online news is positively related to factual political knowledge. Sharing online news, in contrast, is related to structural knowledge. We discuss these findings and their implications for future research investigating the role of online news.

AB  - With the development of Internet technology, social media platforms have become an indispensable part of people's lives, and social media have been integrated into people's life, study, and work. On various forums, such as Taobao and Weibo, a large number of people's footprints are left all the time. It is these chats, comments, and other remarks with people's emotional evaluations that make up part of public opinion. Analysis of this network public opinion is conducive to maintaining the peaceful development of society. Therefore, sentiment analysis has become a hot research field and has made great strides as one of the hot topics in the field of natural language processing. Currently, the BERT model and its variants have achieved excellent results in the field of NLP. However, these models cannot be widely used due to huge demands on computing resources. Therefore, this paper proposes a model based on the transformer mechanism, which mainly includes two parts: knowledge distillation and text augmentation. The former is mainly used to reduce the number of parameters of the model, reducing the computational cost and training time of the model, and the latter is mainly used to expand the task text so that the model can achieve excellent results in the few-sample sentiment analysis task. Experiments show that our model achieves competitive results.

AB  - Consumers have described retargeted ads as "creepy," possibly because these ads cue consumers that marketers are collecting personal data. Participants (N = 280) were either exposed to an ad that was targeted to past online behaviors or a general product ad. Behavioral targeting had a positive direct effect on purchase intent, but it also set off a negative indirect effect. Those exposed to behavioral targeting experienced increased perceived marketing surveillance, which led to increased threat, increased psychological reactance, negative attitudes toward the ad, and negative purchase intention. The indirect cost of perceived marketing surveillance on purchase intent was 4.5 percent.

AB  - American politics scholars disagree on the extent to which voters use policy information to evaluate politicians versus relying on partisan cues to evaluate policies. We demonstrate the coexistence of both of these perspectives, by studying the degree to which objective facts (measured with local COVID-19 cases) and partisan cues (measured with President Trump's tweets about the virus) influence differences in the social distancing behaviors in Democrat and Republican counties in 2020. We find that both factors play an important role in social distancing but that the relative importance between cues and facts favors the latter. Furthermore, the importance of these signals declines over time, suggesting a crucial but underappreciated dynamic of how partisan positions evolve in a Bayesian framework.

AB  - This study integrates network and content analyses to examine exposure to cross-ideological political views on Twitter. We mapped the Twitter networks of 10 controversial political topics, discovered clusters subgroups of highly self-connected users and coded messages and links in them for political orientation. We found that Twitter users are unlikely to be exposed to cross-ideological content from the clusters of users they followed, as these were usually politically homogeneous. Links pointed at grassroots web pages (e.g.: blogs) more frequently than traditional media websites. Liberal messages, however, were more likely to link to traditional media. Last, we found that more specific topics of controversy had both conservative and liberal clusters, while in broader topics, dominant clusters reflected conservative sentiment.

AB  - Background and Objectives: This research aimed at investigating the psychological impact of national quarantine in Italy, and the psychosocial factors that are may influence this impact. Methods: A convenience sample of 1569 people living in Italy responded to an online survey using virtual snowball sampling. The questionnaire included measures of mental health symptoms, well-being, worry about the epidemic of COVID-19, likelihood of infection, coping efficacy, trust in the institutional response to the epidemic of COVID-19, financial loss, perceived house size, and media exposure to COVID-19 outbreak. Results: Gender (women), lower age, occupational status (employed), lower media exposure, higher worry, lower coping efficacy, lower trust in institutions, and negative attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted mental health symptoms. In addition, results showed that gender (men), higher age, socioeconomic status, occupational status (unemployed), higher coping efficacy and trust in institutions, and positive attitudes toward quarantine measures predicted well-being. The estimated prevalence of common mental disorders was 31.7% among men and 52.3% among women. The scores on well-being were significantly lower in the current study than in a previous validation study. Conclusion: The results of the study provided both theory and practical implications in understanding mental health and its psychosocial predictors during national quarantine.

AB  - Introduction:Depictions of infant feeding practices in the media influence public attitudes toward breastfeeding and breastfeeding behaviors. Understanding how breastfeeding is represented in the media can provide insights into breastfeeding experiences and outcomes. This study describes trends in breastfeeding portrayals in the United States newsprint media between 2007 and 2016. Methods:We conducted a retrospective content analysis of 452 newspaper articles identified from the Nexis Uni database. Articles were coded for tone toward breastfeeding (supporting, neutral, or opposing), message frame, and region (Midwest, South, West, Northeast). We frequency weighted articles by publication circulation to account for differences in readership volume. Results:Findings indicate that breastfeeding has been positively portrayed and increasingly discussed. Among the four regions, the South had the most supportive tones, while the Midwest had the most opposing tones. The topics of Health Benefits and Breastfeeding Support and Resources received the most coverage. Positive portrayals surrounding Workplace/University Issues are increasing, while negative portrayals surrounding Indecent Exposure are decreasing. Conclusion:Positive portrayals of breastfeeding in newspapers may signify increased support for breastfeeding as a normal practice. Future research is needed to better understand the direct and indirect impact of newsprint messages on breastfeeding in the United States.

AB  - Objectives. What accounts for the variation in the status of gay rights across countries? We consider the effects of media freedom and Internet access and hypothesize that it is the combination of the two that matters for promoting gay rights. Methods. Using cross-national time-series data drawn from a variety of sources, we test our hypotheses using a measure of lesbian, gay, and bisexual legal equality. Results. Our results indicate that the effects of media freedom and Internet access on gay rights are each conditional on the other. It is the interaction of media freedom and Internet access that has a statistically significant and positive effect on gay rights; without media freedom, Internet access has no significant effect and vice versa. Conclusion. All else being equal, we observe greater respect for gay rights in those countries featuring a combination of both free media and higher rates of Internet access.

AB  - The objective of this study was to systematically assess the informational value, intention, source, and bias of videos related to dentistry available on the video-sharing Internet platform YouTube. YouTube (www.youtube.com) was searched for videos related to dentistry, using the system-generated sorts "by relevance" and "most viewed" and two categories (All and Education). Each of the first thirty results was rated by two assessors filling out a questionnaire for each (total: 120). The data were subjected to statistical analysis using Cohen's kappa, Pearson's correlation coefficient tau, Mann-Whitney U-tests, and a nonparametric three-way ANOVA, including an analysis of the interaction between the sorting and category effect, with an a-level of 5 percent. The scan produced 279,000 results in the category All and 5,050 in the category Education. The analysis revealed a wide variety of information about dentistry available on YouTube. The purpose of these videos includes entertainment, advertising, and education. The videos classified under Education have a higher degree of usefulness and informational value for laypersons, dental students, and dental professionals than those found in a broader search category. YouTube and similar social media websites offer new educational possibilities that are currently both underdeveloped and underestimated in terms of their potential value. Dentists and dental educators should also recognize the importance of these websites in shaping public opinion about their profession.

AB  - The American public remains divided on the issue of genetic modification. A 2014 Pew Research Center survey revealed that 57 % of 2002 respondents consider genetically modified organisms generally unsafe. In comparison, 88 % of 3748 scientists consider GMOs generally safe. To understand this divergence in opinion related to GMOs, I analyzed 200 headlines and articles from the Los Angeles Times, New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post published between 2011 and 2013. I focused on the key arguments and who is making them. The results showed that newspapers presented 207 favorable and 250 unfavorable mentions of GMOs. The findings revealed the arguments "GMO technical performance" and "potential for environmental harm," along with actors described as the "biotechnology industry" and "U.S. government," received more media attention, measured by the frequency of mentions in articles. The arguments, and the actors that drive them, play a vital role in public opinion forming and affect ethical, practical, political, and scientific considerations of GMOs. This research provides insight into arguments influencing public opinion on genetic modification and actors with the potential to change the GMO debate.

AB  - Common wisdom holds that graphic media violence leads to antisocial outcomes. This common wisdom is reflected in the Society for Professional Journalists' Code of Ethics. However, theory and research regarding moral emotions' ability to increase moral sensitivity suggests that this type of negative content may be capable of yielding prosocial responses. This article describes this logic and tests its predictions in two experimental studies utilizing news footage of a mass execution conducted by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Results corroborate claims that graphic media violence can serve as a moral motivator. Higher levels of graphic violence led to stronger anger and disgust responses, which in turn predicted higher levels of (a) moral sensitivity, (b) desires for anti-ISIS interventions (including military and humanitarian efforts), and (c) eudaimonic motivations (i.e., seeking meaning in life). Important to note, no increases in negative attitudes toward Arab Muslims were observed. Theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - The Implicit Association Test (IAT) was developed in response to reports of low validity of explicit (self-report) measures of attitudes, stereotypes, and prejudices. Usually, people are unwilling to report what they think and feel about other races, groups, and nationalities. The IAT has been written about in many books, newspapers, journal articles, websites, and has been featured frequently on radio and television many times; its web site has now reached a peak of 5 million visits. However, despite this popularity its validity and particularly its reliability is under question. This article reports on the validity and reliability of the IAT. Four different experiments were conducted on 150 students at California State University, Long Beach to investigate the temporal reliability of IAT. Also students' opinion (trust) about the validity and reliability of the test was evaluated. The results showed that while there are numerous reports of moderate validity of the test, its reliability as measured in this study, particularly for the first time users, is relatively low. Familiarity with similar tests, however, improves its reliability. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - An audience's interpretation of news is considered to involve the input of news frames and audience predispositions. This study proposes that media frame diversity and individual-level factors may both condition audience issue cognitions. Using two public issues in Taiwan that vary in news frame diversity and data from a sample survey, this study compares media and audience frames and examines factors that condition audience framing. Results show that media frame diversity corresponds to audience frame diversity at the aggregate level. Audience frames are more diverse in the more diverse news context, but are less diverse in the more uniform news context. Individual differences also affect audience framing. Education appears to be a strong predictor to audience frame diversity as more education increases audience frame diversity in both issue contexts. Other individual variables show differential effects on audience framing across the two issues. Overall, the findings suggest that, while effects of individual-level factors on broadening audience perspectives may vary with issues, diverse media frames may help to cultivate a more reflexive citizenry.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the role of the World Health Organization (WHO) in communicating with the public on social media during a global health emergency. More specifically, there is no study about the relationship between the agendas of the WHO and Twitter users during the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Objective: This study utilizes the network agenda-setting model to investigate the mutual relationship between the agenda of the WHO's official Twitter account and the agenda of 7.5 million of its Twitter followers regarding COVID-19.
   Methods: Content analysis was applied to 7090 tweets posted by the WHO on Twitter from January 1, 2020, to July 31, 2020, to identify the topics of tweets. The quadratic assignment procedure (QAP) was used to investigate the relationship between the WHO agenda network and the agenda network of the 6 Twitter user categories, including "health care professionals," "academics," "politicians," "print and electronic media," "legal professionals," and the "private sector." Additionally, 98 Granger causality statistical tests were performed to determine which topic in the WHO agenda had an effect on the corresponding topic in each Twitter user category and vice versa.
   Results: Content analysis revealed 7 topics that reflect the WHO agenda related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including "prevention," "solidarity," "charity," "teamwork," "ill-effect," "surveillance," and "credibility." Results of the QAP showed significant and strong correlations between the WHO agenda network and the agenda network of each Twitter user category. These results provide evidence that WHO had an overall effect on different types of Twitter users on the identified topics. For instance, the Granger causality tests indicated that the WHO tweets influenced politicians and print and electronic media about "surveillance." The WHO tweets also influenced academics and the private sector about "credibility" and print and electronic media about "ill-effect." Additionally, Twitter users affected some topics in the WHO. For instance, WHO followers affected "charity" and "prevention" in the WHO.
   Conclusions: This paper extends theorizing on agenda setting by providing empirical evidence that agenda-setting effects vary by topic and types of Twitter users. Although prior studies showed that network agenda setting is a "one-way" model, the novel findings of this research confirm a "2-way" or "multiway" effect of agenda setting on social media due to the interactions between the content creators and audiences. The WHO can determine which topics should be promoted on social media during different phases of a pandemic and collaborate with other public health gatekeepers to collectively make them salient in the public.

AB  - China enjoys considerable popularity in the Middle East and Africa, not only among elites but also at street level. This article draws on international relations theories to explain this general pattern, as well as intra- and interregional variation. Every approach has something to contribute, but international political economy more so than realism. Constructivist theories are particularly useful in explaining China's popularity in the Middle East and Africa.

AB  - Successful community reentry and the criminological impact of incarceration may depend in part on the attitudes (and consequent reactions) that prisoners encounter after release. Theories of social stigma suggest that such attitudes depend, in turn, on the levels of familiarity with the stigmatized group (the normalization thesis) as well as on the credibility and trust they accord to sanctioning agents (the legitimation thesis). To assess these two hypotheses, we present the first multivariate analysis of public attitudes toward ex-offenders. Data from a four-state, random-digit telephone survey of more than 2,000 individuals indicate that, net of controls, personal familiarity with ex-offenders may soften attitudes, whereas confidence in the courts may harden them. As expected, non-Hispanic Whites, conservatives, and southern residents hold more negative views of ex-offenders. Our findings lend indirect support to concerns that incarceration is becoming "normalized", and we suggest strategies for reducing the stigma of incarceration.

AB  - Since the early 1970s, debates surrounding the promises and pitfalls of renewable energy as a way to securely meet consumption demands in the United States have been commonplace in the media and political discourse. Drawing on the communication and political science literatures, this research addresses the relationships between the amount of media coverage given to wind energy, as well as the frames used in covering the topic, and the number of bills presented to state legislatures. We argue the media and political decision-making bodies are working as agents in a complex adaptive system, wherein they are constantly interacting and adjusting to both internal and external variables.

AB  - This study examined the effects of ad prominence and persuasion knowledge (PK) priming on game users' responses to in-game ads, the advertised brands, and the game. The experimental results suggested that game players showed more negative attitudes toward the brand and the game in response to high prominence ads. In addition, there was a significant interaction between ad prominence and PK priming on recall and attitudes. High prominence ads resulted in better product recall, only when PK was not primed. In contrast, high prominence ads resulted in more negative attitudes toward the game and game players' lower intention to play the game in the future, only when PK was primed. These results suggest that high prominence ads might be preferred when PK is not primed, whereas low prominence ads might be preferred when PK is primed. This study contributes to research on the effects of in-game ads in mobile games and provides practical implications for advertisers and game developers.

It positions voice and the public as two closely related concepts, and reviews how varying definitions of the public throughout the years have played a critical role in determining which voices get heard. The article then discusses the normative foregrounding of voice in deliberative democracy and how, facilitated by technology, voices also bring with them noise and clamor. Finally, this article highlights concerns that arise from an overabundance of voices, and calls for mindful, disciplinary exercising of voice.

TI  - Media Attention and Strategic Timing in Politics: Evidence from US Presidential Executive Orders
T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE

KW  - PUBLIC-OPINION
KW  - NEWS
AB  - Do politicians tend to adopt unpopular policies when the media and the public are distracted by other events? We examine this question by analyzing the timing of executive orders signed by U.S. presidents over the past four decades. We find robust evidence that executive orders are more likely to be signed on the eve of days when the news is dominated by other important stories that can crowd out coverage of executive orders. This relationship only holds in periods of divided government when unilateral presidential actions are more likely to be criticized by Congress. The effect is driven by executive orders that are more likely to make the news and to attract negative publicity, particularly those on topics on which president and Congress disagree. Finally, the timing of executive orders appears to be related to predictable news but not unpredictable ones, which suggests it results from a deliberate and forward-looking PR strategy.

AB  - Importance Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine hesitancy or refusal is common among parents of adolescents. An understanding of public perceptions from the perspective of behavior change theories can facilitate effective and targeted vaccine promotion strategies. Objective To develop and validate deep learning models for understanding public perceptions of HPV vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective cohort study, conducted from April to August 2019, included longitudinal and geographic analyses of public perceptions regarding HPV vaccines, using sampled HPV vaccine-related Twitter discussions collected from January 2014 to October 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures The prevalence of social media discussions related to the construct of health belief model (HBM) and theory of planned behavior (TPB), categorized by deep learning algorithms. Locally estimated scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) revealed trends of constructs. Social media users' US state-level home location information was extracted from their profiles, and geographic analyses were performed to identify the clustering of public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Results A total of 1431463 English-language posts from 486116 unique usernames were collected. Deep learning algorithms achieved F-1 scores ranging from 0.6805 (95% CI, 0.6516-0.7094) to 0.9421 (95% CI, 0.9380-0.9462) in mapping discussions to the constructs of behavior change theories. LOESS revealed trends in constructs; for example, prevalence of perceived barriers, a construct of HBM, deceased from its apex in July 2015 (56.2%) to its lowest prevalence in October 2018 (28.4%; difference, 27.8%; P < .001); Positive attitudes toward the HPV vaccine, a construct of TPB, increased from early 2017 (30.7%) to 41.9% at the end of the study (difference, 11.2%; P < .001), while negative attitudes decreased from 42.3% to 31.3% (difference, 11.0%; P < .001) during the same period. Interstate variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine were also identified; for example, the states of Ohio and Maine showed a relatively high prevalence of perceived barriers (11531 of 17106 [67.4%] and 1157 of 1684 [68.7%]) and negative attitudes (9655 of 17197 [56.1%] and 1080 of 1793 [60.2%]). Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study provided a good understanding of public perceptions on social media and evolving trends in terms of multiple dimensions. The interstate variations of public perceptions could be associated with the rise of local antivaccine sentiment. The methods described in this study represent an early contribution to using existing empirically and theoretically based frameworks that describe human decision-making in conjunction with more intelligent deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, these data demonstrate the ability to collect large-scale HPV vaccine perception and intention data that can inform public health communication and education programs designed to improve immunization rates at the community, state, or even national level.
   Question Can public perceptions of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine be accessed from the perspective of behavior change theories by mining social media data with machine learning algorithms? Findings This cohort study included 1431463 English-language posts about the HPV vaccine from 486116 unique usernames from a social media platform. An increase in HPV vaccine-related discussions was found, and the results suggest temporal and geographic variations in public perceptions of the HPV vaccine. Meaning The findings of this study suggest that social media and machine learning algorithms can serve as a complementary approach to inform public health surveillance and understanding and help to design targeted educational and communication programs that increase HPV vaccine acceptance.
   This cohort study develops and validates deep learning models to understand public perceptions of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines from the perspective of behavior change theories using data from social media.

AB  - This article focuses on the recent phenomenon of Ethiopian films that prominently feature Chinese characters. As the success of these films relies on representing a stereotypical Chinese 'Other', and in reference to China's ever-growing presence in African countries, we pose broader questions relating to the place of ethnicity, race and national identity in popular cultural productions emerging from the continent. Through an analysis which caters for multiple and at times oppositional interpretations, we argue that the representation of the 'Chinese Other' constructed by these films at times criticizes and at times reasserts existing stereotypes and prejudices. The overriding view and intent of the filmmakers to use Chinese characters mainly as narrative devices is often functional in the development of specific, inward-looking social and political criticisms. But this attitude inevitably forces the films to overlook the key issue underlying discourses about otherness in Ethiopian popular media - namely the issue of how to deal with racial multiplicity in a society that defines belonging along rigid and exclusionary terms.

AB  - The viewpoints of Brazilian opinion leaders regarding cancer are not yet well defined. Examining public perceptions of three segments of society through a qualitative study may provide clues to understanding the negative view that the population still has about the disease. Journalists, scientists and teachers participated in discussions in six focus group sessions. The findings were studied using the content analysis method, showing similar elements among these professionals, regardless of area of operation. We identified a negative view that may be contributing to or mirroring the vision of society that associates the illness with death and suffering. Although these opinion leaders believe they are able to filter certain negative aspects of media dissemination about cancer, when the disease affects them personally, the feeling of despair resembles common sense. Words such as "cure" are viewed with prejudice. On the other hand, a morbid approach arouses interest on the subject. It was also noted that the disclosure of a celebrity with cancer stands out as a decoy in the consumption of news. Such distortions may support actions that enhance communication about cancer, structured on pillars such as prevention, early diagnosis and cure.

AB  - Fake news and post-truth pronouncements are increasingly common, and are unfortunately also progressively being applied to the sciences, including the medical sciences. This editorial briefly reviews this unsavoury trend and highlights recent debunking of fake truths in early human development. Science is arguably the last metanarrative with any significant cachet in the postmodern period. We, as scientists, must strive to ensure that our work is transparent and of the highest possible standard so as to continue to uphold science's integrity and probity.

AB  - There is substantial literature on media representations of asylum seeker policy in Australia from a number of theoretical standpoints, namely moral panic theory, whiteness studies and belonging and citizenship. While many of these studies use discourse analysis of textual media as a methodology, there is scant attention to the contribution of manipulative silences in media texts on asylum seeker children. Using a form of discourse analysis to explore the idea of manipulative silences, we demonstrate how media representations may steer public attention towards asylum seeker children in two dominant ways: (i) in discourses of deviancy by association with adults and (ii) the rights of boat children in association with immigration detention. Both generate confusion between rights, compassion and deviancy and, by shifting public attention, they serve to silence more essential concerns for the children. We seek to analyses these manipulative silences in the context of Australian asylum seeker policies of the Abbott government. In elucidating the use of textual silences to manipulate discourse, it is possible to see how Australian media representations may be skewing dialogue in the public sphere away from core political, legal and humanitarian issues that are imperative for the well-being of asylum seeker children.

AB  - Enacted in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has reshaped US health policy. Yet overall opinions on the law remained relatively stable during the few years before and after enactment. In a polarized era, can the implementation of a complex program such as the ACA influence public opinion through a policy feedback? Research on policy feedbacks and self-interest provide competing expectations. To address that question, we consider the impact of the Medicaid expansion that took place in select states. Using differences-in-differences estimation and 2010-2017 surveys of more than 51,000 non-elderly American adults, we show that the Medicaid expansion made low-income Americans on average 4.4 percentage points more favorable toward the ACA (SD = 1.7) relative to those in non-expansion states. Given that no such effect emerged for high-income respondents, these results are consistent with an impact via self-interest and with a policy feedback on public opinion.

TI  - The Incautious Media, Free Speech, and the Unfair Trial: Why Prosecutors Need More Realistic Guidance in Dealing with the Press
T2  - HASTINGS LAW JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - JUSTICE
AB  - The ABA has proposed a new Standard for the Prosecution Function, Standard 3-1.7, which addresses how prosecutors should communicate with the media. The core portion of that proposal prohibits a prosecutor from making a statement raising a substantial risk of materially prejudicing a criminal proceeding or of unnecessarily heightening public condemnation of the accused. But this proposal is unrealistic. Recent findings in cognitive science suggest that media information overload and its fast pace result in media coverage of high-profile trials that heightens audience's negative emotions while compromising their critical faculties. Audience members thus are enraged at accused offenders and ill-equipped to judge the accuracy and completeness of media crime stories. All media in such cases therefore raise the substantial risks that the proposal prohibits. On the other hand, prosecutors' commentary to the press serves important free speech and political purposes, which this Article details. This Article weighs this balance to come up with an alternative series of guiding ethical principles, including, centrally, the principle that the prosecutor's statements shall not aggravate the unavoidable risks posed to trial fairness. The remaining principles detail how to give this nonaggravation rule greater specificity in channeling prosecutors' ethical decisionmaking in communicating with the media.

AB  - With the rapid development of social media, spontaneously user-generated content such as tweets and forum posts have become important materials for tracking people's opinions and sentiments online. A major hurdle for current state-of-the-art automatic methods for sentiment analysis is the fact that human communication often involves the use of sarcasm or irony, where the author means the opposite of what she/he says. Sarcasm transforms the polarity of an apparently positive or negative utterance into its opposite. Lack of naturally occurring utterances labeled for sarcasm is one of the key problems for the development of machine-learning methods for sarcasm detection. We report on a method for constructing a corpus of sarcastic Twitter messages in which determination of the sarcasm of each message has been made by its author. We use this reliable corpus to compare sarcastic utterances in Twitter to utterances that express positive or negative attitudes without sarcasm. We investigate the impact of lexical and pragmatic factors on machine-learning effectiveness for identifying sarcastic utterances and we compare the performance of machine-learning techniques and human judges on this task.

AB  - Despite the extensive amount of research on media framing, most previous studies have focused on individual frames. Recent findings have initiated a discussion on frame dynamics in relation to strength and dominance in competitive environments. However, a proper method of identifying the potency of particular frames when they are examined together has not been defined. The present study fills this gap in the research by providing an easily replicable method for defining frame strength and dominance in competitive contexts based on the media image of the DPRK in three global stations: CNN, CCTV, and Al Jazeera. The findings of this exploratory research revealed differences in the framing used in the DPRK, which enabled the identification of recurring moderators that could have boosted certain frames in the effort to predominate over the competition. Based on the findings of the present study, it was concluded that frames acquire additional strengthening attributes in competitive environments in contrast to single frames, which remain weaker when they are applied individually.

AB  - In reading news stories online, people are exposed to others' comments to a news story. In spite of popularity of comments to a news story online, the understanding of why and who posts a comment is still lacking. To complement scarcity and have a better understanding of comment-posting online, this study examined psychological factors which affect the likelihood of posting a comment to a news story online. In particular, three variables were considered: The first variable was communication efficacy, that is, an individual's belief about communication practices and systems, under the supposition that the people who have greater levels of communication efficacy are more likely to post a comment. The second variable was perception of public opinion, to test that when and if people judge their position of the issue as favored by the majority, they tend to post a comment. And finally, the tone of existing comments was included, to test if the tone of comments affects the willingness to post a comment. The results showed that firstly, people at a high level of communication efficacy are more likely to post a comment compared to people at the low level of communication efficacy. Secondly, the perception of public opinion partly influenced the willingness to post a comment. Especially, when people believe communication systems contribute to develop society and also when judged that their opinion is the majority's opinion, they are more likely to post a comment. Finally, the tone of the comments influenced the willingness to post a comment only on the condition that people are confident of the communication practice and are exposed to emotional comments.

AB  - News media coverage on education plays a uniquely important role in shaping public opinion, can influence educational policy, and can affect and concern teachers. Yet, research examining how teachers have been represented in the news is scarce. What is particularly scarce are investigations with a historical dimension. The study reported in this paper is offered as a contribution towards rectifying the deficit and pointing the way towards one of a number of avenues of research that other scholars in the field could take for various contexts (including different countries) and time periods. It is part of a much larger study whose aim was to provide a historical analysis of The West Australian newspaper's representation of teachers in its reporting of five major educational developments in the State of Western Australia that were the subject of sustained coverage at various times between 1987 and 2007. The specific topic which is the focus of the analysis presented in this paper is standardized testing.

AB  - The UK is committed to ambitious medium- and long-term climate change targets, including a commitment to an 80% reduction in emissions from 1990 levels by 2050. Whilst emissions have fallen significantly since 1990, further reductions will be increasingly difficult to achieve. The government has agreed carbon budgets to the late 2020s that are consistent with the long-term 80% target. However, increasing energy prices since the mid-2000s and the 2008 financial crisis have led to cracks in the political consensus in support of these budgets and targets.
   This paper carries out an assessment of the feasibility of the UK's agreed low carbon pathway over the medium term, with a particular focus on the fourth carbon budget (2023-27). It analyses the uncertainties associated with the specific changes that may be necessary to comply with this carbon budget - including measures to decarbonise electricity, heat and transport. This analysis focuses on 'instrumental' uncertainties associated with specific areas of the energy system (e.g. the decarbonisation of heat in households) and 'systemic' uncertainties that tend to have more pervasive implications for the energy system as a whole (e.g. uncertainties associated with public attitudes). A framework is developed that sets out and analyses the key uncertainties under those two broad categories, in terms of their complexity and their potential impact on the fourth carbon budget. Through the application of this framework the paper also considers strategies to mitigate or manage these uncertainties, and which actors could help develop and implement these strategies.

AB  - Conflict in online discussions of science has the potential to polarize individuals' perceptions of science, yet science communication scholarship has paid little attention to systematic study of how verbal attacks play out in online discussions of science. This study analyzes sarcasm and incivility in Twitter discussions of climate change during an extreme weather event (n = 4,094). We found instances of incivility and sarcasm were low overall. Incivility was used in association with political topics, and both incivility and sarcasm were used alongside skeptical perspectives of climate change and by those who mention right-leaning politics in their profiles.

AB  - Scholars of electoral autocracies accord far more attention to post-election protests than pre-election ones, as the former have the potential to trigger a regime transition. We argue that pre-election protests can have a significant effect on election outcomes. In particular, they are likely to deepen social cleavages along two dimensions: age and immigrant status. The 2019 social unrest in Hong Kong provides a unique opportunity to evaluate the electoral impact of pre-election protests. Comparing public opinion data related to the 2019 and 2015 District Council elections, we find strong empirical support for our argument, as immigrant status and age are strong predictors of voting choices and voter turnout. Our findings imply that exposure to democratic protests may not help in bridging the gap in political attitudes between immigrants and natives.

AB  - The international media coverage of disability sports displays diverse quantitative and qualitative shortcomings and shows that disability sports issues are frequently framed in unfavorable and negative ways. This study explores the effects of (valenced) issue-specific news frames in a disability sports communication. In an experimental study (between-subjects design), 90 participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants read a sports news article about the situation in disability sports prior to the 2012 Paralympic Games with a frame that either saliently focused on the athletic performance in disability sports (Group 1), or the fate and (financial) dependency on public support of disability sports (Group 2), or both (mixed frame; Group 3). Participants' importance considerations regarding specific aspects in disability sports, as well as their attitudes toward a portrayed athlete with a disability were measured. The findings showed a significant impact of the applied frames on participants' importance considerations and attitudes.

AB  - Research in social psychology has shown that public attitudes towards feminism are mostly based on stereotypical views linking feminism with leftist politics and lesbian orientation. It is claimed that such attitudes are due to the negative and sexualised media construction of feminism. Studies concerned with the media representation of feminism seem to confirm this tendency. While most of this research provides significant insights into the representation of feminism, the findings are often based on a small sample of texts. Also, most of the research was conducted in an Anglo-American setting. This study attempts to address some of the shortcomings of previous work by examining the discourse of feminism in a large corpus of German and British newspaper data. It does so by employing the tools of Corpus Linguistics. By investigating the collocation profiles of the search term feminism, we provide evidence of salient discourse patterns surrounding feminism in two different cultural contexts.

AB  - Television is an important political tool in Latin America. In recognition of its ability to shape public opinion and influence political behavior, Brazilian electoral authorities provide political parties with free television airtime in the weeks preceding elections. While Brazil's publicly financed electoral program levels the playing field between parties, it may contribute to intraparty resource disparities. This article contends that racial considerations influence how party elites distribute television airtime and thus contribute to the political marginalization of Afro-Brazilians. Using original data from Rio de Janeiro's 2012 municipal elections, it shows that party officials provide Afro-Brazilian candidates significantly less airtime than their white counterparts, even after controlling for theoretically important nonracial candidate characteristics. Moreover, it shows that there are racial differences in how candidates use the airtime they are awarded. Afro-Brazilian candidates are nearly ten times more likely than whites to focus on racial issues in their campaign ads. These results provide new insight about why Afro-Brazilians are rarely elected to public office and, when elected, the types of issues they may address.

AB  - Through multiple case studies, this essay attempts to paint a general picture of "mediatised politics" in China. The author first discusses several phenomena typical in Chinese political communication, such as government Public Relations training, Internet public opinion guidance, government communication on social media, and regional branding. He then analyses the historical origins of "the mediatization of publicity" and "the public-relations oriented transformation of government administration" in China, and the complex influences they have had on the country's society and culture. With these descriptions and analyses, the author provides a new perspective to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of Chinese communication, especially vis-a-vis the relationship between the Party state and media.

AB  - This investigation aims (1) to describe how people associate sport with human values and (2) to analyse the relationship between media involvement with the Olympic Games and those values. Drawing upon the theory of human values [Rokeach, M. (1968). The role of values in public opinion research. Public Opinion Quarterly, 32(4), 547-559. https://doi.org/10.1086/267645], we tested whether involvement with Rio 2016 and PyeongChang 2018 Olympic Games could affect perceptions of the association between sport and human values. Involvement with Olympic Games was compared to involvement with Paralympic Games. Results indicated the existence of three values of sport (human values associated with sport): (a) equality, (b) social recognition, and (c) friendship. Involvement with Olympic and Paralympic Games have different effects on perceptions of values of sport. Involvement with Paralympic Games positively affected values of equality and social recognition. But involvement with Olympic Games did not affect such values. Implications for theory and practice are discussed.

AB  - Employing a comparative experimental design drawing on over 18,000 interviews across eleven countries on four continents, this article revisits the discussion about the economic and cultural drivers of attitudes towards immigrants in advanced democracies. Experiments manipulate the occupational status, skin tone and national origin of immigrants in short vignettes. The results are most consistent with a Sociotropic Economic Threat thesis: In all countries, higher-skilled immigrants are preferred to their lower-skilled counterparts at all levels of native socio-economic status (SES). There is little support for the Labor Market Competition hypothesis, since respondents are not more opposed to immigrants in their own SES stratum. While skin tone itself has little effect in any country, immigrants from Muslim-majority countries do elicit significantly lower levels of support, and racial animus remains a powerful force.

AB  - This article explores a modern manifestation of the will to truth, the artistry of rap music, and their controversial convergence in America. All too often rap lyrics are interpreted as the celebration and even permissible testimony of the presumed criminal lifestyles of black people in America. In particular, the aggressive lyrics expressed in the subgenre "gangsta rap" have been used as confirmation for a singular truth narrative perpetuated by the media that blacks are inherently criminal and violent. However, Friedrich Nietzsche offers a thorough critique of the singular self-sustaining conception of truth and in its place suggests a healthier, more accurate, conception of honesty that embraces the fluctuating and interactive nature of identity, narrative, and life. Using Nietzsche's critique of truth, I argue that traditional interpretations of gangsta rap are buttressed by a singular narrative of truth that aims to perpetuate antiblack racial sentiments and consequently they overlook the nuanced critique of these sentiments that is achieved through alternative narration. Focusing on the rap artist NaS, I argue that the lyrical prowess he displays in his songs ultimately troubles the singular truth narrative in a way that expresses the type of honesty that Nietzsche champions.

AB  - Despite their high degree of economic, educational, social, and political success, most American Jews in the early 2000s see anti-Semitism as a problem, and significant percentages see anti-Semitism as a very serious problem. How do we explain these perceptions of anti-Semitic threat given the comparative success of Jews in so many aspects of American life? This paper uses annual surveys from the National Survey of American Jews from 2000 through 2005 to address this question. Results indicate a multiplicity of factors affect perceptions of the seriousness of anti-Semitism. Those with a stronger sense of Jewish identity, lower income, and older people are more likely to see anti-Semitism as a very serious problem. Respondents also tend to see anti-Semitism as a more serious threat if they live in states with higher anti-Semitic incidents rates and when use of anti-Semitic terms in the news media increases. The conclusion puts the findings into perspective and suggests what we can learn by studying successful minority groups.

AB  - This study examined White individuals' ability to recall non-White criminal perpetrators, specifically Middle Eastern-looking men, as portrayed in news stories. Considering social identity theory and the Arab/Muslim/Middle Eastern terrorist stereotype, White participants were expected to correctly identify White European-looking men and misidentify Middle Eastern-looking men as the perpetrators in news stories. A 2 (race/ethnicity of the perpetrator: White European- or Middle Eastern-looking) x 2 (story type: violent or nonviolent) experiment revealed that correct recall of the perpetrator for Middle Eastern-looking men was lower than that of White European-looking men. However, White individuals were not significantly more likely to incorrectly recall Middle Eastern-looking men than White European-looking men as perpetrators. Regardless of condition, more negative attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims predicted the incorrect recall of both Middle Eastern- and White European-looking men as perpetrators. These results are explained in light of their contradiction of existing theory. Also, a new measure of attitudes toward Arabs and Muslims is recommended.

AB  - As survey costs continue to rise and response rates decline, researchers are seeking more cost-effective ways to collect, analyze and process social and public opinion data. These issues have created an opportunity and interest in expanding the fit-for-purpose paradigm to include alternate sources such as passively collected sensor data and social media data. However, methods for accessing, sourcing and sampling social media data are just now being developed. In fact, there has been a small but growing body of literature focusing on comparing different Twitter data access methods through either the elaborate firehose or the free Twitter search or streaming APIs. Missing from the literature is a good understanding of how to randomly sample Tweets to produce datasets that are representative of the daily discourse, especially within geographical regions of interest, without requiring a census of all Tweets. This understanding is necessary for producing quality estimates of public opinion from social media sources such as Twitter. To address this gap, we propose and test the Velocity-Based Estimation for Sampling Tweets (VBEST) algorithm for selecting a probability based sample of tweets. We compare the performance of VBEST sample estimates to other methods of accessing Twitter through the Search API on the distribution of total Tweets as well as COVID-19 keyword incidence and frequency and find that the VBEST samples produce consistent and relatively low levels of overall bias compared to common methods of access through the Search API across many experimental conditions.

AB  - Hostile attitudes toward refugees are on the rise, yet individuals who hold negative beliefs toward out-groups are the most difficult to persuade. Is an explicit persuasive appeal effective for such groups, or should fictional narratives with implicit messages be used instead? An online experiment (N=1, 749) was conducted to test this possibility with three possible media-based interventions: a fictional sympathetic portrayal, a fictional hostile portrayal, or a documentary-based portrayal. Hostile portrayals increased negative attitudes toward refugees, while documentary portrayals increased positive attitudes and promoted stereotype reversal. These effects were observed regardless of nationalism or social dominance orientation.

AB  - Although research has tested the spiral of silence theory using a variety of issues, little attention is paid to how the nature of the issues affects the spiral of silence processes. This study adopts issue typologies provided by Yeric and Todd and recommended by Salmon and Glynn to test the theory using three issues: immigration (transitory), gay marriage (emerging), and abortion (enduring). Using a nationwide survey of Facebook users (N = 1,046), this study investigates how the nature of issues influences the dynamics of the spiral of silence processes. Results identify issue-specific differences, especially regarding the opinion congruency. Theoretical implications for future tests of the spiral of silence theory and public opinion research are discussed.

AB  - Does national media news coverage affect the behavior of legislators when deciding foreign policy matters? This article aims to disentangle the relationship between the media and legislative behavior in foreign policy, using Paraguay as a case study. We analyze the level of public debate on international affairs, measured by the frequency of news in the newspaper ABC Color in the six months before the roll-call votes on the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay. The literature on Latin American studies finds a lack of parliamentary interest in foreign affairs due to low voter attention to this subject, and therefore a low impact on reelections. We find the relationship between parliamentary polarization and public interest in a bill to be mediated by mass media. After estimating a Tobit model, we observe a significant and positive relationship between the news coverage a law receives and the degree of polarization among parliamentarians. Thus, our empirical evidence contradicts the idea that there is a lack of electoral interest in foreign policy. We confirm this finding through qualitative data gathered from in-depth interviews.

AB  - Nodding syndrome is an unexplained affliction that has affected thousands of children in post-conflict northern Uganda, South Sudan and in Tanzania. This study focuses on the sudden rise of nodding syndrome in the Ugandan public discourse, based on 369 newspaper reports over a timespan of 4.5 years and interviews with journalists, politicians, caretakers and health workers during 15 months of fieldwork in Kitgum district. The news coverage of nodding syndrome follows a non-linear trajectory, increasing at the end of 2011 and declining a year later. Attention is paid to the conceptualization of nodding syndrome in media reports, linked to the formation of public opinion and management of the affliction. Different settings elicit different concepts and it is therefore necessary to contextualize illness and focus on processes of formation.

AB  - The development and use of nanotechnology in the food industry (nanofood) have grown steadily. While visions for nanofood suggest that the applications will improve quality and safety, they are also controversial for several reasons including potential health risks coupled with difficulty in assessing low-dosage nanoparticle risks as well as values-based objections. In recent years, debate over nanofoods has sparked inquiry into factors that predict public attitudes and purchase intentions. Such studies have investigated the roles of demographics and sociographics, value predispositions toward science and technology, preferences for natural products, trust in regulatory agencies, scientific knowledge, and media attention. This study assesses the role of each of these factors in shaping public attitudes toward nanofood and improves the predictive models by evaluating concepts from protection motivation theory. We find that incorporating threat and coping appraisals provides the best predictive models of public attitudes and intention to purchase nanofood products.

AB  - Can residents of Ukraine discern between pro-Kremlin disinformation and true statements? Moreover, which pro-Kremlin disinformation claims are more likely to be believed, and by which audiences? We present the results from two surveys carried out in 2019-one online and the other face-to-face-that address these questions in Ukraine, where the Russian government and its supporters have heavily targeted disinformation campaigns. We find that, on average, respondents can distinguish between true stories and disinformation. However, many Ukrainians remain uncertain about a variety of disinformation claims' truthfulness. We show that the topic of the disinformation claim matters. Disinformation about the economy is more likely to be believed than disinformation about politics, historical experience, or the military. Additionally, Ukrainians with partisan and ethnolinguistic ties to Russia are more likely to believe pro-Kremlin disinformation across topics. Our findings underscore the importance of evaluating multiple types of disinformation claims present in a country and examining these claims' target audiences.

AB  - A common narrative about crime in the contemporary United States is that offenders are primarily young black men living in poor urban neighborhoods committing violent and drug-related crimes. There is also a local context to community, crime, and fear that influences this narrative. In this article, I address how narratives of crime and criminals play out differently within particular places. The article is based on participant observation and interviews conducted in two high-crime Boston-area communities. Although both communities are concerned with stereotypical offenders, there are differential community constructions of crime, formed through interactions between crime narratives and place identities. In one, crime is a community problem, in which both offenders and victims are community members. In the other, outsiders commit crime against community members. Media portrayals of crime and community, community race and class identities, and concerns over neighborhood change all contribute to place-specific framing of the crime problem. These frames, in turn, shape both intergroup dynamics and support for criminal justice policy.

AB  - The role of national parliaments in EU matters has become an important subject in the debate over the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. Yet despite a remarkable increase in parliamentary involvement in EU affairs, the added value in terms of democratic legitimacy will remain limited if citizens are not aware of their activities. Given that citizens mainly experience politics through the media, the aim of the paper is therefore to explore whether and under what conditions parliamentary involvement in EU matters is visible in national newspapers. The paper draws on two quantitative datasets covering parliamentary EU activities and relevant newspaper articles in seven Member States between 2010 and 2013. Results suggest that the efforts of active parliaments pay off. In addition, conflict within government coalitions over EU issues and greater salience of EU politics in public opinion increase coverage while, surprisingly, both public and parliamentary euroscepticism do not.

AB  - I ntroduction: We aimed to validate the Turkish version of the Stigma Scale of Epilepsy (SSE) (from Brazil) and present the results.
   Method: The SSE was completed by 33 patients with epilepsy (PWE), 25 of the patients' family members, and 23 people from the community. Subjects were interviewed on an individual basis; a physician read the questions and the subjects wrote the answers on a sheet. The form was the same for all subjects. In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Hamilton Anxiety Inventory (HAI), Short Form-36 (SF-36) were completed by the subjects.
   Results: We interviewed 81 subjects. The internal consistency of the SSE showed Cronbach's a coefficients of 0.785 for the PWE, 0.733 for the family members and 0.798 for the people in community. The mean scores on the SSE were 57 for patients, 66 for family members and 65 for the community where a score of 0 would suggest no stigma and 100would indicate maximum stigma. The SSE scores of patients, family members and the community who believed that patients with epilepsy are stigmatized or rejected were higher than the SSE scores of who did not believe it. Although there were strong correlation between high SSE scores and poor functionality and BDI; there were not any correlation between with SSE and HAI, age of epilepsy onset, time of epilepsy, education, and social class.
   Conclusion: The SSE has satisfactory content validity and high internal consistency. It allows for the quantification of the real perception of the epilepsy associated stigma. Prejudice and discrimination are often worse than the seizures themselves in terms of the impact on the daily lives of people with epilepsy and their families. Understanding this aspect of epilepsy is important for reducing the burden of epilepsy, and the SSE can be used for cross cultural, media, and social campaigns aimed at minimizing the negative influences of stigma.

AB  - In a changing information environment in which people increasingly select a combination of media platforms to consume news, scholars have taken a more comprehensive approach in measuring news consumption by examining news media repertoires. This study specifically (1) examines news repertoires of young people, based on their combined usage of media platforms and news content preferences; and (2) examines their variation due to social background characteristics. Results from a survey of Dutch adolescents (N = 1,084; age 16 to 21) reveal four distinct news repertoires: labeled minimalists, omnivores, traditionalists, and online news users. Findings further suggest that platform-based news repertoires are related to preferences for specific news content. Finally, this study contributes to the digital divide literature by demonstrating that inequalities in news media usage related to education do not seem to apply to younger citizens.

AB  - Key events catalyze frame-building processes and competition between frames. A longitudinal study (54 weeks) analyzes framing of economic policy after the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers (2008-2009) in German media to investigate the dynamics of frame struggles. As hypothesized, status and resources of frame sponsors and cultural resonance of frames proved critical for a frame's success. The frames ranking high on these criteria were more competitive and had the capability to displace and suppress alternative frames. The same set of seven frames dominated media coverage more or less unchanged, and competed coequally. Overall, media framing evolution was highly inert. The key event did not catalyze a change of interpretive paradigms, but intensified the frame contest between established frames.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has brought increased discrimination, stigma, and racism toward individuals of Asian descent. Little research has concentrated on public perceptions regarding who is to blame for the spread of the virus. This study extends integrated threat and attribution theories by examining the extent to which prejudice against Asians is related to blame attribution in New Zealand. The paper employs a mixed-method approach (n = 330). The findings suggest that to understand public stigma in ambiguous crises/events, it is significant to look beyond theoretic frameworks. Particularly, this research provides better understanding of how blame attribution has developed and linked with threats in the pandemic. First, fear of contact with COVID-19 is positively related to symbolic and realistic threats. Second, the more people believe COVID-19 is a public health risk, the more symbolic and realistic threats they have. Third, realistic threat is linked to blame attribution.

AB  - Social distancing is an effective means of containing the spread of COVID-19, but only if we all participate. Who are the individuals who are least likely to adhere to social distancing recommendations, presently and in the long term? Such knowledge is important for policy makers looking to sustain the public's buy-in to social distancing. Using survey data from a sample of U.S. residents (n = 1,449), the authors show that some demographic factors (gender, age, race, political party) help predict intent to adhere to social distancing. Yet demographic factors are relatively poor predictors compared with individual attitudes and media diets. Public officials should make efforts to inform and persuade the public of the importance of social distancing, targeting media such as television and radio, where audiences are less likely to currently engage in social distancing or are less likely to envision themselves sustaining strict social distancing for several weeks or months.

AB  - As news viewership has declined in recent years, concerns over the consequences of this phenomenon for democracy have increased. Theories of communication networks and news media effects suggest that accessing self-selected news sources preserves disagreement, whereas interacting with like-minded discussants homogenizes the preferences of members. This study addresses how the level of perceived disagreement within one's networks of political discussion can be maintained when an increasing number of citizens grow disinterested in acquiring political information. Using a series of agent-based simulations with a macro-micro theoretical framework and John Zaller's (1992) axioms as their basis, this study concludes that, if voters continue to "tune out,'' the number of citizens who perceive network heterogeneity will decrease.

AB  - Similar to many developing countries, the government of China has publicly committed itself to the rule of law. As part of the campaign to strengthen the rule of law, the government, media and academics have employed multiple justifications for the value of rule of law, including instrumental justifications such as economic growth and corruption reduction, and intrinsic or normative justifications like increased fairness and neutrality of judicial decisions. While various justifications for the rule of law abound, we know exceedingly little about why the public might value the rule of law. To understand mass attitudes toward the rule of law, we conducted a conjoint survey experiment using a national urban sample of 2,100 Chinese residents. We find instrumental justifications, especially corruption reduction, to have the largest effects, though several intrinsic justifications are also significant. Additionally, intergroup analysis shows that income and experience with the courts condition the type of justification that is most likely to be employed.

AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons. bucks. as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

AB  - Increasing surface temperatures, Arctic sea-ice loss, and other evidence of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) are acknowledged by every major scientific organization in the world. However, there is a wide gap between this broad scientific consensus and public opinion. Internet blogs have strongly contributed to this consensus gap by fomenting misunderstandings of AGW causes and consequences. Polar bears (Ursus maritimus) have become a "poster species" for AGW, making them a target of those denying AGW evidence. Here, focusing on Arctic sea ice and polar bears, we show that blogs that deny or downplay AGW disregard the overwhelming scientific evidence of Arctic sea-ice loss and polar bear vulnerability. By denying the impacts of AGW on polar bears, bloggers aim to cast doubt on other established ecological consequences of AGW, aggravating the consensus gap. To counter misinformation and reduce this gap, scientists should directly engage the public in the media and blogosphere.

AB  - Turnout in second-order elections, like those for the European Parliament, is notoriously low, especially among younger voters. This study compares five pathways in which exposure to poll coverage can affect turnout: bandwagon voting, strategic turnout, increased information efficacy, campaign cynicism and perceived electoral importance. The mediation analyses are combined with Covariate Balancing Propensity Score matching to better account for selection effects. Analyses of a four-wave panel survey of young voters (N = 747) in the 2014 European Parliament Election show that exposure to polls in election coverage predominantly stimulates interest and turnout among young voters. This is in line with the perspective that poll coverage increases perceived electoral importance. Poll coverage can thus play a beneficial role in activating the potential among young voters to engage with (second-order) elections.

AB  - There is convincing evidence that the media have been responsible for questionable coverage on climate change, which has been blamed for undermining public consensus on the issue. However, less is known about the way in which the media communicate the key values, or ethical dimension, surrounding the debate over climate change and its global effects. It is generally argued that a strong notion of cosmopolitanism rather than narrow national self-interest will be fundamental to the achievement of a comprehensive international agreement on climate change. The media provide a crucial forum for discussing such challenges. The study examines how climate ethics form part of the debate on climate change in three British national newspapers leading up to, during, and following two key United Nations conferences. Through a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of climate change coverage, this article examines how the values of cosmopolitanism and communitarianism underpin the debate on climate ethics in the respective newspapers. This article argues that the possibility of reaching a fair climate agreement partially depends upon the ability of media to inform citizens of the inherent injustices of climate change and the importance of taking bold action. It is concluded that a more cosmopolitan perspective in the media could be useful in helping sway public opinion in favor of effective climate action.

AB  - Much to their own surprise, successive Danish governments have succeeded in maintaining the highest level of public support among the nations contributing to the NATO mission in Afghanistan, while suffering the highest number of fatalities per capita. We explain this puzzle in a parsimonious fashion manner using a novel analytical framework derived from elite-competition theory, the event-driven school and the literature on strategic narratives. The Danish government initially built strong political and popular support by making a case for war that resonated with broadly shared pre-existing interests and values (national defence and support for democracy and human/women's rights), and role conceptions (supporting NATO and US-led military operations as a responsible member of international society). Succeeding governments subsequently maintained a high level of political consensus on Afghanistan through a process of continuous consultation and consensus-building. The political elites supporting the mission then sustained the high level of public support by defining success in ways that did not involve winning' but focused instead on the attainment of realistic short-term, tactical objectives such as police training and building of schools, and by speaking with one voice to the media. This effectively reduced the Danish media to a conveyor belt passively transmitting the positive views of the political parties supporting the Afghanistan operation and the officers and soldiers carrying it out.

The paper performs a discourse and visual analysis of trailer and trailer-users interactions to demonstrate that the trailer formulates and disseminates an Islamophobic, anti-secular, Hindu nationalistic discourse with coherence and complexity. It also blurs difficult questions regarding Indians' participation in the British Indian Army, and reclaims Sikhs as part of the Hindu nation in line with Hindutva ideology..

AB  - This study investigates a mechanism of mediated intergroup contact effects that occurs through experiencing social presence of a stigmatized outgroup character. Conceiving narrative texts as a context for mediated intergroup contact, we experimentally test (N = 505) the effects of narrative perspective (first vs. third person) and the photograph of the outgroup protagonist (present vs. absent) on perceived social presence of the outgroup character. We further test whether experiencing the outgroup protagonist as socially present affects intergroup outcomes (i.e., perspective-taking, intergroup anxiety, outgroup knowledge, and outgroup attitudes). Findings indicate that first-person narratives are more effective than third-person narratives in inducing social presence of the stigmatized outgroup character; photos, unexpectedly, did not have such an effect. Social presence, in turn, plays a key role in facilitating positive intergroup outcomes from reading online narrative texts. The implications of our findings are discussed.

AB  - The epidemic of political disinformation in social media has in part triggered the transition to the post-truth era in which emotional and ideological appeals are more influential in shaping public opinion than objective facts. In this study we examined the cognitive and affective responses that political disinformation prompted in Facebook, as the most popular social media platform. Through text analysis of user comments corpora on nearly 2,100 political posts from popular sources in Facebook, we found that compared to true news, political disinformation received significantly less analytic responses from Facebook followers. While the results indicated greater anxiety in responses to true news, responses to political disinformation were filled with greater anger and incivility. We also found similar (low) levels of cognitive thinking in responses to extreme conservative and extreme liberal disinformation. Contrary to prior research findings, our results indicated that responses to extreme liberal disinformation in Facebook were filled with greater anger and incivility. This suggests that the incivility and outrage in online political discourses should not be attributed to a specific political party without considering the concurrent political events.

AB  - Studies have shown that politicians follow the news media closely and react to news through their parliamentary activities. However, we know little about what kinds of information politicians look for in the media and actively use when being responsive to the media. Inspired by the uses and gratifications tradition, we ask what kinds of information politicians look for in the news and how these "informational media use motives" explain their media responsiveness. A survey of Finnish parliamentarians shows that most politicians use the news to learn about society and societal problems. Politicians also use the news to look for information about public opinion, and younger politicians especially search information about other political actors. Politicians who look for information about public opinion from the media are more reactive to media regarding symbolic agendas. Politicians who use the media to learn about other political actors are more responsive to media regarding substantial agendas.

AB  - c Outsourcing is important in highly diversified business environments, but while there have been many studies on outsourcing, none have explicitly tackled the problem of how SMEs should assess and select their outsourcer. Numerous benefits might be gained if SMEs could utilize evaluation models to help select their IT/IS outsourcer effectively. Prejudices arising from selection through impartial analysis could be avoided and a more accurate and an objective decision could be made. We investigated the selection process of an enterprise needing an IT/IS outsourcing provider in Taiwan. Our recommended process quantitatively sorts the criteria using the AHP. An evaluation model was developed based on the needs of the SME who should use it to obtain a better outsourcing provider resulting from improved information vital to maintain outsourcing efficiency. Use of our model should reduce costs and potential risks in adopting new IT/IS applications and promote an objective standard with which to evaluate IT/IS outsourcing providers.

Grounded on the theoretical framework of Van Dijk's approach of Ideology in critical discourse analysis, the socio-cognitive model was used for analysis which is the most appropriate to study media discourse, the data is analysed qualitatively. The method of the current research is critical discourse analysis. The research revolves around the Pakistani socio-political events in Western media from the perspective of a global issue that is a war on terrorism. The research has objectives to investigate what and how Western media has used lexical choices to depict a certain ideology about Pakistan to the world.

AB  - Heritage value, conservation and protection are significant issues in heritage studies and urban and regional planning. In a time where both urban and tourism growth impact the heritage, understanding the relationship between the surrounding heritage and the citizens, especially the local communities, can play an important role in urban and regional planning. This paper aims to provide a theoretical framework for heritage reputation, that integrates the heritage value and the causal framework regarding beliefs, attitudes, intentions and behaviors towards an object, in this case the heritage. Heritage reputation can be strategic for urban and regional planners when analyzing and implementing policies. Crowdsourcing geographic knowledge, web 2.0 and social media play a significant role in today's society because this new source of information can help modeling the evolving human landscape, complementing the existing methods. Indeed, location-based user-generated content can be a relevant source for heritage studies and citizen sensing can be used to model and measure heritage reputation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the potential of educational television and parent-child discussions about race to change White children's attitudes toward Blacks. Ninety-three White children ages 5-7 and their parents participated. Families were randomly assigned into three experimental groups and one control group. Those in the experimental groups were asked either to show their children five educational videos, with or without additional discussions, or to have race-related discussions with their children without the videos. Improvements were seen in children's out-group attitudes in both the video and discussion groups, whereas in-group attitudes decreased for those who watched videos and had discussions with their parents. Results revealed lack of parental compliance. Even when instructed to do so, only 10% of parents reported having in-depth race-related discussions with their children. Children's racial attitudes were not significantly correlated with those of their parents, but children's perceptions of their parents' attitudes were positively correlated with their own. Reasons for parents' reticence about race discussions, their outcome implications, and directions for future research and intervention are discussed.

AB  - Background: Assessing the extent to which drug research influences and impacts upon policy decision-making needs to go beyond bibliometric analysis of academic citations. Policy makers do not necessarily access the academic literature, and policy processes are largely iterative and rely on interactions and relationships. Furthermore, media representation of research contributes to public opinion and can influence policy uptake.
   In this context, assessing research influence involves examining the extent to which a research project is taken up in policy documents, used within policy processes, and disseminated via the media.
   Methods: This three component approach is demonstrated using a case example of two ongoing illicit drug monitoring systems: the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) and the Ecstasy and related Drugs Reporting System (EDRS). Systematic searches for reference to the IDRS and/or EDRS within policy documents, across multiple policy processes (such as parliamentary inquiries) and in the media, in conjunction with analysis of the types of mentions in these three sources, enables an analysis of policy influence. The context for the research is also described as the foundation for the approach.
   Results: The application of the three component approach to the case study demonstrates a practical and systematic retrospective approach to measure drug research influence. For example, the ways in which the IDRS and EDRS were mentioned in policy documents demonstrated research utilisation. Policy processes were inclusive of IDRS and EDRS findings, while the media analysis revealed only a small contribution in the context of wider media reporting.
   Conclusion: Consistent with theories of policy processes, assessing the extent of research influence requires a systematic analysis of policy documents and processes. Development of such analyses and associated methods will better equip researchers to evaluate the impact of research. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The paper seeks to develop new avenues for a study of the Ukrainian press in the West European languages in Europe during the first quarter of the twentieth century. For the first time ever, we employ here the framing perspective for the study of the victimization grand-narrative of Ukrainians in their foreign-language print media in Europe. We examine the victimization of the Ukrainian people in terms of 'human interest', 'conflict' and 'morality' frames in the press discourse of the respective historical periods: colonial (1901-1918), postcolonial (1919-1921), and neo-colonial (1921/1922-1926). We argue that victimization grand-narrative in the press was used purposefully to evoke compassion and empathy from the West European public opinion for the Ukrainian nation as 'collective' victim ('oppressed nation'). Additionally, this research proves that victimization of Ukrainians geared at securing support and solidarity for their nation-state aspirations from the European opinion leaders.

AB  - Matyjaszek's article discusses a set of reactions by Polish emigre cultural and political activists in the United States to the screening of the NBC television series Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss on 16-19 April 1978. It offers an analysis of the emergence of Holocaust history as a source of collective identity and memory in western societies, and as a part of popular culture. The end of the 1970s witnessed a series of cultural and political events as well as the publication of scholarly texts that put images of the mass murder of the European Jews at the centre of North American and global debates on identity and history as well as their political uses. In his analysis of reactions by Polish intellectuals and community leaders, Matyjaszek examines the cultural position of members of the post-war Central-Eastern European intelligentsia in the United States, both in relation to their own reference group's painful and violent history, and to their position within the North American society of the time. In a critical evaluation of contemporary uses of the concepts of 'bystander' and 'survivor' with regard to the Holocaust, he focuses on a set of documents stored in the private archive of Jan Nowak-Jezioranski (Ossolinski Institute, Wroclaw, Poland), as well as on published documents and correspondence.

AB  - The Campania Region in Southern Italy has suffered many problems with municipal solid waste management since the mid-1990s, leading to significant public disturbances and subsequent media coverage. This paper reports on the current views and knowledge of young people (university students) in this region about waste management operations and facilities, specifically the siting of landfills and incinerators. By means of a structured questionnaire, opinion and knowledge were systematically examined by degree type and course year. The study took place in 2011 at the University of Salerno campus. A sample of 900 students, comprising 100 students for each of the nine considered faculties, and 20 students for every academic course year, was randomly selected. Only about a quarter of respondents were not opposed to the siting of a landfill or an incinerator in their city. This clearly highlights that historic opposition to the construction of waste facilities is difficult to overcome and that distrust for previous poor management or indiscretions is long-lived and transcends generations. Students from technical faculties expressed the most reasonable opinion; opinion and knowledge were statistically related (Chi-square test, p < 0.05) to the attended faculty, and the knowledge grew linearly with progression through the university. This suggests that awareness of waste management practices develops with experience and understanding of environmental issues. There is general acceptance that many stakeholders - technicians, politicians and citizens - all have to be part of the decision process when siting a new waste management facility. The opinions of the young respondents were significantly influenced by their level of environmental knowledge. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose
   Lean six sigma (LSS) has attained a prominent position in mature organizations but small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are struggling in the proper implementation of LSS in their core business. This study aims to make a comprehensive analysis of LSS implementation barriers in SMEs so that LSS execution can be much fluent in SMEs.
   Design/methodology/approach
   This research work is carried out based on investigation of LSS barriers through extensive literature review. For validating the identified barriers, a questionnaire survey was conducted, and out of 400 samples, 260 responses received back. The collected responses are analyzed statistically and found 16 significant barriers. The finalized barriers are modeled using interpretive structural modeling (ISM) and clustered them through matrice d'impacts croises-multiplication appliquee a un classement (MICMAC) analysis. Furthermore, to check the consistency of results, ISM-MICMAC outcomes are validated through structural equation modeling (SEM).
   Findings
   The result reveals that 16 LSS implementation barriers are finalized through expert's opinion and validated through statistical reliability test with Cronbach's alpha value of 0.820. The ISM model reveals that the management relevant barriers are exhibiting the leading role to influence the implementation of LSS in SMEs. Moreover, the obtained results validated through SEM are found in good agreement.
   Research limitations/implications
   During pairwise comparisons, there may be some prejudice and subjectivity as human judgments are engaged.
   Practical implications
   This study provides impetus to practitioners and consultant for the initiation of LSS in the business organization through tackling the LSS barriers as per their driving and dependence power.
   Originality/value
   In the past, limited studies had explored the LSS barriers, but a few studies analyzed the mutual relationship between barriers. No such study is reported in literature that validates the mutual interaction model of LSS barriers. Hence, this paper presents the original research work of identification and modeling of barriers associated with LSS implementation in SMEs through hybrid ISM-SEM approach.

The results showed that water supply-related articles have dominated the reporting of water issues since 1843. This emphasis is reflected in the institutions involved and their related policy/management initiatives, as well as the themes of the articles. Extreme events such as flooding and drought have punctuated the historical record of reports on water issues. An economic development-driven tone was overwhelmingly predominant in newspaper articles (85 % of the total); however, there has been a marked decline in the importance of development-driven tone relative to environmental-sustainability oriented tone of articles since 1994. People from academia and NGOs were rarely quoted. Inclusion of wider range stakeholders should be considered as a strategic break-through and natural events should be considered as an "opportunity" to change public opinion on water issues for environmental sustainability.

AB  - This research explored the perception of elderly citizens in Shanghai about negative health impacts of environmental issues. A soft systems methodology (SSM) framework was employed with methodological tools including rich pictures, workshops, social system model building and comparison of models. We found that among our elderly participants, recent government and media campaigns have created the perception that environmental conditions have improved due to government initiatives. The exception to this view is among the educated participants of the study. This suggests that powers of nested social hierarchies and governmental media control still have a dominant influence on public opinion in Shanghai, creating barriers for citizen recognition and understanding of environmental health issues. Education and open access to information are potential areas for intervention to improve understanding and empowerment in this area.

AB  - Sustainability is one of the major challenges that societies are facing. The question of why and how consumer food sustainability related issues (e.g., food waste, sustainable food shopping behavior, among others) are placed on the public agenda is therefore of high interest to food policy makers. Drawing from media agenda setting theory, this study provides the first analysis of how relationships between consumer food sustainability-related frames appear in the media. Focusing on the COVID-19 crisis, it is examined how the media framed food sustainability issues in 2019 and 2020. 271 newspaper stories are investigated through a rather new approach to quantitative content analysis that incorporated binary coding, optimal scaling, and path analysis. The study's findings point to various significant relationships between frame contents and implications and similarly bring to light the moderating effects of the COVID-19 crisis and 'article authorship' on a number of these relationships. The findings contribute to the understanding of how public opinion regarding food sustainability develops and can help food policymakers and authorities seeking to develop, position, and address issues relevant to food sustainability.

AB  - In response to the increasing influence of social media networks on shaping the public opinion, sentiment analysis systems and applications have been developed to extract insights and gain an overview of the wider public opinion behind certain topics so as to support businesses, manufacturers, government agencies, and policymakers with their decisions and plans. Despite the importance of sentiment analysis in providing policymakers with effective mechanisms to understand the attitudes of customers and citizens which can be usefully used in decision-making processes and planning for the future, so far studies on sentiment analysis are very limited in Egypt. Much of the work is still done using survey tools such as questionnaires and polls to gather information about the citizens' attitudes towards given issues and topics. Despite the effectiveness of such methods, citizens' reflections on social media platforms and networks remain more powerful in providing comprehensive insights and overviews. Furthermore, social media-based sentiment analysis is usually more representative being based on larger numbers of participants, which has positive implications to reliability. Opinions expressed on social media are often the most powerful forms of feedback for businesses because they are given unsolicited. In light of this argument, this study seeks to provide a sentiment analysis of Egypt's New Real Estate Registration Law on Facebook. To extract information about the users' sentiment polarity (positive, neutral or negative), Facebook posts were used. The rationale is that Facebook is still the most popular social media platform in Egypt. Text classification was then used for classifying the selected data into three main classes/values: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. The findings indicate that sentiments expressed in the users' posts and comments have a significant negative attitude towards the new law. Despite the effectiveness of the automatic evaluation and analysis of the sentiments and opinions of the users in social media concerning the new Real Estate Registration Law, linguistic approaches including Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), functional linguistics, and semiotics need to be incorporated into sentiment analysis applications for gaining a better understanding of people's attitudes towards specific issues.

AB  - This article introduces the 16 articles appearing in the 2009 and 2010 volumes of Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy that were submitted in response to a call for papers on "The Social Psychology of the 2008 United States Presidential Election." The papers touch a wide array of election topics, comparing the backgrounds and values of voters and nonvoters, those voting for different candidates, and those who choose which candidates they support early vs. late during the campaign. These papers, together with several others on media representations of candidates, highlight the continuing presence of race in shaping political attitudes and preferences, and also emphasize the evolution of American prejudices in the election process, from overt rejection of individuals who are racially different, to qualified political support under certain circumstances. Other papers in the collection focus on the role of gender as well as race, and also on some of the many ways in which presidential elections reflect and shape the self-concepts of American voters.

AB  - Using the case of the Xiamen anti-paraxylene (PX) plant movement, this article investigates the evolving phenomenon of citizen journalism with Chinese characteristics in the information age, with a focus on ICT-empowered environmental activism and the implications of citizen journalists on China's sociopolitical development. It is argued that enhanced public participation and environmental rights defences are developing effectively in China. The increase in alternative information available online through internet-mediated bloggers as well as citizen journalists is posing a formidable challenge to both the Communist Party of China's propaganda-filled media environment and its effective governance. Furthermore, the net's sociopolitical impact in China will be shaped and determined less by the intrinsic nature of the internet itself than by the underlying political dynamics of public opinion, civil participation, citizen journalism and cyber-activism.

AB  - The Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) has a tradition for being among the most respected national police organisations globally. More recent political events in Hong Kong have however placed the HKPF in highly visible public order situations. A wide array of political factions have emerged as a consequence of the handover of control in Hong Kong, many of which have involved young people protesting the curtailment of democratic rights. In this paper, we utilise Wave 7 of the World Values Survey (n = 2075). We utilise Inglehart's (1971. The silent revolution in Europe: intergenerational change in post-industrial societies. American political science review, 65 (4), 991-1017) concept of postmaterialism to examine how far young people's more negative attitudes to the police can be underpinned by cohort-based (or generational) explanations. Our findings identify associations between postmaterialist values and lower confidence in the police. Those that favoured stricter immigration controls, experienced higher fear of crime, perceived drug selling in their area, and consumed certain types of media (notably television and new media) were also less likely to have confidence in the HKPF.

AB  - Science has a powerful role in society. It can fuel innovation, shape policy and influence public opinion. However, science can also be highly controversial and subject to substantial disagreement and debate. Such debates are often evident in the media which regularly reports on areas of disagreement and debate. This article draws on the case-study of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), which has become a highly politicised issue in recent years, to explore media representation of public knowledge controversies. The disease has received substantial policy and media attention, particularly in relation to badgers and their role in its spread. This article focuses on the ways in which the various debates associated with bTB and its control are presented in the press, with a specific emphasis on badger vaccination. An in-depth discourse analysis compares regional, national and farming press, and identifies a number of complex dualisms against which the debate is framed. These dualisms help to explain the unclear policy direction and constant divisions between those who do and do not support badger vaccination, and the continued status of bTB control as a public knowledge controversy.

AB  - Aim of study: The aim of this paper is to analyze how the news media influences the construction of the social perception of forests and forestry.
   Area of study: The area covered by this study is Spain.
   Material and Methods: The materials used for the analysis were the online news related to items such as forest, bioenergy and biodiversity, in two leading newspapers in Spain from 2009 to 2012. The hypotheses tested were divided into two sets, one focused on the messages and another focused on the sources on these messages. Summative content analysis was applied, combining both quantitative and qualitative data analysis. The messages and sources were systematically explored and monitored.
   Main results: As main results, forest wildfires news is the most frequent issue mentioned in the media, however they require deeper reflection and debate. Keywords such as forest management, owners, harvesting, products, etc. are rarely found anymore; furthermore, new terms such as biomass, are not yet prevalent. On sources, official institutions, primarily the regional governments, dominate the news sources with a share of over 50%.
   Research highlights: Mass media analysis is considered the most appropriate complement for perception studies as it provides relevant basic information needed to design a communication plan. Further research is required on the role mass media plays in how we perceive and react to the environmental problems around us.

AB  - In 2006 and 2007, many analysts expected that immigration would be one of the top domestic issues in the 2008 campaign. However, in the 2008 presidential general election, immigration issues were never a major topic between candidates John McCain and Barack Obama. This was partially because McCain has more moderate views toward immigration reform than the passionate anti-immigration faction of the Republican Party. Prior research suggests that an issue in a presidential campaign can remain influential even when the media and campaigns are not discussing or addressing the issue, even when the candidates or parties do not differ greatly on the issue. In a survey of Virginia residents conducted just before the November election, immigration attitudes were a differential factor between McCain and Obama. (C) 2010 Western Social Science Association.

AB  - The intervention of feminist activists and scholars in the last three decades has led not only to far greater sensitization of public attitudes concerning gender but also a series of laws and regulations to promote greater gender justice. However, these effects seem to be more prominent at the higher levels of the bureaucracy, judiciary, higher education and the English-language media than among the popularly mobilized opinion in the regions. This essay examines this disparity in terms of a distinction between the history of the Indian nation-state and the collective consciousness of the people-nation.

KW  - PUBLIC-OPINION
AB  - In late 2017, congressional Republicans enacted a major tax bill despite voter opposition, resistance from organized interests, and considerable uncertainty about its policy consequences. Why did they do so? We argue that Republicans' concern with their party's reputation-in particular, its productivity brand-trumped negative evaluations of the legislation by citizens, interest groups, and policy experts. To support this claim, we analyze measures of legislative output, news media content, public opinion, and lawmaker sentiment. Our findings underscore the importance of party reputation in explaining legislative behavior and suggest that there may be explanatory value in distinguishing between different types of party valence brands.

Without a clear description of how the underlying data were collected, stored, cleaned, and analyzed, however, readers cannot assess their validity. To illustrate the critical importance of evaluating the production of Twitter data, we offer a systematic comparison of two common sources of tweets: the publicly accessible Streaming API and the "fire hose" provided by Gnip PowerTrack. This study represents an important step toward higher standards for the reporting of social media research.

AB  - Within Australia, divisive debates regarding the processing of asylum seekers have delivered increasing polarisation rather than convergence on an evidence-based, humane approach. In order to investigate the role of motivated reasoning (the idea that our judgment is based on our motivations) with respect to attributions of warmth and competence, 186 participants indicated the extent to which they accepted false beliefs regarding asylum seekers. They read an article rebutting such false beliefs and then reported their attitudes towards the author and the extent to which the author possessed warmth and competence traits. They then reported whether they agreed with the information in the article before completing a test of recall. Participants who disagreed with the article recalled less accurate information and rated authors significantly lower on warmth and competence. These findings suggest that motivated reasoning plays an important role in the way stereotypes are applied and in the way information is processed.

AB  - As the Environmental Protection Law was revised and media public opinion supervise them, enterprises need to not only undertake more environmental protection responsibilities but also alleviate the contradiction between development and environment. By applying a multiple regression model, this paper studies the impact of air pollution on the management behavior of enterprises using the panel data of China's A-share polluting enterprises listed in the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock markets between 2014 and 2019. The results of this study are as follows: First, air pollution produces a positive impact on the behavior of corporate green management. Second, media reports have brought more attention to corporate pollution and increased the positive impact of air pollution on corporate green management efforts. By further considering the internal and external heterogeneity of enterprises, the impact of air pollution on corporate green management varies when the degree of enterprise pollution and the degree of local governance differ. Moreover, this paper highlights the fact that air pollution can play a significant role in corporate green management, while media attention, as a third party, plays a regulating role in environmental supervision. This provides suggestions for strengthening green management behavior of enterprises and building comprehensive environmental supervision system.

AB  - This study investigated how the prevalent visual depiction of obesity in the media promotes stigmatization of obese individuals. Particularly, this study proposed and tested the two sequential mechanisms which were not explicated in the previous models but indispensable in stigma research: (1) the disease avoidance response (i.e. discomfort for physical contact) and (2) dehumanizing perception. Results of two experiments overall supported the extended model: the headless photos of obese individuals triggered the disease avoidance responses, which sequentially increased the dehumanizing perception of and negative attitudes toward obese individuals. The identity trait (e.g. gender) match increased readers' level of social identification with obese people and alleviated the disease avoidance response when they saw the photo of the obese model as a whole being. By contrast, the opposite effects (i.e. disidentification and heightened discomfort) were found when the participants saw the headless photo of the obese model of the same gender.

AB  - Drawing from the stereotype content model, we examine how people respond to likeminded and counter-attitudinal political comments appearing after a news article. We experimentally test how citizens behave when they are able to click on one of three different buttons posted next to others' commentsLike, Recommend, or Respect. In the experiment, political attitudes predicted button clicking, but the button label affected the strength of the relationship. In some instances, people clicked on fewer buttons associated with likeminded comments and more buttons associated with counter-attitudinal comments when the button was labeled with Respect as opposed to Like or Recommend. The pattern of results for the Recommend button differed across two issues. The results suggest that political comments can trigger stereotypical reactions. Although the Like button is well known, news organizations interested in promoting less partisan behaviors should consider using a Respect button rather than the Like or Recommend button in comment sections.

AB  - This study grounded on computational social sciences and social psychology investigated sentiment and life domains, motivational, and temporal themes in social media discussions about robotic technologies. We retrieved text comments from the Reddit social media platform in March 2019 based on the following six robotic technology concepts: robot (N = 3,433,554), AI (N = 2,821,614), automation (N = 879,092), bot (N = 21,559,939), intelligent agent (N = 15,119), and software agent (N = 18,324). The comments were processed using VADER and LIWC text analysis tools and analyzed further with logistic regression models. Compared to the other four concepts, robot and AI were used less often in positive context. Comments addressing themes of leisure, money, and future were associated with positive and home, power, and past with negative comments. The results show how the context and terminology affect the emotionality in robotic technology conversations.

T2  - THEATRE RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL
LA  - English
KW  - KOSOVO
AB  - During the 2018 World Cup in Russia, two Kosovo-born Swiss players stirred controversy when they flashed a double-headed eagle gesture during a contentious win over Serbia. The gesture was an assertion of ethnic Albanian pre-eminence in Kosovo and a rhetorical strike against the Serbians, who still claim ownership over Kosovo even ten years after its declaration of independence. The gesture sparked worldwide media coverage and prompted punishments by FIFA (the World Cup's governing body), which legislates against overt political expression during matches. In this article, I will examine the double-headed eagle gesture as an example of the body's unique capacity to perform multiple political interventions at once. Not only did it transmit a contentious history, it also undermined the anti-political boundaries erected around the scenarios of transnational combat engendered by FIFA, highlighted anti-immigrant sentiments still festering across Europe, and illustrated the communicative powers that elite players can access through their goal celebrations. Considering these valences supports my reading of this case as symbolic of the sort of ruptures produced by competing impulses operating in Europe today, one working for the affirmation of the union, the other for its dissolution.

AB  - This paper analyses the powerful stereotypical media discourse that shapes and reproduces a certain racialised and prejudiced perception of people identified as "Roma" in Germany. Using a close analysis of a single picture appearing as harmless at first glance - and through the reconstruction of its various interpretational contexts and semantics the paper identifies mechanisms used in stereotypical media coverage of "Roma". This qualitative analysis draws on media analysis of antigypsyism as well as on research of photographic construction of the "gypsy" in order to analyse the contemporary visual regime of "Roma" in Germany. As it portrays "the Roma" as a fundamentally different and socially deviant group, this visual stereotyping is shown to be an integral element of the persistent antigypsyist ideology, deeply embedded in German society.

AB  - An online survey was used to the examine college students' uses and gratifications of social recommendation systems such as "like" on Facebook. By presenting numerical values, these systems display the volume (i.e., how many users) and valence (i.e., like/dislike) of collective opinions within a specific e-community that users are involved with. Consequently, these systems offer the chance for users to scan the climate of opinions within a specific online community. More importantly, these systems have introduced a new mode of speaking out online. Due to social recommendation systems' significance in the public opinion domain, the study attempted to understand why and how people use them to express opinions. Results showed that social recommendations were used for expression, information, socialization, and entertainment purposes. Above all, users primarily viewed them as potential expressive tools and actually use them to express their opinions. While internet use had no significant relationships with either motives or system uses, social media uses were closely related with both motives and actual uses. The findings suggest that social recommendation systems seem to play an important role in the public opinion domain by offering an additional way to scan collective opinions and express opinions.

AB  - After news media and pollsters were unsuccessful in predicting recent political outcomes such as the 2016 U.S. election, opinion polls came under scrutiny. Journalists were accused of not providing audiences the tools to correctly interpret poll information. Using a content analysis of all evening news items from CBS, ABC, and NBC from the final two months before the 2020 U.S. general election, we analyzed the quality of poll coverage. We find that half of the references to election polls are "diffuse," in which journalists refer to "the polls" in a general manner. When news items do cover specific poll results, media often disclose the absolute minimal essential information (e.g., population and error margin), but fail to provide additional methodological details.

AB  - Members of the World Economic Forum recently identified the economic, health and knowledge disparities between the "haves" and "have-nots" in the world as one of the central risks in the global risk landscape. However, research on the role of communication in reducing knowledge disparities for emerging technologies is rare. More importantly, little research has tracked knowledge gaps about emerging technologies in representative populations over time. In this study we examine U. S. public knowledge levels across different levels of education and media use using data from two nationally representative telephone surveys. Our results show that increased science Internet and television use among low education groups can help narrow, or significantly reduce the growth of knowledge gaps that are forming based on educational disparities.

AB  - While a great deal of attention has been paid to how political media can divide and polarize politicized groups in the U.S., little is understood about its effects within those groups. In this study, I use a population based survey experiment to explore whether targeted political media are affecting two factors associated with political voice - perceptions of political homogeneity and perceptions of political power. Drawing on theories from social psychology, I outline and test a set of theoretical predictions to explore this relationship in the context of Spanish-language political ads. The results suggest that Spanish-language political ads do, in fact, increase perceptions of collective political power among Latinos, but not in a way that unequivocally promote perceptions of political homogeneity. In doing so, the findings provide some of the first evidence of a causal relationship between targeted political media and perceptions of targeted political groups.

AB  - Whose voices are most likely to receive news coverage in the US debate about climate change? Elite cues embedded in mainstream media can influence public opinion on climate change, so it is important to understand whose perspectives are most likely to be represented. Here, I use plagiarism-detection software to analyze the media coverage of a large random sample of business, government, and social advocacy organizations' press releases about climate change (n = 1,768), examining which messages are cited in all articles published about climate change in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and USA Today from 1985 to 2014 (n = 34,948). I find that press releases opposing action to address climate change are about twice as likely to be cited in national newspapers as are press releases advocating for climate action. In addition, messages from business coalitions and very large businesses are more likely than those from other types of organizations to receive coverage. Surprisingly, press releases from organizations providing scientific and technical services are less likely to receive news coverage than are other press releases in my sample, suggesting that messages from organizations with greater scientific expertise receive less media attention. These findings support previous scholars' claims that journalistic norms of balance and objectivity have distorted the public debate around climate change, while providing evidence that the structural power of business interests lends them heightened visibility in policy debates.

AB  - Online social media platforms play an important role in political communication where users can freely express and exchange their political opinion. Political entities have leveraged social media platforms as essential channels to disseminate information, interact with voters, and even influence public opinion. For this purpose, some organizations may create one or more accounts to join online political discussions. Using these accounts, they could promote candidates and attack competitors. To avoid such misleading speeches and improve the transparency of the online society, spotting such malicious accounts and understanding their behaviors are crucial issues. In this paper, we aim to use network-based analysis to sense influential human-operated malicious accounts who attempt to manipulate public opinion on political discussion forums. To this end, we collected the election-related articles and malicious accounts from the prominent Taiwan discussion forum spanning from 25 May 2018 to 11 January 2020 (the election day). We modeled the discussion network as a multilayer network and used various centrality measures to sense influential malicious accounts not only in a single-layer but also across different layers of the network. Moreover, community analysis was performed to discover prominent communities and their characteristics for each layer of the network. The results demonstrate that our proposed method can successfully identify several influential malicious accounts and prominent communities with apparent behavior differences from others.

AB  - Social media platforms provide easy access to the public opinion (called electronic word-of-mouth), which can be collected and analyzed to extract knowledge about the reputation of an organization. Monitoring this reputation in the public sector may bring several benefits for its institutions, especially in supporting decision-making and developing marketing campaigns. Thus, to offer a solution aimed at the needs of this sector, the goal of this research was to develop a methodology capable of extracting relevant information about eWOM in social media, using text mining and natural language processing techniques. Our goal was achieved through a methodology capable of handling the small amount of information regarding public state organizations in social media. Additionally, our work was validated using the context of the Portuguese Army and revealed the potential to provide indicators of institutional reputation. Our results present one of the first cases of the application of this type of techniques to an Army organization and to understand its negative reputation among the population.

AB  - The enduring impact of exposure to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on mental health and sociopolitical attitudes was examined in a sample of 427 adolescents (M = 16.20 years) and their mothers residing in New York City. Direct exposure to the terrorist attack was associated with youth depression symptoms and with mothers' posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. There was no evidence of reciprocal effects of mother exposure on youth or of youth exposure on mothers. Although mothers reported engaging in more emotional processing coping assistance with their children, coping assistance was not associated with youth's symptomatology. Media exposure was found to be a strong predictor of youth's and mothers' sociopolitical attitudes about issues such as prejudice toward immigrants, social mistrust, and current events.

AB  - Islamophobia is a sentiment against the Muslim community; recently, atrocities towards Muslim communities witnessed this sentiment globally. This research investigates the correlation between how news stories covered by mainstream news channels impede the hate speech/Islamophobic sentiment. To examine the objective mentioned above, we shortlisted thirteen mainstream news channels and the ten most widely reported Islamophobic incidents across the globe for experimentation. Transcripts of the news stories are scraped along with their comments, likes, dislikes, and recommended videos as the users' responses. We used a word embedding technique for sentiment analysis, e.g., Islamophobic or not, three textual variables, video titles, video transcripts, and comments. This sentiment analysis helped to compute metric variables. The I-score represents the extent of portrayals of Muslims in a particular news story. The next step is to calculate the canonical correlation between video transcripts and their respective responses, explaining the relationship between news portrayal and hate speech. This study provides empirical evidence of how news stories can promote Islamophobic sentiments and eventually atrocities towards Muslim communities. It also provides the implicit impact of reporting news stories that may impact hate speech and crime against specific communities.

AB  - After decades of relatively high inflows of foreign nationals, immigration is now at the center of substantial political divisions in most European countries and has been implicated in one of the most vexing developments in European politics, the rise of the xenophobic right. However, it is not clear whether high levels of immigration actually do cause a public backlash, or whether publics become habituated to, and supportive of, immigration. This study tests these backlash and habituation theories using novel measures of immigration mood and immigration concern produced by combining over 4,000 opinion datapoints across twenty-nine years and thirty countries. The authors find evidence of a public backlash in the short to medium run, where mood turns negative and concern about immigration rises. Yet the study also finds evidence of a longer-run process of habituation that cancels out the backlash effect within one (concern) to three (mood) decades.

AB  - The dual edged implications of the introduction of English literary studies notwithstanding - the presentation of a fresh cultural perspective and the complete cultural takeover of colony - the pride and fascination of the British with the works of Jane Austen has had a deep impact on cultural production in India and its diaspora. Down the years, keeping pace with changing times and backed by technological developments, the Jane Austen-facilitated coming together of the two nations and two cultures, has seen several multilingual, multicultural screen adaptations of the Austen novels for both television and the big screen: Sense and Sensibility by Tamil cinema as Kandukondain Kandukondain; Pride and Prejudice as Trishna, a serialized Hindi adaptation for Indian national television, and later, for the big screen by a British Indian in English and Hindi as the internationally acclaimed Bride and Prejudice/Balle Balle Amritsar to L.A. and more recently, Emma by mainstream Bollywood in Hindi as Aisha. The essay broaches an analysis of the nuancing that takes place in the interstices between the word and the visual art forms and of the complexities arising from this interface. The complex agenda of the adaptive engagement underlying this vibrant colloquy between two cultures, between two mediums is interesting enough, but the added dynamic of a hybrid cosmopolitanism that is sometimes gratifying and sometimes problematic, makes the study even more challenging.

AB  - As a rising power, China has realized that it is an urgent task to improve its national image among foreign publics. In the era of Xi Jinping, China has invested a substantial amount of resources in its foreign-language media to present a more favorable national image to an international audience. This study provides a novel approach to examine the content of China's Japanese-language media and its dissemination. The study found that the Chinese state media promotes China's soft power using two main strategies: (1) highlighting China's culture and economic achievements, and (2) providing positive stories of China. A comparative content analysis of Chinese and Japanese media shows that Chinese media's narratives are not well circulated in Japan's public opinion ?eld. This study has both substantive and methodological signi?cance. Substantively, this investigation enhances our understanding of China's strategic use of state-owned media for public diplomacy. Methodologically, this research contributes to the employment of quantitative text analysis methods on Japanese-language data.

AB  - Crises are inevitable for any company, and the fate of a company's image rests in how well they are responded to. Few studies have experimentally tested the impact that common types of company responses can have on consumers' perceptions when a negative complaint has been made online. This research sought to expand the strategies put forth for crisis management by image restoration theory (IRT) using best practice research within the context of social mediated crisis communication. An online experiment examined the effect of a company's response to an online complaint (i.e., professional apology, personal apology, deleting the comment, ignoring the comment, control group) on participants' perceptions of the company (i.e., perceptions of company caring, attitude). The potential for perceptions of company caring to mediate the relationship between these expanded strategies and IRT's ultimate aim of attitude change was also tested. An apology, whether professional or personal, improved participants' perceptions compared to deleting or ignoring the complaint. Caring significantly mediated the relationship between response strategy and participant attitude. Compared to a control group, which had no transgression, ignoring or deleting the complaint led to negative attitudes about the company, while responding to the complaint with a personal or professional apology led to positive attitudes about the company via perceptions of company caring. Results indicate that online complaints could also be seen as opportunities to improve a company's image, as attitudes toward the company were highest when a transgression occurred and was responded to positively, compared to not having the transgression take place at all (i.e., control condition). Potential extensions to current image repair strategies in the social media environment are discussed.

AB  - The knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs of key policy influencers and the general public can support or hinder the development of public policies that support cancer prevention. To address gaps in knowledge concerning healthy public policy development, views on cancer causation and endorsement of policy alternatives for cancer prevention among government influencers (elected members of legislative assemblies and senior ministry bureaucrats), non-governmental influencers (school board chairs and superintendents, print media editors and reporters, and workplace presidents and senior human resource managers), and the general public were compared.
   Two structured surveys, one administered to a convenience sample of policy influencers (government and non-governmental) and the other to a randomly selected sample of the general public, were used. The aim of these surveys was to understand knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs regarding health promotion principles and the priority and acceptability of policy actions to prevent four behavioral risk factors for cancer (tobacco use, alcohol misuse, unhealthy eating, and physical inactivity). Surveys were administered in Alberta and Manitoba, two comparable Canadian provinces.
   Although all groups demonstrated higher levels of support for individualistic policies (e.g., health education campaigns) than for fiscal and legislative measures, the general public expressed consistently greater support than policy influencers for using evidence-based policies (e.g., tax incentives or subsidies for healthy behaviors).
   These results suggest that Canadian policy influencers may be less open that the general public to adopt healthy public policies for cancer prevention, with potential detriment to cancer rates.

AB  - Contact tracing applications have been deployed at a fast pace around the world to stop the spread of COVID-19 and may be key to containing future pandemics. This study aims to explain public opinion toward cell phone contact tracing using a survey experiment. We build upon a theory in evolutionary psychology-disease avoidance-to predict how media coverage of the pandemic affects public support for containment measures. We report three key findings. First, exposure to a news item that shows people ignoring social distancing rules causes an increase in support for cell phone contact tracing. Second, pre-treatment covariates such as anxiety and a belief that other people are not following the rules rank among the strongest predictors of support for COVID-19 apps. And third, while a majority of respondents approve of the reliance on cell phone contact tracing, concerns for rights and freedoms remain a salient preoccupation.

AB  - Purpose Labour came to power in 1997 and immediately transferred many features of its party political news management style into government, overseeing the departure of most of the civil service communications leadership within two years, and developing the media management role of politically appointed special advisers. The purpose of this paper is to empirically examine the changes in custom and practice that operated behind the scenes in government communications between 1997 and 2015, asking to what extent such changes challenge public trust in government in a liberal democracy.
   Design/methodology/approach This study takes a longitudinal, qualitative approach through in-depth interviews with former civil servants, journalists and special advisers, together with documentary and archival evidence. The data were analysed thematically through the text-processing software, NVivo.
   Findings The paper finds that although the controversy over the 2002 dossier on Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction was an extraordinary episode, the creative approach to news management that characterised this case still operates within UK Government communications: the bypassing of civil servants, a partial approach to the facts, selective briefing of favoured journalists, a lack of due process in the management of information and a disregard for the letter and spirit of propriety codes. This has implications for public trust and confidence in the workings of liberal democracy.
   Originality/value The study adopts a mediatisation approach to the study of public relations, using the concept of the cross field to demonstrate how PR professionals share media management responsibilities with a number of different promotional actors. PR professionals in government must therefore navigate between the hidden, competitive and demanding worlds of politics, the media and bureaucracy, working with journalists, politicians and political operatives to craft the narratives that seek to drive public opinion.

AB  - The use of social media platforms (e.g. Twitter and Facebook) to raise public awareness towards wildlife conservation is an emerging discussion. However, little is currently known about the propagation pattern of wildlife-related information on social media. In this study, a quantitative model was developed based on 230 independent cetacean stranding incidents (2008-2018) across mainland China from a popular Chinese social media platform (Sina Weibo). This model enabled analysis of the post formation process, identification of the key factors influencing the popularity of the posts and wildlife-related incidents, and allowed investigation of public opinions. The results showed that central media users can increase the overall possibility of elevating incident popularity by similar to 75 times, an attractive species or incident by similar to 5 times, and a negative social ethics incident by similar to 3 times. Traditional media users and celebrity influencers performed key roles in affecting the level of re-posting. Online audiences of highly popular posts predominantly encompassed both users from relatively developed regions and female users. It was observed that posts which became popular within similar to 12 h retained their influence for similar to 3 d. Post popularity was closely related to comment counts rather than forwarding in the first day of posting and the whole status retention time. Public opinion generally expressed a supportive attitude towards wildlife conservation, but lacked in-depth thinking, and individual responsibility was expressed through revival incidents. In order to raise public awareness towards biodiversity conservation, social media-based wildlife information dissemination should balance the content of attractive and non-charismatic species or incidents and include more positive emotions. Posts via traditional users (especially central media users) and opinion leaders (celebrities) can attract a highly educated audience and females, and thus evoke increased comment numbers during the first day of posting. This will help to popularise conservation knowledge and legislation with continuous efforts.

AB  - Popular entertainment often involves political messages, and entertainment elements are now commonly used in politics coverage. This study examines how suspense drives impacts of political entertainment media content on attitudes, building on the "affective news" extended model. Hypotheses were tested with four texts on controversial political issues (within-subjects), presented in alinearorinverted-pyramidstructure and either asnewsorfiction. The resulting 2 x 2 x 3 x 4 online experiment (N= 227) showed that linear texts produced greater suspense and attitude change than inverted-pyramid texts. Suspense mediated attitude impacts. Both news and fiction versions influenced attitudes, with impacts still detectable 1 day after exposure.

AB  - Hurricane evacuation is a complex dynamic process and a better understanding of the factors which influence the evacuation behavior of the coastal residents could be helpful in planning a better evacuation policy. Traditionally, the various aspects of the household evacuation decisions have been determined by post-evacuation questionnaire surveys, however, these surveys have seen a deterioration in the quality of the data due to a gradual decrease in response rates in recent years, which may lead to non-response bias. Increased activity of users on social media, especially during emergencies, along with the geo-tagging of the posts, provides an opportunity to gain insights into user's decision-making process, as well as to gauge public opinion and activities using the social media data as a supplement to the traditional survey data. This paper leverages the geo-tagged Tweets posted in the New York City (NYC) and Jacksonville, FL in wake of Hurricane Sandy and Matthew respectively to understand the evacuation behavior of the Twitter users and compare them with that of the survey respondents. We design the Twitter user classification problem as a novel HMM modeling framework to classify them into one of the three categories: outside evacuation zone, evacuees, and non-evacuees. We compare the demographic composition (age, gender, and race/ethnicity) and spatial coverage of Twitter users with that of the survey respondents to highlight the complementary nature of the two data sources, which when combined give a representative sample of the population. We analyze the GPS coordinates of the tweets by evacuees to understand evacuation and return time and evacuation location patterns and compared them with survey respondents. The techniques presented in this paper provide an alternative (fast and voluntary) source of information for modeling evacuation behavior during emergencies, which is complementary in terms of demographics and spatial distribution as compared to the traditional surveys and could be useful for authorities to plan a better evacuation campaign to minimize the risk to the life of the residents of the emergency hit areas.

AB  - Various studies have found that reading books about positive interactions between ingroup and outgroup characters, known as media vicarious contact, can reduce prejudice. Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low-SDOs in Study 1, and for high-SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge.

AB  - This article investigates how Shari'a is experienced in the everyday life of 57 Muslims from Western Sydney. It focuses on their opinions about its application in Australia, and on how they negotiate their lives around the necessity or non-necessity of adhering to Shari'a principles. The findings show that their observance of Islam tends to be negotiated in their everyday life within the framework of the Australian law, to which they show strong adherence. Respondents strongly reported the inaccurate picture of Shari'a that the media have painted. For this reason, the informants are reticent to have discussions in the public sphere about the implementation of officially recognised Shari'a within an Australian legal system for fear that it would stoke the flames of Islamophobic sentiment. This is an impediment to the development of a post-secular Australia.

T2  - PS-POLITICAL SCIENCE & POLITICS

KW  - MEDIA
AB  - Although much of the United States undoubtedly was aware of the impeachment hearings and trial for President Donald Trump in 2019-2020, the extent to which information about those events influenced the public remains unknown. Building on scholarship about public opinion and democratic governance, we attempted to fill this knowledge gap through a unique survey. We asked half of our sample to answer three factual questions pertaining to Trump's first impeachment trial. We ran a quasi-experiment on the other half, trying to influence their view of the trial by informing them of the same three facts that we asked the first group. The quasi-experiment demonstrates that support for acquittal was largely static and that partisanship strongly influences whether the public accepts the veracity and importance of political information. Consequently, civic knowledge today appears to have a limited-perhaps even nonexistent-effect on public attitudes about American politics.

AB  - Background We aim to describe the general characteristics of how the Canadian newspaper The Globe and Mail reports on opioid-related news, the opioid crisis and its victims, and explore how Canadians' perceptions of the opioid crisis could have developed over time from this reporting. The Globe and Mail has the highest circulation among Canadian newspapers and is Canada's newspaper of record. Methods Reviewers performed independent, blinded bibliometric searches of all The Globe and Mail articles archived in the Canadian Periodicals Index Quarterly spanning an 18-year period (1 January 2000-1 June 2018) related to the keywords "opioids" or "drugs and opioids" and "opiates". Independently and in duplicate, reviewers manually extracted qualitative data from articles and identified emergent themes. Articles were screened independently by both reviewers based on the inclusion criteria. Conflicts were resolved by discussion and consensus. Social representation theory was used as a framework for describing how the opioid crisis is portrayed in Canada. Results Our search yielded 650 relevant opioid articles. The number of articles peaked in 2009, 2012, and in 2016, coinciding with major developments in the epidemic. The language used in this discourse has evolved over the years and has slowly shifted towards less stigmatizing language. Content analysis of the articles revealed common social representations attributing responsibility to pharmaceutical companies, physicians, and foreign countries. Conclusions The Globe and Mail's coverage of the opioid crisis is focused on basic social representations and attributed responsibility for the crisis to a few collectives. A shift toward coverage of the root causes of the opioid epidemic could positively influence the general public's perception of the opioid crisis and promote deeper understanding of the issue. Journalists face several obstacles to achieve greater focus and framing of the opioid crisis; a closer working relationship between the media and the research community is needed.

AB  - This paper attempts to assess the role of Tamil and Chinese newspapers in exerting influence on Indian and Chinese voters, before and after Malaysia's 2013 General Election (GE13). This study employs both content analysis and survey to examine media agenda and public agenda specifically the Chinese and Indian ethnic groups. In total, 4,951 news items were obtained from two major language newspapers comprising Sin Chew, Nanyang Siang Pau, Tamil Nesan and Malaysia Nanban, during the election campaign period. These news items have been coded according to seventeen categories. A total of 754 Chinese and 183 Indians had participated in the public opinion survey conducted before the general election, and a total of 618 Chinese and 122 Indians responded after the general election. This study found that both Tamil and Chinese newspapers did not influence the agenda of the Chinese and Indian respondents nationwide. Politics appeared as the top issue reported in both ethnic newspapers while crime appeared as the most important issue of concern to both Chinese and Indian respondents.

AB  - This article examines the factors that condition citizens' attitudes toward genetically modified (GM) foods by considering individual-level attitudes in 15 European Union member states. Previous research has shown that European attitudes toward GM foods are influenced by overall levels of scientific literacy, consumer exposure to media coverage, and broader socio-political preferences. This article seeks to expand on this literature by testing some of these explanations in a multivariate analysis. To test our propositions, we develop and estimate a logistic regression model using data derived from Eurobarometer surveys. While the sources of information that people value and their attitudes toward EU policy in related areas explain to some extent support for GM foods, our strongest finding confirms the importance of public understanding of science as a basis for support for this emerging technology.

AB  - As a means of communication, city branding can influence public opinion and change the general public's perceived image of a city. In China, news producers may not regard their activities as city branding. Since they have to follow the view and plan of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in terms of reporting on certain aspects of cities, news media, especially official media, is perform a Chinese way of city branding. This article presents a critical discourse analysis of how the People's Daily, as the official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), portrays Shenzhen, as the tone and depictions used in this newspaper when describing this city are arguably part of a Chinese approach to city branding through journalism. Through an analysis of 40 years of news coverage regarding Shenzhen in the People's Daily, this study draws conclusions regarding the features of city branding through journalism in China and how this approach represents a new form of city branding.

AB  - This paper examines the impact of public opinion, time, and the 'yuck' factor in influencing the formation of water reuse norms based on an analysis of newspaper content observed in two locations: Singapore and Queensland, Australia. A simple regression analysis shows that time and the 'yuck' factor were significant factors in norm formation but, surprisingly, public opinion was not found to be a significant factor. The results show that public opinion, long held to be an important factor, may not be significant in the sense in which it is commonly conceived. It also shows how perception can be shaped to promote water reuse policies in the urban sector. The formation of water norms was found to be crucial in determining the different outcomes in the implementation of water reuse policies in the two countries.

AB  - The relationship between emphasis framing and public opinion has received considerable attention in political science, psychology, and mass communication studies. However, what moderating role perceived knowledge plays in influencing emphasis framing remains unsettled. We explore this relationship using a survey-experiment embedded within a large-N, nationally representative survey that allows us to test two specific hypotheses. First, we empirically test whether an emphasis frame influences policy support. Second, we test the moderating effect of perceived knowledge. We test the emphasis framing effects of the name given to a hot-button political issue, while controlling for other survey treatments. Furthermore, we evaluate the degree to which perceived knowledge of the issue moderates the relationship between the emphasis frame and support for hydraulic fracturing. We find support both for the role emphasis framing plays and for perceived knowledge as a moderator.

AB  - The current study examined sexist humor and participants' level of sexism and femininity ideology using two research approaches: (1) a quasi-experimental design in which participants were primed with sexist humor and (2) a correlational approach using content analysis to estimate exposure to sexist humor in media. It was hypothesized that exposure to sexist humor would influence viewer's sexist views and femininity ideology. It was also hypothesized that the quasi-experimental design would yield confirmatory results of our initial hypothesis while the correlational design would not. Participants included 1,559 male and female college students who were randomly assigned to three experimental conditions (viewed sexist humor, viewed non-sexist humor, viewed no videos) and then answered questions related to sexism and femininity ideology followed by general demographic items and media viewing preferences. Results confirmed that the quasiexperimental design, in comparison to the correlational design, yielded more confirmatory results in that those exposed to sexist humor had higher scores on all outcome measures examined. Limitations of priming and content analysis are discussed as well as directions for future research.

AB  - The #MeToo campaign has reminded us that male sexual violence, harassment, and abuse towards women is not a new phenomenon. But alongside the visibility of the perpetrators and experiences of myriad women, this recent campaign raises a set of questions as to how this type of violence towards women is normalised and legitimated. Our focus here is on the ways in which male sexual violence towards women is normalised and legitimated through the use of humour. Existing research on responses to, and discussions of, rape jokes and rape culture have primarily focussed on online discourses or television coverage of rape joke controversies. The focus in this paper is if, and how, serious newspaper discourse contributes to the normalisation of male sexual violence towards women. In order to evaluate this, we undertake a thematic analysis of UK newspaper coverage of rape jokes. While there is the potential for the telling of rape jokes to be emancipatory, our findings suggest that news coverage of rape jokes does the ideological work of strengthening rather than challenging gendered power relations. We argue that news coverage of rape jokes in the UK predominantly reinforces and normalises male sexual violence towards women.

AB  - This article describes a statistical method for aggregating the information from Irish opinion polls. Such aggregate estimates provide academic researchers with a time series of support for political parties, and inform the public better about opinion polls by focusing on trends and uncertainty in these estimates. The article discusses the challenge of aggregating opinion polls in a multi-party setting with a comparatively limited number of polls available and presents daily estimates of party support for the 1987-2016 period. The article develops a method to better model major sudden political and societal events, which have been common in Ireland since 2007. Finally, it discusses how polling aggregation estimates can enhance opinion poll reporting in the media.

AB  - Federal, state, and city governments spend substantial funds on programs intended to aid homeless people, and such programs attract widespread public support. In recent years, however, state and local governments have increasingly enacted policies, such as bans on panhandling and sleeping in public, that are counterproductive to alleviating homelessness. Yet these policies also garner substantial support from the public. Given that programs aiding the homeless are so popular, why are these counterproductive policies also popular? We argue that disgust plays a key role in the resolution of this puzzle. While disgust does not decrease support for aid policies or even generate negative affect towards homeless people, it motivates the desire for physical distance, leading to support for policies that exclude homeless people from public life. We test this argument using survey data, including a national sample with an embedded experiment. Consistent with these expectations, our findings indicate that those respondents who are dispositionally sensitive to disgust are more likely to support exclusionary policies, such as banning panhandling, but no less likely to support policies intended to aid homeless people. Furthermore, media depictions of the homeless that include disease cues activate disgust, increasing its impact on support for banning panhandling. These results help explain the popularity of exclusionary homelessness policies and challenge common perspectives on the role of group attitudes in public life.

AB  - This study investigates media effects on stereotypic attitudes toward immigrants in a political campaign that dealt with the naturalization of immigrants. By combining a content analysis of the campaign coverage with a 2-wave panel survey, the study found that negative news portrayals of immigrants increased stereotypic attitudes in the public in the course of the campaign. Additionally, the frequent exposure to positive news portrayals of immigrants reduced the activation of negative outgroup attitudes. However, these findings are contingent on people's issue-specific knowledge. Only people with low to moderate knowledge were influenced by negative and positive news stories about immigrants in the campaign. Well-informed people were resistant to the effects of positive and news portrayals of immigrants.

AB  - Domestic violence is a widespread issue, with victims suffering emotional and physical harm and severe cases resulting in homicide. Media presentation of these extreme instances may affect public opinion and related policies. The current study considered the portrayal of domestic homicides in Canadian print news, using articles published in the Vancouver Sun between 2004 and 2015. A content analysis shows domestic homicides were portrayed as isolated incidents and perpetuated the notions of victim blaming and offender excusing, rather than as connected to a pattern of domestic violence. This portrayal may affect how domestic violence and homicides are perceived and addressed.

AB  - This paper examines the public relations battles in the US media over Mexico's Union Nacional Sinarquista (UNS), an explicitly Catholic social movement founded in 1937 that aimed to restore the Church to its traditional role in Mexican society and to reject the reforms of the revolutionary government. The sinarquistas shared many of the features of fascism and Nazism, the major global antidemocratic movements of the time, including a strident nationalism, authoritarian leanings, an emphasis on martial discipline and strict organizational structure, and a militant aesthetic. Both its ideological leanings and rapid growth (as many as 500,000 members by the early 1940s) led many US writers to suggest that the UNS represented a dangerous fifth-column threat to both Mexico and the United States. Others, particularly in the Catholic press, saw the UNS as an anticommunist organization that could actually help foster democracy in Mexico. For their part, UNS leaders defended themselves vociferously and sought to build relationships with influential US Catholics who could advocate for them in the press. By analyzing this debate, this paper both underscores the transnational characteristics of the UNS and highlights the crucial role of US public opinion in Mexican politics during the 1940s.

AB  - As part of a multi-year, $816 million initiative to assess the risks posed by thousands of commonly used chemicals and compounds, Canada became the first country in the world to declare that bisphenol A (BPA) was toxic and justified regulation in April 2008. The process set up to conduct this risk assessment differed from the previous Canadian experience with the regulation of hazardous substances in that it was more formal, systematic and more pluralistic with much greater participation from interest groups. This case study explores the politics and process behind this decision and argues that the government's decision went beyond what scientific evidence could justify. The decision resulted from long-term institutional factors such as the incentive structure of Canadian federalism and values embedded in legislation as well as short-term factors such as media coverage, public opinion and interest group pressure.

KW  - CHOICE
AB  - Objectives and Importance of study: News media portrayal of public health issues influences public opinion, policy action and decision making. This study aimed to analyse the use of 'nanny state' frames in Australian news media coverage: identify the stakeholders invoking this frame: determine which public health-related policies attract such framing; and investigate whether 'nanny state' framing is directly challenged in news coverage.
   Study type: A qualitative framing analysis.
   Methods: Articles featuring the term 'nanny state' that were published in Australian print newspapers during matched periods between March and September in 2017 and 2018 were sourced through Factiva, coded and analysed for content and 'nanny state' framing. Content analysis was used to identify any public health-related issues that the terminology nanny state was applied to, and who was portrayed as imposing the nanny state. Frame analysis was used to analyse what meanings are co-presented with the phrase nanny state.
   Results: Out of 81 print newspaper articles that included the term 'nanny state', 19% linked the term to restricting personal choice or creating dissatisfaction with too many health-related rules and regulations broadly, across a range of issues, including: bike helmets, e-cigarettes, firearm restrictions, seatbelts, pool fences and smoking bans. The next most frequent links were to regulations on alcohol (17%), road safety (14%), obesity-related issues (7%) and tobacco control (6%). Of the 81 articles, 53% appeared in news publications owned by News Corporation Australia, 20% in Fairfax Media (Nine Entertainment) publications, 17% in Daily Mail and General Trust and 10% in publications owned by other organisations. Governments were the entity most frequently framed as imposing the nanny state. Most nanny state framings (73%) were negative towards public health controls and focused on policies and regulations. Nanny state was portrayed as an assault on freedom and choice (14%) and used to attack proponents of nanny state controls (11%), while few articles framed the nanny state (7%) in a favourable light.
   Conclusions: 'Nanny state' is a rhetorical device commonly used in Australian news media that may contribute to discrediting of the regulation of a range of health-related issues. News Corp publications are a major propagator of nanny state rhetoric in Australian newspaper media. Public health advocates are not commonly represented within nanny state debates within the news media.

KW  - public opinion
KW  - political knowledge
AB  - As concerns about the spread of political misinformation have mounted, scholars have found that fact-checks can reduce the extent to which people believe misinformation. Whether this finding extends to social media is unclear. Social media is a high-choice environment in which the cognitive effort required to separate truth from fiction, individuals' penchant for select exposure, and motivated reasoning all may render fact-checks ineffective. Furthermore, large social media companies have largely refrained from permitting external researchers to administer experiments on their platforms. To investigate whether fact-checking can rebut misinformation on social media, we administer two experiments on large, nationally representative samples using a novel platform designed to mimic Facebook's news feed. We observe corrections having large effects on factual beliefs (.62 on a five-point scale, p <.001). While misinformation degrades accuracy, our results offer strong evidence that fact-checks increase accuracy, even when tested on realistic simulations of social media platforms.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are deeply embedded within the socio-political landscape of India. NGOs were instituted by the Indian government specifically for the purpose of nation-building at the time of national independence in 1947 (Muttalib, 1987). In recent times however, NGOs have come under much scrutiny because of the expanding neoliberal agenda, and global discourse surrounding NGOs often involves questions of accountability. Communication scholars have studied NGOs in various contexts, but what remains unexplored is the question of how NGOs are portrayed within the media, which in contemporary society constitutes the public sphere or space of public opinion. It is important to look at the media because public legitimacy can have serious consequences for an NGO's ability to garner funds, influence policy, and build trust in beneficiary communities. This study thus asks the research question: How are NGOs framed in the Indian media? A qualitative analysis was employed to identify news frames or 'interpretive packages' used to talk about NGOs in two of the most widely-circulated English daily newspapers in India. The analysis identified four frames: the 'do-good' frame, protest frame, partner frame, and the public accountability frame. The findings show that, for the most part, NGOs are represented in a positive and even a nationalistic light, in spite of the larger global discourse interrogating NGO practices. The discussion elaborates on institutional, political, and historical reasons why NGOs are portrayed favorably in the newspapers.

AB  - This study seeks to improve election forecasting by supplementing polling data with online information-seeking behavior trends as an indicator of public opinion. Aggregate trends of demonstrations of interest or engagement have been shown to accurately predict behavior trends and reflect public opinion. Further, because traditional poll-based predictions are inherently undermined by self-reporting biases and the intention-behavior disconnect, we can expect that information-seeking trends on widely used social media-as an autonomous and unobtrusive indicator of relative levels of public opinion-can help correct for some of this error and explain unique, additional variance in election results. We advance the literature by using data from Wikipedia pageviews along with polling data in a synthesized model based on the results of the 2008, 2010, and 2012 US Senate general elections. Results show that Wikipedia pageviews data significantly add to the ability of polland fundamentals-based projections to predict election results up to 28 weeks prior to Election Day, and benefit predictions most at those early points, when poll-based predictions are weakest.

AB  - The recovery of California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) populations is an environmental success story, but it has created new challenges given their interactions with sport fisherman. Economic losses to the Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) stems both from the loss of fish, as well as the costs of fuel and time spent traveling to new fishing areas to avoid pinnipeds. Management solutions require a firm understanding of the public's perceptions of an issue. To address this shortcoming, we surveyed recreational anglers' perceptions of California sea lions and conducted a content analysis of media coverage of California sea lions in Southern Californian newspapers. We found that as anglers' knowledge of California sea lions increased, their subjective knowledge of the Marine Mammal Protection Act increased as well and they were less likely to advocate the use of lethal removal to manage sea lion issues. Avid fishers were more likely to consider shooting all sea lions as acceptable, and less likely to view controls to restrict human activity from sea lion areas as favorable. Anglers that expressed negative sentiments after an interaction with sea lions while fishing were more likely to view punishing the sea lion favorably, but less likely to view exposing the sea lions to pain as favorable. Our content analysis showed that most articles were about tourism and entertainment and the majority of articles focused on negative effects to sea lions. The media's framing might obscure the successful recovery of California sea lions and flame growing management concerns with stakeholders like anglers, dock workers, and marina occupants. Our survey showed that among stakeholders, increased understanding of the animals increased understanding of the regulatory context of their recovery and repellents as a socially acceptable means of managing the conflict. Thus, we have shown that knowledge among the public and stakeholders will enhance management efforts. Conservation management professionals can influence public attitudes by interacting with the media as well as using communications strategies that highlight the ecological mechanisms behind the conflict as well as the management actions.

AB  - Academic research on White Australia Policy and the Colombo Plan has spanned across the history of Asian migration, policy-making initiatives and Australia-India relations. But the role of popular transnational media images and stories that informs the sociocultural understanding of these relations has been under evaluated. In this article, using newspaper reports and notes of the tours, I highlight the building of popular perceptions under the Colombo Plan (1950-1957). By focusing on Indian journalists and editors, E. P. W. da Costa, J. N. Sahni, Frank Moraes, and Durga Das, this article contributes to the historiography of Australian-Indian relations. As these culture exchanges created a dialogue between the two countries that still influences the public opinion. The article concludes that journalists from both India and Australia sought to play a key role in image-making process and wanted a fresh start in relationship--politically, economically, sociologically and technologically.

AB  - Whereas electoral support for new-rightist parties is often understood as driven by ethnocentric anti-immigrant sentiments, scholars have noted that new-rightist politicians have, surprisingly, stressed culturally progressive arguments in the last decade. Using recent Dutch survey data (N = 1,302) especially collected for this purpose, the article analyses the electoral relevance of three types of cultural progressiveness for voting for the new right and their relation to the well-documented anti-immigrant agenda. The analysis shows that neither moral progressiveness nor aversion to public interference of religious orthodoxy underlies the new-rightist vote. Support for freedom of speech proves relevant, but, in accordance with literature on the new right's electoral strategy and with theorising on framing, this only leads towards the new right among those who are ethnocentric. These findings are discussed in the light of electoral competition, and questions for further research are formulated.

AB  - Genetic Modification (GM) has been a topic of public debates during the 1990s and 2000s. In this paper we explore the relative importance of two hypothesized explanations for these controversies: (i) people's general attitude toward science and technology and (ii) their trust in governance, in GM actors, and in GM regulations, in explaining the Dutch public's Attitude toward GM applications, and in addition to that, the public's GM Information seeking behaviour. This will be conducted through the application of representative survey methodology. The results indicate that Attitudes toward GM applications are best predicted by both the attitude toward science and technology and three trust measures. GM information seeking is predicted by gender and educational level, as well as attitude toward science and technology, trust in organisations and trust in regulations (negative). Overall, psychological variables seem better predictors than demographics. Implications for future research on information seeking behaviour are discussed.

AB  - Background: This experimental study tests effects of exposure to video narratives about successful symptom relief with Medical Cannabis (MC) on attitudes, beliefs, and intentions related to recreational cannabis use.
   Methods: Patient video testimonials were modeled after those found in extant media coverage. Israeli participants (N = 396) recruited through an online survey company were randomly assigned to view a narrative or a non-narrative video containing equivalent information about MC. Video content was further manipulated based on whether the protagonist had a stigmatized disease or not, and whether attribution of responsibility for his disease was internal or external.
   Results: Exposure to patient testimonials indirectly increased positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use through changing attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to MC. Furthermore, exposure to narratives in which the patient was presented as not to blame for contracting his illness (external attribution) was associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions toward MC, a factor that was significantly associated with more positive attitudes, beliefs and intentions related to recreational cannabis use.
   Conclusions: These results suggest that narrative news media coverage of MC may influence public attitudes toward recreational cannabis. Because such media stories continue to be commonplace, it is important to examine potential spillover effects of this coverage on public perceptions of recreational cannabis. Cannabis prevention programs should address the role of media coverage in shaping public opinion and address the distinction between medical and recreational cannabis use.

AB  - In the last few years, research studies and opinion pieces have tried to account for the new polarisation and dealignment of US politics after Trump and the post-Brexit UK politics. It is now well-established both by academic research and by Facebook's own research that Facebook leads to more polarisation in its users' political views, but rhetorical analysis has not yet accounted for the role played by algorithms in political communication and persuasion. What does social media do to rhetoric? The situation of speech in social media is often treated like in a public sphere when it should not be. This misconception prevents rhetorical studies to take into consideration the question of technology. By using the recent literature in critical algorithm studies, I develop a new approach in rhetorical criticism. I argue here that the increasing agency that algorithms have acquired in delivering and mediating rhetoric means that we must consider the role played by intermediaries when examining rhetorical situations. This paper sheds light on what I call the four conditionalities of algorithms on rhetoric: (1) programmed speech content, (2) the verticalisation of political communication, (3) the new biases produced by digital media, and (4) the rhetorical machine learning.

AB  - The news media help shape society's perception of social problems as well as public opinion of victims and offenders. Currently, there is extensive research devoted to the media's portrayal of violence against women but very little examination of femicide (for purposes of this research, defined as the murder of female intimate partners). Using newspaper coverage of femicide cases across the state of North Carolina over a 6-year period (995 articles representing 299 cases), the current study examines the news media's use of direct and indirect victim-blaming language, the sources cited in femicide reporting, and whether femicide cases are contextualized as an individual problem or within the broader social issue of intimate partner violence (IPV). Consistent with previous research, findings indicate that public sources (i.e., law enforcement) were the most commonly cited sources of information in news coverage of femicide compared to private sources (i.e., friends and family); however, domestic violence experts are cited more often than in prior studies. In addition, direct and indirect victim-blaming language is not as pervasive as previous research has suggested. Finally, the percentage of articles that contextualized the femicide as IPV is lower than that found in prior studies of femicide. Implications of these findings and future research are discussed.

AB  - How does a chief executive officer (CEO)'s social media content disclosure on Twitter affect perceived CEO attributes, relationship investment, and public engagement, and to what extent does the CEO's gender (male vs. female) moderate how publics evaluate content disclosures? A 2 (CEO gender: male vs. female) x 4 (level of disclosure: 100% corporate vs. 70% corporate and 30% personal vs. 30% corporate and 70% personal vs. 100% personal disclosure) between-subject experimental design was used to address these questions with a random sample of 465 adult Twitter users in the United States. Results showed that posts that featured high personal disclosure did not increase the perceived likability or competence of the CEO. Nor did CEO gender impact these outcomes. However, CEO professional disclosure proved to be an effective means to gain high levels of perceived relationship investment from publics. Finally, publics may hold implicit gender bias in cognitive (i.e., perceived relationship investment) and behavioral evaluation (i.e., engagement intention) of a female CEO.

AB  - In media effects research a fundamental choice is often made between (field) experiments or observational studies that rely on survey data in combination with data about the information environment or media coverage. Such studies linking survey data and media content data are often dubbed "linkage studies." On the one hand, such designs are the state of the art in our field and on the other hand, they come with a long list of challenges and choices. This article reviews the rationales for linkage studies, outlines different types of linkage studies, reviews the state-of-the-art in this area, discusses which survey and content items to use in an analysis, reviews different types of analyses, outlines considerations for alternative specifications, and provides a step-by-step example.

AB  - This research introduces a methodological framework for a valid and reliable analysis of both media and interpretation frames. It responds to recent calls in literature (1) to acknowledge the social-cultural context and power relations underlying framing, (2) to consider frames as a cluster of frame-elements, and (3) to identify interpretation frames and media frames using a similar analytical approach to ensure a valid comparison of the outcomes of both interrelated framing processes. The methodological framework was applied to three studies. Results show that the discrepancy between interpretation frames and media frames revolved around the distinction between bottom-up and top-down frames. The introduced method provides meaningful insights into the complete framing process of both the sender and receiver of communication messages.

AB  - Inflation is a monetary policy outcome, but in the short to medium term, price and wage decisions are co-determined by the public and private sectors. Many central banks have adopted transparency as a strategic policy approach, whereby communication of monetary policy goals is used as a public anchor. While the central bank's strategy involves carefully crafted, deliberately simplified messages, most of the public tends to access inflation-related information through the media. In this article, we examine South African newspaper articles to identify how inflation is presented in the media and the role of the media, through this presentation, in the process of shaping public opinion around inflation expectations. We do this in two ways. First, we examine how inflation is presented in the media and then we identify the various actors presented in the media, their positions on inflation, and how these relate to each other. The systematic analysis of the media's presentation of inflation allows us to identify some challenges to the central bank's communication strategy.

AB  - This study examined the influence of defendant race and race salience (manipulated via racially charged media) on Canadian mock jurors' judgements. Two hundred ten jury-eligible Canadian online participants read a racially charged (general or specific to the defendant's race) or neutral article followed by a trial transcript that involved dangerous operation of a motor vehicle and impaired driving charges against a White, Black, or Indigenous defendant. Diverging from previous findings, this study did not find effects of defendant race or race salience on verdict judgements or causal attributions. However, when race is not a central feature of the case, making race salient outside the trial may increase levels of racial bias for some mock jurors. When the defendant was Black, a race-specific article appeared to backfire, producing the harshest sentencing recommendation compared to race-neutral and general race articles. Conversely, for the Indigenous defendant, any mention of race produced harsher recommended sentences relative to no mention of race. Results do not seem to parallel those found in U.S. race-salience studies. Rather, this specific race-salience technique may be detrimental to a minority defendant's case in a Canadian context.

AB  - Background: Various countries and states, including Israel, have recently legalized cannabis for therapeutic purposes (CTP). These changes have received mass media coverage and prompted national and international dialogue about the status of cannabis and whether or not it can be defined as a (legitimate) medicine, illicit and harmful drug, or both. News media framing may influence, and be influenced by, public opinion regarding CTP and support for CTP license provisions for patients. This study examines the framing of CTP in Israeli media coverage and the association between media coverage and trends in the provision of CTP licenses in Israel over time.
   Methods: All published news articles relevant to CTP and the framing of cannabis (N=214) from the three highest circulation newspapers in Israel were content analyzed. Articles were published between January 2007 and June 2013, a period in which CTP licenses granted by the Ministry of Health increased substantially.
   Results: In the majority of CTP news articles (69%), cannabis was framed as a medicine, although in almost one third of articles (31%) cannabis was framed as an illicit drug. The relative proportion of news items in which cannabis was framed as an illicit drug fluctuated during the study period, but was unrelated to linear or curvilinear trends in CTP licensing.
   Conclusion: The relatively large proportion of news items framing cannabis as a medicine is consistent with growing support for the expansion of the Israel's CTP program. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose - Social media has become an important part of daily interpersonal communication in contemporary society. The purpose of this paper is to explore the attitudes of UK consumers by identifying the hidden information in tweets, and provide a framework which can assist industry practitioners in managing social media data.
   Design/methodology/approach - Using a large-scale dataset of tweets relating to the Horsemeat scandal of 2013, a comprehensive data analysis framework, which comprises multidimensional scaling and sentiment analysis, alongside other methods, was applied to explore customers' opinions.
   Findings - Making jokes in social media was a main trend in the tweets relating to Tesco during the Horsemeat scandal. Consumer sentiments were overall negative and burgers were the most mentioned product in the week-long period after the story broke. The posting of tweets was correlated with the timing of news coverage, which indicates that the traditional media is still crucial to public opinion formation.
   Practical implications - This paper presents a progressive tweet-mining framework that can serve as a tool for academia and practitioners in crisis management. The proposed framework indicates the significant importance of timely categorising the topics, identifying the sentiment of tweets and understanding the changes of consumer opinions over time in a crisis.
   Originality/value - The research presented in this paper is one of the limited social media research to focus on a UK food fraud issue and adds to the limited body of literature investigating consumer social media use from the side of industry practitioners.

AB  - Parties can significantly influence their supporters' policy views via endorsement cues, raising worries about manipulation of mass opinion. We bring attention to a novel constraint on party influence: information implying that the party adopted its position due to the lobbying efforts of interest groups and campaign donors. Party cue taking is significantly reduced across three survey experiment when this type of information is presented alongside a party endorsement cue. This attenuation in cue taking occurred both when the party adopted a stereotypical as well as a counterstereotypical policy position and both when ideologically aligned and nonaligned groups were the source of lobbyist influence. Moreover, partisans were less likely to follow the party line even though they still believed the party's policy arguments to be superior to opposing arguments and that the policy would yield positive outcomes. Our results suggest a novel and common limit on partisan influence.

AB  - Looking at mediated, political and wider public discourses on immigration in Poland since 2015 and exploring these in the context of the country's right-wing populist politics, the paper develops a multi-step normalisation model which allows analysing how radical or often blatantly racist discourse can not only be strategically introduced into the public domain but also evolve into an acceptable and legitimate perspective inperceptions of immigrants and refugees. The paper highlights the strategic as well as opportunistic introduction of anti-immigration rhetoric in/by the political mainstream in Poland in recent years, often on the back of the so-called post-2014 European "Refugee Crisis". It explores normalisation as part and parcel of a wider multistep process of strategically orchestrateddiscursive shiftswherein discourses characterised by extreme positions have beenenacted, gradated/perpetuated and eventually normalisedas an integral part of pronounced right-wing populist agenda. The paperfurthers a view that normalisation entails the creation and sustainment of a peculiarborderline discoursewherein unmitigated radical statements are often married with seemingly civil and apparently politically correct language and argumentation. The latter are used topre-/legitimiseuncivil or even outright radical positions and ideologies by rationalising them and making them into acceptable elements of public discourse.

AB  - Existing research on conflict framing in the news-media has focused disproportionately on political-party membership, where prior polarization between party elites implies strong pre-existing differences of opinion. To determine whether conflict framing can elicit polarization in the context of other important social identities, we compare the polarizing effects of conflict framing along partisan versus gender lines. In two experimental studies using different samples-i.e., college students (Study 1) and adult U.S. citizens (Study 2)-we found that framing news in terms of gender conflict polarized participants along gender lines. Moreover, polarization emerged primarily via increased self-stereotyping rather than gender-based motivated reasoning or increased gender-based animus. Importantly, this polarizing effect of gender-based conflict framing was not smaller than that of partisan conflict framing. The implications of our findings are discussed in light of work on media framing, social identity, and the formation of public opinion.

AB  - How do counterterrorism policies in the United States reproduce anti-Black racism? Research on U.S. domestic counterterrorism post-9/11 has largely focused on the experiences of Muslim Americans while marginalising both overlapping and separate effects of counterterrorism policy on non-Muslim people of colour, particularly non-Muslim Black communities. I argue that domestic counterterrorism policy, as an act of determining what kinds of political contention the state finds non-threatening, has roots in the historical treatment of Black resistance and continues to derive power and legitimacy from oppressing Black communities. Using the case of the Black Liberation Army and its members, I show that federal counterterrorism institutions were shaped by opposition to Black liberation, alongside more well-studied threads of xenophobia and Islamophobia. This article thus extends understandings of discrimination and prejudice within the U.S. counterterrorism apparatus and advocates for greater attention to anti-Blackness not only in policing but in security institutions more broadly.

AB  - The Sewol ferry tragedy was a major event in South Korea in 2014. This study examines the agenda-setting links between a Korean online newscast (Naver) and a Korean online community (Daum). Although each portal initially focused on different crisis attributes and stakeholders regarding the ferry tragedy, their agendas became more alike over time. Notably, the cross-lagged analysis shows significant influence of the online community (Daum) on the online newscast (Naver).

TI  - Interpretations of Jane Austen's Irony on Screen and in Translations: A Comparison of Some Samples
T2  - WOMENS WRITING
LA  - English
AB  - Whether adored or ignored Jane Austen's ironic narrative voice poses a challenge, at times amounting to a stumbling block, in the history of her reception. The present essay will discuss some selected samples of this voice and how it is interpreted in translations as well as film and television. The material for this discussion consists of two novels, Pride and Prejudice and Mansfield Park, their altogether seven screen adaptations, as well as five Norwegian translations of the first. This constellation will show that receivers of Austen's texts struggle with similar challenges in grasping or rendering her ironic commentary, whether in a new language or a new medium.

AB  - With the rapid development of online social networks, increasing amounts of user generated content are posted online. While information is overwhelming a site, readers actually prefer fully reading some influential articles or information rather than glancing sequentially at every article on a forum. In this paper, we propose techniques for forecasting public responses to articles shortly after the articles are published. Our proposal identifies the important articles from two perspectives: frequent discussion and extreme acceptance or rejection by the online public. We also discuss approaches for distinguishing influentia(l) authors who are popular and receive consistently high ratings from online users. To verify our methodologies, we analyzed a popular social forum in Taiwan during three large-scale social events, a social movement and two national election campaigns. Our results demonstrate that our methodologies achieve high accuracy with significant time reduction and outperform previous methodologies in distinguishing notable articles and authors on social forums.

AB  - Introduction Approximately 10 million people in Brazil have some hearing impairment. Because of the natural progression of hearing impairment to presbycusis, coupled with the increasing number of young people exposed to the risk factors for early hearing loss, the social impact of hearing impairment is high. Objective A team of otolaryngologists and speech therapists conducted an unprecedented worldwide campaign in the primary health sector, aiming to reduce the global burden of hearing impairment with preventive measures. Methods A cultural information campaign called "Ear Parade" was developed. It lasted 3 months, during which SAo Paulo received information on the prevention of deafness and the importance of hearing rehabilitation to reduce prejudice against the use of hearing aids. Results The information was relayed through an art exhibition of public paintings, including 62 sculptures of ears, 2.40 meters high, which colored the city, elucidating the beauty of hearing. The media coverage impacted 170 million people, and at the end of the campaign, a nongovernmental organization was established to raise resources for hearing rehabilitation. In addition, an auction of the ear sculptures raised money toward hearing aid batteries and stem-cell research for hearing. Conclusion The present paper presents the effects of this campaign. Information dissemination is a powerful preventive measure for the primary healthcare system to reduce future treatment expenditures.

AB  - Popular news media play an instrumental role in shaping public perception of issues like the opioid crisis. Using a detailed coding instrument, we analyzed how opioid-related scholarly publications were covered in 149 news stories published by nine major US and Canadian online news outlets at the height of the crisis. We find that a small proportion of available studies receive coverage, mostly within issue-focused rather than science communication news stories. While most studies are framed as established "facts," stories rarely provide sufficient information for news consumers to critically evaluate the validity of the research. Potential implications for science communication and public perception of the opioid crisis are discussed.

AB  - The usage of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, either by the public or by organizations, has been rapidly increasing. The decision-makers in the organizations use social media to engage with their customers since public users tend to express their opinions about certain products and services through this popular mechanism. Hence, this valuable data can be useful for marketing and business decisions. However, the main obstacle is obtaining meaningful information from these platforms due to the unstructured data they present. Sentiment analysis is seen as the best tool to analyze insights or opinions in this huge amount of data. In this article, we extract data on public opinion about property in order to understand the reason behind the imbalances of supply and demand currently faced by the property industry in Malaysia. In addition, we visualized the sentiment results in the form of a dashboard so that it may help property players to understand the public sentiments toward their housing or construction projects.

AB  - By incorporating social representation theory with science communication and by using a critical milestone scientific crisis (i.e., the scandal of Chinese gene-edited human babies in 2018) as a dividing point, this study adopted a network agenda-setting approach to explore how various actors (i.e., scientists, the media, laypeople, and the government) engaged in the construction of social representations of the controversial issue of gene editing on Chinese social media (i.e., Sina Weibo). Based on large-scale social media data, supervised machine learning was employed to identify attribute categories, and semantic network analysis was used to construct attribute networks. Results reveal that after the 2018 crisis, gene editing received increasing social attention on Chinese social media. Further, two trends emerged in social representations of gene editing on social media: de-scientization and medialization. The following dynamic agenda interactions among various actors were found: On the one hand, the media and laypeople's attribute network agendas converged while scientists and the media's diverged after the scandal. This indicates a scientific crisis can serve as a trigger for agenda convergence and divergence among different actors online. On the other hand, there were constant agenda interactions, such as between the Chinese government and the media. This reveals a feature of Chinese science communication-the media not only mediates between scientists and the public, it also observes the government's agenda closely when representing controversial scientific issues such as gene editing.

AB  - The Shanghai New Year's Eve stampede on 31 December 2014, caused 36 deaths and 47 other injuries, generating attention from around the world. This research aims to explore crowd aggregation from the perspective of Sina Weibo check-in data and evaluate the potential of crowd detection based on social media data. We develop a framework using Weibo check-in data in three dimensions: the aggregation level of check-in data, the topic changes in posts and the sentiment fluctuations of citizens. The results show that the numbers of check-ins in all of Shanghai on New Years' Eve is twice that of other days and that Moran's I reaches a peak on this date, implying a spatial autocorrelation mode. Additionally, the results of topic modeling indicate that 72.4% of the posts were related to the stampede, reflecting public attitudes and views on this incident from multiple angles. Moreover, sentiment analysis based on Weibo posts illustrates that the proportion of negative posts increased both when the stampede occurred (40.95%) and a few hours afterwards (44.33%). This study demonstrates the potential of using geotagged social media data to analyze population spatiotemporal activities, especially in emergencies.

AB  - Media contain various cues to opinions of others and therefore serve as an important source of information about the climate of opinion. We distinguish explicit cues directly describing opinion distributions in society, from implicit cues lacking such a direct reference. In an experiment, we examined the relative impact of survey data (explicit cue) and arguments (implicit cue) on climate of opinion judgments. While survey results strongly affected assessments, argumentation had an effect only when no survey information was available. However, arguments produced an indirect effect, as they strongly affected personal opinions, which in turn influenced climate of opinion judgments (projection).

AB  - Contemporary news often spreads via social media. This study investigated whether the processing and evaluation of online news content can be influenced by Likes and peer-user comments. An online experiment was designed, using a custom-built website that resembled Facebook, to explore how Likes, positive comments, negative comments, or a combination of positive and negative comments would affect the reader's processing of news content. The results showed that especially negative comments affected the readers' personal opinions about the news content, even in combination with other positive comments: They (1) induced more negative attitudes, (2) lowered intent to share it, (3) reduced agreement with conveyed ideas, (4) lowered perceived attitude of the general public, and (5) decreased the credibility of the content. Against expectations, the presence of Likes did not affect the readers, irrespective of the news content. An important consideration is that, while the negative comments were persuasive, they comprised subjective, emotive, and fallacious rhetoric. Finally, negativity bias, the perception of expert authority, and cognitive heuristics are discussed as potential explanations for the persuasive effect of negative comments.

AB  - This study tests whether the consequences of cross-cutting exposure (CCE) to political news on affective polarization depend on the type of media individuals consume. Findings from the 2020 American National Election Studies panel data suggest that CCE to cable TV news, a medium frequently described as uncivil, may increase negative affect toward the out-party candidate, and that such effect may be mediated by feelings of anger and certainty in one's political attitudes. These insights draw attention to elite incivility, in addition to citizens' partisan predispositions, as a potential contributor to the growing affective divide in American politics.

AB  - Disdain for empirical science has a long history dating back to eighteenth-century debates about the Earth's surface formation. Scientific debates over global catastrophic flooding and the Earth's geologic age were resolved by the mid-nineteenth century, but subsequent nonscientific debates about the Earth's age and biological evolution spawned a distrust of science that hardened in the twentieth century. Disregard for science grew in the United States with abandonment of science-based policy by government and manipulation of public opinion by social media. Consequently, climate change denial was readily accepted by a preconditioned antiscience culture. Expansion of antiscience sentiment led to rejection of conventional news outlets and information verification in a "post-truth" era in which alternate realities are acceptable despite clear contradictions with observable facts. Critical reasoning and vetting of information are in decline, which leaves democracy vulnerable to manipulation. Reliable information is available but obscured by disinformation. Public scrutiny of information and demand for fact checking and reporting of sources are essential given growth of alternative media that have no checks on the verity of content. Academics should get involved in popular media to counter propaganda and to reconstruct a culture of critical reasoning by voters and science-based decisions by policymakers.

However, studies on local elections do not yet generally take the effect of the media environment into account. This article posits that the territorial fit between newspaper markets and municipal boundaries makes citizens' exposure to locally relevant news more likely. We use fine-grained data on newspaper readership in order to assess the effect of the territorial structure of the newspaper market on turnout in municipal elections in Switzerland. The analysis shows that newspaper audience in a municipality and the congruence of newspaper markets with municipal territories both have substantial positive effects on levels of turnout in municipal elections. The findings suggest that future research on local political behavior should better acknowledge the influence of the media environment - which can be adequately measured by newspaper audience and congruence. Implications are that current structural changes in the media system bear threats to local democracy via the territorial upscaling of media markets.

AB  - Objective. We examine levels of racial resentment among white Millennial youth. In addition, we explore the individual-level determinants of racial resentment among this group, with specific attention given to the potential role of political socialization and social media. Methods. Using a national survey of parents and children collected in October 2012 immediately prior to the U.S. presidential election, we examine the individual-level predictors of racial resentment among white respondents (n = 613) who are 18 years old and younger. We test several competing explanations of racial resentment among Millennial youth, including demographic differences, traditional media use, social media use, general societal views, and levels of racial resentment among parents. Results. Our findings suggest that white American Millennial youth may be slightly more racially progressive than their parents, and parental racial attitudes remain strong predictors of youth racial attitudes. In addition, some forms of social media may help to reduce levels of racial resentment.

AB  - The Ebola virus had only been in the United States for 2 months before it became a major national health concern. However, while some citizens panicked about the looming health crisis, others remained calm, offering explanations for why a rapid spread of the virus was unlikely. Examining the distinctions between these different reactions can contribute to a better understanding of the coping strategies citizens use when facing a health crisis. We consider how citizens respond to fear by focusing on whether or not hyperbolic rhetoric was used as a means for processing and managing fear. Approximately 400 tweets and Facebook posts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the White House, andThe Alex Jones Showwere examined to make conclusions about how citizens respond to messages from these mediated forums. At the intersection of health communication and critical rhetoric, we advance an operational definition of health hyperbolism derived from public response to opinion leaders. Ultimately, we find that health hyperbolism contains language illustrative of distrust, blame, anger, misrepresentation, conspiracy, and curiosity.

AB  - Scholars have long analyzed the influence of combat casualties on public support for war. However, the mechanisms through which casualtiesparticularly local casualtiesaffect wartime opinion formation have received much less attention. We employ a novel survey experiment to test three mechanisms that might explain previously observed cleavages in war support between residents of high- and low-casualty communities. We find that subjects who read a news story concerning a casualty from their home state were significantly more likely to oppose the war in Afghanistan than were subjects who read an identically worded news story in which the fallen soldier was not identified as being from the respondent's home state. Moreover, this difference emerged regardless of whether the story followed the coverage patterns and emphasis typical of national or local media reporting. We conclude that the local connections triggered by learning of a home-state casualty, not the emotionally charged nature of local media reporting, is most responsible for generating opinion cleavages observed in previous research.

AB  - This article provides a summary of research undertaken to investigate public awareness and understanding of human trafficking in Great Britain, Hungary and Ukraine. Responding to the lack of reliable empirical data on this issue, the research relies on representative national opinion surveys to assess the extent of public awareness of what constitutes human trafficking, the sources of knowledge underpinning this awareness, and respondents' attitudes towards key dimensions of human trafficking as embedded in international and respective national legal and policy frameworks and discourses. Conceptually, this article reinforces recent calls for policy and media paradigm shifts from understanding human trafficking as a phenomenon of crime and victimhood, to, above all, a human rights concern linked to the broader issues of sustainable development and social justice. Methodologically, the study highlights the role of opinion surveys as a measure of effectiveness and impact of anti-trafficking awareness campaigns. In practical terms, the article presents a set of data which can be useful for policy-makers, anti-trafficking activists, and national media in designing impactful awareness-raising campaigns and interventions.

AB  - The emerging social media serves as a complementary source for consumer behavior analysis with spontaneous data it generates. However, most studies employ time-consuming content analysis or lexical sentiment analysis. Considering the richness of data and progress of data science, in this paper, we propose a transfer learning based method to explore public attitudes towards alternative meat (AM) using data from social media in China to provide an alternative perspective. We compare traditional machine learning models: Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine with our BERT-based Alternative Meat (BAM) model on the annotated sample. BAM model outperforms others in terms of macro F1 score and accuracy and is employed on the whole dataset later. The sentiment analysis result shows that among 41782 related posts we accumulated, about 42.10% of posts are personal posts consisting of negative, neutral, and positive feelings towards AM with a proportion of 28.77%, 22.91%, and 48.32% respectively. It is less promising compared with the consensus previous studies reach that over half of the Chinese people are positive and few Chinese are negative towards AM. Our findings add to the blooming body of studies suggesting the relationship of people's willingness to try or purchase AM and factors including gender, geography, price, veganism, and food safety. Conspiracy theory is identified for the first time as the main reason for opposition to AM among Chinese consumers. Instead of the booster, traditional vegetarian substitutes especially tofu turn out to be an obstacle for accepting AM with much resemblances.

AB  - Objective: Opioid analgesic abuse is a complex and relatively new public health problem, and to date little is known about how the news media frame the issue.
   Methods: To better understand how this issue has been framed in public discourse, an analysis was conducted of the volume and content of news media coverage of opioid analgesic abuse over a 15-year period from 1998 to 2012 (N=673 news stories). A 70-item structured coding instrument was used to measure items in four domains that prior research suggests can influence public attitudes about health and social issues: causes, solutions, and consequences of the problem and individual depictions of persons who abuse opioid analgesics.
   Results: Although experts have deemed opioid analgesic abuse a public health crisis, results of our study suggest that the news media more often frame the problem as a criminal justice issue. The most frequently mentioned cause of the problem was illegal drug dealing, and the most frequently mentioned solutions were law enforcement solutions designed to arrest and prosecute the individuals responsible for diverting opioid analgesics onto the illegal market. Prevention-oriented approaches, such as prescription drug-monitoring programs, were mentioned more frequently in the latter years of the study period, but less than 5% of news stories overall mentioned expanding substance abuse treatment, and even fewer mentioned expanding access to evidence-based medication-assisted treatments, such as buprenorphine.
   Conclusions: Findings underscore the need for a concerted effort to reframe opioid analgesic abuse as a treatable condition addressable via well-established public and behavioral health approaches.

AB  - Objective. Work on economic news argues that U.S. coverage focuses primarily on changes rather than levels of future economic conditions; it also both affects and reflects public economic sentiment. Given that economic perceptions are related to policy preferences and government support, this is of consequence for politics. This article explores the generalizability of these findings. Methods. Using nearly 100,000 stories over 30 years in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, we compare media tone, public opinion, and economic conditions. Result. Analyses demonstrate that media tone and public opinion follow future economic change in all three countries. Media and opinion are also related, but the effect mostly runs from the public to the media, not the other way around. Conclusion. These results confirm the generalizability of prior findings, and the importance of considering more than a simple unidirectional link between media coverage and public economic sentiment.

AB  - This article examines the effect of historical transgressions associated with individuals' in-group on attribution of responsibility for the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. While the capacity of media frames to induce emotional states is well documented, the current study expands the understanding of the underlying processes associated with the framing effect by highlighting the ability of frames to induce collective-level emotions. Through an online experiment, we suggest that framing the attack in reference to American transgressions (abuses at the Abu Ghraib prison) initiated collective guilt, resulting in less attribution of responsibility for the attack to Islam and less support for anti-immigration policy in the United States. Conversely, framing the event in terms of American victimization (9/11 attack) engendered high levels of collective victimization, subsequently heightening the perceived responsibility of Islam in the attack and harnessing support for anti-immigration policy. Relevant moderators are considered, and practical and theoretical implications are discussed.

AB  - This essay traces a tradition in civil rights that begins with the NAACP's media campaign to fight unjust racial violence between 1909 and 1925, instead of with the education desegregation litigation of the 1950s and 1960s. I recover this earlier period by analyzing the activities of the NAACP's anti-lynching and mob violence reduction campaign during the first quarter of the 20th century. The organization's effort to secure African American equality centered on changing public opinion as the NAACP maintained that lynching could be stopped when it "reached the heart and conscience of the American people." In order to wage a battle against negative public perceptions, this essay describes how the NAACP executed a three-pronged media strategy focused on writing newspaper articles, publishing pamphlets, and printing its own magazine, The Crisis. By articulating the terror of lynching and broadcasting it to a wider audience through these different channels, the NAACP achieved considerable success in reframing the debate concerning African American criminality and American justice in a period overlooked by most scholars.
