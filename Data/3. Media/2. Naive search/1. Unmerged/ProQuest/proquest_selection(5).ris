T1  - Populist Words Speak Louder? Ideology-Inconsistent Personalization and Voting for Populist Candidates
AN  - 2617957962
AB  - The private background of populist politicians oftentimes seemingly contradicts the populist ideology—which can be taken up in political communication. Using two experiments (nStudy 1 = 734; nStudy 2 = 568), we investigate the effects of such ideology-inconsistent personalization on the evaluation of and voting for a populist candidate. We manipulate the politician’s localness and social class (Study 1) and traditionalism in family life (Study 2). Results reveal a number of effects on candidate evaluation which translated into voting intentions. An upper-class background of the populist politician yielded negative effects, but less so among populist voters. However, references to a cosmopolitan biography decreased perceived trustworthiness among all participants. Surprisingly, a nontraditional (i.e., homosexual) relationship was beneficial for a (female) populist.

T1  - The Effects of Populist Identity Framing on Populist Attitudes Across Europe: Evidence From a 15-Country Comparative Experiment
AN  - 2631533223
AB  - We investigate the effects of populist messages that (a) stress the centrality of “ordinary” people, (b) shift blame to the “corrupt” elites, or (c) combine people centrality and antielitist cues on 3 dimensions of populist attitudes: anti-elitism, homogeneous people, and popular sovereignty. We conducted an extensive 15-country experiment in which we manipulated populist communication as social identity frames (N = 7,271). Multilevel analyses demonstrate that messages stressing the centrality of the ordinary people activate all dimensions of populist attitudes. In contrast, anti-elite messages activate anti-elitism attitudes only for those individuals with lower levels of education and extreme positions on the ideological left–right spectrum. Our findings suggest that populist political communication plays a key role in activating populist attitudes across Europe.

T1  - Testing the GRIP: An Empirical Examination of the Gender Roles Inhibiting Prosociality Model
AN  - 2576388624
AB  - Although men and women help others, there are systematic gender differences in the type of helping they perform. Consistent with traditional gender roles and stereotypes, men typically help in agentic ways, and women typically help in communal ways. Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior, the Gender Roles Inhibiting Prosociality model predicts that gender stereotypes about gender-inconsistent helping create negative attitudes, restrictive subjective norms, and low self-efficacy that undermine helping intentions, which, in turn, reduce engagement in gender-inconsistent helping contexts. Across three studies (N = 1,355), we find empirical support for the hypothesized model: When asked to imagine engaging in a gender-inconsistent (vs. gender-consistent) helping scenario, participants anticipated feeling worse, expected others to judge them more negatively, and reported decreased self-efficacy beliefs, and these factors predicted lower intentions to engage in gender-inconsistent helping. Critically, behavioral intentions explained some of the variance in gender-inconsistent helping during the following month. Internal meta-analyses of the differences between gender-consistent and -inconsistent helping on attitudes, subjective norms, self-efficacy, and behavioral intentions across studies revealed small-to-medium average effect sizes (ds = 0.16—0.47). These results have the potential to inform interventions aimed at increasing helping in all its forms.

T1  - The ‘Scots porridge case’ of 1969: bogus discrimination, the loony state and the white backlash archive
AN  - 2673745297
AB  - In November 1969, a quite odd and ludicrous case of alleged discrimination was blown out of all proportion, perhaps wilfully, by Conservative politicians and the media in Britain, some eighteen months after Enoch Powell’s Birmingham speech. A quite high-profile issue at the time, the case has now been completely forgotten. Yet, Esteves’s article suggests that the event itself is helpful to make better sense of the British—rather than merely English—ramifications of debates on race relations and discrimination, particularly at a time of an upsurge in Scottish nationalism. More importantly, the case partakes of what Esteves calls the ‘white backlash archive’, a populist and popular repertoire that nativists—not only in Britain—draw from in order to underline that the state is inefficient and counter-productive when it tries to legislate against discrimination, as well as that ethnic minorities and immigrants get undue protection from the state authorities, even though the 1969 case itself had nothing to do with ethnic minorities or immigration.

T1  - “This is an American Newspaper”
AN  - 2516722489
AB  - In 1917, after the United States joined the war in Europe and was no longer politically neutral, on the American front, the German ethnic press became a target for censors and critics. The general assumption was that German language papers bred disloyalty among German immigrant communities and posed a threat to the United States’ war efforts. This study explores the editorial and political views of the German-language press during the summer of 1917 by assessing the tone of a sample of German language mainstream newspapers during July 1, 1917 through September 30, 1917. The findings show that the overall coverage was less loyal to Imperial Germany than had been argued by U.S. officials and censors. In an effort to assimilate, German immigrant newspapers widely published the U.S. government’s official position, showed support for the American war effort, and focused on cultural affairs of the immigrant community.

T1  - A Network Analysis of Global Trust Across 11 Democratic Countries
AN  - 2518671891
AB  - Trust is seen as a glue in modern societies that facilitates economic prosperity and political functioning (e.g., Fukuyama, 1995; Newton, 2001; Putnam, 2000; see a more critical view of trust in Warren, 1999). In this literature, there exists a conventional division between social and political trust, as they are believed to have different foundations (e.g., Uslaner, 2002, 2018) and therefore should be treated as distinct concepts. However, more recently, the interconnected nature of trust has been increasingly acknowledged: Newton, Stolle, and Zmerli (2018) argue that social and political trust are “closely tied together in a mutually reinforcing manner that underpins social harmony, economic efficiency, and democratic government” (Newton et al., 2018, p. 2; see also Newton & Zmerli, 2011). Consistent with this idea, Liu, Milojev, Gil de Zúñiga, and Zhang (2018) propose a Global Trust Inventory (GTI), which captures “a system...

AB  - This study examined interviewer gender effects on attitudes toward male and female journalists in a survey experiment in six Arab countries. Respondents (N = 5,040) in Jordan, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and UAE were read a scenario, by a male or female interviewer, of either a male or female journalist covering a political scandal, and were then asked about the journalist’s perceived credibility. Interviewer gender affected ratings of journalist conscientiousness in four of six countries (positively in Tunisia and UAE, and negatively in Jordan and Lebanon), and negatively affected knowledgeability ratings in Lebanon. Implications for research on media credibility, gender bias, and survey research are discussed.

T1  - A Picture Is Worth a Thousand Words. A Visual Test of Political Knowledge: Does It Reduce the Effect of Age and Gender?
AN  - 2518671076
AB  - Beyond any doubt, political knowledge is a crucial resource for citizens of democratic societies. It enables them to participate in politics in a more effective manner, and to identify more successfully the candidate and the political party that best represents her/his beliefs and preferences (Delli Carpini & Keeter, 1996). We also know from decades of accumulated research that there are strong and persistent inequalities in the level of political knowledge, based on gender, patterns of media use, education level, and age. A routine finding in this literature is that women, young people, and the lowly educated score systematically lower with regard to levels of political knowledge (Prior, 2005). Given the central role of political knowledge in political science research, it is all the more troublesome that currently there is no generally accepted standard to measure political knowledge in a reliable and balanced manner. In addition, there...

T1  - Concrete Examples of Abstract Others: Testing Exemplar Availability as an Additional Explanation for Third-Person Perceptions
AN  - 2476555085
AB  - Explanations for the third-person phenomenon generally hinge on either self-favoring biases or cognitive mechanisms. While controlling for common perceptual factors, we demonstrate an additional cognitive component: exemplar availability, using a 2-study design. The first considers the third-person perception in the context of media-generated stereotypes. The second considers 3 distinct types of advertisements meant to evoke varied third- and first-person perceptions. Results of both studies showed that the ability to think of examples serves as the most consistent predictor, even after accounting for the influence of perceived exposure and similarity.

T1  - Leadership as a Reflection of Who We Are: Social Identity, Media Portrayal, and Evaluations of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 U.S. Presidential Election
AN  - 2254204387
AB  - The 2016 U.S. Presidential election presented a unique opportunity to study gender and leadership. Using the social identity theory of leadership (Hogg 2001) as a guiding framework, we sought to understand the effect of social identities—gender and political affiliation—on voters’ evaluations of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton in this election. We surveyed 440 participants’ attitudes toward female leaders, political affiliation, level of media exposure, and their evaluations of Clinton’s charisma and effectiveness in Study 1. Results indicate that female voters, those with favorable attitudes toward female leaders, and Democrats were more likely to support Clinton; these relationships were strengthened by media exposure. Contrary to predictions, gender attitudes and political affiliation did not have a significant interaction effect on evaluations of Clinton. In Study 2, we conducted a content analysis of the media’s portrayal of Clinton on both ends of the political spectrum. Our findings revealed that partisan news outlets with opposite political leanings did significantly differ in their portrayal of Clinton’s prototypicality and competence as a leader. As a result, media coverage acted to magnify the role of political affiliation in voters’ evaluations of Clinton’s suitability for the highest political office. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

T1  - Effects of network heterogeneity on social media on opinion polarization among South Koreans: Focusing on fear and political orientation: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2365035439
AB  - Recent studies have shown mixed findings regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity on social media and opinion polarization. Focusing on individual-level variables (i.e., individuals' political orientation, fear of a risky situation, and fear of an out-group), the objective of this study was to investigate opinion polarization over North Korean issues that have brought out threats to South Koreans and tangled with political orientations in the nation. Our analysis indicated that network heterogeneity on social media could decrease polarization. Moderation effects of political orientation and fear of political opponents in the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization were also found. Findings of this study extend previous discussions regarding the relationship between network heterogeneity and polarization in the context of social media by concentrating on North Korea's threatening situation.

T1  - We Are the People and You Are Fake News: A Social Identity Approach to Populist Citizens’ False Consensus and Hostile Media Perceptions
AN  - 2352956514
AB  - This study aims to investigate the relationships between citizens’ populist attitudes, perceptions of public opinion, and perceptions of mainstream news media. Relying on social identity theory as an explanatory framework, this article argues that populist citizens assume that public opinion is congruent with their own opinion and that mainstream media reporting is hostile toward their own views. To date, only anecdotal evidence suggests that both assumptions are true. The relationships are investigated in a cross-sectional survey with samples drawn from four Western European countries (N = 3,354). Multigroup regression analysis supports our hypotheses: False consensus and hostile media perceptions can clearly be linked to populist attitudes in all four regions under investigation. Moreover, our findings show a gap between hostile media perceptions and congruent public opinion perceptions, which increases with increasing populist attitudes to the point that the persuasive press inference mechanism is annulled.

T1  - Political Opinion Formation as Epistemic Practice: The Hashtag Assemblage of #metwo
AN  - 2511154119
AB  - The article contributes to the literature on the political use of hashtags. We argue that hashtag assemblages could be understood in the tradition of representing public opinion through datafication in the context of democratic politics. While traditional data-based epistemic practices like polls lead to the ‘passivation’ of citizens, in the digital constellation this tendency is currently challenged. In media like Twitter, hashtags serve as a technical operator to order the discursive fabrication of diverse publicly articulated opinions that manifest in the assemblage of tweets, algorithms and criticisms. We conceptualize such a critical public as an epistemic sensorium for dislocations based on the expression of experienced social imbalances and its political amplification. On the level of opinion formation, this constitutes a process of democratization, allowing for the expression of diverse opinions and issues even under singular hashtags. Despite this diversity, we see a strong tendency of publicly relevant actors such as news outlets to represent digital forms of opinion expression as unified movements. We argue that this tendency can partly be explained by the affordances of networked media, relating the process of objectification to the network position of the observer. We make this argument empirically plausible by applying methods of network analysis and topic modelling to a dataset of 196,987 tweets sampled via the hashtag #metwo that emerged in the German Twittersphere in the summer of 2018 and united a discourse concerned with racism and identity. In light of this data, we not only demonstrate the hashtag assemblage’s heterogeneity and potential for subaltern agency; we also make visible how hashtag assemblages as epistemic practices are inherently dynamic, distinguishing it from opinion polling through the limited observational capacities and active participation of the actors representing its claims within the hybrid media system.

T1  - Contemporary Social Movements in a Hybrid Media Environment
AN  - 2456878415
AB  - Media are central to the dynamics of protest and social movements. Contemporary social movements face a shifting environment composed of new media technologies and platforms that enable new identities, organizational forms, and practices. We review recent research focusing on the ways in which movements shape and are shaped by the media environment and the ways in which changes in the media environment have reshaped participation, mobilization, and impacts of activism. We conclude with the following recommendations for scholarship in this burgeoning area: move toward a broader conception of media in movements; expand engagement with scholarship in neighboring disciplines that study politics, media, and communication; develop new methodological and analytical skills for emerging forms of media; and investigate the ways in which media are enhancing, altering, or undermining the ability of movements to mobilize support, shape broader identities and attitudes, and secure new advantages from targets and authorities.

T1  - Beyond smart crowds. The media effect of citizen mobilizations around the peace agreements in Colombia
TT  - Mais além das multidões inteligentes. O efeito midiático das mobilizações cidadãs pelos acordos de paz na Colômbia. Más allá de las multitudes inteligentes. El efecto mediático de las movilizaciones ciudadanas por los acuerdos de paz en Colombia
AN  - 2377287198
AB  - Objective: This article analyzes the citizen mobilizations that demanded a definitive peace agreement between the Colombian government and the FARC, between October and November 2016. To that end, these expressions of social protest are compared with previous social mobilization events during the negotiation stage. This analytical exercise aims to identify the visibility, resonance and legitimacy that these forms of social mobilization received from some of the main Colombian media. Methodology: Based on a mixed approach methodology which simultaneously combines and integrates qualitative and quantitative data, we utilize different conceptual references that have drawn attention to the close relationships of social movements and the media. For this purpose, a database was built in which news events about the peace process were recorded between January 2013 and December 2016. From that set of news, we chose those that referred to the mobilizations for or against the peace agreements. This information was systematized from a matrix in which the news events were typified, distinguishing the informative bias between negative, neutral or positive, as well as typifying the actor or actors involved in the news and the bias attributed to each one. Conclusions: The information analyzed establishes that the citizen mobilizations in favor of achieving a definitive peace agreement, in October and November 2016, had a more visible and favorable media positioning, and at the same time, were more effective or legitimate than the other cycles of protest experienced during the negotiation process. In this way, the article provides evidence that accounts for the media impact of such mobilizations in the public opinion process around peace agreements in Colombia. Originality: By analyzing and describing the new forms of collective action that have emerged in Colombia in recent years, from innovative conceptual and methodological references, it is possible to identify how repertoires of action have been transformed, as well as the demands and mobilization strategies of social movements, all of which account for the effectiveness of these expressions of mobilizations for peace compared to previous forms of collective action.Alternate abstract: Objetivo: Este artículo analiza las movilizaciones ciudadanas que reclamaban por un acuerdo definitivo de paz entre el gobierno colombiano y las FARC, ocurridas entre octubre y noviembre de 2016. Para tal fin, tales expresiones de protesta social son comparadas con eventos de movilización social previos, ocurridos durante la etapa de negociación. Con este ejercicio analítico se pretende identificar cual fue la visibilidad, resonancia y legitimidad que tales formas de movilización social recibieron de algunos de los principales medios de comunicación colombianos. Metodología: A partir de una metodología de abordaje mixto, que combina e integra de manera simultánea datos cualitativos y cuantitativos, se retoman diferentes referentes conceptuales que han llamado la atención sobre las estrechas relaciones que despliegan los movimientos sociales con los medios de comunicación. Para tales efectos, se construyó una base de datos en las que se registraron los eventos noticiosos sobre el proceso de paz, entre enero de 2013 hasta diciembre de 2016. De ese conjunto de noticias fueron escogidas aquellas que hicieron alusión a las movilizaciones a favor o en contra de los acuerdos de paz. Dicha información fue sistematizada a partir de una matriz en la cual se tipificaron los eventos noticiosos, distinguiendo el sesgo informativo entre negativo, neutral o positivo, así como tipificando el actor o actores que intervienen en la noticia y el sesgo que el medio atribuye a las actuaciones u opiniones de cada actor. Conclusiones: A partir de la información analizada se pudo establecer que las movilizaciones ciudadanas a favor de la consecución de un acuerdo definitivo de paz ocurridas entre octubre y noviembre de 2016, tuvieron un posicionamiento mediático más visible y favorable, pero a la vez, más efectivo o legítimo que los otros ciclos de protesta que se vivieron durante el proceso de negociación. De esta manera, se provee evidencias que dan cuenta del impacto mediático de tales movilizaciones en el proceso de formación de opinión pública en torno a los acuerdos de paz en Colombia. Originalidad: Al analizar y describir las nuevas formas de acción colectiva que han surgido en los últimos años en Colombia, desde referentes conceptuales y metodológicos innovadores, ha hecho posible identificar cómo se han transformado tanto los repertorios de acción, como las demandas y estrategias de movilización de los movimientos sociales, todo lo cual da cuenta de la efectividad de estas expresiones de movilizaciones por la paz frente a las formas de acción colectiva precedentes.Alternate abstract: Objetivo: Este artigo analisa as mobilizações cidadãs que reivindicavam um acordo definitivo de paz entre o governo colombiano e as Forças Armadas Revolucionárias da Colômbia (Farc), ocorridas entre outubro e novembro de 2016. Para isso, essas expressões de protesto social são comparadas com eventos de mobilização social anteriores, que aconteceram na etapa de negociação. Com esse exercício de análise, pretende-se identificar qual foi a visibilidade, a ressonância e a legitimidade que essas formas de mobilização social receberam de alguns dos principais meios de comunicação colombianos. Metodologia: A partir de uma metodologia de abordagem mista, que combina e integra, de maneira simultânea, dados qualitativos e quantitativos, são retomados diferentes referentes conceituais que chamaram a atenção das estreitas relações que os movimentos sociais estabelecem com os meios de comunicação. Para isso, foi construída uma base de dados nas quais foram registrados os eventos noticiosos sobre o processo de paz, entre janeiro de 2013 e dezembro de 2016. Desse conjunto de notícias, foram escolhidas as que fizeram alusão às mobilizações a favor dos acordos de paz ou contra eles. Essa informação foi sistematizada a partir de uma matriz em que os eventos noticiosos foram tipificados, com diferenciação das tendências informativas entre negativa, neutra ou positiva, bem como tipificando o ator ou atores que intervêm na notícia e o viés que o meio atribui às atuações ou opiniões de cada ator. Conclusões: A partir da informação analisada, pôde-se estabelecer que as mobilizações cidadãs a favor do acordo definitivo de paz ocorridas em outubro e novembro de 2016 tiveram posicionamento midiático mais visível e favorável, mas, ao mesmo tempo, mais efetivo ou legítimo que os outros ciclos de protesto vividos no processo de negociação. Dessa maneira, são apresentadas provas do impacto midiático dessas mobilizações no processo de formação de opinião pública acerca dos acordos de paz na Colômbia. Originalidade: Ao analisar e descrever as novas formas de ação coletiva surgidas nos últimos anos na Colômbia, a partir de referentes conceituais e metodológicos inovadores, foi possível identificar como vêm se transformando tanto os repertórios de ação quanto as demandas e estratégias de mobilização dos movimentos sociais, o que demonstra a efetividade dessas expressões de mobilização pela paz diante das formas de ação coletiva precedentes.

AB  - Partisan selectivity of news media and attitudinal polarization are linked, yet the bulk of research focuses on the role of political attitudes while neglecting religious dispositions. We consider the degree to which both network and cable news media offend viewers in terms of both politics and religion. Using data from the 2010 Baylor Religion Survey, we find that white evangelicals have higher odds than mainline Protestants of reporting taking offense from the evening news, as well as higher odds than religious non-affiliates of being offended by both types of news. The primary divide, however, was between affiliates and non-affiliates, as biblical literalism and religious exclusivism at least partially mediated differences between white evangelicals and mainliners in taking offense from the evening news. Religious service attendance at least partially mediated differences between affiliates and non-affiliates in taking offense from both types of news, but while political conservatism explained differences in being offended by the evening news, it was not a significant predictor of taking offense from cable news. We suggest that this is due to processes of media differentiation that make cable news an equal-opportunity offender.

T1  - Motivational Theories of Agenda-Setting Effects: An Information Selection and Processing Model of Attribute Agenda-Setting
AN  - 2432396663
AB  - This study explores how agenda-setting theory works in a fragmented media environment while examining psychological motivations that drive selective exposure and information processing in an electoral context. The data suggest that regardless of motivational goals, people with a moderate active need for orientation (NFO) spent more time engaged in cross-network exposure to news media than the other groups. However, driven by directional goals, they were more apt to engage in biased information processing that increased agenda-setting outcomes on candidate attributes. Overall, this study suggests that NFO predicts information-seeking behavior, while motivated reasoning explains how people processed information. Exposure to partisan news reporting on cable television exhibited the strongest agenda-setting associations on candidate attributes.

T1  - Partisan Media, Polarized Audiences? A Qualitative Analysis of Online Political News and Responses in the United States, U.K., and The Netherlands
AN  - 2432396415
AB  - Media outlets in the United States are frequently accused of articulating partisan biases in political reporting. In Europe, the media and citizens are assumed to interpret reality from polarized and populist mindsets. To date, however, empirical research has not explored how such interpretations are constructed online. Important questions remain unanswered: How are online media constructing partisan biases? How do citizens respond to such news? To answer these questions, this article draws on a comparative qualitative content analysis of online political news and responses in the United States, U.K., and The Netherlands (N = 1,179). Results reveal that citizens respond to partisan news with congruent polarized interpretations. These findings provide important foundational evidence for the congruence between partisan media and polarized interpretations.

T1  - Islamophobia, Racism and the Vilification of the Muslim Diaspora
AN  - 2410495495
AB  - Is Islamophobia a new phenomenon? Are Islam and the Judeo-Christian West still hateful of and hostile toward each other? Do Muslim women with veils and headscarves constitute a threat to the Wests secular and liberal values? What has fueled the sudden rhetoric of Islamophobia in the United States of America and Europe? How does Anglophone print and digital media report pressures, prejudices and discriminatory practices against male and female students? How do Western media cover the social exclusion of the Muslim diaspora? These questions need a thoughtful coverage and concentration in academia. It is believed that most of the grievous and painful stories experienced, for example, by Muslim immigrants- be they legal or illegal, asylum seekers, refugees, or whatsoever, still do not find a room in scholastic research. This paper utilizes the narrative research method to study and probe into the problem of Islamophobia, the vilification of and racism against Muslims in the United States of America and Europe. The usage of human stories, peoples personal experiences and narrative accounts or recounts of Islamophobic incidents (real or imagined) as the basis of this inquiry is particularly suitable for research because it can help understand the status quo of Muslim diaspora in the United States of America and Europe. Narrative data are retrieved from five major US-news publications and press elite (e.g., Foreign Policy, The New York Times, The Washington Post, USA Today and Chicago Tribune). The analysis of these data can be used to improve the situation of Muslim diaspora and their interaction with non-Muslims all over the world. The mediums cited above have been chosen because they are the prime source of information for intellectuals and policy-makers. Decidedly, they construct and build up ample epistemologies on Islamophobia and other epiphenomena of racism.

AN  - 2330737144
AB  - In this paper I discuss Islamophobia as a form of racism especially intensified in the press and media. The women in my study talked about how they coped with what they saw as a backlash of Islamophobia. I show how they have come to deal with the effects of this in their everyday life. Even though most of the women in my study were born and raised in Britain, this antipathy towards Muslims has made them question their sense of belonging. This paper brings to light the experiences of prejudice and discrimination from the perspective of middle-class British-Pakistanis.

T1  - Stereotyping Online? Internet News, Social Media, and the Racial Typification of Crime
AN  - 2284869116
AB  - A substantial body of research indicates that television news consumption is associated with criminal stereotyping. However, less is known about how online media, such as Internet news and social media news consumption, is associated with such attitudes. Using a multisite sample of mostly young adults, the current study examines the relationships between multiple types of online news consumption and crime news engagement on racially typifying African Americans as violent, property, and drug offenders. Findings reveal that Internet news consumption is negatively related, but social media news consumption is positively related, to racially typifying African Americans as criminals. Beyond consumption, social media crime news engagement is negatively related to racial typification. Last, there is some evidence that the association between online media consumption and engagement varies by race and political ideology. Findings and direction for future research is discussed.

T1  - The Keynesian-Monetarist Competition Over Public Credibility
AN  - 2330623221
AB  - Mainstream economic theories went through an intellectual crisis during the recession that hit Western economies in the late 1970s. Academic debates extended to public media and mass culture, starting with the TV shows led by John Kenneth Galbraith (The Age of Uncertainty) and Milton Friedman (Free to Choose). Such a translation of ideas and language had a spillover effect on the academic community. The simultaneous pursuit of honors in distinct fields raises the question of the role of economists in the public debate. By shifting the focal point beyond the notions of expertise and public opinion, this article explores the mechanisms of the conquest of the public sphere by experts and intellectuals, and its consequences on the field of economics.

T1  - Transcultural fandom of the Korean Wave in Latin America: through the lens of cultural intimacy and affinity space
AN  - 2250554164
AB  - This article has examined how the Hallyu phenomenon is integrated into a transnational global cultural landscape, focusing on Chilean reception of K-pop. It analyzed how Hallyu fans engage with a social media-saturated environment in Chile, mapping out transnational pop cultural flows within the digital media environment through which the participatory culture of media users is spread. What is interesting is that Chilean society, in general, shows negative attitudes toward K-pop fans. More importantly, while many Chileans consider K-pop fans weird and strange, often disparaging their family members and friends for liking such music, the marginalization of K-pop fans in Chile promotes a greater sense of bonding among them through the affinity spaces of social media. Under this circumstance, most of our interviewees explained that digital media plays a vital role in the dissemination of K-pop in Chile and Latin America. Unlike Hallyu fans in other regions, K-pop fans in Chile have developed cultural intimacy specific to digital site-media, primarily in the realm of social media, and K-pop generates the creation of affinity spaces via different social media platforms.

T1  - Citizen surveil-labour: Analysing Crime Stoppers and its alliance of police, media, and publics
AN  - 2219537796
AB  - An examination of a Crime Stoppers initiative – a weekly page published in a major city-based tabloid newspaper – afforded a rare glimpse into this understudied global entity. It also offered a means of reflecting on the co-option of CCTV images; partnerships between police, media organisations, and diverse publics; and the harnessing of citizen labour in a culture of surveillance. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted on the images, accompanying texts, and rhetoric of this feature page for a two-year period. From a media criminology perspective, the portrayals underscore the abrogation of the presumption of innocence, a focus on mundane property offences, with the potential to exacerbate fear of crime and to engender more punitive public attitudes. From a conceptual frame, this article proffers the notion of surveil-labour where the repurposing of CCTV data in the context of a Crime Stoppers scheme reinforces an alliance of police, media, and the public to enhance an infrastructure of informing.

T1  - Immigration, race and local media: Smethwick and the 1964 general election
AN  - 2209515006
AB  - In 1964, a small industrial town on the outskirts of Birmingham gained a reputation worldwide as Britain's most racist town. The Conservative Party's candidate, Peter Griffiths, bucked national trends in the General Election by winning a seat in Smethwick with a large majority, following a fiercely anti-immigrant campaign. Smethwick's immigrant population was no larger than that of neighbouring towns, posing the question why such intense anti-immigrant feeling emerged at a local level? This article addresses the impact of local and regional media on public perceptions of immigrants in Smethwick during and immediately after the 1964 General Election, arguing that the local newspaper, the Smethwick Telephone, and ATV Today, ITV's regional news programme for the Midlands, fuelled hostility and helped legitimise Griffiths' campaign. By investigating the media's influence at a local level, we can gain a greater understanding of the development of racial prejudice in British communities and the complex history of twentieth century media. This article further develops the work of Wendy Webster, Sarita Malik and Gavin Schaffer, who examine the framing of immigration by a range of national media forms but overlook the vital role of local and regional reporting in this process.

T1  - Understanding an Urban Park through Big Data
AN  - 2329644691
AB  - There are significant strengths of social media data such as indisputability, volume, and real-time data.

Since social media users post their opinions on their social media platform [7], social media data represent public opinions more directly than other traditional methodologies when researchers try to understand public attitudes and perceptions.

[...]this study examined how social media data can be used to understand: (1) visitor activities in parks and (2) visitor satisfaction about the park.

According to this study, urban parks can promote the mingling of different ethnic groups and encourage interactions among visitors.

Researchers have developed several ways to measure these variables through field observation, surveys, and interviews.

Since these methods have been used in studies of urban parks for a long time, these methods are often called traditional analytics [45,46].

T1  - The Discursive Appeal to Solidarity and Partisan Journalism in Europe’s Migration Crisis
AN  - 2300632050
AB  - The article analyses the discursive appeal to solidarity in the mass media during the unfolding of Europe’s migration crisis. Solidarity was claimed by numerous actors in the public discourse to legitimise political decisions and mobilise public opinion. While it seems that the call for solidarity was shared by many actors, media studies show the ‘partisan journalism’ of media outlets. Thus, the political orientation of media outlets influences their coverage of public debates. Hence, to what extent do different quality newspapers cover the same solidarity claims in times of crisis? In order to answer this question, the crisis coverage of two German and two Irish newspapers with centre-left and centre-right political orientations is examined via the discourse network methodology. Germany is selected due to high political parallelism and a strong affectedness by the crisis, while Ireland is selected because of low political parallelism and a weak affectedness by the migration crisis. The findings demonstrate that partisan journalism persists during Europe’s migration crisis. Especially German party actors are present in both countries, underpinning the central position of Germany. Regarding the appeal to solidarity, political solidarity claims prevail in all four newspapers, indicating the political-institutional asymmetry in the Common European Asylum System. The study contributes to the strategic framing of concepts in public debates and demonstrates that the left-right distinction of media outlets is hardly affected by the migration crisis.

T1  - Public Perceptions of the Seriousness of Crimes: To What Extent are They Driven by Television Exposure?
AN  - 2262010416
AB  - This article investigates the relationship between exposure to overall television content and television news on the one hand, and public crime seriousness perceptions, including the two main components of perceived crime seriousness, i.e., perceived wrongfulness and harm severity, on the other hand. Drawing on cultivation theory and additional literature, we have constructed three hypothetical models which, for the first time, also include conservationism and legal cynicism as mediating variables. Using structural equation modelling, we have tested the models empirically in a cross-sectional survey of 1278 adult Dutch-speaking Belgian residents. Our findings indicate that overall exposure to television content is not significantly related to perceived crime seriousness, wrongfulness, harm severity, or any of the mediating variables. Exposure to television news, however, is both directly and indirectly related to perceived crime seriousness, wrongfulness, and harm severity. These findings thus suggest the relevance of television news exposure as a predictor of people’s perceptions of crime seriousness.

T1  - "Wealthy Gay Couples Buying Babies Produced in India by Poor Womb-Women: Audience Interpretations of Transnational Surrogacy in TV News
AN  - 2186635473
AB  - Surrogacy is beginning to generate public debate, and the way the media approach it may have negative effects on social attitudes toward gay parenting. The news media play a key role in informing society, especially about topics such as surrogacy, of which most audiences have no direct experience. The aim of our research is to explore opinion formation of surrogacy and gay parenting by analyzing the audience interpretation of a TV news story in Spain. To do this we conducted four focus groups that were analyzed using a qualitative content analysis based on the discourse produced by the participants. The results show that the framing strategies used in the news story contribute to advocating an attitude of repudiation toward surrogacy, with an adverse sentiment also extending to homosexual couples who wish to become parents. This leads us to discuss the role of media in shaping public opinion and the resulting potential consequences in the case of surrogacy and gay parenting.

T1  - Police use of force and its video coverage: An experimental study of the impact of media source and content on public perceptions
AN  - 2179661695
AB  - Purpose To explore the influence of media source, suspect's alleged criminal activity, and the rater's socio-demographic attributes on public ratings of video incidents of police use of force (PUF). Methods A national online sample of 581 adults viewed and evaluated four different PUF videos in a 3 × 3 experimental design.Study participants were randomly assigned to experimental conditions involving differences in (1) media sources and (2) suspect's alleged criminal activity.The dependent variables included ratings of the credibility of the video's media source (i.e., trust in the source and accuracy of its video account) and the officer's conduct (i.e., excessive force, justifiable force).The independent and moderating variables included the experimental conditions, personal salience of PUF incidents, the rater's use of different media sources, and other socio-demographic attributes. Results Three major results were found in this study: (1) video accounts of PUF are rated as more trustworthy when the video is attributed to “national TV news” source than “social media” outlets, (2) ratings of excessive force are more likely in PUF incidents when they involve a more dangerous offender (i.e., an alleged murder vs. shoplifter), and (3) the impact of the individual's socio-demographic characteristics on these public perceptions are strongly moderated by the personal salience of PUF incidents to the rater and their pattern of daily usage of conventional and social media. Conclusions The visual content in short, video clips of PUF incidents strongly influences public attitudes about the officer's conduct as excessive and unjustifiable.However, by the timely release of the video images and framing them within their wider context, police departments may better demonstrate transparency and help overcome various cognitive biases that may underlie adverse public reactions to PUF incidents.

T1  - Islamophobia, Representation and the Muslim Political Subject. A Swedish Case Study
AN  - 2318724732
AB  - Applying media analysis, this article addresses how the exclusion of Muslim women from fields of common public interest in Sweden, such as partaking as an active citizen, is materialized. Focusing on a specific event—the cancellation of a screening of Burka Songs 2.0—and the media coverage and representation of the cancellation, it discusses the role of discourses of gender equality, secularity and democracy in circumscribing space for Muslim political subjects. It casts light on Islamophobic stereotyping, questionable democracy and secularity, as well as the over-simplified approaches to gender equality connected to dealings with Muslim women in Sweden. Besides obstacles connected to Muslim political subjects, the study provides insights into media representation of Muslim women in general, specially connected to veils and the role of lawmaking connected to certain kind of veiling, in Sweden and Europe.

T1  - Silver screen sorting: Social identity and selective exposure in popular film viewing
AN  - 2178951653
AB  - While research in media and politics has long stressed the importance of television, the political impact of movies has largely been ignored. However, a small body of literature suggests that both political docudramas and popular films may have the capacity to change the issue attitudes of viewers. Building on that work, this paper examines the potential for selective exposure in movie viewership. We develop a theory that there is large-scale sorting into popular movies rooted in social identity theory. We argue that sorting is a result of two processes: film studios marketing films towards particular social groups and individuals sorting into films based on social group characteristics. We test this theory using a unique dataset in which undergraduate students were asked to rate trailers for a variety of political docudramas and popular films. Our results indicate that there is indeed widespread sorting into popular films on the basis of social identities rooted in socio-demographic traits.

T1  - When “Scurry” vs. “Hurry” Makes the Difference: Vermin Metaphors, Disgust, and Anti‐Immigrant Attitudes
AN  - 2151164561
AB  - In three studies, we demonstrate that common metaphors used to describe immigrants in news media interact with national, but not political, identity to lead to feelings of disgust as well as anti‐immigrant attitudes. The first study demonstrates that the current discourse in the U.S. surrounding unauthorized immigrants includes metaphors that readily activate thoughts of vermin (e.g., rodents). The second study shows that when these metaphors are present in a news article about immigrants, the more participants identify as American the more disgust they experience reading the article. The final study further shows that after reading a news article in which the vermin metaphors are present, the more participants identify as American the more likely they are to support stringent immigration policies. This research shows the power of metaphor to shape intergroup attitudes and support for government policies.

T1  - Media Use and Satisfaction with Democracy: Testing the Role of Political Interest
AN  - 1967238023
AB  - In the process of political communication, media use has strong influences on citizens’ attitudes toward politics. However, the importance of political interest in shaping the relationship between media use and satisfaction with democracy has not been extensively studied. This study makes a contribution to identify the role of political interest in mediating the effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Consistent with the virtuous circle theory, the findings from this study show that there are significantly positive associations between reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information and political interest. Citizens who are more interested in politics also tend to be more satisfied with democracy. By contrast, in accordance with the media malaise theory, our results also show that reading a newspaper, listening to the radio, and using the Internet for political information are negatively related to satisfaction with democracy. Distinct from existing literature, our findings indicate that the indirect positive effects of media use mediated by political interest are outweighed by the negative direct effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy. Hence, the relative magnitudes of direct and indirect effects are critical for the overall effects of media use on satisfaction with democracy.

T1  - It Takes Three: How Mass Media Coverage Conditions Public Responsiveness to Policy Outputs in the United States*
AN  - 2129534189
AB  - ObjectiveDemocratic governance requires that policy outcomes and public demand for policy be linked. While studies have shown empirical support for such a relationship in various policy domains, empirical evidence also indicates that the public is relatively unaware of policy outputs. This raises a puzzle: Why do policy outputs influence public attitudes if the public knows little about them?MethodsThis study seeks to address this paradox by examining the conditioning role of media coverage. We rely on data derived from the Policy Agendas Project in the United States, allowing us to analyze the relationship between policy outcomes, public preferences, and newspaper content across a long span of time (1972–2007).ResultsOur results indicate that public policy preferences respond to policy outputs, and that this relationship is strengthened by greater media attention to a policy area. Importantly, our findings also indicate that without media attention to a policy area, there is no direct effect of policy outputs on public demand for policy.ConclusionsMedia coverage appears to be a key factor for public responsiveness to occur. In the absence of policy coverage by the media, public responsiveness to policy outputs is greatly reduced.

T1  - In the Eye of the Beholder: How News Media Exposure and Audience Schema Affect the Image of the United States Among the Chinese Public
AN  - 2432396860
AB  - This study presents a theoretical framework that examines foreign publics’ use of foreign news from domestic media and preexisting schema to form an image of another nation. To test the proposed theoretical framework, we examined Chinese citizens’ image of the United States using the data from a survey collected from a representative sample of Chinese adults. The findings suggest that the role of foreign news from domestic media is conditional on preexisting schema, including individuals’ patriotism and whether they have traveled to the United States. We conclude by discussing the implications of the results for research investigating national image and stakeholders interested in predictors of national image.

T1  - Investigating the Effects of Media Consumption on Attitudes Toward Police Legitimacy
AN  - 2035225750
AB  - Prior investigations have examined both traditional media (e.g., television news) and entertainment media (e.g., crime-related shows) on policing-related outcomes; however, less is known how contemporary forms of media, such as the Internet and social media, may affect policing-related outcomes. Using a sample of young adults, the current study examines the effect of multiple types of media consumption (traditional, entertainment, the Internet, and social media) on attitudes toward police legitimacy. Findings reveal that respondents who read news online are more likely to have negative attitudes toward police legitimacy. However, when individual differences are controlled for, the effect of reading news online is weakened and using social media becomes marginally significant. Further, the impact of media consumption on attitudes toward police legitimacy varies by key audience characteristics.

T1  - Perceived Community Acceptance of Same-Sex Marriage: Persuasive Press, Projection, and Pluralistic Ignorance
AN  - 2430088726
AB  - The early twenty-first century witnessed a substantial shift in public opinion about whether same-sex couples should be allowed to legally marry in the United States. By the time the Supreme Court announced its 5-4 decision that same-sex couples had the right to marry in all 50 states, a plurality of opinion polls showed that a majority of Americans favored same-sex marriage (SSM). For example, a Quinnipiac poll in April 2015 found 58% of respondents supported marriage between same-sex couples. In that same month, An ABC–Washington Post poll found a similar level of support (61%). This shift is remarkable considering only one third of Americans supported SSM a decade earlier (Pew Research Center, 2016). However, little is known about whether people recognize the dramatic shift in public opinion that has occurred around them. Perceptions of public opinion do not necessarily mirror public opinion polls, and they are often inaccurate (Mullen & Smith, 1990). Faulty or not, these perceptions matter. A long history of scholarship on social perception signals that beliefs about what others are thinking or doing play an influential role in shaping how people think and behave themselves (Asch, 1955; Deutsch & Gerard, 1955; Fishbein & Ajzen, 2007; Rimal & Lapinski, 2015). For example, people are more likely to express opinions when they believe others agree with them (Glynn, Hayes, & Shanahan, 1997), and they are more likely to adopt behaviors they believe others are doing (Prentice & Miller, 1993). This study fills a gap in our understanding of perceived public opinion about SSM by addressing how two tendencies—the habit of thinking others believe as we do, and the inclination to infer public opinion from the perceived slant of news media coverage—affect perceptions of public support for SSM. Our cross-sectional survey of adults in four major U.S. cities assessed where people believe their communities stand on the issue of SSM. We test the accuracy of these estimates relative to the actual distribution of public opinion in the sample. Further, in this study, we test a model that increases our understanding of the factors that contribute to perceptions of others’ opinions.

T1  - New Media and Support for Same-Sex Marriage
AN  - 2150387944
AB  - Research in advanced industrialized democracies on social attitudes toward same-sex marriage suggests that intergroup social contact and positive media coverage play an important role in promoting tolerance and support for same-sex marriage. Using AmericasBarometer survey data for eighteen countries in 2010, 2012, and 2014, this article examines the ways in which individual-level Internet use interacts with news exposure, country-level quality of democracy, Internet penetration, and their association with support for same-sex marriage. The results suggest that not only is Internet use associated with greater support for same-sex marriage, but that among those who both use the Internet and pay more attention to the news, the positive effects are amplified. In addition, national level of democracy, economic development, and Internet use are also associated with overall higher probabilities of supporting same-sex marriage. We find that Internet use has a strong positive association with the probability of supporting same-sex marriage as the percentage of the national population on the Internet increases. These findings extend our understanding of social and political tolerance of same-sex marriage in Latin America.Alternate abstract:Investigación en países industrializados sugiere que el contacto entre grupos sociales y la cobertura positiva de los mismos en medios de comunicación juegan un papel importante en la promoción de tolerancia y en aumentar apoyo al matrimonio entre personas del mismo sexo. Basándonos en las encuestas del AmericasBarometer de 2010, 2012 y 2014, este artículo examina cómo el uso de la Internet interactúa con el consumo de noticias, la calidad de la democracia en el país, el grado nacional de penetración de la Internet, y su asociación con mayor apoyo al matrimonio igualitario. Estos resultados sugieren que no solamente existe una asociación entre el uso de la Internet y apoyo al matrimonio igualitario, pero que esta asociación amplifica los efectos positivos entre las personas que usan la Internet y prestan atención a las noticias. Además, la calidad de la democracia al nivel nacional, niveles de desarrollo económico, así como el uso de la Internet están también asociados con probabilidades mayores de apoyo. Encontramos que existe una fuerte asociación positiva entre el uso de la Internet y probabilidades de mayor apoyo conforme aumenta el porcentaje de la población con acceso a la Internet.

T1  - Iconizing "Muslim Terrorism" in a British Newspaper and Public Perception
AN  - 2056831550
AB  - By examining a news story and reader responses published in the Daily Mail Online (DMO), our study discursively argues that this daily newspaper promotes an Orientalist perception of Islam and Muslims. The religion and its adherents are both framed and perceived as a threat to British society and its "Western values", thus reinforcing Islamophobia within society. This study also argues that the DMO espouses the perceived Orientalist threat posed by Islam through juxtaposition, exaggeration and manipulation of facts, through lexical choices and visual images that eventually establishes the perception of a cultural clash. In addition, by examining the readers' responses toward the news story, this study demonstrates that the vast majority of respondents perceive Islam and Muslims as a threat to "the West". Their comments, as triggered by the text, also contribute to the discourse of Islamophobia and the perceived Orientalist view of an Islamic threat.

T1  - Abandoned not: media sociology as a networked transfield
AN  - 2002461887
AB  - The relationship between the disciplines of communication and sociology has been primarily described as being abandoned by sociologists. This article historicizes the alleged sociological abandonment of communication and media research and centers on media sociology as the key manifestation of an ongoing vibrant relationship between the two disciplines. It has two goals. First, I examine the contours of the abandonment notion since Berelson vs. Schramm, Riesman, and Bauer in Public Opinion Quarterly in 1959. I demonstrate the diversity and the depth of media sociology and argue that an US-centric positivist understanding of media sociology has led to the exaggerated and misleading notion of abandonment, which homogenizes theoretical discourse and discounts scholarly contributions from outside of the US. Personal and collective memories have also documented institutional and organizational growth of media sociology. Second, I propose to conceptualize media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions transcending disciplinary little boxes. Rather than returning to the Lazarsfeldian media effect paradigm, media sociology as a networked transfield driven by questions will allows scholars take advantage of structural holes for synthesis and innovation.

T1  - Public Support for Censorship in a Highly Regulated Media Environment: The Influence of Self-Construal and Third-Person Perception Over Time
AN  - 2430088569
AB  - This study represents the first longitudinal examination of third-person effects and uses a rigorous specification of the relative contribution of perceptions of influence on self and others (viz., the diamond method). Using nationally representative samples from Singapore gathered in 2001 (n = 626) and 2013 (n = 1,012), it examines perceptions of sex and nudity in films, content that the government allows but regulates. As expected, interdependent self-construal and third-person perceptions predicted support for censorship, as did perceived total media influence. The pattern of prediction was quite consistent with a slight increase in support for censorship. The discussion considers implications with respect to both the social landscape and an evolving media landscape.

T1  - Social Transformation and Human Mobility: Reflections on the Past, Present and Future of Migration
AN  - 2024042324
AB  - This article examines the development of international migration in the context of broader changes in global economic and political formations since the late 1940s. It also reflects on changing official policies and public attitudes to migration, as well as on the emergence of migration studies as a special interdisciplinary area of the social sciences. Four phases are discussed: 1. The period of concentration of investment in the old industrial areas of Western Europe up to the mid- 1960s , which led to attraction of mainly lower-skilled labour as 'guestworkers' or post-colonial migrants. Prejudice against newcomers was interpreted mainly in social-psychological terms as a 'natural reaction' against newcomers. 2. The beginnings of a new wave of globalisation in the 1970s and 1980s. Manufacturing employment in old core industrial areas fell, while new industrial economies (based largely on low pay and anti-union policies) burgeoned. Western European governments tried to send home the 'guestworkers'. The failure of such policies led to the emergence of multicultural societies. At the same time, the growing economies of the Gulf oil states and some Asian 'tigers' pulled in millions of workers, bound by very strict and often discriminatory contracts. 3. From the late 1980s to the recession of 2008 the globalisation of investment and production reached new heights. Cheaper transport and the growth of new media supported the growth of international migration at all skill levels. Developed countries cut back on education costs by importing human capital from countries like India and China, while denying the need for low-skilled workers. Yet the lack of nationals willing to take such jobs fuels the growth of temporary contract migration and irregular movement. Increasingly, migrants have come to be seen as a threat to jobs for low-skilled nationals and as a danger to national security. 4. The article argues that a new phase in global change is emerging following the 2008 crisis, and examines possible trends and their meaning for human mobility in the 21st century.

T1  - Rethinking the Debate Over Recent Polling Failures
AN  - 2015014168
AB  - In Inventing American Religion (2015), sociologist Robert Wuthnow's prescient history and harsh critique of the survey industry, he called for a frank national dialogue "about what is being tapped in polls and whether the investment is worth it." He estimated that more than 1,200 unique firms and institutions had conducted 37,000 separate public opinion polls in the United States through 2012, mostly since the 1990s. According to my count of that same polltracking service Wuthnow cited, an additional 12,000 polls were conducted in the four-year election cycle that followed, concluding in 2016 with Donald Trump's electoral college upset. While the unexpected result prompted some industry flagellation and introspection (e.g., Cohn, 2017; Kennedy et al., 2017; Silver, 2017) a broader dialogue about opinion polls is long overdue. What, if anything, are we actually learning from all these surveys? I argue as others have (e.g., Lepore, 2015; Zukin, 2015) that yes, there is a crisis in public opinion research, but it is not strictly speaking the one that has received most of the attention from scholars and journalists. I am referring of course to hotly contested disputes about the impact of declining response rates, strategies for selecting and modeling representative samples from various panels of Internet respondents, and implications of the rising use of multiple survey modes (for an overview, see Kennedy et al., 2017). These changes may have far-reaching implications. But no, my question for those of us who study public opinion is not about the limits of our methods or our abilities to accurately and reliably forecast elections. Rather, in this article I ask, as Wuthnow does, whether we ought to demand both less and more from the millions spent on survey research each election cycle: we should be less concerned with forecasting errors and more troubled by ingrained practices in the use of surveys that reveal less about public attitudes than they should.

T1  - Charlie Hebdo: Differences in Corporate and Alternative Media Coverage
AN  - 2013964848
AB  - In the following mini-study, quantitative content analysis was used to investigate differences in the United States print media's coverage of the Charlie Hebdo shooting. Four articles were analyzed, two from the corporate media and two from independent sources. The four articles did not disagree on the existence of terrorism, but they differed in terms of their assumptions regarding the cause(s) of terrorism as well as in terms of how the terrorist subject is configured discursively. Blaming Islam in general, or all Muslims, in relation to terrorist acts perpetrated by a few criminals can have drastic results, such as Islamophobia.

T1  - The promise to the Arab World: Attributes of U.S. President Obama in Arabic-language tweets: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2000683740
AB  - U.S. President Barack Obama's much-anticipated address in Egypt in 2009 promised a new beginning between the U.S. government and the Arab world but only a few years later there were many criticisms that the U.S. President did not live up to his promises, driving Arab attitudes toward the United States to their lowest point in years. Five years later, we analyzed Arabic-language twitter messages involving President Obama to examine cognitive and affective attributes. Results show that tweets by members of the media differed greatly from tweets by members of the public. The public tweets held more negative attitudes towards the U.S. President than tweets by news organizations. Members of the public also were more likely to link the President to a wider range of countries, suggesting a greater diversity of attributes, while primarily fixating on the Palestinian issue.

T1  - An Evaluation of Media's role in de-popularizing and Influencing Political Attitudes towards Jacob Zuma: Collating Events Leading to His Removal
AN  - 2157374265
AB  - Media has for decades been and still remains a significant instrument for societal socialisation. In most recent times, the media in South Africa has come to occupy a critical space in shaping political opinions as well as attitudes. While various scholarly works have documented the role of media in the political landscape of societies, not much has been written recently by scholars regarding the contribution of media in de-popularising of politicians, in particular the former South African President Jacob Zuma. Therefore, this paper examines how the growing participation of media in the transmission of principles, moral standards and values, resulted in citizens being more vocal regarding their dissatisfaction, which led to constant national calls for the removal of the former president Jacob Zuma. The qualitative study uses secondary sources to identify the dynamics of media reinforcement of Jacob Zuma declining popularity. The study found that the media used its agenda setting role to negatively undermine Zuma's popularity and influence public opinion about him and his leadership dynamics. The study therefore recommends the need for developmental journalism, which will help in advancing transformational leadership under President Ramaphosa and the future leaders of the country.

T1  - “Velvet Revolution” in Armenia: Potential, Gains and Risks of Political Protest Activity: Politicheskie Issledovanii︠a︡
AN  - 2138078633
AB  - The paper is focused on the public protests in Armenia in spring 2018 which caused the change of ruling elites. The new elite announced perspective directions of modernization, mostly in internal politics, including fight against authoritarian regime, corruption and economic monopoly developed by the previous government. It is demonstrated that the protests and slogans of spring 2018 are logically connected with accumulated culture and potential of protesting against institutionalized mechanisms of circulation of ruling elites inside the same political-oligarchic group and reflected public disagreement with situation in domestic economy and policy (which also caused mass emigration from the country). Comparably high level of freedom of speech in the country, critical public discourse on the lasting domestic issues, stagnation and on the failures of the ruling elites to tackle them influenced accumulation of protest potential, as well as accompanied public protests of the last decade, including the recent one. The arguments of the paper are based on author’s involved observations during mass protests in Armenia in April-May 2018, analysis of mass media and online publications, public discussions in social media, as well as interviews with Armenian experts – sociologists, political scientists, cultural anthropologists, historians and journalists. Along with that, secondary analysis of sociological and statistical data collected prior to the protests in 2018 and demonstrating the level of trust to political institutions, public perceptions on actual political and economic issues, as well as on participation in antigovernment protests, is implemented and serves as the context to demonstrate actual background for the recent protests. The paper represents an explanatory attempt to assess the causes of the protests and change of government in spring 2018 in Armenia, as well as to describe the forms of protest behavior, including communication and interaction models of the protesters. There is also an attempt to find out and demonstrate some risks and dysfunctions of the protest activities and especially post-protest political processes in the country, including construction and development of misperceptions and biased forms of framing of the mass protests in 2018 in the communication and media environment.

T1  - Reading, Writing and Political Competence
AN  - 2071301453
AB  - In the present paper we analyze the relation between political competence and media exposure. Taking into account the dynamic transition of media environment related to growing impact of the internet (web 2.0) we made several assumptions about the influence of traditional and new media on political sophistication. We hypothesize that the impact of the media on political competence is related to qualitative, rather than quantitative factors; competence rises with the way a media consumer interacts with the medium, rather than on the amount of time spent with the medium. The empirical analysis based on a mass public opinion survey confirms our assumptions: there is a positive relationship between media exposure and political competence, however various kind of media differ as far as their influence is concerned. Moreover the use of interactive internet features (participation in information exchange) is a key factor shaping competence.

T1  - Ethno-nationalist populism and the mobilization of collective resentment
AN  - 1961335173
AB  - Scholarly and journalistic accounts of the recent successes of radical-right politics in Europe and the United States, including the Brexit referendum and the Trump campaign, tend to conflate three phenomena: populism, ethno-nationalism and authoritarianism. While all three are important elements of the radical right, they are neither coterminous nor limited to the right. The resulting lack of analytical clarity has hindered accounts of the causes and consequences of ethno-nationalist populism. To address this problem, I bring together existing research on nationalism, populism and authoritarianism in contemporary democracies to precisely define these concepts and examine temporal patterns in their supply and demand, that is, politicians' discursive strategies and the corresponding public attitudes. Based on the available evidence, I conclude that both the supply and demand sides of radical politics have been relatively stable over time, which suggests that in order to understand public support for radical politics, scholars should instead focus on the increased resonance between pre-existing attitudes and discursive frames. Drawing on recent research in cultural sociology, I argue that resonance is not only a function of the congruence between a frame and the beliefs of its audience, but also of shifting context. In the case of radical-right politics, a variety of social changes have engendered a sense of collective status threat among national ethnocultural majorities. Political and media discourse has channelled such threats into resentments toward elites, immigrants, and ethnic, racial and religious minorities, thereby activating previously latent attitudes and lending legitimacy to radical political campaigns that promise to return power and status to their aggrieved supporters. Not only does this form of politics threaten democratic institutions and inter-group relations, but it also has the potential to alter the contours of mainstream public discourse, thereby creating the conditions of possibility for future successes of populist, nationalist, and authoritarian politics.

T1  - 'If everyone says so ...' Press narratives and image change in major event host cities
AN  - 1950807142
AB  - This paper looks into the European Capital of Culture (ECoC) programme as a leading example of culture-led regeneration intervention aimed at renewing or diversifying the economic base and positioning of host cities. One of the key claims associated with the programme is that it can transform the 'image' of a city. These image transformation claims are often supported by evidence of heightened or more positive media coverage in the short term. However, little evidence has generally been gathered to determine long-term, sustained image change. The paper seeks to at least partly address this lacuna by presenting evidence on the media representation of Glasgow and Liverpool over three decades. These two cities are widely perceived to be paradigmatic not only of successful culture-led regeneration but also of the power of the ECoC title to transform city image. The paper looks at the importance of the media narrative arc surrounding major cultural events in solidifying 'image change' processes, regardless of the existence of evidence to suggest a change in perceptions by local communities at the time the event is taking place. The core argument is that if media coverage about a particular place shows a significant change in focus and attitude over time, is voluminous enough and cuts across geographical and journalistic variations, then it effectively becomes a key source of evidence of de facto image change. The key proposition in this paper is that evidenceable and sustained change in media representations of place can be taken as tantamount to image change. This is based on the assumption that widespread and longitudinal trends in media representation have the capacity to both reflect and influence public attitudes and perceptions.

T1  - How We Know What We Know about Pakistan: New York Times news production, 1954-71
AN  - 1950005791
AB  - This article explores public knowledge creation by examining how the New York Times produced Pakistan news between 1954 and 1971, the formative period of United States of America (USA)-Pakistan relations. These years encapsulate not only the heyday of cooperation between the two governments, but also the American public's first major introduction to the South Asian country by the increasingly intrepid news media. A leader in shaping that introduction was the New York Times. While most studies of the American media focus on measuring the effect of news exposure and content on public opinion, this article focuses on the theoretically underexplored aspect of news production: foreign news gathering. With a lens on South Asia, it shows that foreign news gathering involves the straddling of on-the-ground political and logistical constraints that generate an atmosphere of high uncertainty. By exploring the limitations on news gathering faced by America's leading newspaper's foreign correspondents in Pakistan in the 1950s and 1960s, this article identifies an important historical source of the ambiguity characterizing USA-Pakistan relations. The findings are based on recently released archival material that offers rare insight into the news-production process.

T1  - Watching the News and Support for Democracy: Why Media Systems Matter
AN  - 1933859349
AB  - Objective 
We explore whether the effect of watching television on support for democracy is contingent on the type of media system. In countries with well-developed public broadcasting systems, watching television news should enhance support for democracy. In more market-oriented systems with more superficial and episodic news content, watching television news should weaken democratic attachments. 
Methods 
We utilize Wave 6 of the World Values Survey to investigate the relationship between watching television news and support for democracy in the United States, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands. 
Results 
Watching television news in public broadcasting systems increases the importance one places on living in a democracy and evaluations of democratic governance. Watching television news in market-oriented systems increases support for authoritarian political systems. 
Conclusion 
The effect of watching television news on democratic attitudes is contingent on media system. Public broadcasting systems enhance democratic attitudes while market-oriented systems weaken these democratic attachments.

T1  - A Psychological Firewall? Risk Perceptions and Public Support for Online Censorship in Russia*
AN  - 1933859144
AB  - Objective 
Authoritarian regimes commonly justify Internet censorship by framing the Internet as a threat to their citizens that must be tightly controlled for their own protection. This threat rhetoric underpins government censorship and creates a "psychological firewall" driving public support for a censored Internet. 
Methods 
Based on risk and decision-making scholarship, we evaluate how mass media and partisan regime support promulgate these threat perceptions, and in turn how they influence citizen attitudes about censorship. Employing Russia as a case study, we tested our hypotheses with a national survey (N = 1,600) conducted in May 2014. 
Results 
We found that reliance on Russian national TV news predicted greater Internet threat perceptions, and in turn these threat perceptions significantly increased support for online political censorship. 
Conclusion 
Approval of the Putin government further amplified the impact of these threat perceptions on support for censorship. Implications for understanding psychological foundations for support for censorship in authoritarian contexts are discussed.

T1  - Measuring or Creating Attitudes? Seventy Years of Australian Public Opinion Polling about Indonesia
AN  - 1915903847
AB  - This article critically evaluates the relationship between public opinion polling and foreign affairs. It plots key trends in public opinion polls of Australian attitudes towards Indonesia from the 1940s to the present day. Despite variations in polling companies and questions, Australian attitudes to Indonesia appear surprisingly stable, especially since the 1970s. Reading across multiple polls over this period reveals that, both as a mass and among individuals, Australians held complex views in which positive appraisals of Indonesian people and culture co-existed with an underlying fear of Indonesia as a potential military threat. Yet rather than accepting these findings at face value, this article calls for nuanced scrutiny of the role played by polling companies and the media in the construction and representation of so-called "public" opinion. Sensitive to recent developments in the historiography of public opinion polling, it suggests that public opinion polls not only attempted to measure Australian attitudes towards Indonesia, but also helped construct Indonesia as an object of popular and political concern.

T1  - The Fear Factor is a Main Thing: How Radio Influences Anxiety and Political Attitudes
AN  - 1923803833
AB  - We investigate how being exposed to media influences levels of anxiety and political attitudes in conflict-affected areas. Exploiting exogenous variation in signal strength of a radio station in South Sudan's Western Equatoria State, we compare original qualitative and quantitative data from areas with differing radio coverage. Civilians living in areas with more exposure to radio are more afraid of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA). This anxiety means civilians rely more on a civilian militia, the arrow boys, and less on the state army. Hence media, through fear, can contribute to changing social and political structures.

T1  - A comparison of the visual and story frames Al Jazeera English and CNN employed during the 2011 Egyptian revolution: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1908213450
AB  - This study examines a month of cable news coverage of the Egyptian uprising in 2011. Specifically it examines how Al Jazeera English and CNN differ in their use of story and visual frames. The quantitative content analysis (N = 503) found significant differences between the two networks. Al Jazeera English employs more frames about Egyptian history, political strategies, public engagement, public opinion, economy and the impact on the future of the country more frequently than CNN. When examining visual frames of conflict, Al Jazeera English was more likely to employ conflict frame-not violent than CNN. CNN was more likely than Al Jazeera English to employ the conflict frame-latent violence.

T1  - Debunking Nixon’s radio victory in the 1960 election: Re-analyzing the historical record and considering currently unexamined polling data
AN  - 2077093793
AB  - It is widely reported that Nixon won the first of the 1960 presidential debates among radio audiences while Kennedy carried television viewers, and further that Kennedy’s victory translated to an electoral victory. It is thus assumed that style trumped substance when politics entered the television age. However, the Nixon radio victory emerged in only a single poll conducted by Sindlinger and Company. Considering other polling data reveals Sindlinger’s finding is likely the result of a Republican bias in the sample and not a mass defection of Democrats swayed by Nixon’s substantive arguments. Voters found Kennedy ahead on substance as well as style. Considering the full historical context of the election, there is little evidence that television worked to the advantage of Kennedy and the disadvantage of Nixon, nor even much evidence that Kennedy was considered more attractive. We find no evidence that the first debate was decisive; we find it dubious that the debates overall produced a 2-million vote swing for Kennedy; we find it implausible that the first debate can be linked in any meaningful way to the outcome of the election. We find it more meaningful that Nixon turned a 5-to-3 Republican disadvantage into a razor-thin contest and that he largely did so using television during the final two weeks of the contest. The 1960 election should not be read as a triumph of style over substance. Correcting the misguided dismissal of substantive argument is crucial work scholars can contribute to the broader democratic project.

T1  - Media and sectarianism in the Middle East: Saudi hegemony over Pan-Arab media
AN  - 1923319375
AB  - Powerful political and economic players allocate significance resources in order to influence the media in ways that advance their interests. This article attempts to reveal the mechanisms that the ruling Saudi family uses to exert its power over pan-Arab media. It argues that Al Saud uses ownership, sponsorship, cooptation and coercion to keep pan-Arab media in line with its policies. It also asserts that the main consequence of Saudi domination of pan-Arab media today is not to divert Arab public opinion away from politics, as was the case in the 1990s; rather it is to set a sectarian agenda as a means to counter Iran’s influence in some Arab countries. Using frame analysis of a representative sample of eight programmes broadcast between 2012 and 2016 by three Salafi TV channels owned and sponsored by Al Saud, the article demonstrates that sponsoring a sectarian agenda may also encourage terrorism. It also reveals frame convergence between the messages of the Salafi channels and that of ISIL. Saudi media policy thus increases the visibility of ISIL’s messages and renders them credible, leading to the expansion of ISIL’s capability for recruitment.

T1  - Do Foreigners Count? Internationalization of Presidential Campaigns: PROD
AN  - 1900251650
AB  - The U.S. presidential elections always attract the attention of foreign audiences--who, despite not being able to vote, choose to follow the campaigns closely. For a post that is colloquially dubbed as the "Leader of the Free World," it is not unexpected to see such an interest coming from nonvoters. Mimicking almost hosting a megaevent, the elections increase the media coverage on the United States, thus making the elections a platform to communicate with the rest of the world and to influence the reputation of the country, or its nation brand. This study postulates that the increasing adoption of social media by campaigns as well as ordinary users, increase the symbolic importance of presidential elections for foreign audiences in two ways. First, foreign audiences no longer passively follow the campaign but rather present their input to sway the American public opinion through social media campaigns. Second, foreign audiences are exposed to a variety of messages ranging from official campaigns to late-night comedy shows to local grassroots movements. The audiences both enjoy a more in-depth understanding of the elections campaigns and are exposed to alternative political views. In this study, the 2016 U.S. presidential elections are positioned as a megaevent that can influence the American nation brand. Through a comparative content and network analyses of messages disseminated over social media in the United Kingdom, Turkey, Canada, and Venezuela, the nation branding-related impacts of election campaigns are investigated.

T1  - Return Imaginaries and Political Climate: Comparing Thinking About Return Mobilities Among Pakistani Origin Migrants and Descendants in Norway and the UK
AN  - 1865256726
AB  - The political climate on immigration and diversity in various European societies has previously been analysed in relation to media representations, policy regimes and public opinion. This paper focuses more narrowly on how political climates affect migrant and post-migrant generations, as inhabitants of these European societies. We focus on the impact of ambivalence resulting from perceived lack of recognition as full citizens in European societies among migrants and their descendants. Ambivalence in relation to experiences of particular traits of the political climate is further connected with ideas about mobility--how migrants and descendants may think about return migration--what we discuss in terms of 'return imaginaries'. Culture, ideology and representations are seen as significant for contemporary politics, not only with expressive but also with formative roles. With this perspective, the analysis explores three politically heated areas of debate: about immigration control, about social cohesion and integration agendas and about terrorist attacks. These three areas were inductively selected, drawing on analysis of qualitative data collected among Pakistani origin migrants and descendants in Norway and the UK. The two countries of residence are purposefully chosen because they in different ways reflect political climates affected by the rise of xenophobia and Islamophobia in Europe.

T1  - Media Messages and Perceptions of the Affordable Care Act during the Early Phase of Implementation
AN  - 1861031537
AB  - Public opinion about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has been polarized since the law's passage. Past research suggests these conditions would make any media influence on the public limited at best. However, during the early phase of implementation, locally broadcast ACA-related media messages -- in the form of paid health insurance and political advertisements and news media stories -- abounded as advocates, insurance marketers, and politicians sought to shape the public's perceptions of the law. To what extent did message exposure affect ACA perceptions during the first open enrollment period? We merge data on volumes of messaging at the media market level with nationally representative survey data to examine the relationship between estimated exposure to media messaging and the public's perceptions of how informed they were about and favorable toward the ACA in October 2013. We find that higher volumes of insurance advertising and local news coverage are associated with participants' perceptions of being informed about the law. Volumes of insurance advertising and of local news coverage are also associated with participants' favorability toward the law, but the relationship varies with partisanship, supporting the growing body of research describing partisan perceptual bias.

T1  - The Influence of Mass Media on the Evaluation of Effectiveness of Police Activity (Based on the Results of Sociological Research)
AN  - 2092573910
AB  - In the given article the problem of mass media influence on the public opinion formation about police activity is considered. The authors draw attention to the fact that the level of mass media confidence has declined lately. At present people began to reflect upon official mass media information. A significant change in the preferences of the population of Volgograd about information sources is marked. The comparative analysis of the sociological research conducted by the authors of the article points that people have come to prefer the Internet, social networks to television. The representation of the citizens about the police activity is inextricably linked to the issues of their personal safety. The authors assert that mass media are said to be one of the main factors that help the citizens form assessment of the police activity effectiveness to ensure their personal safety. During the analysis of the empirical data some correlation between the sense of the personal security of the respondents and the sources of the information about the police activity has been observed. The respondents receiving the information about law enforcement activity from mass media mainly feel a higher level of security than those who make judgments based on their personal experience. In conclusion the authors emphasize the positive dynamics in the public assessment of the police activity to ensure the personal security of the citizens that depends not only on improving the police activity in general, but also on the information provided to the citizens and, anyway, generates certain attitudes and stereotypes.

T1  - A Multicultural Nation and its (Muslim) Other? Political Leadership and Media Reporting in the Wake of the 'Sydney Siege'
AN  - 1801919020
AB  - This article explores public reactions to an event dubbed the 'Sydney siege', through an analysis of its media coverage. The event, where a Muslim man held 18 hostages in a Sydney café, was closely followed during its 22 hour duration and triggered an avalanche of public commentary. We analyse media articles, political leaders' media statements and transcripts of press conferences published within the week of the siege. Using NVivo software, we code the key themes arising from the data and employ in-depth textual and discourse analyses of the most prominent themes: multiculturalism, Islam/Muslims and 'community/solidarity'. Using the theoretical framework of the nation as an imagined community which needs its 'Others', we find that the 'Sydney siege' lead to emphasising hegemonic ideas of the Australian national identity and values that mark the boundaries of nationhood, community belonging and solidarity. Such ideas placed Muslims precariously at the national margin, applying a simplistic binary of the 'good ones' worthy of inclusion into the 'good nation' and the 'bad ones' to be excluded. We conclude that the public discourse following the Sydney siege affirmed Australian multiculturalism in a broad sense but also strongly implied the Otherness of Muslims.

T1  - The Best-Seller as an Indicator of Societal Narcissism
AN  - 1799811070
AB  - Narcissism has become inculcated in many aspects of modern society. It can be found in the growing popularity of social media which enable users to post "selfies;" in the competitive race for fame, beauty and extravagant lifestyles; and in the public's fascination with power-hungry and greedy politicians and businesspeople featured on television and in the movies. Narcissism thrives when members of society admire, flatter and promote individuals with grandiose ideas and fantastical dreams. This paper extends the research of Mullins and Kopelman (The Public Opinion Quarterly, 48: 720-730, 1984 ), which studied whether or not excessive concern with the self is on the rise, using bestsellers as an unobtrusive indicator of societal narcissism for the period, 1950-1979. Carrying this research forward for another thirty years, it was found over a 60-year period that the proportion of narcissistic-related bestsellers increased approximately 100 % for hardcovers (from 19 % to 35 %); and also over a 19-year period for Amazon sales (from 15 % to 35 %).

T1  - Of Echo Chambers and Contrarian Clubs: Exposure to Political Disagreement Among German and Italian Users of Twitter
AN  - 2342305396
AB  - Scholars have debated whether social media platforms, by allowing users to select the information to which they are exposed, may lead people to isolate themselves from viewpoints with which they disagree, thereby serving as political “echo chambers.” We investigate hypotheses concerning the circumstances under which Twitter users who communicate about elections would engage with (a) supportive, (b) oppositional, and (c) mixed political networks. Based on online surveys of representative samples of Italian and German individuals who posted at least one Twitter message about elections in 2013, we find substantial differences in the extent to which social media facilitates exposure to similar versus dissimilar political views. Our results suggest that exposure to supportive, oppositional, or mixed political networks on social media can be explained by broader patterns of political conversation (i.e., structure of offline networks) and specific habits in the political use of social media (i.e., the intensity of political discussion). These findings suggest that disagreement persists on social media even when ideological homophily is the modal outcome, and that scholars should pay more attention to specific situational and dispositional factors when evaluating the implications of social media for political communication.

T1  - Emotion in obesity discourse: understanding public attitudes towards regulations for obesity prevention
AN  - 1787933219
AB  - Intense concern about obesity in the public imagination and in political, academic and media discourses has catalysed advocacy efforts to implement regulatory measures to reduce the occurrence of obesity in Australia and elsewhere. This article explores public attitudes towards the possible implementation of regulations to address obesity by analysing emotions within popular discourses. Drawing on reader comments attached to obesity-relevant news articles published on Australian news and current affairs websites, we examine how popular anxieties about the 'obesity crisis' and vitriol directed at obese individuals circulate alongside understandings of the appropriate role of government to legitimise regulatory reform to address obesity. Employing Ahmed's theorisation of 'affective economies' and broader literature on emotional cultures, we argue that obesity regulations achieve popular support within affective economies oriented to neoliberal and individualist constructions of obesity. These economies preclude constructions of obesity as a structural problem in popular discourse; instead positioning anti-obesity regulations as a government-endorsed vehicle for discrimination directed at obese people. Findings implicate a new set of ethical challenges for those championing regulatory reform for obesity prevention.

T1  - Presenting welfare reform: poverty porn, telling sad stories or achieving change?
AN  - 2059564209
AB  - Much is written about the suffering resulting from welfare reform and other cuts for disabled people and others on the receiving end. Usually this is seen as a 'good thing'. But is it as simple as that? It may not be the same as so-called television poverty porn, but what is the point of constantly recycling welfare reform's effects? Judging from last May's general election, doing this does not seem to have had a significant effect on public politics/attitudes. So perhaps we need to look at it more carefully. When might discussion of welfare reform be helpful and when unhelpful? Is not the real task to develop alternatives, rather than hope as the Fabians did, that if we show how awful things are, 'then something will have to be done'?

T1  - Testing the Selective Exposure-Polarization Hypothesis in Israel Using Three Indicators of Ideological News Exposure and Testing for Mediating Mechanisms
AN  - 1774576248
AB  - While an empirical association between exposure to ideologically congruent media sources and polarization has been substantiated in various studies, recent criticisms suggest that perhaps it is biased reports of ideological exposure that may account for the association. In addition, our understanding of the mechanism underlying the relationship between selective exposure (SE) and polarization is still limited. The present investigation addresses the first problem by using an unobtrusive indicator of SE and the second problem by exploring two possible mediators: the use of arguments from ideological media in political conversations and perceptions about the climate of public opinion. Respondents were recruited using advertisements published in mainstream, right-wing, and left-wing news outlets in Israel, and completed a survey tapping the constructs under investigation. Three different indicators of SE -- the online news outlet from which the respondents were recruited (ideological/mainstream), self-reported frequency of exposure to predefined congruent ideological media, and the tendency to prefer congruent political materials -- were significantly related to polarization. Results also demonstrated that the effect of SE on polarization is mediated through opinion climate perceptions, but the use of arguments from media in conversations did not mediate between SE and polarization.

T1  - Filter Bubbles, Echo Chambers, and Online News Consumption
AN  - 1786556699
AB  - Online publishing, social networks, and web search have dramatically lowered the costs of producing, distributing, and discovering news articles. Some scholars argue that such technological changes increase exposure to diverse perspectives, while others worry that they increase ideological segregation. We address the issue by examining web-browsing histories for 50,000 US-located users who regularly read online news. We find that social networks and search engines are associated with an increase in the mean ideological distance between individuals. However, somewhat counterintuitively, these same channels also are associated with an increase in an individual's exposure to material from his or her less preferred side of the political spectrum. Finally, the vast majority of online news consumption is accounted for by individuals simply visiting the home pages of their favorite, typically mainstream, news outlets, tempering the consequences -- both positive and negative -- of recent technological changes. We thus uncover evidence for both sides of the debate, while also finding that the magnitude of the effects is relatively modest. [web URL: http://poq.oxfordjournals.org/content/80/S1/298.abstract]

T1  - The Gap between Public Preferences and Policies on Immigration: A Comparative Examination of the Effect of Politicisation on Policy Congruence
AN  - 2076972757
AB  - The existence of a gap between public preferences for more restrictive immigration policies and relatively expansive immigration policy in Western democracies has received considerable attention. Sometimes, this gap has been explained by the nature of immigration policies: dominated by elites while the public remained uninterested. In many countries, however, immigration has gained considerable salience among the public. There are competing expectations and accounts relating to whether policy-makers ignore or follow public demands on immigration. In this article we examine the potential drivers of variations in the opinion-policy gap on immigration in seven countries (1995-2010). We analyse the effect of the politicisation of immigration on this opinion-policy gap. The strength of anti-immigrant parties is unrelated to the opinion-policy gap on immigration. The salience of the issue and the intensity of the public debate are associated with the opinion-policy gap, and the combination of negative attitudes with extensive media coverage seems particularly conducive to policy congruence.

T1  - Human Interest Framing of Irregular Immigration: An Empirical Study of Public Preferences for Personalized News Stories in the United States, France, and Norway: PROD
AN  - 1681928797
AB  - The media have a strong tendency to frame political issues with a focus on personal and emotional cases. We do not, however, know if there is a close link between the news media's use of these frames and the news preferences of the public. Such a close relationship may exist either because human interest news coverage is driven by audience demand or because the public might be influenced by the degree of individual news stories in the news. On the other hand, the audience's news preferences may be unrelated to the actual media coverage on irregular immigration due to citizens' selective media exposure, which may be driven by political predispositions. Based on a large quantitative content analysis conducted in the United States, France, and Norway and a following public opinion survey in the same countries, we find that the application of a human interest frame in a country's news coverage of irregular immigration does not correspond with the public's preferences for this type of news coverage. On the individual level, our findings demonstrate that liberal audience groups favor human interest-framed news coverage, while conservatives do not agree that individual news stories would provide a better understanding of the issue of irregular immigration.

T1  - Australian Muslim Jobseekers and Social Capital
AN  - 1685997106
AB  - In spite of the above, the educational attainment profile of Muslims in Australia is "either similar to or better than non-Muslim Australians. This applies to both Muslim men and women" ([Hassan] 2010, 579) even though qualifications do not translate into equitable labour force participation (Akbarzadeh, [G. Bouma], and [R. Woodlock] 2009). Muslims in Australia endure high levels of prejudice and intolerance (United Nations 2010), constituting a distinct labour market disadvantage ([Kabir] and Evans 2002). Muslims are frequently named by public sources as representing a threat to the nation (Northcote and [S. Casimiro] 2010). The Australian media has focused intensely on the risks posed by radical Islamist terrorism for Western nations (Rane 2010). Imtoual (2010, 56) names prejudice against Muslims in Australia as "religious racism". Anti-Muslim attitudes, negative stereotyping and cultural racism and discrimination, especially since 9/11, serve to disadvantage Muslims, creating limited opportunities for Muslim jobseekers in some occupations. Many Muslims "believe that as a result of this media bias, they are vilified in society, and particularly in the workplace" (Kabir 2006,313; see also Wise and [J. Ali] 2008). The subtle and not-so-subtle discrimination that Muslim jobseekers encounter constitutes a major obstacle to their labour force engagement (Kabir and Evans 2002). In viewing our data through a lens of social capital, we include this background Islamophobia when considering the preference for networking and support that we found among Muslim jobseeker informants.              Jobseekers of Muslim faith in Australia come from diverse backgrounds. Not only do they belong to many different ethnic groups but they vary widely in terms of length of time in Australia, English language fluency, educational attainment and labour market experience. They might be refugees, but might as easily be first, second and third generation immigrants. It was therefore a research challenge to study Muslim jobseekers as a group, even though this was the brief given by the project funding body itself: an Australian Government department, and we could not depart from it. Yet, in spite of the diversity of our informants, we found significant points of similarity in the Muslim jobseekers' accounts of their difficulties in entering the labour market, difficulties which were not inherent in ethnicity or any of the characteristics listed above. Rather, the participants in this study were judged, and felt judged first as Muslims, especially women who wore the headscarf and those who favoured pious practices. For example, one woman said,"[It's] not my accent but my appearance. So many times when I get a job over the phone and they ask me for interview. I could see the reaction when they see me wearing this scarf. They slam the door in my face" (R3,30s, F, Malaysian migrant). A male informant told us,"For me I try my best to dress up nicely and shave my beard almost everyday as I do not want anybody to think I am a complicated Muslim, could go to pray five times a day" (A3, 43, M, Arab-Iraqi refugee). We have already reported on our findings of the experience of Islamophobia for Muslim jobseekers elsewhere (see Lovat, Nilan, [H. Hosseini], Samarayi, Mansfield and Alexander 2013a, 2013b; Nilan 2011,2012; Nilan, Samarayi and Lovat 2012). In this article we focus on the strategies and networking practised by those who encounter implicit or explicit anti-Muslim prejudice in looking for work. It is appropriate not just to depict the social suffering of Muslim jobseekers but to give due consideration to the networking and communication strategies this group use to overcome such labour market disadvantage. The concept of social capital is a useful heuristic for the task we undertake below.

T1  - The Racialization of Muslims: Empirical Studies of Islamophobia
AN  - 1748865809; 201600778
AB  - Racialization is a concept that is theoretically underdeveloped. Although there has been an increased interest in Islamophobia since 9/11, it is very rarely discussed as racial in its nature. In this special issue on Islamophobia and the Racialization of Muslims scholars connect racism to Islamophobia. This issue situates racialization as a way to explain and understand Islamophobia, as racism towards a Muslim population. Through empirical studies, this issue uncovers the processes of racialization of Muslims and the rise of Islamophobia in both Europe and the USA. Case studies include the experiences of middle-class US Muslims; of white British converts to Islam; of young working-class British-Pakistani men; policing practices in Ireland; and the construction of Muslim identities through online comments about a reality television show. As well as identifying some issues specific to the nation, each case study also reveals the intersection of the racialization process with class and gender experiences.

T1  - The effect of television viewing on ethnic prejudice against immigrants: A study in the Italian context
AN  - 1735657105; 201536976
AB  - Television viewers construct many different meanings from the programs they watch. Here, we investigated whether ethnic prejudice is differentially influenced by the genre of television programs in their portrayal of ethnic minorities. We also wanted to determine whether a higher educational level reduces ethnic prejudice and television use. A self-reported questionnaire was administered to 401 Italian adults. Structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships between ethnic prejudice and television program contents and educational level. Viewing Reality and Variety Shows was positively related to ethnic prejudice, News and Public Affairs was negatively related, and Films and TV series had no apparent influence on prejudice. Educational level was negatively related to both ethnic prejudice and watching Reality and Variety Shows, and positively related to viewing News and Public Affairs and Films and TV series programs.

T1  - Rush, Rachel, and Rx: Modeling Partisan Media's Influence on Structural Knowledge of Healthcare Policy
AN  - 1728661647; 201534847
AB  - Examining the impact of various media sources on knowledge has a long tradition in political communication. Although much of the extant research focuses on the impact of traditional media on factual knowledge, research is expanding to include a variety of media sources and multiple dimensions of knowledge, in addition to understanding processes that better explain these relationships. Using a nationwide, opt-in online survey (n = 993), we examine the relationship between partisan media and structural knowledge, which assess how interconnected people see political concepts. Utilizing understanding of the Affordable Care Act as the content area of interest, we examine whether exposure to partisan media has differential effects on attitudinal ambivalence -- holding both positive and negative attitudes toward an object -- based on the political ideology of the respondent, and whether this impact of ambivalence influenced structural knowledge. Our results show that exposure to attitude-consistent media decreased attitudinal ambivalence. This exposure to attitude-consistent media results in a positive indirect effect on structural knowledge through this decrease in ambivalence. We find the reverse effect for use of attitude-inconsistent media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Moving Pictures? Experimental Evidence of Cinematic Influence on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1667953640; 201510697
AB  - Objectives Media effects research has generally ignored the possibility that popular films can affect political attitudes. This omission is puzzling for two reasons. First, research on public opinion finds the potential for persuasion is highest when respondents are unaware that political messages are being communicated. Second, multiple studies have found that entertainment media can alter public opinion. Together, this suggests that popular films containing political messages should possess the potential to influence attitudes. Methods We develop a laboratory experiment where subjects were randomly assigned to watch a control movie with no political messages, a movie with subtle political messages, or a movie with strong and explicit political messages. Results We find that popular movies possess the ability to change political attitudes, especially on issues that are unframed by the media. Furthermore, we show such influence persists over time and is not moderated by partisanship, ideology, or political knowledge. Conclusions Our key findings suggest that a renewed scholarly interest in the political influence of popular movies is clearly warranted. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revisiting Media Effects in Authoritarian Societies: Democratic Conceptions, Collectivistic Norms, and Media Access in Urban China
AN  - 1913993485
AB  - We argue that, to effectively understand media effects in authoritarian societies, researchers must assess different types of media strategies adopted by authoritarian leaders. Using survey data from two Chinese cities, we examine the effects of two types of media strategies adopted by the Chinese government, targeting political attitudes and nonpolitical values and norms, respectively. Following a new line of research, we contrast China's domestic-controlled media to foreign free media. After accounting for the selection bias in Chinese urbanites' media access, we do not find sufficient evidence for the effect of the media strategies directly targeting their democratic conceptions. However, sufficient and robust evidence shows that more intensive consumption of diverse media sources, including foreign media, does significantly but indirectly counteract the Chinese government's political campaigns targeting its citizens' democratic conceptions, via thwarting the government's media strategies to cultivate a collectivistic norm in the society.

T1  - Gay Bullying and Online Opinion Expression: Testing Spiral of Silence in the Social Media Environment
AN  - 1531932597; 201422693
AB  - Social network sites (SNSs) such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and LinkedIn have recently attracted the attention of public opinion scholars. However, research testing existing public opinion theories in a social media context is scarce. This study represents arguably the first empirical examination of the spiral of silence theory in the social media environment. Through an experimental manipulation embedded in an Internet survey, respondents (N = 760) were presented with a hypothetical scenario (i.e., friendly or hostile) concerning gay bullying, an issue suited for investigation due to its moral components. Willingness to self-censor and to some extent, congruency with the national opinion climate were significant predictors of various online opinion response strategies, indicating the presence of the spiral of silence phenomenon in the social media environment. However, individual characteristics such as issue importance were related to willingness to communicate about the issue, suggesting a liberating effect on opinion expression.

T1  - Social Media in Public Opinion Research: Executive Summary of the Aapor Task Force on Emerging Technologies in Public Opinion Research
AN  - 1735655593; 201537262
AB  - Public opinion research is entering a new era, one in which traditional survey research may play a less dominant role. The proliferation of new technologies, such as mobile devices and social-media platforms, is changing the societal landscape across which public opinion researchers operate. As these technologies expand, so does access to users' thoughts, feelings, and actions expressed instantaneously, organically, and often publicly across the platforms they use. The ways in which people both access and share information about opinions, attitudes, and behaviors have gone through a greater transformation in the past decade than perhaps in any previous point in history, and this trend appears likely to continue. The ubiquity of social media and the opinions users express on social media provide researchers with new data-collection tools and alternative sources of qualitative and quantitative information to augment or, in some cases, provide alternatives to more traditional data-collection methods. The reasons to consider social media in public opinion and survey research are no different than those of any alternative method. We are ultimately concerned with answering research questions, and this often requires the collection of data in one form or another. This may involve the analysis of data to obtain qualitative insights or quantitative estimates. The quality of data and the ability to help accurately answer research questions are of paramount concern. Other practical considerations include the cost efficiency of the method and the speed at which the data can be collected, analyzed, and disseminated. If the combination of data quality, cost efficiency, and timeliness required by a study can best be achieved through the use of social media, then there is reason to consider these methods for research. An additional reason to consider social media in public opinion and survey research is its explosion in popularity over the past several years. At a time when many are eschewing landline telephones (Blumberg and Luke 2013) or actively taking steps to prevent unsolicited contact (e.g., caller ID, restricted-access buildings), many are now communicating and interacting online via social-networking sites. It is only natural for researchers to aim to meet potential respondents where they have the best chance of getting their attention and potentially gaining their cooperation. However, this brave new world is not without its share of issues and pitfalls--technological, statistical, methodological, and ethical--and much remains to be investigated. As the leading association of public opinion research professionals, AAPOR is uniquely situated to examine and assess the potential impact of new 'emerging technologies' on the broader discipline and industry of opinion research. In September 2012, the AAPOR Council approved the formation of the Emerging Technologies Task Force with the goal of focusing on two critical areas: smartphones as data-collection vehicles and social media as platform and information source. The current report focuses on social media; a companion report covers mobile data collection. This report examines the potential impact of social media on public opinion research--as a vehicle for facilitating some aspect of the survey research process (i.e., questionnaire development, recruitment, locating, etc.) and/or augmenting or replacing traditional survey research methods (i.e., content analysis of existing data). We distinguish between qualitative insights and quantitative indicators from social media and discuss the factors that must be evaluated to determine its fitness for use.

T1  - Examining the Hostile Media Effect as an Intergroup Phenomenon: The Role of Ingroup Identification and Status
AN  - 1448995880; 201343457
AB  - This approach conceptualizes the hostile media effect (HME) as an intergroup phenomenon. Two empirical studies, one quasi-experimental and one experimental, examine the HME in the context of the abortion debate. Both studies show that ingroup identification and group status qualify the HME. Pro-choice and pro-life group members perceived an identical newspaper article as biased against their own viewpoint only if they considered their ingroup to have a lower status in society than the outgroup. In addition, only group members with a stronger ingroup identification showed a HME, particularly because of self-investment components of ingroup identification. Taken together, the findings confirm the important influence of ingroup status and ingroup identification on the HME. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Diversity policy, social dominance, and intergroup relations: Predicting prejudice in changing social and political contexts
AN  - 1417522926; 201331923
AB  - In contrast to authors of previous single-nation studies, we propose that supporting multiculturalism (MC) or assimilation (AS) is likely to have different effects in different countries, depending on the diversity policy in place in a particular country and the associated norms. A causal model of intergroup attitudes and behaviors, integrating both country-specific factors (attitudes and perceived norms related to a particular diversity policy) and general social-psychological determinants (social dominance orientation), was tested among participants from countries where the pro-diversity policy was independently classified as low, medium, or high (N = 1,232). Results showed that (a) anti-Muslim prejudice was significantly reduced when the pro-diversity policy was high; (b) countries differed strongly in perceived norms related to MC and AS, in ways consistent with the actual diversity policy in each country and regardless of participants' personal attitudes toward MC and AS; (c) as predicted, when these norms were salient, due to subtle priming, structural equation modeling with country included as a variable provided support for the proposed model, suggesting that the effect of country on prejudice can be successfully accounted by it; and (d) consistent with the claim that personal support for MC and AS played a different role in different countries, within-country mediation analyses provided evidence that personal attitudes toward AS mediated the effect of social dominance orientation on prejudice when pro-diversity policy was low, whereas personal attitudes toward MC was the mediator when pro-diversity policy was high. Thus, the critical variables shaping prejudice can vary across nations. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - Rethinking Anti-Immigration Rhetoric after the Oslo and Utoya Terror Attacks
AN  - 1315600468; 201308603
AB  - This article examines right-wing populism and populist rhetoric in Norway preceding the July 22, 2011 terror attacks at Utoya and in Oslo. It describes how the mainstream media, academics, and political parties have appealed to the public in an increasingly populist fashion and have spread fear about immigration, immigrants, and integration. It argues that while the populist right-wing Progress Party has adopted immigration and integration as its main cause and has gained support because of it, the Progress Party alone cannot be blamed for the widespread xenophobia in Norway. The media are also responsible for the way immigration, culture, and race have been reported, as are a wide range of politicians for formulating increasingly stricter immigration policies. In the aftermath of July 22 politicians became acutely concerned about their own anti-immigrant rhetoric and how it may have influenced the terrorist Anders Behring Breivik. A broad consensus to address and change the language used in the immigration debate was agreed upon; more openness and more democracy was promised. Much has changed, but even more has stayed the same in Norwegian politics and attitudes to immigration and Islam. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Surveying Japanese Media Usage during the Beijing Olympics As a Measure of Audience Attitudes towards China and the Chinese
AN  - 1551002337; 201429498
AB  - An online survey of 624 respondents was divided evenly between men and women, with exactly 104 subjects in each of the six generational groupings. The respondents' occupational and other demographic characteristics do not deviate significantly from Japanese averages comprising a good cross-representational Japanese sample. A pre-Olympic survey was conducted on August 6-7, followed by a second survey carried out after the Olympics on September 1-2, 2008. Audience images of China and the Chinese improved as a result of exposure to media content during the Olympics period, although the improvements varied in degree somewhat depending on the issue at hand. As for reported audience attitudes towards China and the Chinese, the pre- to post-Olympic shifts were far less significant than observations of stable (i.e. apparently not significantly influenced by Olympics media coverage) attitudes/impressions in line with the audience members' individual ideological orientation. Among the ideological-type groups, those in the 'National Regime'-oriented group had more salient and robust attitudes, in general, towards many items surveyed in the research. In terms of the reported preferred media use, the audience was categorised into three groups: newspaper readers/radio listeners, television watchers/Internet users and cellular phone users. Each group displayed similar tendencies regarding the relationship of individual ideological orientation and these individuals' respective evaluations of China/Chinese.

T1  - Foreign Wars and Domestic Prejudice: How Media Exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Predicts Ethnic Stereotyping by Jewish and Arab American Adolescents
AN  - 1283637696; 201305725
AB  - This study was based on the theory that adolescents view scenes of violent ethnic conflicts in the mass media through the lens of their own ethnicity, and that the resulting social-cognitive reactions influence their negative stereotypes about similar ethnic groups in their own country. We interviewed 89 Jewish and 180 Arab American high school students about their exposure to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, their social cognitive reactions to it, and their stereotypes toward ethnic groups. Beyond the effects of ethnic identity, the degree to which adolescents identified with Israelis and Palestinians in the media was a key variable linking exposure to media depictions of the conflict and the implicit ethnic stereotypes they displayed about Jewish Americans and Arab Americans.

AB  - Social and political tensions heightened after the attacks of 9/11 have created an increase in Islamophobia. Historically, vilified depictions of Muslims have legitimized discriminatory acts against Muslim Americans. In this context, Islamophobia has infiltrated our classrooms, making it urgent for educators to develop a critical pedagogical stance that counters discrimination and demystifies stereotypes against Muslim American students.

T1  - What's the point? Anti-racism and students' voices against Islamophobia
AN  - 1023030338; 201225475
AB  - In a climate of Islamophobic racism, where media racism saturates our TV screens and newspapers, where racism on the streets, on campus, in our community become everyday realities, I ask, what can we -- teachers, lecturers and educationalists -- do in the work of anti-racism in education? This article examines classroom debates on Islamophobia by exploring the connections between student experiences and the wider social political issues and ideologies that create and re-enforce racism. The underlying interest for me is to examine the ways in which classroom interaction; dialogue and exchanges can undo racist thinking by informed anti-racist critique. This article has three sections; first, I discuss the multicultural and anti-racist discourses within education in the British context. I then go on to explore theoretical developments found in Critical Race Theory (CRT) as a tool for this anti-racism in education. In the second section I examine Islamophobia, the hatred of Muslims, as a measurement of current racism. My interest is to explore the meanings of Islamophobia, and its relevance to students lived realities. Media representation and text on Islamophobia are used as a way of pulling out the student views and lived experiences of such racism. In the final section I raise the question of 'what's the point of studying racism?' Here I discuss a class seminar on the viewing of a YouTube role play of a racist incident against a hijaab wearing woman. The point here is to unpack student's views and reactions to Islamophobia. I conclude that classroom discussions can be a place where anti-racist, anti-sexist and anti-oppressive views emerge to inform the discussion for social justice in education.

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1907814848
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - Covering the crisis: Media coverage of the economic crisis and citizens' economic expectations
AN  - 919905066; 201202004
AB  - The 2008-2009 worldwide economic crisis serves as a backdrop to this study of the dynamics of citizens' economic expectations. Economic expectations are identified as crucial for a range of political attitudes. This study is the first to consider how information affects evaluations in times of a severe crisis, as prior research of information effects on economic evaluations took place in more stable economic times. It links citizens' news exposure and the content of economic news coverage with changes in prospective economic assessments. Drawing on a three-wave panel study and on a media content analysis between the panel waves, we thus provide a dynamic assessment of media influences on changes in economic evaluations. The results demonstrate that media exposure strongly affected expectations regarding the future development of the national economic situation, while being largely unrelated to personal economic expectations. We furthermore show that media dependency increases the magnitude of the media effect. We discuss the disconnect between personal and national economic evaluations with regard to mass-mediated economic information. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The media and attitudes towards crime and the justice system: A qualitative approach
AN  - 914766504; 201201128
AB  - The role of the media in shaping attitudes towards crime and the justice system has been a heavily researched topic. It has obvious relevance to the procedural justice perspective, in that media representations may have a mediating relationship between the behaviour of institutions of justice and public perceptions of them. Most of these studies have used quantitative methods in order to establish a relationship between attitudes and media consumption. A relationship has been demonstrated on several occasions, but its causal nature has not been proven. However, the difficulty of identifying a direct causal media effect should not lead us to abandon completely the idea that the media have some influence in shaping attitudes towards crime and the justice system. We should look for more sophisticated theories to explain the formation of public opinion and the role of the media in it, and, in addition to the quantitative analysis of statistical data, we should move towards audience research and the use of more qualitative methods. The research reported here used focus group methods to understand how and how much people rely on the media when interpreting issues of crime and evaluating justice institutions.

T1  - All The News You Want To Hear: The Impact Of Partisan News Exposure On Political Participation
AN  - 896169241; 201120518
AB  - In a news media environment characterized by abundant choice, it is becoming increasingly easy for Americans to choose news sources slanted toward their own political views rather than sources providing more diverse perspectives. This development poses a challenge to ideals of deliberative democracy if people who consume politically like-minded news disproportionately populate the electoral process, while those presumably reaping the benefits of exposure to more diverse views in the news (e.g., more informed, tolerant attitudes) withdraw from politics. Using panel data collected during the 2008 presidential campaign, this study investigates the proposition that exposure to news slanted toward one's own partisan views increases political participation, while exposure to news with the opposite partisan slant depresses participation. The results suggest that, while exposure to partisan news does not alter the strongly habitual decision to turn out, the hypothesized energizing and enervating effects of exposure do appear for other behavior during the campaign; the partisan hue of the news sources citizens choose to consume affects both when voters decide and their levels of participation over time.

In the face of declining support of US government policies in the Muslim world, this study examines the credibility and effectiveness of Radio Sawa in an attempt to understand its effectiveness as a communication tool. The study explores differences in credibility and other dimensions among the United Arab Emirates (UAE) population; surveying both those who use this new medium and those who do not. Results of the study reveal the effectiveness of the US government in reaching its objectives in the region. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1928755819
AB  - Mass media have been considered a powerful agent of political socialization, affecting political attitudes and behaviors of voters and non-voters. This study employed a survey of international students in the US to investigate the effects of print, television and online news on political socialization during the 2008 US presidential race. Results indicated that newspaper and television news use significantly predicted internal political efficacy and intentions to participate in American politics. Media 'nationality', motivation to apply for permanent residence and duration of stay in the US were explored for possible moderation of media effects on political socialization. The findings are discussed within the framework of media effects on political socialization in host and home countries.

T1  - The Influence of Spanish-Language Media on Latino Public Opinion and Group Consciousness
AN  - 902083233; 201122263
AB  - Objective: This article determines if the use of Spanish-language media among Latinos influences public opinion on various policy issues and group consciousness. Methods: Using a 2004 national public opinion survey of U.S. Latinos, a multivariate analysis is run to determine the effect of language media preference on immigration policy, abortion, same-sex marriage, and three measures of group consciousness. Results: I find more frequent use of Spanish-language media leads to more liberal attitudes toward immigration, but has no effect on opinions toward abortion and same-sex marriage. I also find increased use of Spanish-language media leads to increased levels of group consciousness. Conclusions: The differences in attitudes are due to the diverging goals of Spanish-language and English-language media. The effect of using Spanish-language media serves to promote a sense of group consciousness among Latinos by reinforcing roots in Latin America and the commonalities among Latinos of varying national origin.

T1  - Media Influences on Public Perceptions of Ethnic Groups, Generations, and Individuals
AN  - 870433288; 201114496
AB  - America's pluralistic society is growing increasingly diverse as groups compete for media representation. This article focuses on people's perceptions of how their ethnic group is portrayed in the media, as well as the issue of media influence on the values portrayed. A cross-sectional survey in a major Midwest metro area measured perceived importance of values and their portrayal in the media, finding that TV viewing is correlated with perceived media representatives of one's own values and TV news viewing is associated with perceptions of media portrayals of the values of one's ethnic group. Results indicate that several dimensions of values recognized in the media are linked to people's perceptions of how the media portray people like them, their generation, and their ethnic group.

T1  - When Knowledge Is a Double-Edged Sword: Contact, Media Exposure, and American China Policy Preferences
AN  - 1023025487; 201224892
AB  - Globalization affords greater opportunities to learn about foreign peoples than in the past. What impacts do interpersonal contact, media exposure to and knowledge about China have on the American people's China policy preferences? Two large surveys of U.S. citizens were conducted in the summers of 2008 and 2009 to explore whether knowledge about China and prejudice against the Chinese people and the Chinese government would mediate the relationship between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and U.S. China policy preferences on the other. Results show that while knowledge played the expected mediating roles between contact and media exposure on the one hand, and prejudice against the Chinese people on the other, greater knowledge of China was actually associated with greater negativity toward the Chinese government, which in turn contributed to desires for tougher China policies. Both media exposure and interpersonal contact thus had mixed effects on China policy preferences. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Making the News: Movement Organizations, Media Attention, and the Public Agenda
AN  - 908525916
AB  - Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteerled, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Race and Ethnic Representations of Lawbreakers and Victims in Crime News: A National Study of Television Coverage
AN  - 216935952
AB  - Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002-2003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support.
