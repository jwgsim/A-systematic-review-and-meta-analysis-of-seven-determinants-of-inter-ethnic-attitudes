T1  - When is Disinformation (In)Credible? Experimental Findings on Message Characteristics and Individual Differences
AN  - 2419900450
AB  - Disinformation on the Internet has become a major threat to our society. Especially false and inaccurate information in the form of news might have detrimental consequences for the democratic process when biasing individuals’ political views. To combat disinformation, a necessary first step is to investigate the factors relevant for individuals to detected false information online. Hence, we conducted an experiment (N = 294) to investigate effects of message factors and individual differences on individuals’ credibility and accuracy perceptions of disinformation as well as on their likelihood of sharing them. Results suggest that message factors, such as the source, inconsistencies, subjectivity, sensationalism, or manipulated images, seem less important for users’ evaluations of disinformation articles than individual differences. While need for cognition seems most relevant for accuracy perceptions, the opinion toward the news topic seems most crucial for whether people believe in the news and share it online.

T1  - Toward a More Just Feminism
AN  - 2408484316
AB  - The history of the women’s movements and women’s involvement in civic causes and actions shows that commitment to women’s causes is no guarantee that other human rights issues will be supported. Instances of racism and other prejudices that have impacted women’s groups in the United States will be used to illustrate the contradiction, and corollary patterns from the present will be used to show that the disconnect between promoting women’s causes and other pressing human rights issues remains. I will use the exemplar of citation practices as one aspect of contemporary professional behavior that may contribute to the ongoing invisibility of accomplishments by women and scholars of color of any gender. I will also demonstrate some tools that, combined with better self-awareness, can improve the visibility of all members of underrepresented groups. The challenge we face is to convert awareness of the complex intersections between gender and racial issues into the application of feminist values across the full spectrum of human experience.

T1  - The historical understanding of female premodern possessions. Problematizing some gender assumptions in the historiography on Teresa de Ávila and Jeanne des Anges
AN  - 2333552612
AB  - This paper discusses how to approach the history of female possessions today. By analyzing some recent contributions applied to two well-known historical figures: Teresa de Ávila (1515-1582) and Jeanne des Anges (1602-1665), I will problematize some of the ongoing history of female possessions. I intend a reflection on two of the current conceptual frameworks that feature the way history explains the subjective experience of these premodern possessed individuals. I focus on two kinds of interpretation: one I call the 'neurotic' interpretation, and the other the 'subversive' interpretation. Both constructions underpin explanations of women's divine and demonic possessions, involving historiographical gender prejudices and ahistorical assumptions.

T1  - The Role of Political Leaders on the Prespa Agreement
AN  - 2447287443
AB  - The relations between Macedonia and Greece have been very tense over the name dispute during the last 30 years. This political issue kept Macedonia outside the NATO alliance since 2008, when it first attempted to join, and was refused by Greece because of the name issue. The main problem consisted on the fact that Greece did not recognize Macedonia with its formal name instead, and that it should be called Former Yugoslavian Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). In this paper we will be analyzing the role of political leaders from both countries (Greece and Macedonia) during the Prespa Meetings and their efforts and obstacles in reaching the Agreement, which set a new page of diplomacy between Greece and Macedonia.By using different scientific methodologies such as literature review, analyses of the official text and document, as well as analyses of the media from the both countries, we are going to try to find the causes and consequences of these policies from both sides, and the impact that the international community had on the resolving the crisis. In order to reach the whole picture on the situation, we will analyze the result of the referendum regarding the name issue, the boycott of the referendum by the opposition VMRO-DPMNE, the use of nationalism for political gains and the voting on the name change on the parliament, as well as the role the Albanian community on the final outcome.

T1  - The process to rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States
AN  - 2318469669
AB  - Despite the lingering conflict between the government of Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States, issues of remittance and relationship relaxation between the refugees and Vietnamese government happened both in the 1990s. Recent years have seen the attitude-change of the returning diaspora and their shifting strategies of working in Vietnam. This paper describes the first step toward rapprochement between Vietnam and its diaspora in the United States, by analysing the attempts of Vietnam to approach its diaspora in the United States and the reactions of the diasporic community members. On the other hand, it also describes the efforts of Vietnamese Americans to empower Vietnamese people through philanthropic and civic engagement activities. The rapprochement via media and civic engagement reveals a shift from hard, intense ideological conflict to soft tactics in the transnational relation between Vietnam and the Vietnamese diaspora in the United States. This paper concludes that the process to rapprochement is still challenged by the significant differences in political views between the two sides. It suggests that the process of negotiation and conflict resolution be conducted with openness, honesty and acceptance of differences.

T1  - Changing Connotations and the Evolution of the Effect of Wording: Labeling Asylum Seekers in a Political Campaign
AN  - 2431021276
AB  - This paper investigates the moderating role of public discourse in the effects of labeling asylum seekers (as “immigrants” vs. “refugees”) on attitudes toward asylum policy. The study relies on a series of survey experiments conducted in Hungary, in a period when asylum policy suddenly became a highly salient issue there. Originally, respondents were much more solidaristic toward “refugees” than “immigrants,” but the public discussion on asylum policy suppressed this wording effect—mainly by contaminating the concept of “refugee.” By using data on news reports and respondents’ media use, the analysis also looks at the roots of these changes. In particular, it presents evidence on the moderating role of converging connotations of different labels on the effect of wording.

T1  - New Perspectives on International Public Relations: Engaging Foreign Stakeholders: PROD
AN  - 2298075980
AB  - The field of public relations has been transformed in past decades by globalization as well as by the emergence and prominence of social and digital platforms. Where once limited to their own geographic regions, organizations are now required to adapt to a fast-moving global environment where geography and organizational stakeholders span across the four corners of the world. This new scenario brings challenges not only to public relations scholars but also to practitioners and companies. In fact, as new markets emerge along with new global actors, long-held assumptions regarding the theory and practice of public relations, which once seemed immutable as well as reflected predominantly a Western perspective, are now being challenged. Recognizing the strategic relationship management function as the key focus in the public relations field (Ki & Hon, 2007; Ledingham & Bruning, 1998), international public relations has become another byproduct of globalization.

T1  - Crime News Effects and Democratic Accountability: Experimental Evidence From Repeated Exposure in a Multiweek Online Panel
AN  - 2432396439
AB  - Publics hold chief executives uniquely responsible for national well-being, and they learn about national conditions through news. But when news disproportionately covers problems, what happens to democratic accountability? Here, we experimentally test how leader approval changes when crime loses prominence in news for a sustained period. We create an online news environment coding real news in real time, then experimentally filter news for nationally diverse U.S. panelists over 1 week. We find causal evidence that reducing crime news raises presidential approval and depresses problem importance evaluations for crime. No other leaders are credited, and reducing all problems produces no further gains. These effects persist well after exposure but dissipate within a week. We conclude with broad implications for journalism and democratic judgment.

AN  - 2335665413
AB  - This study deals with the penetration of the Internet in all spheres of life, including its increasing influence on the political views of people. Internet memes are becoming a specific reflection of modern reality and a new kind of sociopolitical discourse. Therefore, the study aimed to study and analyze the most popular Internet memes in the Chinese media space, compare the main trends in modern Chinese, and determine their connection with key events within China and abroad. The main result of the study was the identification of new linguistic and cultural characteristics in the compilation of the Internet meme. Moreover, during the study, it was proved that most of the Internet memes are socially or politically colored, some of them penetrate from unofficial Internet space to a higher language level and are included in the generally accepted active language reserve.

T1  - Tanni Grey-Thompson - 'The one that got away': a theological analysis of foeticide, infanticide and the deviant Paralympic success story
AN  - 2178535253
AB  - In this essay, I apply a theological perspective to argue that the Paralympic Games, its athletes and the media, unwittingly collude to demonstrate contempt towards the killing of disabled children, whilst claiming that disability equality has been improved or achieved. I argue that British Paralympic athlete Tanni Grey-Thompson was destined to succeed because many of her potential competitors were denied the right to life. British newspapers and publicly available figures related to the killing of disabled children in the United Kingdom are contrasted against the positive narrative about disabled people promoted by the International Paralympic Committee. I make reference to Christian bio-medical ethics to draw attention to the medical profession's negative attitudes towards disabled people in the early 1900s, which provided execution techniques for the Nazi holocaust. I conclude by contending that the genocide of disabled children continues unabated despite the positive and dominant discourse attached to the Paralympic Games.

T1  - Gaydar, Marriage, and Rip-Roaring Homosexuals: Discourses About Homosexuality in Dear Abby and Ann Landers Advice Columns, 1967-1982
AN  - 2167561850
AB  - Over the past 70 years, the history of acceptance of the lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) community within the United States has seen much change and fluctuation. One of the places that this dialogue has been preserved is through the syndicated advice columns of Dear Abby and Ann Landers, in which individuals in the United States were writing in for advice to deal with their anxiety over a newly emerging and highly visible new community of individuals once considered to be mentally ill and dangerous. Using discourse analysis, this article traces the evolution of public and scientific opinions about the LGBT community during the years leading up to the Stonewall riots all the way to right before the AIDs epidemic. This analysis sheds light on several moral panics that emerged regarding this newly visible population, especially in regard to disturbances within the domestic sphere and a stigmatization of bisexuality.

T1  - Muslim Surveillance in Japan: A Narrative Aimed at Trivialization
AN  - 2410492899
AB  - In 2010, it came to light through leaked internal documents that the Japanese police were engaging in sweeping, blanket surveillance of all foreign national Muslims in the country. The police deemed all Muslims to be potential terrorists, surveilled mosques and other establishments, and clandestinely gathered detailed personal information on 72,000 persons. Almost immediately after the leak, a narrative was created by the media and the authorities, whereby Muslims had been subjected to harm through the malicious leaking of their personal information. This narrative recognized the responsibility of the police insofar as they had been unable to adequately secure the information; however, it served to deflect attention from the fundamental human rights issues. This narrative was eventually accepted by the Japanese judiciary, in a judgment with potentially grave consequences for human rights protection in Japan in general.

T1  - Fluid identities and navigating integration: The politics of solidarity in contemporary Germany
AN  - 2049548294
AB  - Due to political, economic and environmental factors, global immigration will only increase. Using Germany as a case study, the research question addressed in this article is not if the public thinks immigrants and asylum seekers should be permitted entrance to politically stable countries, but rather once they have arrived, what active strategies can be implemented to achieve healthy integration and who should set the agenda? A qualitative data analysis, culled from interviews conducted during the summer of 2016, contribute to the debate on public opinion around the politicization of immigration and identity. This analysis examines the media coverage of specific socially and politically charged events in relation to Germany’s solidarity movement, known as <italic>Willkommenkultur</italic> (welcome culture). The study found that the way in which a society defines, frames and understands the motivations behind its movements of opposition, or solidarity, potentially allows for a shift in perspective leading to a reimagining of what is and what could be.

T1  - Selective Exposure, Information Utility, and the Decision to Watch Televised Debates
AN  - 2187591866
AB  - Why do people watch televised election debates? This article considers the role of three factors highlighted in recent research on political news exposure: selective approach toward attitude-congruent information; selective avoidance of attitude-incongruent information; and information utility. I test the distinct effects of these three factors on viewing decisions by taking advantage of Austria’s unique organization of televised debates as pairwise match-ups between the main party leaders. I find that selective approach dominates selective avoidance and that information utility increases exposure propensity. Beyond explaining debate viewership, these findings have general implications for understanding exposure to political information, particularly during campaigns.

T1  - Muslims in Europe: Citizenship, Multiculturalism and Integration
AN  - 1975714370
AB  - This article provides an analysis of the concerns in relation to citizenship and multicultural reforms in Europe. It examines the implications for the social integration of Muslims, who seemingly face insurmountable constitutional hurdles notwithstanding liberal institutional attempts, in accommodating a religion that, judged by its global politicisation, may pose more a challenge to multicultural societies than to others. While shedding light on recent developments concerning a wide-ranging panorama of the socio-legal dynamics of integrating Muslim communities in Europe, the article provides an overview of the multicultural idea, focusing on how some European countries address multicultural claims swiftly while others lag behind, busy with more basic issues of immigrant assimilation and integration. It is argued that while attempts are being made to improve Muslim integration, the rising tide of Islamophobia (political and media-manufactured), anti-terrorism legislations and security policies serve to provide a multi-pronged attack on civil liberties and freedoms of Muslim groups. In the concluding section, there will be general remarks concerning the future of Muslims in Europe and the commendable and realisable aim of Muslims to construct an inclusive national identity and find partners who will, like them, be determined to approve what Western culture produces in terms of its positive contributions and resist its deleterious effects on the human, societal and environmental levels.

T1  - Examining the impact of integrated and non-integrated parasport events on volunteer attitudes towards disability
AN  - 1947106134
AB  - Attitudes, and attitudinal change towards persons with disabilities, is an important area of research as it can potentially enable greater understanding of the constraints that may preclude full participation in society. In the realm of sport and recreation mega sporting events have been suggested as a potential catalyst for positive societal change and shifting negative attitudes. Much of the event research to date, however, has focused on able-bodied sport events, with parasport events being largely overlooked. As a result, the impact of major parasport events on attitudinal change towards persons with a disability is assumed by sport practitioners, policy-makers and politicians but not justified by empirical evidence. The current study thus presents a starting point by examining the benefits of hosting mega sport events and in particular focuses on an important event stakeholder group; volunteers. More specifically, the current study addresses volunteer's perceptions of attitudes towards disability at two major parasport events: the 2014 Commonwealth Games (where parasport was integrated with the able-bodied sport) and the 2015 Pan Am/ParaPan American Games (where parasport was separated from the able-bodied sport). Data were collected at two time points for each event: pre-Games, and post-Games. Results revealed that both events had an impact on volunteer awareness levels of disability and accessibility-related issues, as well as positively impacting attitudes towards persons with disability. Interestingly, the integrated events at the Commonwealth Games appeared to impact attitudes to a greater degree than the non-integrated events at the ParaPan Am Games. Implications are discussed pertaining to the impact of an integrated vs. non-integrated major parasport event on disability/accessibility awareness, and attitudes towards disability.

T1  - Cumulative and Long-Term Campaign Advertising Effects on Trust and Talk
AN  - 2502810151
AB  - Most studies of political advertising have failed to consider that advertising effects may build up across multiple election seasons or extend past Election Day. This study investigates the short-term and long-term effects of both same-cycle and multi-cycle exposure to campaign advertising on political and social trust and modes of political talk. Using survey data and campaign advertising data, we test the effects of ad volume and ad negativity. We find effects of both same-cycle and cumulative exposure to advertising. Some are fleeting effects, but the majority of them are sustained or sleeper effects, emerging long after the campaign has ended. These results suggest that scholars should extend their focus beyond same-cycle effects measured during or just after a single campaign.

T1  - How Voters Combine Candidates on the Ballot: The Case of the Philippine Senatorial Elections
AN  - 2502808646
AB  - In the Philippines, senators are nationally elected officials, and citizens vote for 12 candidates every three years. The country’s electoral features include a weak party system, a low-information environment for voters, and a history of political dynasty rule and preponderance of media celebrities in elected political offices. The article first applies cluster analysis on exit poll data for the 2010 Senatorial Election and then examines predictors of Senatorial candidate sets. Hypotheses are proposed based on theories and evidence that name recall has important consequences in voter decision-making under low information circumstances, and that media celebrities and members of political dynasties benefit from the name recall vote. Findings support predictions that voters put media celebrities and members of national political dynasties together often on a ballot and that the voters who are likely to operate with little information are more likely to vote for these candidates. These are voters with low education and low income, who live in rural areas, and who exhibit high abstention rates.

T1  - Influenced by Peers: Facebook as an Information Source for Young People
AN  - 2342346177
AB  - The study examines the role and impact of Facebook as a central political information source within today’s high-choice information environment among university students. It assumes that the growing role of Facebook as a political information source means the return of the two-step flow of information model: political views and experiences of the less interested majority are largely shaped by the communication of the fewer politically interested peers. Based on a survey among university students in Hungary, the study confirms that Facebook is the primary political information source for university students. The results indicate that only a politically interested minority of university students post or share political content on Facebook. However, posting is shaped by dissatisfaction with the way democracy functions, and accordingly, obtaining regular information about politics through Facebook leads to more negative perceptions about the way democracy works. Based on these findings, it may be assumed that the negative evaluation of democracy by students who are informed about politics through Facebook results from the fact that on this platform information and opinions are mostly provided by their discontented peers. An important contribution of this study is that social influences resulting from using Facebook are not investigated in themselves, but are embedded into the modern information environment where several information sources are used simultaneously.

T1  - "It's not Pans, It's People": Student and Teacher Perspectives on Bisexuality and Pansexuality
AN  - 1877827860
AB  - This article explores how Canadian youth who participate in Gay-Straight Alliances (GSA) and teachers who advise them perceive and/or experience bi/pansexuality. Participants' perspectives on, definitions of, and alignment with bi/pansexuality are examined as they unpack mis/understandings associated with nonmonosexual identities. For GSA members, bisexual and pansexual identity labels were not interchangeable terms; bisexuality was associated with the fe/male binary and pansexuality served as a personal contestation to this dichotomy. Despite these distinctions, both nonmonosexualities were marked by invisibility, mis/understandings, and prejudice in school. Findings emphasize how students' knowledge of sexual diversity and fluidity was more nuanced than their GSA advisors due to personal online research. GSA participation enabled bi/pansexual knowledge exchange among students and teachers, and promoted overall understandings of bi/pansexualities. Although GSA involvement facilitated opportunities to discuss bi/pansexualities, this article also highlights how an effort should be made to integrate bi/pansexual content in these clubs.

T1  - Language and linguistics on trial: Hearing Rachel Jeantel (and other vernacular speakers) in the courtroom and beyond
AN  - 2048126485
AB  - Rachel Jeantel was the leading prosecution witness when George Zimmerman was tried for killing Trayvon Martin, but she spoke in African American Vernacular English (AAVE) and her crucial testimony was dismissed as incomprehensible and not credible. The disregard for her speech in court and the media is familiar to vernacular speakers and puts Linguistics itself on trial: following Saussure, how do we dispel such ‘prejudices’ and ‘fictions’? We show that Jeantel speaks a highly systematic AAVE, with possible Caribbean influence. We also discuss voice quality and other factors that bedeviled her testimony, including dialect unfamiliarity and institutionalized racism. Finally, we suggest strategies for linguists to help vernacular speakers be better heard in courtrooms and beyond.

T1  - Changing people's views of outgroups through individual-to-group generalisation: meta-analytic reviews and theoretical considerations
AN  - 1855326547
AB  - Through individual-to-group generalisation, information about individual members of stigmatised social groups changes the outgroup judgment. This article reports meta-analytic reviews of over 30 years of experimental, lab-based research on individual-to-group generalisation (107 independent tests; 5393 participants). In a first meta-analysis, a positive, medium-size generalisation effect was detected (r = .28, p < .001), reflecting significant generalisation of outgroup exemplar information to the outgroup judgment. This effect was moderated by the number of exemplars and exemplar typicality, with more moderately atypical exemplars maximising generalisation effects. Several other design parameters-including type of control condition, generalisation measures, mode of information provision, type of target outgroup and origin of study-did not moderate the positive generalisation effect. A second meta-analysis investigated the interplay between metacognitions and generalisation and found assimilation effects with metacognitive triggers encouraging exemplar inclusion, and contrast effects with metacognitive cues encouraging exemplar exclusion. These results demonstrate that the same outgroup exemplar can lead to bias reduction or bias exacerbation, depending on available meta-cognitive cues. Findings are discussed in terms of implications for intergroup psychology, generalisation theory and bias reduction interventions.

T1  - The Englishisation of higher education in Catalonia: a critical sociolinguistic ethnographic approach to the students' perspectives
AN  - 2012906567
AB  - This paper investigates the attitudes towards Englishisation displayed by 30 students enrolled in a Combined Languages degree, including English and another language, in a top-ranked bilingual university in Catalonia, where Spanish and Catalan coexist complexly, and where foreign language medium instruction is relatively new. Through a two-year fieldwork project, I report on how the institution implemented this partial English-medium instruction program for the first time in Spain, following its internationalisation mission. I then focus on the students' perspectives towards the officialisation of English as the third language of the Catalan university system. Via a Domain and Emotion Coding analysis of 30 essay-writing assignments, I show that students mobilise a series of predominantly favourable discourses on Englishisation which conflictingly interplay with negative attitudes towards it. They envision English as a post-national 'democratising' lingua franca and as an asset for employability and educational excellence, but they also construct it as a politicised threat to linguistic diversity. These perspectives contribute to a nuanced understanding of the students' range of ambivalent stances concerning the established sociolinguistic orders of globalised universities in Barcelona and the neo-liberal linguistic regimes of the European Higher Education Area, which call for policies providing a more balanced ecology of languages.

T1  - Parenting Transgender Children in PFLAG
AN  - 1835699965
AB  - Parents of transgender children (N = 14) recounted four ways in which their parenting experiences were more difficult and isolating than those of other parents of a national GLBT support organization: the physical changes their children undergo, the lack of media representations of transgender lives, the effect of their child's gender transition on their identity as a parent, and the tensions involved in their child's successful transition in public settings. Parental isolation may be alleviated, however, by recognizing four unrecognized similarities shared among parents of GLBT children: adjusting to changes in their child's appearance, the process of grief and mourning, the tendency to hierarchically rank parental difficulties, and fears of being a bad parent. The isolation faced by parents of transgender children is imposed not only by antitrans prejudice and lack of information, but also by the unacknowledged and undiscussed ways in which a child's gender transition affects parental gender identities.

T1  - From grand tour to virtual tour: Italy through the stereoscope in 1900
AN  - 1817647463
AB  - In 1903, Underwood & Underwood published Italy through the Stereoscope: Journeys in and about Italian cities, a multimodal set that provided an immersive travel experience by combining the use of a visual device (the stereoscope and stereoviews), localisation tools (the maps), and a written commentary on each view. The paper argues that this 'medium', which was introduced as a realistic and immersive visual reproduction of the world, was an innovative forerunner of modern virtual-reality technologies. The visual three-dimensional effect obtained by the stereoviews is just one of the characteristics meant to enhance the 'virtual' experience of the viewer. The author analyses the rhetorical means, strictly intertwined with the photographic representations, to reinforce the impression and emotion and to replace the physical experience of a tour with that of an armchair traveller. The framing of the picture, the choice of the points of view, and the style of staging and posing the people reveal an international standard. In spite of their claim of realistic representation, this vision is not ideologically neutral, and the analysis of this set reveals the biases and prejudices towards not only strangers but also the 'old' technology of 2D photography. For social and economic reasons, the ancient practice of taking the grand tour faded, but the conspicuous consumption of this medium allowed the middle class to gain cultural capital with a 3D visual tour in order to claim refinement.

T1  - Local Kids, 'Refugees' and Publics of Privilege: Children's Mediated and Intercultural Lives in a Regional Australian City
AN  - 1801919006
AB  - This paper considers contradictions and complexities around mediated and intercultural relationships between local children, primarily of Anglo-Australian descent, and 'refugees', in a regional Australian primary school community. It examines two different spaces in which local children engage with asylum seekers on a daily basis - the prolific 'speech communities' around refugees which circulate in public culture, and lived practices of 'everyday multiculturalism'. Young people are shown to draw on negative tropes around 'refugees' to anchor themselves in a local cultural order. These speech communities, however, differ significantly from the forms of everyday multiculturalism which take place between local children and asylum-seeker youth. This raises questions about how narratives around refugees, privilege and morality become embedded in local cultural identities, and what this might mean for children's attempts to belong within such contexts. These practices are discussed here through long-term ethnographic fieldwork, the importance of which is highlighted for making sense of young people's prejudices and racism towards refugees in economically insecure communities.

T1  - The Impact of Class and Sexuality-Based Stereotyping on Rape Blame
AN  - 2314220975
AB  - In order to investigate whether stereotypes about sexuality can impact perceptions of sexual assault, participants read a scenario that described a situation in which a woman reported being raped. The woman’s socioeconomic status (SES) was varied, so that she appeared to be of low or high-SES. Following the vignette, participants completed explicit measures that assessed victim blame, attitudes toward rape victims, and perceived promiscuity. Participants also answered an open-ended question that was coded for minimizing and maximizing language. Last, participants completed an “attitude survey” that measured classist attitudes. It was hypothesized that participants who read about the low-SES woman would show more rape blame, display more negative attitudes about rape victims, respond to the open-ended question with more minimizing language, and perceive her as being more promiscuous. It was also predicted that these explicit measures would be positively correlated and that the language measure would be moderated by participants’ classism. Results supported these hypotheses. Participants who read about the low-SES survivor showed more negative attitudes, believed her to be more culpable, and more promiscuous. The explicit measures were positively correlated. Additionally, participants differed in linguistic minimization and maximization, such that participants who were low in classism were more likely to maximize the low-SES target’s experience, whereas participants who were high in classism were more likely to minimize the low-SES target’s experience. Taken together, these results suggest that low-SES women are stereotyped as being promiscuous and that this stereotype affects how they may be blamed after cases of sexual assault. Public Health Significance Statement: The results of this study suggest that low-socioeconomic status (SES) survivors of assault are more likely to be blamed and found culpable for the assault than high-SES women. These attitudes correlate with stereotypes about low-SES women’s sexuality.

T1  - The Post-Racial Society is here
AN  - 1925690461
AB  - Since state-sanctioned racism has effectively been outlawed, Rich contends, we already have a post-racial society, and the media's emphasis on racial strife compounds our own failure to recognize this.In this complex and contemporary examination of American cultural attitudes toward race, Rich offers a series of lectures and essays that situate his topic in an historical timeline.In making his case that Americans resist the idea that we are already living in a post-racial society because of a focus on residual attitudes, Rich provides a useful generational structure for readers to consider.Furthermore, the current generation of Americans does not find race-based attitudes attractive, so the leaders of tomorrow will approach the future from a standpoint that does not include old prejudices.In summary, The Post-Racial Society Is Here by Wilbur C. Rich offers a compelling argument as to why Americans must recognize and embrace a cultural shift that, he contends, has already occurred.

T1  - The contemporary US digital divide: from initial access to technology maintenance
AN  - 1746599816
AB  - As US Internet penetration rates have climbed, digital divide researchers have largely shifted attention to differences in Internet skills. Interviews with 72 low-income US residents from both a large metropolitan city and a medium-sized Midwestern town, however, reveal that many people still struggle to maintain physical access, supporting technology maintenance theory. Technology maintenance theory argues that although most of the US poor now use digital technology, access is unstable and characterized by frequent periods of disconnection. As a result, low-income users must work to maintain access, often experiencing cycles of dependable instability. In these interviews, nearly all used the Internet, but technology maintenance practices were widespread, including negotiation of temporarily disconnected service, broken hardware, and logistic limitations on public access. As a result, participants had limited access to health information and employment, and biased attitudes toward technology. That is, in some cases, negative attitudes toward Internet adoption reflected a rational response to disconnection rather than cultural norms or fears of the Internet, as suggested by previous research. Findings support and extend the theory of technology maintenance by emphasizing a shift in the US digital divide from issues of ownership to issues of sustainability; they also provide insight into the interrelated nature of access and attitudes toward technology. This new theoretical approach complements other theoretical approaches to the digital divide that foreground a contextualized understanding of digital disparities as embedded within a history of broad social disparities.

T1  - “Russian celebrations” and American debates about Russia in 1813
AN  - 2697560343
AB  - In the article, the author uses a sociocultural approach to analyze debates in the US press that accompanied “Russian celebrations” in 1813. During the War of 1812, the Federalist opposition to President Madison's administration organized several celebrations of Russia's victories over Napoleon, who was a de facto ally of the USA in its war against England. As a result, harsh debates arose about the relative merits of the Russian nation. Madison's supporters described Russia in extremely critical terms, while the critics of the administration mostly spoke positively of the distant country. For both sides, the Russian victories were just a pretext for formulating their own political views, but by using an image of “the Other,” they elaborated and affirmed two major characterizations of Russia: in one view, it was a barbaric and uncivilized country; in the other, a guarantor of liberty and a rapidly developing and freedom-loving nation. The main difference was summarized in a pamphlet publication of correspondence between Robert Harper and Robert Walsh. The article affirms that the level of civilization in Russia was not just used as an argument in domestic polemics, but was determined according to the demands of that polemic.

T1  - 'I second that emotion': a case for using imaginative sources in writing civil rights history
AN  - 1784144972
AB  - Imaginative sources are a rich archival store. Facts may be as slippery as the sources in which they are contained, but to limit the sources we use in building a civil rights historiography is to risk curtailing the reach and interdisciplinary scope of historical scholarship. We need to read imaginative and subjective sources as objects for the study, analysis and explanation of the Civil Rights Movement. In civil rights, as in other historical subjects, there is a privileging of an 'objective', detached approach to historiography in which 'the knower' is made distinct from what is known, and fact distinct from its imaginative representation. Monteith's essay argues that much can be gained by examining those sources in which the feeling of the movement is explored sensitively and intellectually-or even exploited. Organizers in the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and Freedom Summer volunteers chose to represent the movement in fiction, poetry and creative non-fiction, and found themselves represented in fiction films. Monteith argues that imagination and emotion should be more closely incorporated into civil rights history writing but attention needs to be paid to genre and style if generically unstable sources are not to be misread as unadorned fact.

T1  - The Diverse Impacts of Politically Diverse Networks: Party Systems, Political Disagreement, and the Timing of Vote Decisions
AN  - 1757244439
AB  - Party systems affect the number of choices available to citizens, available information about parties, and party viability. But citizens do not absorb influences from the choice and information environment via osmosis; the media, civil society, and social networks mediate contextual influences. In other words, political information from network members is shaped by the party system, and in turn shapes networks' political effects.

T1  - Who wants to change the flag? Results of a national representative survey
AN  - 1765371852
AB  - New Zealand is considering whether to not to change its flag: a first referendum has been held to decide on the alternative flag, and a second referendum pitting the alternative flag against the current flag will be held in March 2016. Through 2015, polls have consistently shown 60-70% favour keeping the current flag, while opinions expressed in the media often express support for change (possibly by a factor of 2-3 to 1). This begs the question, whose views are being over-represented in the media? This article reports analyses from a representative survey - the International Social Survey Programme 2015 survey for New Zealand - on the factors associated with views on changing the flag. Results showed that 60% favour keeping the existing flag, in line with poll results. Groups strongly in favour of keeping the flag include women, those who are socio-economically deprived, who have low levels of education, who work in semi-skilled jobs, who feel they have less influence on government and indeed mistrust government, and those who think being born in New Zealand is important for New Zealand identity. There is, however, no group strongly in favour of change. It is concluded that, barring a substantial shift in public opinion before March 2016, the New Zealand flag will not change. Those lobbying for change may need to develop a message that resonates with women, the socio-economically disadvantaged, and the politically inefficacious and wary.

T1  - Contesting Legality in Authoritarian Contexts: Food Safety, Rule of Law and China's Networked Public Sphere
AN  - 1735658425; 201537823
AB  - Since the introduction of the Internet, China's networked public sphere has become a critical site in which various actors compete to shape public opinion and promote or forestall legal and political change. This paper examines how members of an online public, the Tianya Forum, conceptualized and discussed law in relation to a specific event, the 2008 Sanlu milk scandal. Whereas previous studies suggest the Chinese state effectively controls citizens' legal consciousness via propaganda, this analysis shows that the construction of legality by the Tianya public was not a top-down process, but a complex negotiation involving multiple parties. The Chinese state had to compete with lawyers and outspoken media to frame and interpret the scandal for the Tianya public and it was not always successful in doing so. Data show further how the online public framed the food safety incident as indicative of fundamental problems rooted in China's political regime and critiqued the state's instrumental use of law.

T1  - Transforming Higher Education Through Mother Tongue Teaching: A Case Study of One South African University
AN  - 1799007502
AB  - This paper reports on how one South African university has responded to a call for transformation in Higher Education by formulating a language policy that emphasizes the use of an African language as the medium of instruction. This was a qualitative study located within the interpretive paradigm. Methods used in the study included reflections and literature review. The objectives of the study were threefold, that is, to understand how University X understands transformation, to establish how this University has responded to transformation, and to explore the extent to which University X has succeeded in implementing the mother tongue policy as a way of responding to transformation. Results indicate that the language policy is being implemented with some success. It also shows that there are negative attitudes towards this move as well as serious challenges that require human resource and materials development, which have financial implications. The paper acknowledges the need to extend the debate to include different stakeholders and to develop strategies to increase the participants' awareness of the importance of teaching in the mother tongue in institutions of higher learning.

AB  - Since the end of the Civil Rights Movement, large numbers of black people have made their way into settings previously occupied only by whites, though their reception has been mixed. Overwhelmingly white neighborhoods, schools, workplaces, restaurants, and other public spaces remain. Blacks perceive such settings as “the white space,” which they often consider to be informally “off limits” for people like them. Meanwhile, despite the growth of an enormous black middle class, many whites assume that the natural black space is that destitute and fearsome locality so commonly featured in the public media, including popular books, music and videos, and the TV news—the iconic ghetto. White people typically avoid black space, but black people are required to navigate the white space as a condition of their existence.

T1  - Attitude of Iranian Female University Students to Sport and Exercise
AN  - 1660022993; 201506537
AB  - Women's sport has always been a challenging subject in Muslim countries and Muslim women have had to face various constraints regarding their participation in sport and exercise, which also influence their attitudes to sport. This study aims to explore the attitude of Iranian female university students toward sport by survey method (N = 1,120) and qualitative interviews (N = 50). The results indicate that the majority of the participants have negative attitudes to sport, and accordingly they do not practice it. Various macro-, meso- and micro-level factors were found as perceived barriers. From the results it can be concluded that the media as a tool for raising awareness to providing role models and shaping the social values of mainstream society does not take a positive role in order to develop the culture of women's sport, and to change the attitude of female students and their social environments to sport in Iranian society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revisiting the Dark Side of Political Deliberation: The Effects of Media and Political Discussion on Political Interest
AN  - 1627728297
AB  - Citizens' deliberation and interest in politics are crucial to democracy and have always been understood as positively related. We argue here that political discussion, one of the most common mechanisms of deliberation, might lead to citizens' political disengagement or lack of interest. Using the Comparative National Elections Project (CNEP), an innovative data set of postelection national surveys, we attempt to ascertain and shed light on these apparently contradictory effects on citizen engagement. The results indicate that political discussions, specifically those involving disagreements, can produce a lower level of interest when citizens are less informed, are strongly partisan, or hold strong social ties with those they disagree with.

T1  - Japanese marriage migrants in 'imagined' multicultural Australia: Facing gaps between expectation and reality
AN  - 1664807807
AB  - This article uses qualitative data to explore Japanese marriage migrants' preconceptions of Australia prior to their emigration to Queensland. In particular, it focuses on two dominant images of Australia: its natural environment and its multicultural society. I argue that the preconceived images accord with Japanese media representations of Australia, providing examples of cultural texts that reflect such images. Second, I highlight the disparity between anticipated settlement experiences influenced by preconceived images of Australia and actual lived experience. In Japanese migrants' imagination, multicultural Australia has no racial prejudice or discrimination, and therefore they do not expect to encounter any. However, some migrants have faced adverse experiences that ultimately contest the preconceived image of a harmonious Australia. Semi-structured interviews were conducted, and some informants avoided discussing racist experiences and some even adopted a defensive attitude. This article lastly explores why some participants find it difficult to share their negative experiences. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The evolution of blame and trust: an examination of a Canadian drinking water contamination event
AN  - 1667952572; 201510372
AB  - Assigning 'blame' is a normal human reaction when trying to identify who or what was responsible for something going wrong. What was done, by whom, the extent of the damage, combined with the system in place to prevent a reoccurrence can influence short and long-term trust. Studies to date have examined how governments have handled large-scale public health disasters without necessarily taking a close look at the factors leading to blame and the potential role it plays in the loss of trust in government in the affected communities. This study examines the evolution of blame and restoration of trust by the public after a localized public health risk event, the contamination of drinking water supplies by E. coli bacteria in Walkerton, Ontario, Canada in May 2000. Data are drawn from an analysis of national media sources from May 2000 to December 2011 and focus group discussions with members of the general public in 10 select communities in Ontario. An evolution of blame was revealed in the data analysis: over time, members of the public directed blame from a more general scope to specific targets as information became available. Within a relatively short period of time, Walkerton residents appeared to lose trust in both their water supply and those who are supposed to protect it. By contrast, focus group participants had mixed reactions: at a surface level, they expressed a general loss of trust in 'government,' but when probed more deeply, they remained confident in the overall system of regulations to ensure public protection. Nonetheless, Walkerton has served to raise public expectations about food and drinking water issues. 'Walkerton' is frequently invoked when the potential exists for a 'system' failure and public health is put at risk. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Cohesion Activities and Attitude Change in Cyprus
AN  - 1699086813
AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium- to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries.

T1  - Gender Violence as a Social Problem in Spain: Attitudes and Acceptability
AN  - 1680151898; 201517786
AB  - Although violence against women (VAW) is not strictly a new phenomenon, its visibilization and the social rejection it produces are recent and, in this sense, it would be appropriate to consider it as an emerging social problem. This paper analyses how a particular form of this violence, intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW), is currently considered as a social problem in Spain. We present some data from different surveys carried out previously in Spain. Specifically, this review provides an overview of acceptability and public attitudes that support the use of this violence and focuses on the effect of gender and gender role attitudes. The data review shows that Spanish society as a whole, considers IPVAW as a social problem and rejects it, but there are still some violence-supportive attitudes, such as victim blaming, and also a gender gap in the consideration of this violence. We discuss the implications of these data on the management and prevention of IPVAW. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1559006689; 201433257
AB  - In this article, I show how the term lawfare is being deployed as a speech act in order to encode the field of human rights as a national security threat. The objective, I claim, is to hinder the work of human rights organizations that produce and disseminate knowledge about social wrongs perpetrated by military personnel and government officials, particularly evidence of acts emanating from the global war on terrorism-such as torture and extrajudicial executions-that constitute war crimes and can be presented in courts that exercise universal jurisdiction. Using Israel as a case study, I investigate the local and global dimensions of the securitization processes, focusing on how different securitizing actors-academics, nongovernmental organizations, think tanks, policy makers, and legislators-mobilize the media, shape public opinion, lobby legislators and policy makers, introduce new laws, and pressure donors to pave the way for a form of exceptional intervention to limit the scope of human rights work.

T1  - Pups and Babes: Quantifying Sources of Difference in Emotional and Behavioral Reactions to Accounts of Human and Animal Abuse
AN  - 1559004831; 201432581
AB  - Anecdotal reports suggest that people may be affected more by media coverage of animal rather than human-related abuse. Findings of the extant research regarding this apparent effect are mixed and omit certain key variables that may drive differential reactions to abuse disclosure. The goal of the current study was therefore to examine whether differences exist between individuals' emotional responses and pro-social behavior (reporting abuse) with respect to human (infant), or animal (puppy), directed abuse, and the effect of demographic and personality variables (including empathy and attitude to animals) on these responses. One hundred and twenty-three university students (104 females, 19 males) were presented with two scenarios (randomly presented to control for order effects) describing identical abuse situations but with two different 'victims'-namely an infant or a puppy. Immediately after reading each scenario they were asked to indicate how much what the infant/puppy went through 'bothered' them, the likelihood of their contacting the police should they know or discover the identity of the attacker, and complete the Profile of Mood States (Short Form). Results indicated that although in general participants were more bothered by the infant-than the puppy-abuse scenario, this was mediated by whether participants were current pet owners, and their level of pet attachment. Specifically, those most attached to their pet were significantly more bothered by the puppy abuse scenario than any other group. Personality and demographic characteristics were also found to relate to mood disturbance, bother rating, and willingness to contact police following each scenario. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Combatting antisemitism in the school playground: an Australian case study
AN  - 1660023721; 201505641
AB  - The aim of Gross and Rutland's paper is to analyse the problem of antisemitic bullying in contemporary Australian state schools by investigating the case of Jewish children in those schools. The study is interdisciplinary, drawing on historical data and educational methodology, and employs a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews conducted in Sydney and Melbourne with all the major actors: students (55), teachers (10), principals (4), parents (13) and Jewish communal leaders (10). Gross and Rutland argue that classical anti-Jewish stereotypes are perpetuated in the school playground, transmitted by children from one generation to the next. This finding provides an additional perspective to the general literature, which argues that racial prejudice and stereotypes are acquired primarily through home socialization, religious institutions and the media, and neglects the role of the school playground. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - "There Is Nothing Funny in This World About Rioting in Harlem": Reactions to Bill Cosby as Reflections on the State of the Black Freedom Struggle
AN  - 1528147467
AB  - Reactions to Bill Cosby's comedy and his political views show the way in which many have failed to clearly distinguish between these two strands of his connection to the freedom struggle. This has been complicated by Cosby's projection of some of his political ideals through his comedy while he chose to neglect others. The militant and radical words of Cosby in Playboy in 1969, his endorsement of civil rights causes, help for the under-privileged, and critique of systemic racism contrasted with the color-blind worldview projected by his comic creations. His more recent message of Black self-determination and community action that has links to conservative thought exists alongside repeats of The Cosby Show and the associated projection of a color-blind world symbolically led by Barack Obama. Such duality and visibility has so often made Cosby a reference point for the position of Blacks in America in the years since the civil rights movement.

T1  - The Importance of Image Management for a Good Society
AN  - 1665210261
AB  - The paper deals with the importance of managing the image of a private or public organization and of any government, especially. There are underlined two important matrix used in the image and communication field and in the management field. The paper shows how these two matrices can be applied by a Government that wants to lead the mass people to a good society. Comparison and analogy are used as scientific methods together with the direct experience of the author as a private manager of the first private television after 1989, SOTI TV. For a good society, the Government must search continuously the needs, expectations, desires and aspirations for the mass people and find the dynamic ratio between individual and collective mind together with the signals of changing between different ways of thinking: PRO, AGAINST and NEUTRAL. The result is that in the end, the public opinion is moving from AGAINST to PRO, regarding the Government's decision, even it is an unpopular decision. Why this paper? As politician, as civil servant working within a public organization and as a member of the government, all must know the difference between myth and reality and all must improve the power to manage the image in order to become more consciousness about their own free will against so easily manipulation in a consumer society..

T1  - Aviation and propaganda in France during the First World War
AN  - 1559007182; 201432644
AB  - This article explores the impact of aviation as the subject of propaganda during the First World War. Aviation was not a tool of overall importance for the war as a whole, but it was overrepresented in the media. Three distinct types of newspaper, aiming respectively at the home front, the trenches and occupied populations, are examined here in order to set out a comparative window on French public opinion during wartime. The study breaks down the myths built up by the military and the press and underlines the way discourse varied according to the target public, as well as the difficulties of constructing a propaganda that would raise enthusiasm for war in areas directly affected by hostilities, whether the trenches or the occupied zones. The impact of this propaganda allows us further to evaluate not only the important degree of communication between different French groups, but also between propagandists and journalists. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Beliefs About the Strauss-Kahn Case in France and Germany: Political Orientation and Sexual Aggression Myths as Local Versus Global Predictors
AN  - 1566419248
AB  - In May 2011, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund and a prominent member of the French Socialist Party, was charged with attempted rape. Extensive media coverage led people across the globe to speculate about intentions and responsibilities. While the case was pending, we conducted two parallel Internet surveys, with French and German participants (N = 1,314). We examined how strongly exoneration of the alleged perpetrator depended on acceptance of modern myths about sexual aggression (AMMSA) and identity attributes that are temporarily salient as a function of local context (gender, political left-right orientation, nationality). AMMSA was a global predictor of exonerating the alleged perpetrator across national sub-samples, whereas the predictive power of gender and left-right orientation varied locally: For French respondents, left-wing political attitudes predicted exoneration of the alleged perpetrator, whereas only for German respondents, being male predicted exoneration. We conclude that the interplay of global (sexual aggression myths) and local (social identification) factors affects the lay assessment of ambiguous cases of sexual violence.

T1  - Muslim communities attitudes towards and recruitment into the British police service
AN  - 1559007723; 201433228
AB  - Recent UK media reports have often portrayed Muslim communities in a negative light (Allen, 2010). Indeed, the frequent media focus of Muslim's being arrested for counter-terrorism offences have been reported in great length. Yet the Muslim community remains diverse and is one of the longest established UK communities within Britain. However, previous studies show that there remains a tense relationship with the police and Muslim communities (Awan, 2011) with negative attitudes held by many young British Muslims towards the police (Kundnani, 2009), and indeed negativity remains stronger from young people from minority ethnic communities. The focus and aim of this research was to gather perceptions from the Muslim community in Birmingham as regards whether they would choose or recommend a career within the police service. Thus the objective for the study was to try and get a better understanding of Muslim perceptions about police recruitment. This article reports on the findings and implications of a small-scale study conducted in 2011 comprising of interviews with two Muslim groups namely the Bangladeshi and Pakistani communities from Birmingham (in the UK), where 20 people were interviewed in four groups consisting of (5) participants. The categories included Young People (aged between 15 years and 18 years); Community Leaders; Mosque Representatives and Female Groups (aged between 18 years and 30 years) which aimed to identify and gather the views of Muslim communities in respect to their views about choosing a career with the police service. Analysis revealed that the Muslim community responded in a fairly homogeneous way: they had a lack of trust towards the police and also issues were raised about the legality of counter-terrorism policing operations; a perception that the police service were a racist organisation and that the police had failed to engage with the Muslim community in Birmingham which had left a negative experience of Muslim communities and the police.3 Recommendations to improve the image and recruitment into the police service include more pro-active work with local communities and the use of community policing as a means to reach out to otherwise 'hard to reach groups'.

T1  - Informed consent for sterilisation of women and girls with disabilities in the light of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities
AN  - 1559005804; 201432122
AB  - In South Africa, as indeed around the world, systematic prejudice and discrimination continues to result in women and girls with disabilities having their right to experience their sexuality, to have sexual relationships and found and maintain families violated. There have been anecdotal reports in KwaZulu-Natal of parents and guardians of pubescent girls and women with disabilities giving consent for the sterilisation of these girls and women based on stereotypical notions of sexuality, parenthood, challenges with sanitation and menstruation periods, sexual abuse and myths about HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted diseases. This Article is aimed at identifying the stereotypical beliefs and attitudes towards parenting, sexuality and reproductive choices that make women with disabilities more likely to be involuntarily sterilised than non-disabled women. It is also aimed at illustrating the problems in South African legislation dealing with sterilisation and the inaction of government tasked with implementing sexual reproductive health policies. The author interrogates whether or not the amended Sterilisation Act 4 of 1998 meets the state's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) and whether it promotes the rights of women to freedom of the person and bodily integrity, equality and dignity under the South African Constitution. It is argued that the legal capacity of women with disabilities must be uncoupled from their sexuality, fertility and reproductive capacity to ensure that the agency of women with disabilities to make their own reproductive decisions is recognised. This will require demystifying the sexuality of women with disabilities, through policy, advocacy and media efforts, but also through careful law reform measures to enhance their autonomy in decision-making about reproduction, particularly to ensure South Africa's Sterilisation Act (as amended) is in line with the Constitution and the state's obligations under the CRPD. Recommendations for law reform are made in this regard. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Discourses of popular politics, war and authenticity in Turkish pop music
AN  - 1504421505; 201406470
AB  - Turkey and the United States (US) have had a close mutually beneficial political and military relationship since the end of World War Two. However, this relationship came under pressure when the US government and Turkey's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP) tried to cooperate closely in the 2003 military invasion of Iraq. AKP's leadership failed to persuade Turkey's parliament to accept the deployment of US troops and equipment in Turkey partially due to public opinion. Despite Turkish media and its government being intertwined to the extent where subversive discourses are all but silenced, some popular music videos were able to articulate discourses which questioned AKP's military policies. This paper analyses lyrics, visuals and sounds of one of these songs to look at the way war and political issues become articulated through a form of simplified popular politics, despite being presented as serious and authentic by a number of key signifiers across the different modes. A number of scholars have addressed the issue of subversion in music both as actual political challenge and as popular counter culture. This case study is used to assess subversion in music in these terms in order to consider its likely place in political debate in Turkey. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Reflections from the world of policy-related research; Think tanks and cultural diversity - between theory and practice
AN  - 1508624857
AB  - In the current context of increased interactions with multiple mobilities, the acceleration of communication and the permeability of cultural borders multiply the benchmarks for people, ideas and discourses. It changes communication, ways to mobilize public opinion and mechanisms of dissemination and influence to situate action and reaction, senses of belongings and ruptures, trends and counter-trends. Making the connection between idea-makers and decision-makers, between theory and practice, is the aim of think tanks, those laboratories of ideas at the service of society. How can we link the social fabric with research and political actions? How can we avoid distrust with the necessary marketing of proposals and conclusions certified by think tanks to get the media's attention? Discourses connect ideas with people, and in the time of global processes they have to be analysed through an interdisciplinary perspective in order to question the theory and the practice, the contexts and the flows. Think tanks can be the mediators for the renewal and transnationalization of research with the participation of social actors - professionals of justice, communication and young researchers - in parallel processes that are mutually influenced. This research/action raises the existence of an excessive usage of 'containers' concept in discourses, in which anything that creates incertitude can fit. In this way, the discourse related to migration has to be renovated and renewed. Words such as difference, identity and diversity can describe migration either as a problem or a solution, but always highlight it as being ab-normal and as being a global reaction to new realities. How can we imagine scenarios for action in which we all can move in one social framework beyond nacional boudearies? This article questions the role of think tanks from a reality in which a variety of opinions, perspectives and practices exist without coinciding in one single analysis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Eminently Visible: The Role of T-Shirts in Gay and Lesbian Public Advocacy and Community Building
AN  - 1504421745; 201406227
AB  - Beginning with coded statements of identity in the early days of the gay rights struggle and moving on to more upfront public declarations of visibility, T-shirts have offered a way for gays and lesbians and their allies to quite literally announce their presence on the political stage for the purposes of both enhancing solidarity and advancing public rhetoric. By visibly marking the bodies of wearers and publicly identifying their sexual identities or political views, T-shirts contribute to a broader project of gay and lesbian public visibility that has held a central place in attempts to transform the social and political world. This study draws upon both archival materials and interviews with contemporary wearers of gay- and lesbian-themed T-shirts in order to document the meaningful role that this pervasive yet often-ignored popular medium of visual communication has played and continues to play for gay and lesbian public advocacy and community building.

T1  - Linguistic creativity in Nigerian Pidgin advertising
AN  - 1524820961
AB  - Advertising communication aims at attracting audiences' attention. It also motivates interest, changes perceptions, stimulates desires and manipulates social values and attitudes. In achieving these objectives, the language medium needs to be carefully selected, especially in a multilingual setting like Nigeria, given that language is the driving force that determines the effectiveness of ad messages. This paper explores the (socio)linguistic devices that are exploited in ad discourse in Nigerian Pidgin (NP) as well as the pragmatic and creative potentials of lexical innovation, code-switching, proverbs, humour and other stylistic strategies that are employed in both print and electronic ads in NP. The paper discovers that advertising in NP commands enormous public appeal because of its spread, flexibility and the creative possibilities it allows. Advertising communication presents yet another platform to deepen further the social utility and functional relevance of NP in the public space in spite of the widespread and age-long misconceptions and prejudices against it.

T1  - Anders Breivik and the Death of Free Speech in Norway
AN  - 1438561013; 201340865
AB  - On July 22, 2011, Anders Breivik detonated a bomb in Oslo and massacred dozens of teenagers at a Labour Party Youth camp on the island of Utoya. Nearly all the media coverage of Breivik focused on the conservative political views outlined in his Manifesto. The week of the massacre, The New York Times ran a series of editorials which identified Breivik as a part of the counterjihad movement represented by Pete King, Bruce Bawer, Geert Wilders, Newt Gingrich, and Robert Spencer. In Norway, the Norwegian media was quick to blame Siv Jensen of the conservative Progress Party for creating the "climate of hate" which produced Breivik. In the wake of the murders, prominent Norwegian intellectuals began calling for a rejection of American "free speech absolutism" in favor of vigorously enforcing an "anti-racism" clause in Norway's penal code which criminalizes threatening or insulting speech, or speech that incites contempt for anyone because of his or her skin color, religion, or sexual orientation. However, this would contribute little to public safety in Norway; instead it would stifle the kind of vigorous debate about social issues that one would expect to find in an open society. It would also demoralize moderate Muslims who are working to promote free speech and democratic pluralism in Muslim-majority countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social Workers and Broadband Advocacy: Social Justice and Information Communications Technologies
AN  - 1429628992; 201335374
AB  - This article presents the results of an exploratory study examining attitudes toward broadband advocacy, as related to attitudes toward and use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) and a variety of other personal, political, and professional characteristics. A random sample (n = 297) of licensed social workers in Michigan was surveyed. There is a growing body of literature indicating that access to broadband Internet is an important element of the digital divide, especially in the United States, which after having led in this area has fallen behind. Findings from this study indicate significant relationships between willingness to engage in broadband advocacy and political views, attitudes toward and use of ICTs, and knowledge about broadband. The implications for a profession focused on social justice and advocacy on behalf of vulnerable populations are explored. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Iraq's Mental Health Crisis
AN  - 1417525482; 201332153
AB  - The mental health experiences of Iraqis during nearly ten years of international occupation have been underexamined. Contrary to media disinformation concerning "troop withdrawal" and "combat operation reductions," U.S. companies constructed permanent military bases and mega-embassies in Iraq. Added to which, some twenty thousand, UK mercenaries (from companies such as ArmorGroup and Aegis) are still operating in the country. Mental health specialists, including psychiatrists and psychologists, point to the fact that pre-invasion trauma is the underlying factor of Iraqis' mental health disorders, which the 2003 invasion exacerbated; pre-invasion trauma included the Anglo-American-imposed economic sanctions (which devastated the country), the terror of Saddam Husseins' torture regime, and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). Improvements in mental health are hampered by a considerable lack of services in the country, stigmatic public attitudes to mental health disorders, ongoing traumas (such as sectarian violence and terrorism), and the disparity of the amount of attention given to the Western aggressor-states' military veterans and their Iraqi civilian counterparts.

T1  - Demographic group differences in adolescents' time attitudes
AN  - 1364702938; 201326312
AB  - In the present study, we examined demographic differences in time attitudes in a sample of 293 adolescents. Time attitudes were measured using the Adolescent Time Attitude Scale (Mello & Worrell, 2007; Worrell, Mello, & Buhl, 2011), which assesses positive and negative attitudes toward the past, the present, and the future. Generally, African Americans and Asian Americans reported higher scores for negative time attitudes and lower scores for positive time attitudes than European Americans and Latinos, with medium sizes. Adolescents in the low socioeconomic status group reported a less favorable evaluation of their past than middle and high SES peers, but there were no meaningful differences in time attitudes by gender. Findings indicate that middle SES adolescents, high school juniors and seniors, Latinos, and European Americans had higher representation in positive time attitude clusters (i.e., Positives and Balanced) than high SES adolescents, high school freshmen and sophomores, and African Americans.

T1  - The horror at Fort Hood: disseminating American exceptionalism
AN  - 1494749788; 201402957
AB  - American exceptionalism -- the constitutive myth of American national identity -- has been disseminated through literature, film, and foreign policy. This article analyzes another site: online comments in response to the New York Times coverage of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting. It is a site in which citizens participate in myth-making and maintenance. This article makes two broad claims. First, that readers' comments in response to the Fort Hood shootings constitute messages about American national identity, particularly American exceptionalism vis-a-vis the military -- the military-idea, the symbol of a unified, coherent force is central to the myth of American exceptionalism. Second, events considered to be failures of the military threaten the coherence of American exceptionalism (by fracturing the military-idea). The Fort Hood incident was considered such a failure and one readers identified as part of a larger problematic involving the US's post-9/11 'war on terror'. In this mediated activity, readers put various discourses (e.g. Islamophobia, mental illness) into service to account for the military's failure and thus maintain the myth of American exceptionalism. Ultimately, these communications constitute an attempt to avoid the divisive consequences of 'another Vietnam', to which the US's post-9/11 military operations are increasingly compared.

T1  - Assessing the Dimensionality of Beliefs About Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) in Chile
AN  - 1429624003; 201338078
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to investigate the psychometric properties of the Beliefs about Children's Adjustment in Same-Sex Families Scale (BCASSFS) (Frias-Navarro 2009), in terms of confirmation of internal consistency and dimensionality via confirmatory factor analysis. In addition, we set out to validate this scale using the Attitudes toward Lesbians and Gay Men (ATLG) Scale Cardenas and Barrientos (The Journal of Sex Research 45(2):140-149, 2008a). Finally, we divided our sample into categories with a view to creating a typology (Egalitarian, Normative opponents, Bigots, and Individual opponents). No research to date has confirmed the hypothesized factor structure of the BCASSFS in Latin American countries. Using data from a convenience sample obtained through the application of a survey of heterosexuals at a university in northern Chile (N=283), a model of two correlated factors was used and the fit indexes obtained. The results indicate that the BCASSFS is a valid and reliable scale for measuring beliefs about children's adjustment in same-sex families in Chile. Moreover, the findings indicated that responses to BCASSFS could be explained by two factors (individual opposition and normative opposition) and that the two factors were correlated. Finally, differences between "egalitarian," "normative opponents," "bigots," and "individual opponents" in the ATLG scale were examined, statistically significant differences being found between groups in the ATL and ATG subscales.

T1  - Using strategic litigation for women's rights: Political restrictions in Poland and achievements of the women's movement
AN  - 1347782880; 201322490
AB  - Legal mobilization in the courts and in political discourse has emerged as an increasingly important strategy of social movements that complements other political approaches. This is true also for women's movements in post-socialist countries, but most research on strategic litigation has focused so far on common law countries and on supranational litigation in Europe. Using the case of Poland as an example, this article asks why references to the law are so attractive in post-socialist contexts and what can be gained by this with respect to actual rights, justice and social change. It focuses thereby on strategic litigation as the most sophisticated strategy that results from other sustained movement activities connected with the law. It draws on field research, interviews with activists and analyses of primary as well as secondary sources. The article explores the reasons for using the law as the 'master frame' by analysing the traditions of gender and law in state socialism and during democratic consolidation. Two examples of strategic litigation, the Tysic case for reproductive rights and the 'Biedronka' cases for employment rights, are analysed and situated in the context of other legal mobilization activities. These cases set the agenda for crucial social problems and resulted in binding decisions by the courts. A broad and predominantly supportive media discourse was conducive to cultivating public opinion. These analyses support the conclusion that legal mobilization tends to directly influence law and legal practices. It has a socializing effect on the population and their legal consciousness. In aiming at both state and society, these legal strategies of the women's movement are a modest but crucial success for democratic consolidation.

T1  - SANDRA WILLSON: A CASE STUDY IN LESBIAN IDENTITIES IN 1950S AND 1970S AUSTRALIA
AN  - 1700673908; 201524793
AB  - In 1959, a young Sydney lesbian, Sandra Willson, shot and killed a taxi driver as a form of protest against social attitudes toward lesbianism. She spent 18 years in prisons and psychiatric hospitals before her release in 1977. Taking Sandra Willson as a case study, this article will explore the ways in which social disapproval of lesbianism was expressed in 1950s Sydney and the impact this had on women's lives, relationships and identities. By the time of Willson's release in the late 1970s, Sydney represented a very different place in which to articulate a lesbian identity; a place in which same-sex desire was beginning to be acknowledged in the press and in cultural media, and where feminist and gay activists were challenging long-standing negative attitudes toward homosexuality. Sandra Willson's experience offers an opportunity to trace shifting notions of lesbianism between the 1950s and the 1970s in Sydney and to consider how these broader patterns of cultural change might have impacted on individual women.

T1  - Iraq's Mental Health Crisis
AN  - 1367557478
AB  - The mental health experiences of Iraqis during nearly ten years of international occupation have been underexamined. Contrary to media disinformation concerning "troop withdrawal" and "combat operation reductions," U.S. companies constructed permanent military bases and mega-embassies in Iraq. Added to which, some twenty thousand, UK mercenaries (from companies such as ArmorGroup and Aegis) are still operating in the country. Mental health specialists, including psychiatrists and psychologists, point to the fact that pre-invasion trauma is the underlying factor of Iraqis' mental health disorders, which the 2003 invasion exacerbated; pre-invasion trauma included the Anglo-American-imposed economic sanctions (which devastated the country), the terror of Saddam Hussein's torture regime, and the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). Improvements in mental health are hampered by a considerable lack of services in the country, stigmatic public attitudes to mental health disorders, ongoing traumas (such as sectarian violence and terrorism), and the disparity in the amount of attention given to the Western aggressor-states' military veterans and their Iraqi civilian counterparts.

T1  - The politics of fear: what does it mean to those who are otherized and feared?
AN  - 1315602779; 201307445
AB  - Islamophobia has, of late, created a tendency to conflate all Muslims as belonging to a single nation of Islam that does not recognize and respect boundaries imposed by western geopolitics. This has been done by some to create and by others to generate a sense of exclusive unity that would separate all Muslims and make them into 'others' within western societies. It is the contention of this paper that such calls both embody and ignore the diversities of Islam as understood and practised by its adherents. Furthermore by 'otherizing' the entire community of Muslims in the West, the singular label of 'Islamism' marginalizes and may even silence the vibrant contestations among Muslims about their faith and its teachings; these include questions posed by women who may be described as feminists. The attributes of Islamism, ascribed to the faith by public, the media and politicians in the West and adopted by some Muslims primarily as a politically unifying force, are very different from the fluidity and flexibility that has been a historic part of lived Islam. Many Muslims may well aspire to belong to the umma: people of Islam conceptualized as crossing ethnic, racial, geographical and political boundaries. But Muslims in general and Muslim women in particular do not wish to do so at the expense of being otherized and conforming to the negative stereotypes ascribed to them that mask their fluid identities and, in the case of 'white' women, their close ties with their kinship networks. The multiplicity of Muslim's identities sits more easily within the permeable unbounded umma applicable to the global as well as the local without necessarily always privileging one or other identity.

T1  - Vindictive but vulnerable: Paradoxical representations of women as demonstrated in internet discourse surrounding an anti-rape technology
AN  - 1347782388; 201322549
AB  - Much media interest surrounded a campaign to raise funds to distribute 30,000 Rape-aXe condoms to women during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The barbed device is worn inside the vagina and attaches to a penis upon penetration. This paper presents an analysis of popular attitudes towards women and rape as identified from comments made upon online news websites and popular blogs in response to this technology. Two over-arching representations emerged; first, that the Rape-aXe would be employed as a weapon for vengeance and deceit, and second, that it was a means of helping women negotiate risk. We argue that such paradoxical representations of women as simultaneously vindictive and vulnerable make problematic the utility of such an anti-rape device. We suggest that the cultural entrenchment of stereotypical and negative attitudes towards women needs to be recognized and counter-acted upon before rape intervention measures, like the Rape-aXe, can have any positive effect.

T1  - Education as a Battlefield: The Autonomous University of Mexico City in the National and International Contexts
AN  - 1567049060; 201436434
AB  - The Autonomous University of Mexico City (Spanish initials UACM), the country's newest institution of public higher education, is at war. It is a foolish war provoked by the university's own rector, Esther Orozco Orozco, who declared in April 2011, a few months after taking office, that we are 'an academic fraud' and 'a swamp without rules.' At first, a large swath of academia, most newspapers, and the major radio stations portrayed her as a brave administrator fighting against shadowy interest groups, mindless students, and idle professors. A year later, this perception has drastically changed. A vigorous movement to defend the university has emerged, managing to win the backing of a section of public opinion. Meanwhile, Esther Orozco's administration is facing serious criticism over corruption, harassment of employees, human rights violations, and violations of the collective bargaining agreement.

T1  - Social networks and women's mobilization in Tunisia
AN  - 1314732805
AB  - After the fall of Ben Ali's regime, fears were growing as various religious parties have decided to run in the elections to the Constituent Assembly of October 23^sup th^, 2011. The Code of Personal Status, the very symbol of Bourguibian modernity, might well be challenged. Beyond their presence on traditional media, feminist movements have organised themselves online so as to make themselves heard and to be able to mobilize public opinion. Facebook has become a place that maximizes visibility, thus allowing Tunisian feminists to make their ideas and their actions widely known. By favouring distanciated commitment, Facebook is a tool that has brought about an upheaval in the various forms of militancy and the militant's relationships to organizational structures.

T1  - Mothers Affected by Domestic Violence: Intersections and Opportunities with the Justice System
AN  - 1504422371; 201407823
AB  - Secondary analysis from two qualitative studies was used to explore the interactions of mothers exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) with the justice system. Results were categorized according to three key themes: (a) negative interactions within the justice system, (b) positive interactions within the justice system, and (c) recommendations for an improved justice system response to domestic violence. Overall, findings suggested that mothers affected by domestic violence are confronted with negative attitudes and ineffectual practices within convoluted bureaucratic criminal justice systems, leaving many feeling revictimized. Despite the negative aspects of the legal system, women in both studies cited positive examples of feeling comforted, validated, and even empowered by the actions of the specific service providers. The findings of both studies underscore the need for greater efficiencies within the justice system and mandatory training for service providers, making it easier for women who have left their abusers to access appropriate support services, as well as the importance of affirmational support particularly when it can be provided by a peer with shared experiences. Future research is needed to guide the development of interventions that will limit the impacts of IPV exposure on child developmental outcomes. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - Owing to the changes in its technological and economic environment, the national contexts that previously defined the world of sport have changed dramatically. The contribution of sport in defining national identity has been discussed by many scholars across a range of national contexts. However, there has not been a critical examination of the role of sport in articulating Hungarian identity. This is somewhat surprising given that Hungary has been very successful in international sporting competitions producing a society that is rich in sport-related collective memories. The objective of this article is to explore the relationship of sport and national identity in Hungary within the context of globalization and social change. Using document analysis and a survey of a representative sample (n = 1027) of the Hungarian adult population the research focuses on public attitudes to sport, and within these, the different aspects of national identity. The achievements of elite Hungarian athletes are emphasized by (sport) politicians and by the media, having an impact on the opinions and expectations of citizens. The results show that for the majority of Hungarian society elite-sport success is important, however, identification decreases in cases of failures and scandals. Issues that are not related to elite sport are not as prominent although these may strengthen national integration regardless of performance success.

T1  - After 9/11: Canada, the Israel/Palestine Conflict, and the Surveillance of Public Discourse
AN  - 1429623880; 201337719
AB  - Since September 11, 2001, a growing body of scholarship has traced the intensification of surveillance in countries of the industrialized West. However, less attention has been paid to analyzing the impact of surveillance of discourse, particularly public discourse normally considered a hallmark of liberal democratic freedoms of speech and association. In this article we consider the case of Canadian public discourse and illustrate how surveillance has intensified in relation to freedom of expression regarding the Israel/Palestine conflict. Drawing on accounts from media, government, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), we highlight notable moments in the Canadian state's deepening ties with Israel, tracing direct intervention in public discourse concerning the Israel/Palestine conflict. The regulation of public discourse on the part of state and non-state actors in Canada is aimed to influence universities, civil society events, access to meetings and events with international speakers, and even the expressions of NGOs abroad. In addition, the regulation of public discourse has impacted the securitization of borders, immigration, and surveillance in light of an ascribed "terrorist threat." This has resulted in a new and distinct pattern of surveillance-or watching-of words, loyalty, and organizations, according to their presumed political views concerning the Israel/Palestine conflict.

T1  - The Internet as Public Sphere: A Zimbabwean Case Study (1999-2008)
AN  - 1283637579; 201304327
AB  - The appearance of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) on Zimbabwe's political landscape in 1999 and the publication of independent newspapers provided Zimbabweans with alternative public spheres to the government controlled media. Through these counter-publics Zimbabweans articulated their protests against the deteriorating economic and political situation in the country. However, legislations like the Access to Information and Protection of Privacy Act (AIPPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA) have since 2002 enabled the government to exert a stranglehold over the free flow of information. This has subsequently forced Zimbabweans to resort to the Internet to articulate their political views without fear of reprisals from the state. This paper addresses the key features, problems, and prospects of this cyber public sphere. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Communicate over a network: the blog as a 'new' social space
AN  - 1037881572; 201232033
AB  - The contribution analyzes from a sociological perspective the development of the blog, passing through the different typologies, to define the relationship that develops in today's society between the network and the individual, through a theoretical comparison of the major scholars who have dealt with the issue of network. From Sherry Turkle to Manuel Castells up to the studies of Barry Wellman, we will define the development of the network as a new social space. The work incorporates some classical theories of Simmel, some by Goffman and Thompson about interaction, of community-society by Toennies and the action-system of Luhmann. The central part of the article focuses on how the space of the network can become, in some cases, a 'place' of sharing not only of entertainment topics but also of those that have some importance for public opinion. Then the blog becomes a 'showcase' in which to expose the peculiar characteristics of one's identity, but also a point of listening for those who do not have easy access to traditional media. Through the testimony of two young people, we will highlight those aspects that characterize the blog as a communication tool, from the diary to the letter, as well as the role played by these documentary sources in the past in sociology's field. In this way, some salient points arise about the use of the network space, compared to traditional media. The last part of the contribution proposes a comparison between America and Japan about the use of blogs and social networks, no longer in numerical terms, but proposing a reflection that brings out an individual who, as a sociable being, exploits all the possible ways to communicate, feeling in such situations freer to express his emotions, and able build a dialogue that turns out to be an added value to his person and in relationship with others outside.

T1  - Protest or Riot?: Interpreting Collective Action in Contemporary France
AN  - 1010632598; 201210780
AB  - Although both events were fundamentally acts of contestation led by different segments of France's youth, the fall 2005 riots and the spring 2006 CPE protests received very different treatment in French public opinion. Whereas the riots were overwhelmingly condemned, the protests were not only tolerated but also often celebrated. By examining dominant interpretations of these events circulated in the news media alongside those of young people collected during a year of fieldwork in the public housing projects of a medium-sized French city, this paper shines light on fundamental French values and beliefs about how society ought to work while also contributing to ongoing debates about the cultural identity of such youth. More generally, it demonstrates the usefulness of comparison in the analysis of acts of political dissent. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gendered Capital: Childhood Socialization and the "Boy Crisis" in Education
AN  - 896168766; 201121939
AB  - This study examined the effect of gender socialization on kindergarten grades using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort. The sample consisted of 6,394 children (3,177 girls; 3,217 boys) from across the United States. MANOVA and follow-up tests revealed that both boys and girls tend to participate in gender-typed activities. Girls are more likely to have positive school attitudes and exhibit positive social behavior; boys are more likely to have negative school attitudes. Regression analyses indicated that participation in "female" activities and positive social behavior positively affect grades; participation in "male" activities has no direct effect. Positive attitudes positively affect the grades of girls; negative attitudes negatively affect the grades of boys. Teacher evaluation practices are also considered. Adapted from the source document.

AB  - [...] a third stream of neoliberalism discussed by Doug Porter and David Craig (2004) views neoliberalism as an "inclusive" liberalism, in which market liberalism coexists with policies that promote opportunity, empowerment, and security; while still market-led, the emphasis is on partnerships and good governance.  The main objectives were to document human-rights abuses as they relate to welfare reform, and to provide quantitative and qualitative data to the media, public-interest litigators, community organizations, and elected officials to progressively change public opinion and welfare policy.

T1  - Older and Younger Adults' Attitudes Toward Feminism: The Influence of Religiosity, Political Orientation, Gender, Education, and Family
AN  - 896165665; 201121871
AB  - The present study explored attitudes toward feminism in 245 U.S. college students and their older relatives. Participants completed a scale of attitudes towards feminism, political orientation, a religiosity measure, and a demographic questionnaire. Results indicated that older adults were more conservative than younger adults on their attitudes towards feminism, religiosity, and political orientation measures. In the young adult sample, attitudes towards feminism were predicted by gender and political orientation, compared to older adults in which religiosity and political orientation were the best predictors. When exploring generational influence, older adults' attitudes and demographic information were not associated with younger adults' attitudes towards feminism and the women's movement. In contrast, young adults' political views were associated with older adults' attitudes towards feminism. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Greek anti-Americanism and the war in Kosovo
AN  - 1037879576; 201232472
AB  - This paper focuses on the perceptions of Greek public opinion concerning NATO's intervention in Kosovo as a case study for Greek anti-Americanism and, especially, its post-Cold War expression. Greek opposition towards NATO intervention in Kosovo (1999) has often been attributed to bias, nationalism and emotionalism. However, the main influential factor in the shaping of the Greek perception of the Kosovo war was the anti-American legacy. It should also be emphasized that the post-Cold War version of Greek anti-Americanism has distinct qualitative characteristics, the most important of those being its diffusion into the ideological and political spectrum. Based on a qualitative analysis of the press, this study attempts to show how this generalized anti-Americanism functions like a prism during the Kosovo crisis and to illustrate the influence of a complex set of historical myths and conceptual schemes, as well as the role of several secondary factors such as political strategies and party competition. In the conceptual field, the legacy of the Kosovo narration is the establishment of the totalitarian argument as far as the US is concerned and the shaping of a negative image of American society that is directly linked to US aggression in foreign relations.

T1  - Planning Context and Urban Intensification Outcomes: Sydney versus Toronto
AN  - 902083083; 201123167
AB  - There is a lack of knowledge about effective implementation of intensification policies. The paper concentrates on the intensification experience of Sydney, Australia, and Toronto, Canada. Historical narratives, which document intensification efforts and outcomes since the 1950s, paint different pictures. For much of the period, Sydney adopted a medium-density strategy sustained by public-sector incentives and regulations. In Toronto, in contrast, the focus has been on high-density developments driven mostly by market trends. Lately, however, the Sydney intensification strategy has shifted to high-density projects. The paper concludes by drawing out findings that are relevant to intensification policies in the selected metropolitan regions and elsewhere: the ubiquity of NIMBY reactions; the importance of senior government involvement because less sensitive to anti-density NIMBY reactions; the possibility of framing intensification strategies in ways that avoid political party confrontation; and the role of major environmental movements in raising public opinion support to intensification.

T1  - Too Close for Comfort: Exploring Gender Differences in Inmate Attitudes Toward Homosexuality in Prison
AN  - 852897769; 201105249
AB  - Since the inception of the Prison Rape Elimination Act in 2003, there has been increased interest in not only sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, but all aspects of prison sexuality. Correctional policies have focused on the homosexual population in attempts to protect these individuals from victimization and in attempts to decrease sexual relationships between inmates. While recent research has focused on the prevalence of homosexual behavior and the prevalence of sexual victimization among incarcerated populations, there has been little research on inmate attitudes toward homosexuality and same-sex sexual encounters in prison. The present study adds to the literature base by examining gender differences in attitudes toward inmate homosexuality among a sample of male and female inmates in a large Southern prison system. Findings revealed that male inmates, older inmates, and heterosexual inmates had significantly more negative attitudes toward homosexual inmates. Implications based on these findings are discussed.

T1  - CHINESE AMERICAN ATTITUDES TOWARD HOMELAND GOVERNMENT AND POLITICS: A Comparison among Immigrants from China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong
AN  - 859435941
AB  - Much of the research attention, nevertheless, has been paid to immigrants from Europe and, only more recently, Latin America.  [...] in the massive voting-behavior literature, precious little has been written on political participation across national borders, especially that across the Pacific.5 A different observation may be made regarding the studying of the Chinese diaspora in the United States, where numerous publications document a long history of involvement in homeland political development and change.6 Still, much of the research on Chinese American transnational politics has been historical in focus and qualitative in methodological orientation and does not engage quantitative social science approaches in systematically analyzing the relationships between divergent origins and the political attitudes and behavior of the majority-immigrant population in contemporary times.7 This literature also pays little attention to the (secondary) migration from Taiwan and Hong Kong in the post-World War II era.

T1  - Prologue: the riddle of race
AN  - 902082820; 201122214
AB  - Bernard explores the myth of racelessness as it is currently circulating in American social discourse. The election of the first black American president has unleashed the term across the cultural landscape, from the mainstream media to the classrooms in which she teaches African American literature. Students use the term as a twenty-first-century incarnation of the civil rights-era concept of colour blindness. But racelessness does not represent an aspiration for equality as much as it represents an ambition to turn away from the realities of difference. It is code for a common ambition to avoid the realities of institutional racial inequalities, as well as personal experiences of cultural difference. The myth of racelessness intersects uncomfortably with current academic discourse that promotes the view of race as a social construction. Scientifically proven and irrefutably true, this discourse does not allow any room for the social experience of race and racial difference as it is lived by everyone every day, whether we like it or not. The election of President Barack Obama is a portal on to this current confusion about the concept of race, specifically, and blackness, in particular. Many pundits have speculated that Obama would not have been electable if he had had dark skin, if he were irrefutably black, in colour and culture. The fact that he himself has elected to call himself 'black' serves as the platform of Bernard's essay on the case of race in the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Mental Health Stigma, Self-Concealment, and Help-Seeking Attitudes among Asian American and European American College Students with No Help-Seeking Experience
AN  - 1081866077; 201237403
AB  - The present study examined whether mental health stigma (i.e., negative attitudes toward people with a psychological disorder) and self-concealment are unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes in Asian American and European American college students with no history of seeking professional psychological services. The Asian American group had less favorable help-seeking attitudes overall, lower levels of stigma tolerance and interpersonal openness, greater mental health stigma, and greater self-concealment than the European American group. Mental health stigma and self-concealment were unique predictors of help-seeking attitudes overall in both groups. However, mental health stigma was not a unique predictor of recognition of need for psychotherapeutic help and confidence in mental health practitioners, the components of help-seeking attitudes theorized to be most associated with actual help-seeking behavior. Self-concealment was a unique predictor of confidence in mental health practitioners in the Asian American group, but not in the European American group. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Catholics and the Death Penalty: Religion as a Filter for Political Beliefs
AN  - 1010632440; 201211556
AB  - Research has shown that public opinion about the death penalty can be largely attributed to the tone of media stories and the number of murders that happen around the time the surveys are conducted. However, not all citizens react similarly to new information such as media stories. Political awareness can help people to filter out new information that might otherwise sway their opinions. Those who lack such awareness are more easily persuaded by new information, resulting in rather unstable, easily changed opinions. We hypothesize that strongly held religious beliefs also serve as such a filter, creating stability in opinions regardless of political awareness. Using the issue of capital punishment, we examine how strongly held Catholic beliefs might affect opinions on the death penalty. We show that Catholics with a strong religious attachment are less likely to be persuaded by current events and political discussion than is the norm. Strongly religious Catholics tend to filter out such information and seemingly ground their opinions in the social doctrine of their church. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender as catalyst for violence against Roma in contemporary Italy
AN  - 835111663; 201100576
AB  - Silvio Berlusconi's use of ethnicity and immigration as national security issues in his successful campaign for election to the Italian presidency in 2008 was by no means unique in contemporary Europe. What was surprising was the speed of his right-wing government's legislative restriction of migrants in the form of the so-called 'security package', first introduced just five weeks after the election. Woodcock explores the striking fact that this 'security package', and the intense wave of racist violence by Italians against Roma that it legitimized and encouraged, was proposed and justified in response to media reports of Italian babies being stolen by 'Zingari' from the 'nomad camps' and of Italian women being raped and beaten by Romanian men of 'Zingari' ethnicity. Gender and ethnicity are the twin constitutive discourses of modern European society, and racialized subjects are necessarily gendered. The stereotype of 'dangerous black men sexually threatening white women' has been mobilized in a vast range of European and colonial nationalist projects in order to justify the policing of both racialized masculine subjects and women as objects of the patriarchy. Similarly, the depiction of women as hysterical, sexually vulnerable objects in need of (white) masculine protection is an old story that the Italian media recognize as a fairy tale even as they reproduce the discourse. Woodcock explores what has not been mentioned thus far, namely, that gender stereotypes are vital to the mobilization of violent racism against the Roma in contemporary Italy, and how conservative gender binaries are strengthened and policed in a time of social crisis through the stereotyping of Roma as racial threat.

T1  - Nixon and the Jews
AN  - 835111641; 201100575
AB  - In public the 37th President of the United States did not express hostility or disparagement, or show any signs of religious prejudice towards Jews. But inside the White House, Richard M. Nixon's remarks were often scurrilous. His antisemitism was not casual; it was close to compulsive. And it could be coupled with other seething grievances, for example, towards liberals, radicals, the media, Blacks and Italian-Americans. Yet Nixon controlled his antisemitism. It had no adverse effect on Jewish life, either at home or abroad. The malice that he nurtured remained unmobilized. Apart from a few limited personnel instances (mostly but not completely ignored by Nixon's underlings), it is impossible to connect private resentment to public policy, probably because the barriers to the expression of antisemitism in the United States have been so high. The ugliness of his utterances in the Oval Office revealed his character, but did not extend outward to shape the processes of governance. A disconnect can therefore be discerned between what he felt and how he acted. Most American Jews voted for Nixon's Democratic opponents in 1968 and 1972. But even Jews who voted against him, even those who loathed him, have often acknowledged that Nixon's policies fortified the security of Israel; and he was proud of his support for the Jewish state during the Yom Kippur War. What betrayed Nixon, and what forced him to resign the presidency, was his decision to instal a secret taping system in the Oval Office. When the tapes were played in 1974, he showed himself to be conspiring to obstruct justice. In subsequent years, further exposure of the tapes revealed the extent and intensity of Nixon's antipathy to Jews. The expletives that had to be deleted did much to besmirch the dignity of the office. But such was the stigma the political culture attached to antisemitism that, had his bigotry become public before 1968, Nixon's career would have been over. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Confronting Sexism: The Role of Relationship Orientation and Gender
AN  - 764428114; 201067029
AB  - This study examined whether relationship orientation was associated positively with confronting sexism and whether confronting sexism was associated positively with competence, self-esteem, and empowerment for women but not men in stereotypically masculine domains. Men and women undergraduates from a United States Midwestern university (n?=?165) were exposed to a sexist statement during a staged, online interaction. Relationship orientation, confronting (i.e., publically rating the sexist statement as problematic and inappropriate), competence, self-esteem, and empowerment were assessed. Consistent with hypotheses, relationship orientation was associated positively with confronting. Additionally, confronting was associated positively with competence, self-esteem, and empowerment for women but not men. Implications for interpersonal confrontation, relationship orientation, and gender differences in response to everyday sexism are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Endorsement of Group Change and Organization Change Affirmative Action Programs for Male and Female Beneficiaries
AN  - 758127064; 201060057
AB  - To test the position that some people's willingness to endorse affirmative action is influenced by the match between beneficiary group and the attributional underpinnings of the programs, endorsement of four programs that could be used to benefit either women or men were assessed among 95 undergraduate students in Ontario, Canada. Students preferred the use of a remedial program that suggested that beneficiaries are under-qualified and need to develop job relevant skills for female versus male beneficiaries. This was driven by perceptions of the effectiveness of the program. For male beneficiaries, participants were more supportive of a mentorship development program that implied the necessity of structural change than they were of the remedial program. These effects were independent of participant gender. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'Roots' or the virtualities of racial imaginaries in Puerto Rico and the diaspora
AN  - 758122743; 201057129
AB  - This essay analyzes representations and imaginaries of blackness in contemporary Puerto Rico, by focusing on the debates raised by 'Raices'/(Roots) (2001), the Banco Popular video special about traditional Afro-Puerto Rican rhythms of bomba and plena. These debates divided public opinion in Puerto Rico and included members of academia, musicologists, bomba and plena groups, and the San Anton (Ponce) community residents. They refer to the ways Puerto Ricans 'speak the unspoken,' that is, the ways Puerto Ricans talk about race and its intersectionalities on the island and in the diaspora. Authenticity claims, particularly as to why bomba and plena appeared alongside reggae or hip-hop, are discussed in terms of four important elements: (1) the musical, cultural and social discourses of blackness in Puerto Rico and the ways they are represented in the media; (2) the complex dialogues between Puerto Rican definitions of blackness/whiteness and the African Diaspora; (3) forms of racialization of the Puerto Rican diaspora; and (4) the ways roots are also routes that articulate an understanding of blackness, race, and racialization in contemporary Caribbean/US global circuits.

T1  - Investigating Differences in Public Support for Gay Rights Issues
AN  - 754039630; 201049791
AB  - Public opinion surrounding two of the most well-known gay rights issues--same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians--varies widely: About 30% of the public favors same-sex marriage, while about 50% favors adoption. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare the demographic variables that predict attitudes toward same-sex marriage and adoption by gays and lesbians. Political ideology and attendance at religious services emerged as the strongest predictors. However, a close examination of the two issues shows that there were important differences between them. These differences may aid gay rights advocates in crafting media campaigns designed to increase support for same-sex marriage. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - New Panthers, old Panthers and the politics of black nationalism in the United States
AN  - 754038494; 201049763
AB  - The New Black Panther Party for Self-Defense has been a cause du scandale since it was formed in the early 1990s. Indeed, the Anti-Defamation League has described it as 'the largest organized anti-Semitic and racist black militant group in America'. It is somewhat surprising, then, that there has been very little detailed analysis of the party and its activities. Mulloy begins to fill this gap by outlining the origins and development of the party, and by closely examining the ongoing dispute between the New Black Panthers and surviving members of the original Black Panther Party--established by Huey Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, California in 1966--over the right to claim the name, the history and the legacy of the Panthers in the United States. Critically assessing the strategies and actions of the New Black Panthers, Mulloy argues that its high-profile, media-centred approach to political activism has largely been a failure with regard to its overall aim of reviving the Black Power movement in the United States.

T1  - Stacked Deck: An Effective, School-Based Program for the Prevention of Problem Gambling
AN  - 902082256; 201123890
AB  - School-based prevention programs are an important component of problem gambling prevention, but empirically effective programs are lacking. Stacked Deck is a set of 5-6 interactive lessons that teach about the history of gambling; the true odds and "house edge"; gambling fallacies; signs, risk factors, and causes of problem gambling; and skills for good decision making and problem solving. An overriding theme of the program is to approach life as a "smart gambler" by determining the odds and weighing the pros versus cons of your actions. A total of 949 grade 9-12 students in 10 schools throughout southern Alberta received the program and completed baseline and follow-up measures. These students were compared to 291 students in 4 control schools. Four months after receiving the program, students in the intervention group had significantly more negative attitudes toward gambling, improved knowledge about gambling and problem gambling, improved resistance to gambling fallacies, improved decision making and problem solving, decreased gambling frequency, and decreased rates of problem gambling. There was no change in involvement in high risk activities or money lost gambling. These results indicate that Stacked Deck is a promising curriculum for the prevention of problem gambling.

T1  - Socializing on the Internet: Case Study of Internet Use Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates
AN  - 743050753; 201033915
AB  - This paper analyzes socializing on the Internet and attitudes towards the Internet as a medium of social interaction among university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). It stems from a larger research project conducted at seven different institutions of higher education in the Abu Dhabi Emirate between 2007-2009 through anonymous questionnaires. A total of 571 students (353 female, 183 male) participated in the survey. In this paper we present only a small portion of the data and focus on (1) the intensity and frequency of Internet use; (2) identity and gender hiding in the virtual environment; (3) meeting internet acquaintances in real life; and (4) attitudes towards the Internet as a medium for social interaction. Responses were cross-analyzed in light of the participants' gender, age, and subjectively-perceived social status. Essentially, we argue that Emirati students dedicate a substantial amount of time and turn frequently to activities related to socializing on the Internet. Yet we have found significant differences in Internet usage and attitudes towards socializing on the Internet along the lines of gender, age, and social status. Generally, respondents tend to hide their identity more than their gender in the virtual environment; yet, women tend to hide both their identity and gender significantly more than men. More than half of the respondents think that the Internet is a medium through which they can communicate without being subjected to prejudice; yet men tend to be more positive than women about being treated differently on the Internet when people do know their gender. Finally, respondents who perceive themselves as having a higher social status tend to hide their identity less and are less distrustful of relationships formed via the Internet than are their counterparts, who perceive themselves as having middle class social status. Overall, the findings presented in this paper suggest that although the Internet can largely act as a vehicle for resisting social exclusion and gender segregation, it can also simultaneously serve as a mechanism for reinforcing pre-existing norms within newly-networked traditional communities. On a more general level, this paper aims to contribute to our understanding of global patterns of Internet usage and the complex interplay between technology, culture and identity.

T1  - Development of Heterosexuals into Sexual-Minority Allies: A Qualitative Exploration
AN  - 743046355; 201029479
AB  - Heterosexually identified individuals can serve a crucial role as allies in eliminating sexual prejudice and the resulting policies that discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. However, few studies have systematically examined the development of heterosexual allies. Consensual qualitative research methods (Hill et al., The Counseling Psychologist, 25, 517--572, 1997) were used to analyze individual interviews conducted with a community sample of 12 heterosexually identified participants who demonstrated ally commitment through some form of LGBT activism. Findings revealed six domains that best described the development of these heterosexual allies. Participants described early role models, an evolving recognition and understanding of privilege and oppression, and conflict between an awareness of sexual prejudice and deeply held values of justice and equality. Participants also described barriers to LGBT activism and the rewards of ally work. The authors discuss implications for heterosexual ally development and, ultimately, for social justice and equality. Adapted from the source document.
