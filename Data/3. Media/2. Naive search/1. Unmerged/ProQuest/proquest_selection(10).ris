T1  - Stereotyping and the opioid epidemic: A conjoint analysis
AN  - 2437195174
AB  - Political attention and media coverage concerning rising rates of opioid addiction and opioid-involved deaths in the United States have been critiqued for focusing almost exclusively on trends among whites. It remains unclear, however, if this "white-washing" of the opioid crisis has coincided with a shift in Americans' stereotypes about who abuses opioids. Understanding these stereotypes is important because they can create or uphold larger structural barriers by impacting the ability of certain groups to access appropriate treatment, influencing public support for various policies, and shaping interactions with law enforcement officials. Utilizing a conjoint survey experiment (n = 3670), we examined the independent effects of a person's race, occupation, gender, age, and region on the probability they would be seen as more likely than another individual to abuse opioids. We found that the probability of being identified as likely to abuse opioids is highest when a profile describes an individual as white or unemployed. This study offers the first systematic, experimental analysis of the independent contributions of various traits to the perception that someone is likely to abuse opioids.

T1  - Is negative the new positive? Secondary transfer effect of exposure to LGBT portrayals in TV entertainment programs
AN  - 2354725994
AB  - This study investigates the primary effect of positive, neutral, and negative exposure to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) TV portrayals in entertainment programs on attitudes toward the LGBT community and the Secondary Transfer Effect (STE) of such exposure on attitudes toward people with Asperger's Disorder (the secondary out‐group), controlling for face‐to‐face and online contacts with both out‐groups. Research was conducted using a mixed methods approach. Quantitative Study 1 used an online survey of 716 Israeli Jews, to investigate primary and secondary effects of TV exposure to LGBT portrayals. The positive primary effect of TV exposure was shown—regardless of LGBT portrayals perceived as positive, neutral, or negative. STE of TV exposure to neutral and negative LGBT portrayals is likely to diminish social distance to people with Asperger's Disorder, while no STE was found with positive LGBT portrayals. Full mediation effect of attitudes toward the LGBT community was found. Qualitative Study 2, based on 52 in‐depth interviews, was conducted in order to reveal the hidden mechanisms of these effects, examining the parasocial experience and its interpretations by the viewers. According to qualitative findings, the positive primary and secondary effects of negative exposure may be explained by varied interpretations of gay portrayals on TV by different people depending on social background and life experience, opposite reaction on stereotypical gay portrayals on TV, and asymmetrical negative‐positive heuristic. Given the important role of TV in fostering more positive intergroup relations, this research revealed sources of prejudice reduction and increase in tolerance toward “others” for society at large.

T1  - “You See the Very Sharp Edge of the Problems of Prejudice in Town”: Youth Service Providers’ Perceptions of a Regional Community Facebook Group
AN  - 2385917902
AB  - The prolific growth of social media in recent years has provided new forums which allow engagement in local town discussions; particularly via community Facebook groups. This study seeks to understand the role of community Facebook groups in a regional town in the Northern Territory (NT) of Australia; particularly how they are used to portray youth, and their relevance to a grassroots youth justice reinvestment process. This research arose due to direct concern from a community working group. Seventeen semi-structured interviews, with 18 participants, were conducted with service providers in Katherine, NT. The data was then inductively thematically analyzed, resulting in six themes: staying informed in a regional context; vilifying youth and combating this; racism; impact on youth; tensions in positioning youth: right versus left; and adopting a strengths-based approach to youth. Community Facebook groups were noted as an important factor for staying informed in a remote context. As a key medium within the town, Facebook groups should be considered a source of community discussion and an appropriate avenue to influence community opinion. The racialization of community discussions about “problem youth” indicates a segregation issue in the town, which has been noted for many years. Community education and the promotion of the youth justice work currently being implemented in the town were considered key in changing mindsets and ultimately behaviors. Importantly, research and community development programs alike should consider the community Facebook group as a medium for positive social action.

T1  - Refugees in the media: Exploring a vicious cycle of frustrated psychological needs, selective exposure, and hostile intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2310141562
AB  - Two research objectives underlay the present research. First, we tested how frustrated psychological needs caused by the refugee‐influx influence the endorsement and selection of refugee‐relevant information. Second, we tested how information selection processes contribute to the development of exclusionary attitudes that counteract the integration of refugees into host countries. In a laboratory study (n = 181), frustrated psychological needs decreased participants’ endorsement of a refugee‐friendly essay (vs. a control essay). Additionally, frustrated needs led to a biased selection of refugee‐hostile over refugee‐friendly information and such selection biases, in turn, predicted higher levels of ingroup defense and prejudice toward refugees. The findings imply that host societies’ receptiveness to refugees is influenced by the maintenance of basic psychological needs.

T1  - Mediated Public Diplomacy Redefined: Foreign Stakeholder Engagement via Paid, Earned, Shared, and Owned Media: PROD
AN  - 2298077512
AB  - Mediated public diplomacy literature examines the engagement of foreign audiences by governments via mediated channels. To date, scholars have examined the competitive contest between global rivals in promoting and contesting one another’s frames as reflected in global news media coverage. Recognizing the meaningful impact of social media platforms, along with the global rise of government-sponsored media organizations, the current study builds on previous mediated public diplomacy scholarship by expanding the scope of the literature beyond the earned media perspective to also include paid, shared, and owned media. The article presents a revised definition of the term mediated public diplomacy along with a case study of government to foreign stakeholder engagement via the social media platform, Twitter.

T1  - 'Her death is as saintly as her life'. Media representations of royal deathbeds in Belgium, 1850-1910
AN  - 2287438079
AB  - This paper explores the media representations of the deathbeds of Queen Louise-Marie (1850), King Leopold I (1865), Queen Marie-Henriette (1902) and King Leopold II (1909) of Belgium. Print and visual media made the dominant ideals of the 'beautiful death' and the 'good death' tangible and visible by representing the last moments of Belgian kings and queens. Whether these representations showed the royal family in a positive or a negative light depended on the degree of compliance between the final acts of the king/queen and the dominant deathbed paradigms. The historical process of mediatisation affected the public perception of these four royal deaths and changed considerably in form and scale as time passed. Romanticised illustrations and descriptions of the deathbeds of Louise-Marie and Leopold I in weekly French illustrated newsmagazines and Belgian dailies successfully projected the ideal of 'the family on the throne' for a mid-nineteenth century bourgeois readership. Regarding the Catholic model of the 'good death', the pictures and descriptions of the deathbed of Louise-Marie served as a modern version of devotional ars moriendi-literature. On the other hand, Leopold's religious sentiments during his final moments became the object of discussion and conflicting interpretations. The remarkable gap between the idealised model of the beautiful death in the bosom of the family and the lack of family affection during the last moments of Marie-Henriette and Leopold II led to mediatised scandals against the background of a growing culture of yellow journalism in the early twentieth century.

T1  - Mistaken Identities: The Media and Parental Ethno-Religious Socialization in a Midwestern Sikh Community
AN  - 2328400508
AB  - The role of the media in constructing the stereotypical portrayal of Muslims and the effects of that image on Muslim communities in the United States have been well reported (Abbas 2004).

[...]the portrayal of Muslims in popular media has intensified stereotypical images of several other ethno-religious groups in the United States, among them Sikhs (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kromidas 2004; Kumar 2016).

Since boys and men are more vulnerable to bullying and discrimination due to their outward identity markers, the focus of this study was ethno-religious socialization of boys. 1.1.

According to the American Sikh Organization, this number could, in fact, be as large as 500,000 (Pew Forum 2012).

[...]of the ensuing problem of misidentification, Sikh communities have found support in collective practices that serve as antidotes to negative stereotypes (Ahluwalia and Pellettiere 2010; Kurien 2014).

AB  - Los medios de comunicación y los diferentes actores sociales han jugado un importante papel en la formación de opinión pública en torno a la pobreza e injusticia energética en España. Una investigación con un diseño mixto ha permitido analizar quiénes se han conformado en grupos de interés, su grado de implicación y participación, sus sustanciales contribuciones para la reducción de la desigualdad y sus estrategias comunicativas. Se han analizado 478 noticias de la prensa digital, publicadas entre 2012 y 2017, utilizando análisis de contenido y análisis cualitativo con enfoque fundamentado. La investigación concluye que la pobreza energética se ha afrontado desde el plano asistencial y coyuntural y que este hecho ha propiciado la reclamación mediática de justicia energética y de empoderamiento colectivo para el logro de la ciudadanía energética.Alternate abstract:The media and the different social actors have played an important role in shaping public opinion about energy poverty and injustice in Spain. A mixed-design study analysed the composition of stakeholder groups, their degree of involvement and participation, their substantial contributions to the reduction of inequality, and their communication strategies. Both content analysis and qualitative analysis were used by adopting a well-founded approach to 478 news items from the digital press, published between 2012 and 2017. The study concluded that energy poverty has been addressed from the welfare and conjunctural perspective and that this has led the media advocate energy justice and collective empowerment in order to achieve energy citizenship.

T1  - Public support for the death penalty in a red state: The distrustful, the angry, and the unsure
AN  - 2299727177
AB  - Set against the backdrop of Nebraska’s 2015 legislative repeal of the death penalty and the 2016 electoral reinstatement, we examined public support for capital punishment. Using two years of statewide survey data, we compared respondents who preferred the death penalty for murder, those who preferred other penalties, and those who were unsure, a respondent group often excluded from research. To understand what distinguishes among these groups, we examined media consumption, instrumental and expressive feelings about crime, and confidence and trust in the government regarding criminal justice. Results revealed that those who preferred the death penalty expressed more anger about crime and greater distrust, but perceived the death penalty as applied more fairly, relative to the other groups. The unsures, compared to those who preferred other penalties, were less trusting and viewed the death penalty as applied more fairly. The persistence of public support for capital punishment may best be understood for its symbolic, expressive qualities.

T1  - Echoslamming: how incivility interacts with cyberbalkanization on the social media in Hong Kong
AN  - 2239603329
AB  - Cyberbalkanization has growingly become common on the Internet and can lead to public's opinion polarization. This study investigates a specific process of cyberbalkanization through which incivility is circulated within online communities. From a dataset of Hong Kong-based Facebook Pages collected during a social movement, a set of politically-organized communities was identified and their connectivity generated a post-sharing network. A random sample of contents shared between and within these communities was then manually classified based on the level of incivility. The targets of offence through the use of uncivil language were also coded. Contents shared within ideologically compatible communities were found to be more likely to be uncivil. The association was significantly more positive in a populistic community, of which members had unique political nature and cultural norms. The targets were usually political opponents and incivility was adopted to petition detractors from within-community discussions. We therefore suggest 'echoslamming' is an online phenomenon through which uncivil contents catalyse anger toward political opponents among ideologically congruent information sources and consequently reinforce the audience's predilection. Such a mechanism can be one underlying explanation for a vicious circle of cyberbalkanization-induced polarization on political opinions.

T1  - The Russian Intelligentsia and Russia’s Social Institutions: Trust or Alienation
AN  - 2468398567
AB  - This article considers the institutional trust of Russia’s humanitarian intelligentsia, describes its underlying qualities, characterizes the structure of institutional trust, reveals the essence and prerequisites of its occurrence, and analyzes the elements of institutional structure. The intelligentsia demonstrates a very high level of trust in the Russian president, but the attitudes and motives of this trust differ significantly (the difference between true supporters and passive observers). Trust in the military reflects the intelligentsia’s recognition of its merits and role in ensuring the security of the state. Complete trust in the church indicates the intelligentsia’s identification with its values and goals. The intelligentsia’s low level of trust in political institutions is part of a contemporary international trend—a sense of injustice, the belief that things will not improve, and incredulity about the future undermine trust in the state. Trust of the police and the courts is low, largely due to widespread prejudice, low awareness of their activities, and rare interactions with them. The intelligentsia’s trust in television and the press is very limited; however, television remains the main source of news, while an important alternative is the Internet. The low level of institutional trust among members of the humanitarian intelligentsia is combined with conservatism, paternalism, and civic and political passivity, and is more likely an indication of disappointment and alienation than an active criticism of Russian institutions.

T1  - The Role of Partisan Sources and Audiences’ Involvement in the Persuasive Press Inference
AN  - 2430088595
AB  - Based on the persuasive press inference, this study examined the role of partisan sources and audiences’ involvement in their perceptions of public opinion. An online experiment (N = 221) was conducted in South Korea. This study found that partisan sources indirectly affected audiences’ perceptions of public opinion by influencing their perceived news slant. Audiences’ value-relevant involvement, rather than outcome-relevant involvement, significantly moderated the effect of perceived news slant on their perceptions of public opinion. Moreover, the indirect effect of partisan sources on the perceptions of public opinion was stronger for those with higher levels of value-relevant involvement. The implications of these findings were discussed.

T1  - Lessons in Colour-Blind Racism from The Bachelorette
AN  - 2302423160
AB  - The US reality television show The Bachelorette is one of the most successful productions in its genre. It only recently featured its first African American lead, a long-expected departure from the show's dominantly white cast. By analysing how the show discusses race, this article sheds light on how reality television sensationalizes racism. Racism in reality television is not, as the production wants to make viewers believe, the result of individual cases of prejudice, but a problem of those responsible in the control room and, arguably, of those tuning in.Alternate abstract:L'émission de télé-réalité américaine The Bachelorette est l'une des productions dans le genre ayant eu le plus de succès. Ce n'est que récemment qu'elle a mis en vedette sa première célibataire afro-américaine, un virage longtemps attendu de la part d'une émission dont les personnages sont surtout blancs. En analysant comment l'émission discute de race, cet article met la lumière sur la manière dont la télé-réalité dramatise le racisme. Contrairement à ce que la production veut faire croire aux téléspectateurs, le racisme en télé-réalité n'est pas le résultat de préjugés individuels, mais bien un problème lié à ceux responsables de la salle de régie et, sans doute, de ceux qui regardent l'émission.

T1  - Discarding protests? Relating crisis experience to approval of protests among activists and bystanders
AN  - 2240358494
AB  - To what extent does the economic crisis affect support for political protest? Since the outburst of the financial crisis in 2008 many protests have been mobilized against national governments and their austerity policies. In some countries, these actions were described in the media as having little support among the general public, while elsewhere these actions enjoyed significant public support. Surprisingly little scholarly work has examined this variation. We fill this research gap by investigating who approves of austerity protests, how bystanders’ attitudes differ from the activists’ approval of protests and how repertoires relate to the approval of austerity protests. The analysis uses original survey data from nine European countries affected by the recent economic crisis at varying degrees and demonstrates that protest experience, both at the country and individual level, relates to approval of anti-austerity protests. The severity of economic crisis increases is positively related to protest approval in general terms, but there are differences depending on the type of grievances and which forms of austerity protests are considered.

T1  - Indigenous peoples in public media: A critical discourse analysis of the human zoo case
AN  - 2229892316
AB  - This study analyses the legal action taken for defamation in the case of the ‘human zoo’, an alleged defamatory portrayal of the Paiwan people, a Taiwanese indigenous group, by Japan’s public broadcaster, NHK. The analysis of this case is presented in two stages, the first of which employs a critical discourse analysis (CDA) to examine the covert racist discourse regarding the Paiwan people in a four-episode NHK documentary series on the history of the modernization of Japan. Second, the study evaluates the discursive patterns of the legal documents resulting from the subsequent lawsuits. The analysis incorporates the findings of interviews with key stakeholders in the human zoo case in its investigation of the presence of insidious racial prejudice against the Paiwan people, combined with a lack of sensitivity towards indigenous peoples in general, both in the documentary and in the responses from NHK in the subsequent lawsuits.

T1  - Prejudice and Morality in Responses to Films About Lesbians: From Perceived Realism to Enjoyment and Appreciation
AN  - 2121559678
AB  - This article observes to what extent prejudice towards lesbians (homophobia) and the moral evaluation of this sexual orientation affect responses to narratives about lesbians and towards their lesbian protagonists. Two hundred six students (79.6% women, MAge = 20.68, SD = 2.36, RgAge = 18–33) of different sexual orientations completed a questionnaire that measured homophobia, the morality attributed to lesbians and familiarity with lesbians in everyday life. Following this, they watched a film about a lesbian community with a morally controversial lesbian protagonist. Later, they completed a questionnaire that measured the protagonist’s attributes and characteristics, the perceived realism of the story, enjoyment and appreciation. Statistical analyses show that homophobia and morality impact on the evaluation of the lesbian protagonist’s actions and attributes and enjoyment of the film. Nonetheless, homophobia, morality, familiarity with lesbians, and the gender and sexual orientation of the receiver do not impact on appreciation or perceived realism. In fact, appreciation and perceived realism are independent of attitudes towards lesbians. These results reveal the role of prejudice and morality in film reception. They also enable us to characterise enjoyment and appreciation of stories particularly about lesbians.

T1  - Narrative Misdirection? UK Strategic Communication for Afghanistan and Beyond
AN  - 2207058826
AB  - Britain’s war in Afghanistan – specifically its latter stages, where the UK’s role and casualties sustained in the conflict rose dramatically – coincided with the institutional emergence of Ministry of Defence-led ‘Strategic Communication’. This article examines the circumstances through which domestic strategic communication developed within the UK state and the manner in which the ‘narratives’ supporting Britain’s role in Afghanistan were altered, streamlined and ‘securitised’. I argue that securitising the Afghanistan narrative was undertaken with the intention of misdirecting an increasingly sceptical UK public from the failure of certain aspects of UK counter-insurgency strategy – specifically its counter-narcotics and stabilisation efforts – by focusing on counter-terrorism, and of avoiding difficult questions about the UK’s transnational foreign and defence policy outlook vis-à-vis the United States by asserting that Afghanistan was primarily a ‘national security’ issue. I conclude this article by arguing that the UK’s domestic strategic communication approach of emphasising ‘national security interests’ may have created the conditions for institutionalised confusion by reinforcing a narrow, self-interested narrative of Britain’s role in the world that runs counter to its ongoing, ‘transnationalised’ commitments to collective security through the United States and NATO.

T1  - Persuasion and ballot initiatives: how persuasive were the televised campaign ads on same-sex marriage?
AN  - 2571083685
AB  - Initiative campaigns, unlike candidate-centered elections, are efforts to mobilize and persuade residents of state and local governments on specific policies. Previous studies have conflicting findings whether or not initiative campaigns can persuade voters. For issues like same-sex marriage, voters may be even more difficult to persuade because their attitudes may be crystallized. Four states voted on marriage equality in November 2012, which resulted in historic victories for the proponents of same-sex marriage. This led to a belief that the marriage equality campaigns won because of their strategic communications. I examine the effect of televised campaign ads on people’s attitudes toward same-sex marriage by combining market-advertising data from the 2012 campaigns and a rolling cross-sectional national survey. Media markets that spill over into neighboring states are analyzed as a natural experiment, isolating the effect of televised advertisements from other campaign efforts. The results suggest that people were greatly affected by campaign ads aired by the groups opposed to marriage equality, and the ads in favor of marriage equality were ineffective. When competing sides are framing the rights of sexual and gender minorities, those opposed retain an unequal advantage in changing the minds of the public through televised media.

T1  - Accepters, fence sitters, or rejecters: Moral profiles of vaccination attitudes
AN  - 2218958097
AB  - Rationale: Childhood vaccination is a safe and effective way of reducing infectious diseases. Yet, public confidence in vaccination is waning, driven in part by the ‘manufacture of doubt’ by anti-vaccination activists and websites. However, there is little research examining the psychological underpinnings of anti-vaccination rhetoric among parents. Objectives: Here, we examined the structure and moral roots of anti-vaccination attitudes amongst Australian parents active on social media parenting sites. Methods: Participants (N = 296) completed questionnaires assessing their vaccination attitudes, behavioural intentions, and moral preferences. Results: Using Latent Profile Analysis, we identified three profiles (i.e., groups), interpretable as vaccine “accepters”, “fence sitters”, and “rejecters”, each characterised by a distinct pattern of vaccination attitudes and moral preferences. Accepters exhibited positive vaccination attitudes and strong intentions to vaccinate; rejecters exhibited the opposite pattern of responses; whilst fence sitters exhibited an intermediate pattern of responses. Compared to accepters, rejecters and fence sitters exhibited a heightened moral preference for liberty (belief in the rights of the individual) and harm (concern about the wellbeing of others). Compared to acceptors and fence sitters, rejecters exhibited a heightened moral preference for purity (an abhorrence for impurity of body), and a diminished moral preference for authority (deference to those in positions of power). Conclusion: Given the sensitivity of fence sitters and rejecters to liberty-related moral concerns, our research cautions against the use of adversarial approaches-e.g., No Jab, No Pay legislation-that promote vaccination uptake by restricting parental freedoms, as they may backfire amongst parents ambivalent toward vaccination.

T1  - Public responses to scientific research: Does disciplinary attribution matter?
AN  - 2170270064
AB  - Research has shown that the form and content of science communications can influence individuals’ responses. This study examines whether individuals’ perceptions of scientific research are influenced by the discipline to which the research is attributed. Two vignette experiments find that neither the perceived scientific-ness nor trustworthiness of a study originating from sociology is affected by attributing the study to a different social science or to a natural or medical science. These null findings contrast with surveys showing sizable disciplinary differences in public attitudes. It is possible that disciplinary attribution is a less salient cognitive shortcut when presented in longer communications as compared to survey questions that only provide the name of a discipline. We conclude with suggestions for further research on the role of disciplinary attribution on public perceptions of science.

T1  - Green Illusions: Governing CSR Aesthetics
AN  - 2325743018
AB  - This article makes a novel argument that governance of corporate environmental activities should recognize that the business corporation is an aesthetic phenomenon, including the environmental practices and communications undertaken in the name of "corporate social responsibility" [CSR]. Corporate identities and CSR practices are aesthetically projected through logos, trademarks, websites, the presentation of products and services, stylish offices, company uniforms, and other aesthetic artefacts. This corporate "branding" dovetails with the broader aestheticization of our pervasive media and consumer culture. Aesthetics has particular salience in CSR for influencing, and sometimes misleading, public opinion about corporate environmental performance. Consequently, in disciplining unscrupulous corporate behaviour, governance methods must be more responsive to such aesthetic characteristics. The green illusions of business communications create difficulties for regulation, which is better suited to disciplining discrete misleading statements about retailed products or trademarks rather than tackling the broader aesthetic character of business and the marketplace. The article suggests that non-state actors who are more sensitive to aesthetics can help to fill some of this governance void. The "counter-aesthetic" strategies of social and environmental activist groups can inject a subversive narrative that can help to unmask these green illusions. Although the history of such tactics suggests they probably have only a modest effect in challenging corporate deception, the law can assist by protecting public spaces from corporate marketing and sponsorship.Alternate abstract:Cet article présente une argumentation novatrice selon laquelle la gouvernance des activités pro-environnementales des entreprises devrait reconnaître que la société commerciale est un phénomène esthétique, notamment au chapitre des pratiques et opérations de communication environnementales mises en œuvre au nom de la « responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise ». L'identité de l'entreprise et ses pratiques en matière de responsabilité sociale sont projetées esthétiquement dans les logos, les marques déposées, les sites internet, dans la présentation des produits et services proposés, dans des bureaux aménagés avec style, les uniformes de ses employés et d'autres objets de facture esthétique. Cette stratégie de marque s'inscrit dans l'esthétisation générale de la culture médiatique et de consommation envahissante qui est la nôtre. En matière de responsabilité sociale de l'entreprise, l'esthétique a une importance particulière parce qu'elle sert à influencer et parfois à berner l'opinion publique quant au bilan environnemental d'une entreprise. En conséquence, pour corriger une conduite peu scrupuleuse de l'entreprise, les méthodes de gouvernance doivent être mieux adaptées à ce type de caractéristiques esthétiques. Les vertes illusions des communications d'entreprise compliquent la réglementation, qui convient mieux pour sanctionner les discrètes affirmations trompeuses portant sur les produits vendus au détail ou sur les marques déposées que pour s'attaquer au caractère esthétique général des affaires et du marché. L'article laisse entendre que les acteurs non étatiques dotés d'une sensibilité supérieure à l'esthétique peuvent contribuer à combler un peu ce vide de gouvernance. Les stratégies de « contre-esthétique » des groupes militants sociaux et écologistes peuvent introduire un discours subversif qui aide à démasquer ces vertes illusions. Bien que l'histoire de telles tactiques donne à penser qu'elles n'ont probablement qu'un effet limité sur la remise en cause de la tromperie des entreprises, le droit peut offrir un soutien en protégeant les espaces publics contre le marketing et la commandite d'entreprise.

T1  - Online comments about psychiatric neurosurgery and psychopharmacological interventions: Public perceptions and concerns
AN  - 2195249127
AB  - The field of biological psychiatry is controversial, with both academics and members of the public questioning the validity and the responsible use of psychiatric technological interventions. The field of neuroethics provides insight into these controversies by examining key themes that characterize specific topics, attitudes, and reasoning tools that people use to evaluate interventions in the brain and mind. This study offers new empirical neuroethical insights into how the public responds to the use and development of psychiatric technological interventions by comparing how the public evaluates pharmacological and neurosurgical psychiatric interventions, in the context of online comments on news media articles about these topics. We analyzed 1142 comments from 108 articles dealing with psychopharmacological and psychiatric neurosurgery interventions on websites of major circulation USA newspapers and magazines published between 2005 and 2015. Personal anecdote, medical professional issues, medicalization, social issues, disadvantages, scientific issues and cautionary realism were among the main themes raised by commenters. The insights derived from the comments can contribute to improving communication between professionals and the public as well as to incorporating the public's views in policy decisions about psychiatric interventions.

T1  - Navigating Islam: The Hijab and the American Workplace
AN  - 2318717103
AB  - The United States Constitution allows individuals to practice any religion they choose. However, the austerity of this right is tested when an individual’s belief is publicly displayed. For Muslim women wearing the hijab, or headscarf, the intersection between private religious practice and its social expression is explored on a daily basis. To fully understand the manifestation of public religious expression, this paper examines a series of interviews with 35 hijab-wearing Muslim women living in the United States. By exploring the lived experiences of Muslim-American women, this paper highlights the broader issues of the media’s influence on perceptions of Muslim culture, the complex and often unclear legality of religious symbols in the workplace, and the barriers that exist for hijab-wearing women in the workplace. With the rise of Islamophobia, the participants found a stronger sense to exert their right to express their religious identities. Moreover, the women interviewed demonstrate their agency by continuing to embrace their religious practice despite intersecting forms of discrimination.

T1  - Journalists on social media: Politics, privacy, personal branding
AN  - 2153867483
AB  - In late 2017, the New York Times issued new guidelines to its staff on the use of social media. In these guidelines, journalists were reminded that, as employees, their use of social media—whether work-related or private—could have a detrimental effect upon the organization. As New York Times management put it: “In social media posts, our journalists must not express partisan opinions, promote political views, endorse candidates, make offensive comments or do anything else that undercuts The Times’ journalistic reputation.” The New York Times went on to tell its employees that while they may think that their social media accounts are private, “everything we post or ‘like’ online is to some degree public. And everything we do in public is likely to be associated with The Times.”

T1  - Representing the “invisible crime” of climate change in an age of post-truth
AN  - 2097854627
AB  - This article builds on prior writing on the ophthalmological aspects of climate change to argue that in an age of climate change denial and “post-truth”—which Oxford Dictionaries defines as “relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief”—developing a visual language of climate change becomes of paramount importance. This article suggests that while media representations of climate change may serve to reduce climate change to a stock set of visual clichés certain art may improve our visual acuity of climate change. Accordingly, this article looks at select examples of artwork on the causes and consequences of climate change and considers the capacity of such work to inspire personal and political action.

T1  - Objectification, Sexualization, and Misrepresentation: Social Media and the College Experience
AN  - 2313793045
AB  - Social media use can have major impacts on one’s construction of identity, sexuality, and gender. However, some social media sites exhibit problematic and prejudiced themes through their photo and video posts. This paper examines two Instagram sites specifically targeting traditionally college-aged individuals. These sites have tens of thousands of followers, post frequently, and solely focus on highlighting the college experience. Through a textual analysis of these two sites, problematic themes emerged, including objectification of female college students, submissiveness of female college students, and emphasis on a young white college experience. These themes are detailed and explored, followed by a discussion on their potential impacts on broader societal structures and ideas for education on gendered prejudices in the media.

T1  - Post-Postracial America: On Westworld and the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture
AN  - 2113776494
AB  - A seismic shift in the racial landscape of the United States occurred in 2016. The prevailing discourse about a “postracial America,” though always, in the words of Catherine Squires a “mystique,” was firmly and finally extinguished with the election of Donald J. Trump. Race, in the form of racial prejudice, erupted in Trump’s political rhetoric and in the rhetoric of his supporters. At the same time, the continued significance and consequences of racial division in America were also being asserted for politically progressive ends by the increasingly prominent #blacklivesmatter movement and by the newly opened National Museum of African American History and Culture on the National Mall in Washington, DC, not far from the White House. This article tracks the resurgence of race in the US cultural landscape against the racially depoliticized myth of the “postracial” by focusing first on the HBO television series Westworld, which epitomizes that logic. The museum, which opened its doors against the backdrop of the presidential campaign, lodges a scathing critique of the very notion of the postracial; in fact, it signals the return of race as an urgent topic of national discussion. Part of the work of the museum is to materialize race, to move race and white supremacy to the center of the American national narrative. This article points to the way the museum creates what Jacques Rancière calls “dissensus,” and thus becomes a site of possibility for politics. The museum, in its very presence on the Mall, its provocative display strategies, and its narrative that highlights profound contradictions in the very meaning of America, intervenes in what Rancière calls “the distribution of the sensible” and thus creates the conditions for reconfiguring the social order. In part, it achieves this by racializing white visitors, forcing them to feel their own race in uncomfortable ways. The article suggests that this museum, and the broader emerging discourse about race in both film and television, offers new ways to think about the political work of culture.

T1  - Do Stereotypical Media Representations Influence White Individuals’ Perceptions of American Indians?
AN  - 2081904087
AB  - In this study, we examined exposure to stereotypical movie portrayals of American Indians, motivations to respond without prejudice, and awareness of White privilege on racist attitudes. European American participants (N = 232) were randomly assigned to watch stereotypical representations of American Indians or control videos. Hierarchical regression results revealed that higher internal motivations to respond without prejudice and awareness were associated with lower levels of racist attitudes. Higher external motivations to respond without prejudice were associated with higher levels of modern racist attitudes. For participants high in awareness, there was no significant difference in modern racist attitudes between the control and stereotype conditions. For participants low in awareness, those in the control condition reported lower modern racist attitudes than those in the stereotype condition. Results suggest awareness is an important predictor of lower racist attitudes but needs to be reconceptualized within the counseling literature. Social justice implications and limitations are discussed.

T1  - Campaign dynamics of cognitive accessibility of political judgments: measuring the impact of campaigns and campaign events using response latencies in two German rolling cross section studies
AN  - 2052771231
AB  - Do campaigns matter? Based on two rolling cross-section computer-assisted telephone surveys conducted in the run-up to the 2009 and 2013 German Federal Election, we test whether we can detect campaign effects on the accessibility of voters’ judgments: how do response latencies of political judgments evolve over the course of campaigns? The study uses response latencies, i.e. the standardized time it takes respondents to answer a survey question, as a proxy measurement of cognitive accessibility of political judgments. If campaigns do help voters to make up their minds, we should be able to observe changes at the implicit level of response latencies. Do people answer questions about their voting behavior and political attitudes faster as Election Day comes closer? Our results suggest that attitudes towards candidates and voting intentions become more cognitively accessible during campaigns whereas the accessibility of party identification is conditional on the contextual features of campaigns. In addition we find specific short-term effects of TV debates.

T1  - A postcolonial framing of Indian commercial surrogacy: issues, representations, and orientalisms
AN  - 2047318091
AB  - Although only legalised in 2002, Indian commercial gestational surrogacy (CGS) is an industry worth an estimated 2.3 billion USD to India at its height. Not only has this contentious topic been researched extensively from a spectrum of academic angles, representations of Indian CGS abound in both the Indian and Western popular media (novels, documentaries, films, etc.), and increasingly online, particularly in CGS websites, advertisements, and (personal) blogs. Popular media representations as well as commercial ones can often be inclined towards the sentimental and even sanctimonious, but are immensely influential in shaping public perception. This article seeks to position the discourse and representation of transnational Indian CGS more explicitly within the postcolonial framework. Thus, it addresses a theoretical gap in explicitly connecting the problematic issues of power and ethics in CGS within the paradigms of postcolonial studies, drawing also on gender and feminist frameworks. The neo-colonisation of the body has been already considered to some extent - mostly in neo-liberalist contexts - but the industry's systemically orientalistic set up and structure has been surprisingly little mentioned, particularly where transnational surrogacy is involved, with little framing of the imperialistic hangovers and undertones dogging these particular sets of international contracts. This article maps the orientalisms (and sometimes re-orientalisms) at play in this already fraught and contentious context, positioning transnational surrogacy as another instance of imperialism, as yet another form of cultural colonisation, othering, subalternising, and peripheralising working-class Indian surrogate women in the twenty-first century.

T1  - Who Is Welcoming and Who Is Not? An Attitudinal Analysis of Anti-Immigrant Sentiment in South Africa
AN  - 2111444118
AB  - Recurrent xenophobic violence in South Africa highlights the strong undercurrent of popular opinion opposition to international immigrants. This article examines public attitudes towards the international immigrant community in South Africa and the factors influencing those attitudes. The author uses public opinion data from the 2014 South African Social Attitudes Survey (SASAS). The article will show that there is an asymmetry in the processes of opinion formation on immigrants in the country. The findings seemed to call into question the bipolarity of attitudinal measures used in public opinion studies of anti-immigrant sentiment. In addition, the author found that stereotypes about the harmful impact of international immigration were powerful drivers of public antipathy towards foreigners. Greater scrutiny of harmful stereotypes of foreign immigrants voiced by the media, politicians and national leaders is therefore needed.

T1  - “Citizens but for Papers:” Undocumented Youth Organizations, Anti-Deportation Campaigns, and the Reframing of Citizenship
AN  - 2081757182
AB  - Scholars have documented strong anti-immigrant bias in mainstream media portrayals and public sentiment, especially associated with notions of “illegality.” Yet certain groups of undocumented immigrants have been able to defend their continued residency. How are undocumented immigrants, as marginalized subjects, able to make claims for legal and social recognition? Through an analysis of 125 anti-deportation campaigns led by undocumented youth organizations in the United States, I show how organizations developed a nationally coordinated model using citizenship frames to challenge deportations and build support for pro-immigrant legislation. Citizenship frames are based in legal and normative ideologies of citizenship that underscore acculturation, civic engagement, and humanitarian concerns. The campaigns highlight undocumented immigrants’ social integration, deservingness, and practice of citizenship, therefore contesting the boundaries between citizen and noncitizen, and between lawful and unlawful. Though citizenship frames are used across cases, campaign tactics vary: students are portrayed as high-achievers who would suffer greatly if deported, while campaigns for non-students emphasize the detrimental effects of deportation on others. Importantly, citizenship frames are bounded by the government’s priorities for immigration enforcement, with potentially negative consequences for those immigrants considered less than model citizens.

T1  - Gender aspects of sexual exploitation of the humans
AN  - 2132679045
AB  - In article results from an author's sociological study about the population attitude to prostitution as to a most common form of sexual exploitation persons rendering commercial sexual services are analyzed. Being based on the Russian sociological and criminological sources, materials of the carried-out questioning, the author comes to a conclusion that the gender stereotypic attitudes in public consciousness of Russians supported by traditions of gender discrimination are one of the factors producing deviant sexual behavior, criminal violence, and having independent victimologic properties. The list of the specified factors in modern society is formulated: introduction in public consciousness by mass media of attitudes to normalization of prostitution; voluntariness of women's prostitution and «guild) of the female victim of sexual exploitation; public opinion and influence of social moods; influence of the mass media cultivating traditional female roles in the Russian society; gender stereotypes in mass consciousness with accurate identification of participants of the sphere of commercial sex on the basis of sex; viability of stereotypic ideas of a high men's sexual potentiality as standard of courage and sexual hyper-requirements. On the basis of application of qualitative methodology their substantial characteristic is offered. The conclusion is drawn that the traditional gender stereotypes connected to gender as a factor of formation of social roles, need assessment to decrease indicators of mass distribution about prostitution as the social phenomenon, risk of involvement in deviant sexual practices and sexual abuses.

T1  - Issue-Relevant Values and Opinions About Gay Rights: Beyond Equality and Morality
AN  - 1977678453
AB  - Although many studies have examined the role of values in shaping public opinion, the number of values that inform this research is limited. This article employs the concept of issue-relevant values as a means to explore the broader range of values associated with policy issues. After discussing the concept in general terms, the article explores issue-relevant values pertinent to public opinion about gay rights. Using the policy examples of employment nondiscrimination and same-sex couple adoption, the present study identifies, measures, and assesses several values that add to the very short list previously used to explain public opinion about gay rights issues. Content from interest-group Web sites and news media coverage of the two issues aided in identifying the values. Data from an original Internet survey yield valid measures of the values. Multivariate analyses indicate that the values behave in predictable ways: they are strongly influenced by partisanship, and they strongly affect opinions about the two issues. The performance of the values is consistent with findings from previous research on the partisan basis of values and the value-based nature of opinions. The article concludes with suggestions for further empirical and theoretical work that could apply and extend the concept of issue-relevant values.

The achievement of gay rights claims in society is the result of an interplay among various social factors and forces. Media is one of most influential players in building homosexual images and promoting mutual understanding. Chinese homosexuals were not treated as criminals or mental illness patients anymore in 1997 and 2001, respectively, after decriminalization and depathologization. Thus this article aims to explore how homosexuals were portrayed in the official media of China, particularly the People's Daily, to illustrate the changing perception of homosexuals in China's political and social spheres. It argues that representation of homosexuals in the People's Daily changed gradually from a negative perception to a more positive one with less discrimination and prejudice as shown by the article's quantitative and qualitative results.

T1  - Immigration politics and group consciousness for newcomers to Southern US politics
AN  - 2571083584
AB  - This paper examines the role of immigration politics and group consciousness in Hispanic and Asian American vote preferences in a Southern US statewide election. Using a single public opinion data set that allows for a unique, comparative study of both Latino and Asian American likely voters, I explore the development of group consciousness through immigration politics and ethnic media and test the effects of group-conscious voting (motivation to vote to support one’s ethnic community) on support for Democrats. Through this two-part multivariate analysis I identify immigration politics as central to the development of group consciousness for Latinos but not for Asian Americans, while ethnic media predict group-conscious voting for both highly heterogeneous groups. While group-conscious voting is a strong predictor of both Hispanic and Asian American support for a Democratic candidate in a statewide race, only Latinos link immigration salience to Democratic support. This research contributes to the literature on minority politics in the New South.

T1  - U.S. Children's Stereotypes and Prejudicial Attitudes toward Arab Muslims
AN  - 1980069351
AB  - The current study examined whether children in elementary school in the United States held stereotypes and prejudicial attitudes about Arab Muslims relative to other groups. Children (n = 136), ages 6-11 (55 boys, 81 girls), were read three counterbalanced vignettes about different immigrant families who moved to the United States: one family from the Middle East with clothing markers indicating they are Muslim (e.g., hijab), one family from the Middle East without clothing markers indicating religion, and one White family from Ireland. Children's responses indicated stereotypes associating the Arab Muslim male target as more anti-American and hostile and the Arab Muslim female target as more oppressed than others, both consistent with prevalent media stereotypes. Children's positive and negative affective intergroup attitudes were also measured, along with their attitudes about who can be an "American," with children showing both a positivity and negativity bias against Arab Muslims. Children who had some contact with Muslims or were familiar with Islam felt more positively toward Arab Muslims than less informed children. In addition, if children perceived Arab Muslims to be prototypical "Americans," and identified as very American themselves, they also held positive attitudes toward Arab Muslims. Implications for prejudice reduction interventions are discussed.

T1  - 'Unassimilable and undesirable': News elites' discursive construction of the American immigrant during the Ellis Island years
AN  - 1947335204
AB  - This research examines the historical role news elites have played in shaping public perceptions of immigrants as a distinct social group. To that end, we identify the discursive strategies used by The New York Times to construct the 'American immigrant' during the Ellis Island years (1892-1924), a pivotal period when some of the nation's earliest immigration restriction laws were established. Data were collected from front page newspaper articles and analysis was developed using the techniques of critical discourse analysis. Drawing on Foucault's (1977) theoretical understanding of the enmeshment of power relations in discourse as well as Blumer's (1958) group position model, we develop and test five hypotheses about the role of news elites in constructing this social group. Finding support for all hypotheses, we show how the article's discursive choices dehumanized immigrants, trivialized their experiences, silenced their voices and helped legitimate an unequal social hierarchy that positions immigrants beneath non-immigrants.

T1  - Selective Exposure, Political Polarization, and Possible Mediators: Evidence From the Netherlands
AN  - 2502808681
AB  - One of the main lines of reasoning in the contemporary debate on media effects is the notion that selective exposure to congruent information can lead to political polarization. Most studies are correlational, potentially plagued with self-report biases, and cannot demonstrate time order. Even less is known about the mechanisms behind such an effect. We conducted an online quasi-experiment with a sample matching the characteristics of the Dutch population closely (N = 501). We investigate how selective exposure can lead to polarized attitudes and which role frames, facts, and public opinion cues play. While we find that facts learned can help explaining attitude change and that selectivity can influence the perception of public opinion, we cannot confirm that people generally polarize.

T1  - Big Food, Nutritionism, and Corporate Power
AN  - 1923351462
AB  - Big Food corporations have capitalized on nutritionism-the reduction of food's nutritional value to its individual nutrients-as a means by which to enhance their power and position in global processed and packaged food markets. Drawing on the literatures on nutrition and corporate power, we show that Big Food companies have used nutritional positioning to bolster their power and influence in the sector. Through lobbying and participation in nutritionally focused public-private partnerships, they have directly sought to influence policy and governance. Through market dominance in the nutritionally enhanced foods sector, and participation in nutrition-focused rule-setting activities in agrifood supply chains, they have gained power to influence policy agendas. And they have used public outreach and the media to present their views on the nutritional aspects of their products, which shapes public perceptions and the broader regulatory environment. Together, these strategies have enhanced the power of Big Food firms to influence policies in the food sector.

T1  - Invisible Violence: Gender, Islamophobia, and the Hidden Assault on U.S. Muslim Women
AN  - 2491991808
AB  - Drawing on forty semistructured interviews with young Muslim American women, FBI hate crimes data, and civil rights policy reports, this research explores the rise of institutionalized private violence directed at Muslim women. While saving Muslim women from Muslim men through U.S. military invasion remains a dominant cultural ideology and justification for the global War on Terror, I argue that "saving Muslim women" from violence garners significant attention only when foreign Muslim men are positioned as the assailants of such violence. One central form of violence that remains unexamined for Muslim women's lives is the increased exposure to violence in the public sphere following the rapid securitization of the United States after the bombing of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. Of the women interviewed for this study, 85 percent reported experiencing verbal assaults or threats within public spaces, and 25 percent reported experiencing physical violence. This research finds that, although white American men are disproportionately responsible for public forms of Islamophobic violence, the race and gender of these assailants often remain invisible within media accounts.

T1  - 'That's What Being A Woman Is For': Opposition To Marital Rape Law Reform In Late Twentieth-Century Australia
AN  - 1875868113
AB  - From 1976 until 1994, Australian states and territories introduced a raft of reforms to sexual assault laws. Most of these were welcomed, and were seen to reflect women's changing status within a modernising society. One reform, however, was especially contentious. The British law had proclaimed that a woman could not be raped within marriage: the marital bond included a husband's right to sexual access to his wife. Following South Australia's lead, all Australian jurisdictions introduced changes to this law, making it a crime to rape a woman within marriage, either before or after separation. It was a fundamental challenge to the way familial authority was conceptualised, established and policed. 
In a period where feminism had infiltrated many layers of political and social life, we might expect that this change to the law would have been greeted with relief and even celebration. The response to changes to marital rape laws was, however, both muted and ambivalent. Even feminist groups did not offer unequivocal support, and in general public opinion was at best reserved. Further, many conservative groups understood the new laws as an assault on the sanctity of the family itself. 
Drawing on a wide range of sources in the mainstream and alternative media, as well as parliamentary debates, government enquiries, academic studies and legal reports, this paper will explore the multifarious responses to legislative change. It uncovers the complex ways sexual violence and female bodily autonomy were understood within and beyond the borders and boundaries of the home and family.

T1  - Media Framing and Partisan Identity: The Case of Immigration Coverage and White Macropartisanship
AN  - 1951657991
AB  - Laboratory studies frequently find that framing changes individual issue positions. But few real-world studies have demonstrated framing induced shifts in aggregate political opinions, let alone political identities. One explanation for these divergent findings is that the competitive nature of most real-world political debates presents multiple frames that cancel each other out. We assess this proposition and the extent of real-world framing by focusing on the issue of immigration, which has been framed in largely negative terms by the media. Specifically, we assess the connection between New York Times coverage of immigration and aggregate white partisanship over the last three decades. We find that negative framing on immigration is associated with shifts toward the Republican Party--the Party linked with anti-immigrant positions. This suggests that under the right circumstances, framing can alter core political predispositions and shape the partisan balance of power.

T1  - Fighting games and Go: Exploring the aesthetics of play in professional gaming
AN  - 1867095346
AB  - This paper examines the varied cultural meanings of computer game play in competitive and professional computer gaming and live-streaming. To do so it riffs off Andrew Feenberg's 1994 work exploring the changing meanings of the ancient board game of Go in mid-century Japan. We argue that whereas Go saw a de-aestheticization with the growth of newspaper reporting and a new breed of 'westernized' player, the rise of professionalized computer gameplay has upset this trend, causing a re-aestheticization of professional game competition as a result of the many informal elements that contribute to the successes, and public perceptions, of professional players. In doing so we open up the consideration of the aesthetics of broadcasted gameplay, how they reflect back upon the players and the game, and locate this shift historically and culturally within the last two decades of computer games as a creative industry, entertainment industry, a media form, and as an embodied practice.

T1  - ‘Di ta go; ons het dit gedoen; we did it’: Khoekhoe ethnicity, sexuality and temporalities in <i>Proteus</i>
AN  - 2447502397
AB  - The film Proteus (2003), directed by John Greyson and Jack Lewis, fictionalises the true story of the relationship between two prisoners – a white Dutchman and a Khoekhoe man – who were executed for sodomy on Robben Island in 1735. The film employs anachronistic features to reveal and critique cross-historical instances of cataloguing, language usage, homophobia and racism within the South African context. The textual analysis in this article uses the notion of bisexual temporalities, as articulated by Chung-Hao Ku. The argument made here is that the directors portray and celebrate interracial same-sex sexual behaviour and intimacy, but employ a relatively Eurocentric lens that endorses gay identity formation and inadvertently confirms prejudices about homosexuality being alien to African people (contrary to anthropological evidence). However, the film, true to its allegorical symbolism, allows for varied interpretations, and this article explores the significance of the portrayal of the Khoekhoe character’s sexuality as an allusive example of indigenous queerness.

T1  - Forecasting the 2016 General Election in Jamaica
AN  - 2545964160
AB  - The objective of the article is to explain the methodologies and the findings of the 2016 Jamaican General Election forecasts. The Good Judgment Project's CHAMPSKNOW system was applied using qualitative and quantitative methods. The research question was: what were the probabilities of the Jamaica Labour Party (JLP) or the People's National Party (PNP) winning the 25 February 2016 General Election? The data were drawn from election results and macro-economic variables from 1962 to 2015; polls from 1976 to 2016; campaign ads; election newspaper stories; constituency fund disbursements and independent surveys in marginal seats. The results showed that the JLP had a greater number of ads with better and clearer policy contents than the PNP ads. The JLP also received more positive news coverage during the campaign. MPs who spent a large part of their constituency funds on welfare were more likely to win. The PNP had more garrison, traditional and marginal seats than the JLP so the PNP had the edge. Moreover, the data from the independent surveys and the macro-economic analyses indicated the likelihood of a PNP win. The national polls revealed a statistical dead heat but the forecasts started with the governing PNP having a slightly greater probability of winning because of its active political business cycle in which the PNP was rolling out programmes throughout the country in the election year. The forecasts were revised when the JLP narrowed the gap because the PNP refused to participate in the national debate, which generated negative news about the PNP. The final forecast said the election would be close with the PNP having the edge. However, the JLP's tax plan was a wild card, which gave the party the edge with a one-seat victory.

T1  - Is Same-Sex Marriage an Equality Issue? Framing Effects Among African Americans
AN  - 1817459226
AB  - Public opinion about gay rights is often shaped by egalitarian values. While the extant literature has suggested that African Americans' value structure tends to be very egalitarian, many popular media accounts as well as some scholarly research indicate that Blacks have, at times, opposed gay rights. We assert that when the media frame gay rights as equality issues, Blacks are more likely to rely on egalitarianism to form their opinions. We use content analysis to show that equality framing of gay rights dramatically increased in 2012, and we use national survey data to show that Blacks' support for marriage equality also precipitously rose beginning in 2012. Then, we use data from an original framing experiment to show that exposure to an equality frame does, indeed, encourage Blacks to be more reliant on their egalitarian values to form an opinion about same-sex marriage and to be more supportive of the policy.

T1  - Intersections of hate: Exploring the transecting dimensions of race, religion, gender, and family in Ku Klux Klan Web sites
AN  - 1780983936
AB  - The United States has a historical legacy of oppression and subjugation spanning an array of social locations, including class, gender, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation and others. Contemporary research has documented a growth in themes of prejudice and racism present in popular media, such as the Internet. This study fills a gap in the literature by exploring Internet manifestations of a social group that has been historically organized around an ideology of intolerance, prejudice, and hatred: The Ku Klux Klan. Findings from an intersectional content analysis of KKK Web sites reveal that prejudice exists on multiple axes of hate. Major themes include emphases on white solidarity, the cult of Aryan Christianity, Aryan Klan masculinity and heteronormative nuclear family values. These dimensions intersect to create a complex picture of the Klan's self-proclaimed social supremacy. Implications regarding the use of the Internet as a vehicle of hate are considered.

T1  - The rise and fall of nodding syndrome in public discourse: An analysis of newspaper coverage in Uganda
AN  - 1795526122
AB  - Nodding syndrome is an unexplained affliction that has affected thousands of children in post-conflict northern Uganda, South Sudan and in Tanzania. This study focuses on the sudden rise of nodding syndrome in the Ugandan public discourse, based on 369 newspaper reports over a timespan of 4.5 years and interviews with journalists, politicians, caretakers and health workers during 15 months of fieldwork in Kitgum district. The news coverage of nodding syndrome follows a non-linear trajectory, increasing at the end of 2011 and declining a year later. Attention is paid to the conceptualization of nodding syndrome in media reports, linked to the formation of public opinion and management of the affliction. Different settings elicit different concepts and it is therefore necessary to contextualize illness and focus on processes of formation. [web URL: http://coa.sagepub.com/content/36/2/168.abstract]

T1  - Mass media, new technology, and ideology: An analysis of political trends in China
AN  - 2427491720
AB  - Based on a nationwide survey, this study examines the mediated constructions of political ideology and its antecedents in contemporary China. The empirical findings offer insights into China’s future by examining political beliefs in the country. Our study found that most of the respondents share an inclination toward Liberalism, indicating that the general public harbors expectations not only for expansion of market competition to ensure the country’s successful entry into the world economic system in the age of globalization, but also for deepening political reforms, increased supervision of political power, and growing access to democratic participation. The study also investigated the relationship between media use and political ideology, as the former, together with new technology, predicts the latter to varying degrees. In addition, social psychological factors such as the motivation to use the Internet and trust in media were found to play significant roles in these complex relationships. Individuals’ social interactions and their political cognitions also help to explain the complexity of political ideology in a transitional society.

T1  - Presentation of China in online West European media: More fairness and accuracy required: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1781818141
AB  - This article focuses on the presentation of China in online West European media and examines reporting on China in British, Dutch and Belgian online newspapers and weblogs. Through concrete case studies he uncovers the reasons for the predominantly negative coverage of China-related topics in the above-mentioned sources, in particular, to explain the inaccuracy, bias and partisanship. It further studies the complex relationship between journalism and activism and presents a number of analyses that shed light upon the process of construction of an unfavourable opinion about China that the attitudes of the media industry have contributed to. By showing the weaknesses in the coverage of China of the West European media such as distortion of the information or self-censorship, the article criticizes the absence of objectivity in reporting, and proposes a number of measures that both European and Chinese journalists could take so as to overcome the imbalance and prejudice in reporting and move towards more fairness and accuracy.

T1  - To Laugh or not to Laugh: A Critical Discourse Analysis of the Humour Employed in Khabardaar
AN  - 1903923876
AB  - Although the primary function of humour is to make people laugh, it also plays a major role in shaping people's attitudes. Apparently the function of humour is to generate laughter in order to amuse people and release their tension but verbal humour also involves the use of language to construct or deconstruct people's identity. The aim of the current study is to explore the identity constructed through the humour employed in one of the programmes: Khabardaar telecast on Express, a Pakistani News channel, in order to unmask the hidden ideologies. Being a qualitative case study, instances of verbal humour taken from different shows of the programme are analyzed within the framework of Critical Discourse Analysis. The data analysis reveals that in most of the cases the physical features of people, including their obesity and skin colour, are made the target of humour. The study exposes injustice against such people who are considered physically unattractive, according to our cultural notion of attractiveness and addresses the issue of inequality highlighted by Fairclough (1995). The humour is not just confined to the physical appearance of people but also involves ridiculing people on the basis of their gender, ethnicity, and nationality. The paper ends with a note of recommendation for the TV channels in general and the comedians in particular, that advertently or inadvertently, become agents in spreading hatred and intolerance against individuals and groups leading to further reinforcement of different forms of prejudice that already exist in our society.

T1  - "Political Storms in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005: Cuban and Mexican Leaders' Critiques of the Disaster Response to Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma"
AN  - 1731483491
AB  - Hurricanes Katrina and Wilma caused massive destruction in the Gulf of Mexico in 2005 but circum-Caribbean countries responded differently to the storms in terms of hurricane preparedness and disaster management. What accounts for these dissimilarities, and are the roles expected of governments and societies to mitigate loss of life and physical devastation different across political systems and countries? This article examines etiologies of hurricane destruction advanced by political rulers and public opinion leaders in Mexico and Cuba. Reports in the Spanish-language printed media provide evidence of the types of critiques made by Mexican and Cuban leaders of U.S. mismanagement of disaster response to hurricane Katrina. How they assessed their own country's management of hurricane Wilma's destruction is also analyzed. A key theoretical question which the article addresses is whether the effectiveness of hurricane responses depends on the state's capacity, including social capital, public policy priorities, social values, and quality of leadership. Explanations are offered and factors identified as to why a state with massive resources and broad legitimacy like the U.S. responded ineffectively to Katrina while the Cuban government with limited resources and much less legitimacy performed effectively in managing Wilma. In turn, how did the first post-PRI government in 70 years with limited experience and neoliberal values manage its hurricane Wilma crisis?

T1  - TO TEST OR NOT? SINGULAR OR MULTIPLE HERITAGE?
AN  - 1733239665
AB  - DNA ancestry testing may seem frivolous, but it points to two crucial questions: First, what is the relationship, if any, between biology and race? Second, how much and why do people prefer clear, singular racial identities over blurred, mixed racial self-understandings, or the reverse? We posit that individuals of different racial or ethnic backgrounds will have different levels of support for this new technology. In particular, despite the history of harm caused by the biologization of race, we theorize that African Americans will be receptive to the use of DNA ancestry testing because conventional genealogical searches for ancestral roots are mostly unavailable to them. This "broken chain" theory leads to two hypotheses, of disproportionately high Black interest in DNA ancestry testing--thus an implicit acceptance of a link between biology and race--and high acceptance among Blacks of multiple heritages despite a preference for evidence of roots in Africa. To test these hypotheses, we analyze two databases of U.S. newspaper articles, one with almost 6,000 items and a second with 700. We also analyze two new public opinion surveys of nationally representative samples of adult Americans. Most of the evidence comes from the second survey, which uses vignettes to obtain views about varied results of DNA ancestry testing. We find that the media increasingly report on the links between genetic inheritance and race, and emphasize singular racial ancestry more than multiple heritages. The surveys show, consistent with our theory, that Blacks (and Hispanics, to some degree) are especially receptive to DNA ancestry testing, and are pleased with not only a finding of group singularity but also a finding of multiple points of origin. Qualitative readings of media reports illuminate some of the reasons behind these survey findings. We conclude with a brief discussion of the broader importance of DNA ancestry testing.

T1  - The French secular hypocrisy: the extreme right, the Republic and the battle for hegemony
AN  - 1784145163
AB  - The success of the extreme right in France in the past two decades has not been limited to its electoral rise. A more long-lasting victory has taken place in the ideological field, where the discourse of the extreme right now occupies a prominent place in the mainstream liberal democratic agenda. Increasingly, its ideas are seen in the media and in the platforms of mainstream parties as 'common sense' or at least acceptable. The growing acceptance of this 'common sense' is the result of very carefully crafted strategies put in place by extreme-right thinkers since the 1980s. For over three decades now, in order to change perceptions and renew extreme right-wing ideology, New Right think tanks such as the French GRECE believed it was necessary to borrow the tactics of the left and, more specifically, the Gramscian concept of hegemony: cultural power must precede political power. With the use of contemporary examples, Mondon's article demonstrates the continuing impact these ideas have had on the Front national and French politics and society, and how this change originated in the association of populist rhetoric with the neo-racist stigmatization of the Other.

T1  - Mediating climate politics
AN  - 1790892888
AB  - This article examines the centrality of Brazil within the future of climate policy and politics. The state of the carbon sink of the Amazon rainforest has long been an iconic marker of the condition of the Earth. Brazil has been innovative in developing many non-carbon forms of energy generation and use and it has played a major role in international debates on global warming since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992. We examine various ways in which climate change has come to be centrally important in Brazilian public opinion. Survey evidence shows that Brazilians are the most concerned about issues of climate change - with less climate change scepticism as compared with more 'advanced' societies. Through using techniques of corpus linguistics we examine how Brazilian media has engendered and stabilized such a high and striking level of climate change concern. We show that the media helped to fix a 'climate change framing' of recent often strange weather. The article analyses the newly constructed Brazilian Corpus on Climate Change, presenting data on a scale and reach that is unique in this area of research.

T1  - Automatic personality assessment through social media language
AN  - 1767328133; 201607510
AB  - Language use is a psychologically rich, stable individual difference with well-established correlations to personality. We describe a method for assessing personality using an open-vocabulary analysis of language from social media. We compiled the written language from 66,732 Facebook users and their questionnaire-based self-reported Big Five personality traits, and then we built a predictive model of personality based on their language. We used this model to predict the 5 personality factors in a separate sample of 4,824 Facebook users, examining (a) convergence with self-reports of personality at the domain- and facet-level; (b) discriminant validity between predictions of distinct traits; (c) agreement with informant reports of personality; (d) patterns of correlations with external criteria (e.g., number of friends, political attitudes, impulsiveness); and (e) test-retest reliability over 6-month intervals. Results indicated that language-based assessments can constitute valid personality measures: they agreed with self-reports and informant reports of personality, added incremental validity over informant reports, adequately discriminated between traits, exhibited patterns of correlations with external criteria similar to those found with self-reported personality, and were stable over 6-month intervals. Analysis of predictive language can provide rich portraits of the mental life associated with traits. This approach can complement and extend traditional methods, providing researchers with an additional measure that can quickly and cheaply assess large groups of participants with minimal burden.

T1  - Self-Disclosure and the Liking of Participants in Reality TV
AN  - 1718067575; 201531356
AB  - Reality TV shows are characterized by the very intimate self-disclosure of their participants early on in the shows. In everyday interactions, however, such intimate self-disclosure is welcomed only when it evolves gradually. This discrepancy between reality shows and real life apparently contradicts previous research documenting the similarity between real relationships and relationships with media characters. The current research explores this apparent contradiction by examining whether the relationship between self-disclosure and liking and the rules about the timing of self-disclosure that apply in everyday interactions apply in reality TV. Study 1 shows that viewers prefer characters who make early intimate disclosures, and Study 2 shows that they prefer this disclosure to evolve gradually and become more intimate, as in real relationships.

T1  - Intervening in the Media's Influence on Stereotypes of Race and Ethnicity: The Role of Media Literacy Education
AN  - 1708527329; 201528954
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1662632272
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies.

AN  - 1662632097
AB  - This article provides a review of the research record on the potential for media literacy education to intervene in the media's influence on racial and ethnic stereotypes, and explores the theoretical concepts that underlie these efforts. It situates media literacy theory and practice within particular emphases in the field and synthesizes qualitative and quantitative studies. Quantitative research on the effect of media literacy training and mediated counterstereotypes on reducing racial/ethnic prejudice is described. In addition, we report qualitative data from an ongoing study of early adolescents who took part in a media literacy curriculum on stereotypes. The research record reveals that although the topic is severely understudied, media literacy education holds great promise for its ability to shape media-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors and encourage an active and critical stance toward media.

T1  - Arizona: A Reflection and Conversation on the Migrant Rights Movement, 2015
AN  - 1802183405
AB  - Téllez examines recent forms of activism and organizing that women have innovated in Arizona on the front lines of some of the most vicious anti-immigrant discourse and policing practices witnessed in decades. Through testimonios with activists, Téllez chronicles the initial forms of activism that emerged in the context of hatred, xenophobia, and violence and describes how these were transformed into longer-term strategies of community organizing that mobilized Chicana/o, Mexican, and indigenous communities throughout Arizona.

T1  - Looking at Muslims: the visibility of Islam in contemporary French cinema
AN  - 1680151553; 201514082
AB  - Tarr analyses the representation of Islam in five feature films made since 2006 that centre on the changing identities of Muslims in contemporary France. She locates the films within the context of the rise in Islamophobia in France following 9/11 and anxieties about immigration and terrorism, but also in relation to France's troubled postcolonial history and French republican ideology. In particular, the French notion of laicite (secularism) has given rise to active hostility to any public expression of religious or cultural difference, particularly on the part of Muslims. Cinematic representations of Muslims, and particularly of the children of migrants from the Maghreb, have, therefore, since the mid-1980s, been treated with caution in order not to alienate mainstream Franco-French audiences and to facilitate the second generation's integration into French society. However, the five feature films addressed here-two mainstream popular comedies, Mauvaise foi/Bad Faith (2006) and L'Italien/The Italian (2010), and three independent, low budget, auteur-led, realist films, Dans la vie/Two Ladies (2008), Dernier maquis (2008) and La Desintegration/Disintegration (2012)-offer new narratives that challenge fears of Islam by foregrounding the protagonists' negotiation of their Muslim identities in a French context and, by implication, argue for the integration of Islam as a legitimate referent of French identity. However, their construction of Islam does not extend to positive representations of young veiled women, and they thus still risk confirming the oppressive majority view that certain practices associated with Islam, such as the wearing of the veil, are incompatible with the secularism of the French Republic.

T1  - Crisis Moments: Shifting the Discourse
AN  - 1700675357; 201526214
AB  - Discourse and public opinion on the question of Palestine--and every other issue for that matter--are largely shaped by the mainstream media. Palestine remains remote for the average American consumer of information who is generally less concerned with foreign affairs than with the domestic issues that directly impact daily life. In moments of crisis, however, media coverage of Palestine increases significantly, sometimes to the point of saturation. Such 'crisis moments,' despite being few and far between, can have a significant and lasting impact on shaping public opinion, rendering it critically important to understand and analyze the coverage of Israel's latest assault on Gaza--as well as the discourse surrounding the issue.

T1  - 'Inculcating' creativity: culture as public pedagogy in Singapore
AN  - 1660022684; 201505917
AB  - The Singapore government has long relied on the inherent public pedagogical qualities of culture in the forms of official cultural and media policies and in the unscripted signifiers of cultural conduct, such as in the public's attitude towards the arts. The prime objective is to instrumentalise citizens on how they should become both economically productive and creative whilst adhering to prescribed sociopolitical norms. The paper begins with a discussion of a 2012 debate surrounding a Singapore street artist, dubbed the 'Sticker Lady', who was arrested for vandalising public property with political incorrect stickers and provocative phrases. The saga sparked questions of whether Singapore is ready to embrace the increasingly open, technologically advanced and creativity-led twenty-first century. This paper argues that while the authorities are cognisant of the need to open-up society, it is finding it difficult to cede some aspects of control. Instead of making the case for a fundamental change, it argues that public pedagogical imperatives need to be better applied to realign the direction of cultural policy in Singapore. In essence, the perception of what creativity is and how it might engender sociopolitical openness is needed to 'inculate' a culture of creativity in Singapore. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Revisiting Media Effects in Authoritarian Societies: Democratic Conceptions, Collectivistic Norms, and Media Access in Urban China
AN  - 1551002966; 201429543
AB  - We argue that, to effectively understand media effects in authoritarian societies, researchers must assess different types of media strategies adopted by authoritarian leaders. Using survey data from two Chinese cities, we examine the effects of two types of media strategies adopted by the Chinese government, targeting political attitudes and nonpolitical values and norms, respectively. Following a new line of research, we contrast China's domestic-controlled media to foreign free media. After accounting for the selection bias in Chinese urbanites' media access, we do not find sufficient evidence for the effect of the media strategies directly targeting their democratic conceptions. However, sufficient and robust evidence shows that more intensive consumption of diverse media sources, including foreign media, does significantly but indirectly counteract the Chinese government's political campaigns targeting its citizens' democratic conceptions, via thwarting the government's media strategies to cultivate a collectivistic norm in the society.

T1  - The theme of indivisibility in the post-war struggle against prejudice in the United States
AN  - 1660024003; 201505829
AB  - Whitfield's essay seeks to identify and explain a tendency that emerged in the United States in the 1940s and extended through the 1950s. It was then that a notion became commonplace, especially among liberals, that the victims of prejudice were interchangeable and that bigotry was undifferentiated. Before the 1940s, the problem of prejudice was not widely believed to be urgent; but the war against the Third Reich heightened awareness of the price of an irrational hostility to minorities. American liberals in particular came to the understanding that bigotry was indivisible; and, for its objects, the cards of identity could easily be shuffled. Whether the victims were Jews or Negroes or homosexuals, the hatred that they elicited appeared to be formed without making any distinctions among them. Evidence can be found in the culture of those two decades, in novels, plays and films. The unitary view of the character of prejudice had some support in social science, including in the authoritative volume The Authoritarian Personality. The theory would also be reflected in a major shift in the agenda of Jewish civil rights organizations, which redefined their mission as promoting the democratic rights of all minorities rather than the particular interests of American Jews. This distinctive tendency vanished in the 1960s, however. One reason for the change was a fuller appreciation of the hostility that minorities could harbour towards other minorities. The realization also deepened of the singular vulnerability of black Americans under the pressure of racism, which demonstrated a tenacity as well as a proclivity for violence that had been largely absent from other forms of bigotry. Finally, a broader legitimation of difference itself emerged in the 1960s to bury the notion that minorities were fungible. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Motives for Active Participation in Political Blogs: A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Eight German Blogs
AN  - 1531931120; 201422694
AB  - Blogs play an important role in political communication and in forming the opinions of political actors and politically interested users. Their ability to facilitate active interaction, present opinions, mobilize voters, and thereby, influence public opinion and eventually election outcomes makes political blogs an interesting research subject. Thus, this article draws upon a qualitative content analysis to reveal the readers' motivations and main themes to post comments and get involved in the discussions on political blogs. We analyze 12 blog discussions (500 pages) in eight left-leaning German political blogs and use qualitative content analysis to develop a category scheme comprising of 3,868 codings. We find that social interaction with other blog users is the main motive for blogging on German political blogs together with the desire for the exchange of further information and analysis, and the expression of the own opinion concerning the subject. Moreover, we classify 191 users by their motivations for blogging using cluster analysis and identify the bloggers' different communication roles. By providing insight into the users' political discussions, motives for participation, and communication roles, we clarify the role that political blogs play in the process of forming political opinion and derive implications for politics.

T1  - Mobile Technologies for Conducting, Augmenting and Potentially Replacing Surveys: Executive Summary of the AAPOR Task Force on Emerging Technologies in Public Opinion Research
AN  - 1735655460; 201537260
AB  - The proliferation of new technologies, such as mobile devices and social media platforms, has the potential to change the face of public opinion research. The ways in which people both access and share information about opinions, attitudes, and behaviors continue to evolve at a rapid pace. The widespread adoption of smartphones and ubiquity of social media are interconnected trends which may provide researchers with new data collection tools and alternative sources of information to augment or, in some cases, provide alternatives to more traditional data-collection methods. However, this brave new world is not without its share of issues and pitfalls technological, statistical, methodological, and ethical. As the leading association of public opinion research professionals, AAPOR is uniquely situated to examine and assess the potential impact of these 'emerging technologies' on the broader discipline and industry of opinion research. In September 2012, AAPOR Council approved the formation of the Emerging Technologies Task Force with the goal of focusing on two critical areas: smartphones as data collection vehicles and social media as platform and information source. The purposes of the task force are to: define and delineate the scope and landscape of each area; describe the potential impact in terms of quality, efficiency, timeliness and analytic reach; discuss opportunities and challenges based on available research; delineate some of the key legal and ethical considerations; and detail the gaps in our understanding and propose avenues of future research. This report examines the potential impact of mobile technologies on public opinion research as a vehicle for facilitating some aspect of the survey-research process (i.e., recruitment, questionnaire administration, reducing burden, etc.) and/or augmenting or replacing traditional survey-research methods (i.e., location data, visual data, and the like).

AB  - This study offers a critical analysis of ways women were represented during the peak of protests associated with the Tunisian civil resistance campaign in North Africa from late 2010 through early 2011 among newspapers, wire services, and blogs-launch of the Arab Spring (or Arab Awakening). Theoretical underpinning includes norm theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 198237. Kahneman, D., & Tversky, A. (1982). The simulation heuristic. In D. Kahneman, P. Slovic, & A. Tversky (Eds.), Judgment under uncertainty: Heuristics and biases (pp. 201-208). New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.) and gender role congruity theory (Eagly & Karau, 200216. Eagly, A. H., & Karau, S. J. (2002). Role congruity theory of prejudice toward female leaders. Psychological Review, 109, 573-598.), as well as Gans's (197926. Gans, H. J. (1979). Deciding what's news. New York, NY: Pantheon.) concept of social order as an enduring news value. Enjoined, these frameworks facilitate interrogation of print and visual texts to reveal characterizations of women and how the outcomes may have shaped public opinion on the global stage. Seven themes describe media representations of women among written and photographic reportage: Female Victims, Comparatively Lucky Women, Frivolous Girls, Female Culprits, Invisible Women, Women as Agentic Leaders, and Female Patriotic Citizens. Results underscore how print and wire media consistently clung to traditional female gender stereotypes, representing women as emotional, communal, and nurturing mothers and wives, whereas blog content represented women as fully engaged agentic leaders and citizens.

T1  - GLOBALIZATION: CULTURAL TRANSMISSION OF RACISM
AN  - 1690371969
AB  - Globalization is examined by theorists such as, Iammanuel Wallerstein, Anthony Giddens, Martin Wolf, Thomas Friedman, Manuel Castells, David Held, Anthony McGrew, and Paul Hirst. However, globalization remains a significant subject area to analyze, theorize, and to empiric. In general, globalization is a contested topic within the field of social sciences through its various meanings. The topic of cultural transmission is a component of globalization; however, this topic has not been examined within all forms of transmission. For example, a critique of cultural transmission is examined through the transmission of racial bias, stereotypes, and prejudice. As a result, there are three central components of this literature review: description of globalization, description of racial bias, and the interconnectedness of cultural transmission through globalization in the form of racial bias. In addition, racial bias transmission is examined through the use of the mass media.

T1  - Framing MOVE: A Press' Complicity in the Murder of Women and Children in the City of (Un) Brotherly Love
AN  - 1929912817
AB  - This article examines local press coverage of the 1985 police bombing of MOVE, which resulted in the deaths of eleven people, as well as the destruction of two city blocks leaving 250 people homeless. According to public opinion polls many Philadelphians seemingly showed little concern about the heavy-handed tactics used by the police; in fact, many praised the mayor and the efforts of law enforcement. News accounts from the Philadelphia Inquirer were content analyzed to determine whether or not the coverage was framed in a manner that may have influenced the public's attitude toward the organization and its members, thus cultivating within the populace an attitude of indifference.

T1  - The multimodal construction of acceptability: Marvel's Civil War comic books and the PATRIOT Act
AN  - 1504421615; 201406241
AB  - The 9/11 attacks in the USA had profound political consequences at both domestic and international levels. Specific and controversial policy developments were pursued requiring substantial legitimation to find acceptance. A prime example was the USA PATRIOT Act, which was passed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and subsequently received considerable critique due to the sweeping nature of its redefinition of what was acceptable in the cause of 'fighting terror'. The media, and their construal of events and policies, played a significant role in the necessary process of legitimation. In this paper, we explore how one particular area of the media, the superhero comic book, was also active in this regard. By focusing specifically on the multimodal meaning construction within Marvel's Civil War comics series, we suggest how a close multimodal discourse analysis can shed further light on the mechanisms by which particular discourse contexts of public opinion are propagated.

T1  - Explicit and implicit attitudes of Scottish and Maltese children to national identity
AN  - 1373430246; 201329751
AB  - This paper utilised a combination of explicit and implicit techniques to investigate the ways in which children aged 5-16 from two small European nation-states develop in-group favouritism, and positive and/or negative attitudes towards other nation-states. The study adopted a combination of data collection approaches to gain greater evaluation of variability in the responses obtained. Data were analysed statistically for both quantitative and qualitative data. The findings show self-regulation of overt negativity and clearly demonstrate some disquieting outcomes. It poses questions of the extent to which social norms of xenophobia and racism disseminated to children through access to an adult directed media; and what interventions might diminish out-group negativity and prejudice whilst maintaining a level of in-group favouritism that delivers personal self-esteem, and provides the basis for national regard that does not compromise the rights of others.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1417520884; 201333994
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - 'They are all the same': Low perceived typicality and outgroup disapproval as buffers of intergroup threat in mass media
AN  - 1364703240; 201323752
AB  - Three studies examined whether the perceived typicality of a threatening outgroup actor in media messages alters threat effects on attitudes toward the entire outgroup; and whether outgroup (dis)approval of the actor influences perceived typicality. Study 1 measured Dutch majority attitudes toward Moroccans before and after the Van Gogh murder by a Moroccan-Dutch Muslim. Low perceived typicality of the murderer mitigated less favorable attitudes toward Moroccans after the murder. Study 2 used a newspaper report involving a Moroccan perpetrator to manipulate (dis)approval by other Moroccans. Controlling for prior attitudes toward Moroccans, outgroup disapproval effectively reduced the perceived typicality of the perpetrator as a Moroccan. Study 3 manipulated threat to Psychology students' identity by an Economy student's insulting behavior and (dis)approval by other Economy students in a campus magazine interview. Outgroup disapproval reduced the perceived typicality of the insulting student and buffered threat effects on Psychology students' attitudes toward Economy students. We conclude that outgroup disapproval buffers threat effects of negative outgroup behavior in mass media on outgroup attitudes through reducing perceived typicality. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Do Muslims in Germany Really Fail to Integrate? Muslim Integration and Trust in Public Institutions
AN  - 1322723519; 201310748
AB  - Multivariate analysis of 2008 data from the German Social Survey (ALLBUS) provides firm evidence on the basis of one important dimension of political integration-individuals' trust in the political system-that Muslims are integrating well into German society. The results are significant despite controls for multiple indicators of respondents' social capital, socioeconomic status, post-material views, ideological position, partisan support for parties in power, assessment of government performance, interest in politics, and amount of television viewing. Furthermore, Muslims' level of religiosity does not influence their level of political trust. The findings raise new questions about integration in that the significantly lower levels of political trust found among non-Muslims may negatively affect their views of government and its efforts to respond to Germany's Muslim population. Skepticism and distrust of government by non-Muslim ethnic Germans may undermine important programs designed to bridge the actual value and cultural differences which remain the source of the ignorance that fuels prejudice and discrimination.

T1  - Accent and Prejudice: Israelis' Blind Assessment of Al-Jazeera English News Items
AN  - 1761674821; 201602161
AB  - To examine the interplay between ethnic bias and source credibility, we designed a blind experiment in which 112 Jewish-Israeli students rate the credibility and professionalism of videos broadcast by CNN, BBC, Fox News, and Al-Jazeera English (AJE) after removing identifying details. We then compared the results to a control group (N = 99) who viewed the videos untouched. Both the experiment and the control group rated AJE's material significantly lower on credibility and professionalism in comparison to the other networks' materials. Findings highlight the pervasive ethnocentrism of international news viewership and offer support for the 'hostile media perception' theory. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Spiral of Silence and the Internet: Selection of Online Content and the Perception of the Public Opinion Climate in Computer-Mediated Communication Environments
AN  - 1567047072; 201435824
AB  - The question of whether the conventional approaches of media effects research still prove valid in online environments has increasingly stimulated the interest of scholars. This article adds to this discussion, exploring whether Noelle-Neumann's Theory of Public Opinion can explain public opinion formation when applied to computer-mediated communication environments. By focusing primarily on the perception of the climate of opinion, our theoretical considerations indicate that individuals most likely tend to select information online following a subjective-pluralistic pattern. Due to projection effects, this might lead to the perception of a consonant climate of opinion in one's Internet environment, which in turn reduces the individual's fear of isolation. However, there is no evidence yet that this affects the willingness to speak out in offline environments. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - How Citizens Respond to Combat Casualties
AN  - 1283642066; 201304261
AB  - Scholars have long analyzed the influence of combat casualties on public support for war. However, the mechanisms through which casualties-particularly local casualties-affect wartime opinion formation have received much less attention. We employ a novel survey experiment to test three mechanisms that might explain previously observed cleavages in war support between residents of high- and low-casualty communities. We find that subjects who read a news story concerning a casualty from their home state were significantly more likely to oppose the war in Afghanistan than were subjects who read an identically worded news story in which the fallen soldier was not identified as being from the respondent's home state. Moreover, this difference emerged regardless of whether the story followed the coverage patterns and emphasis typical of national or local media reporting. We conclude that the local connections triggered by learning of a home-state casualty, not the emotionally charged nature of local media reporting, is most responsible for generating opinion cleavages observed in previous research.

T1  - Motivated Reasoning And Public Opinion Perception
AN  - 964199260; 201208178
AB  - Theorists posit that a public -- unlike a mass of individuals -- forms opinions through awareness of multiple viewpoints and recognition of opposition in a polity. Whether individuals pursue information on others' political preferences is another matter. While some are motivated to seek as much information as possible, others seek information that supports their own preference. This differential pattern of awareness has implications for individuals' assessment of collective preferences. This article extends recent research on motivated reasoning to test whether accuracy goals (i.e., reaching correct conclusions) and directional goals (i.e., reaching preferred conclusions) affect perceptions of majority preferences. Results show that motivated reasoning affects overestimates of support, of both national-level opinion and modal opinion in discussion groups, even after controlling for partisan strength, demographics, news exposure, political knowledge, and interest. Implications for considered public opinion are discussed in the conclusion. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - No News Is Good News: The Longevity of Australian Humanitarian Interventions
AN  - 1914048959
AB  - The Australian government and military have maintained humanitarian interventions for far longer than any comparable U.S. humanitarian intervention. This longevity confounds most traditional international relations theories. It seems that the key variable is public support for humanitarian interventions. The U.S. public quickly grew impatient with humanitarian operations, while the Australian public has not yet done so. Two reasons for the Australian public's forbearance are explored. First, the idea that the Australian military and government are proficient at these operations and that the public supports these operations because it "loves a winner" is found wanting. Second, innate differences between the United States and Australia, particularly regarding news media, are explored; these differences seem to be highly correlated with the longevity of the operations. It seems likely that the Australian public does not hear enough about these operations to be concerned about them or question their utility, efficacy, or cost.

T1  - Lasswell's Problem and Hovland's Dilemma: Split-Ballot Experiments on the Effects of Potentially Emotionalizing Visual Elements in Media Reports
AN  - 964189240; 201208181
AB  - The question of how the content of images that accompany reports in the mass media can be systematically assessed via content analysis and how the effects of such images can be quantitatively ascertained and related to textual reporting, is one of the still unsolved issues in empirical communication research. In this article, the results of two experiments are presented, in which the emotional reactions to manipulated news items was tested with the result that no significant effect in terms of emotionalization could be proven. Since other comparable experiments, where the text has been manipulated, have shown significant effects, the study seems to indicate that texts may have a stronger emotional effect than pictures.

T1  - Navigating Public Prejudices: The Impact of Media and Attitudes on High-Profile Female Political Leaders
AN  - 896217819; 201121955
AB  - Predictions from the stereotype content model (SCM; Fiske et al. 2002) that suggest high-status career women are perceived as competent but cold were tested with a sample of college students in California (N=294; 51% female; M age=21.49). Participants completed measures of sexism and attitude extremity, read a positive or negative article about a female senator, and rated her warmth and competence. Results indicate positive media coverage counteracts the competent but cold prediction of the SCM. In the context of negative media, extreme hostile sexism predicted evaluations of low warmth and competence; however, males with less extreme sexist attitudes had greater warmth and competence evaluations. Results are discussed in relation to the SCM and worldview confirmation hypothesis. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Exploring News Coverage of Femicide: Does Reporting the News Add Insult to Injury
AN  - 896187630; 201121393
AB  - The news media help shape society's perception of social problems as well as public opinion of victims and offenders. Currently, there is extensive research devoted to the media's portrayal of violence against women but very little examination of femicide (for purposes of this research, defined as the murder of female intimate partners). Using newspaper coverage of femicide cases across the state of North Carolina over a 6-year period (995 articles representing 299 cases), the current study examines the news media's use of direct and indirect victim-blaming language, the sources cited in femicide reporting, and whether femicide cases are contextualized as an individual problem or within the broader social issue of intimate partner violence (IPV). Consistent with previous research, findings indicate that public sources (i.e., law enforcement) were the most commonly cited sources of information in news coverage of femicide compared to private sources (i.e., friends and family); however, domestic violence experts are cited more often than in prior studies. In addition, direct and indirect victim-blaming language is not as pervasive as previous research has suggested. Finally, the percentage of articles that contextualized the femicide as IPV is lower than that found in prior studies of femicide. Implications of these findings and future research are discussed.

T1  - The path to war: Exploring a second-level agenda-building analysis examining the relationship among the media, the public and the president
AN  - 902083184; 201122702
AB  - This study combines both the agenda-building and the second-level agenda approaches. It proposes an expansion of agenda-building research by examining the interaction among the president, the media and the public for an event that was not considered an existing 'real-world' condition. Specifically, this study uses former President Bush's five most prominent rationales for invading Iraq to explore the three-way reciprocal relationship among the media, the public and the president on attributes related to the pre-emptive strike on Iraq. The study found evidence of the information subsidies approach as Bush influenced media coverage of the Iraq War. The research also found more evidence of a linear model of agenda-building. The media and presidential agenda had only a limited influence on public concern about the war. Public concern influenced how much space the president devoted to the five issues on his Iraq War agenda and the press also had some limited influence on the issues stressed by the former president.

T1  - Examining the Perceptual Gap and Behavioral Intention in the Perceived Effects of Polling News in the 2008 Taiwan Presidential Election
AN  - 868010288; 201113191
AB  - This study examines the impact of polling news in the 2008 Taiwan presidential election from a third-person effect perspective. Results of a survey using a random sample of 1,097 respondents indicate that they perceived news about election polls to have a greater effect on others than themselves, regardless of whether the effects were perceived as negative or positive. Furthermore, findings show that attention to election polling news enhanced the perceived positive effects on self and others. Findings also point to a link between poll credibility and perceived effects on self and others. The less credible elections polls are perceived, the larger is the self-other perceptual gap. Finally, concern about the negative effects of election polling news on others is found to motivate respondents to consider protective behavior. However, findings show that perceived positive effects of such news on self resulted in intention to engage in campaign discourse. Theoretical implications of the findings to advance the third-person effect research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - HISTORICAL IMAGES OF PUERTO RICANS: THE CASE OF THE SOUTH BRONX
AN  - 1766845339
AB  - This paper was presented in a special session in the American Anthropology Association's 108th Annual Meeting in December 2009 in honor of Dr. Antonio Lauria-Perricelli. It is a research study that explored how a moral panic discourse in the 1970s shaped a public perception of the lower Bronx in New York City, and it examined how media stereotypes of blighted neighborhoods in the Bronx were reworked in social actors' perceptions of local poverty, race, and crime. The Bronx' mediated reputation was analyzed in the context of recent reforms in community policing. These reforms influenced a local discourse on social control and city authority that was infused with media stereotypes of Bronx residents. [media stereotypes, poverty, crime, Bronx, discourse]

T1  - News from YouTube: professional incorporation in Hong Kong newspaper coverage of online videos
AN  - 1125216806; 201241208
AB  - This study examines newspaper coverage of online videos in Hong Kong. Drawing upon the extant literature on media usages of online user-generated content, newspaper coverage of online videos is expected to exhibit signs of professional incorporation and content standardization over time. Findings from content and textual analyses show that Hong Kong newspapers seldom based their judgment of the newsworthiness of online videos solely on the videos' online currency. Rather, newspapers used the reporting of online videos to meet a variety of existing professional and/or organizational needs, such as filling news space, reporting on newsworthy events, performing as a watchdog, and representing public opinion. Furthermore, the contents of the reported videos and the sourcing patterns in the news coverage of different newspapers showed signs of standardization over time. The implications of the findings are discussed in terms of how mainstream media coverage of online videos could shape the social and cultural significance of new media in a society. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup contact and reduction of explicit and implicit prejudice toward immigrants: a study with Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises
AN  - 835111725; 201100074
AB  - A field study was conducted to test the effectiveness of intergroup contact (Allport, The nature of prejudice, 1954) as a predictor of explicit and implicit attitudes toward immigrants and to examine the processes driving its effects. Participants were Italian businessmen owning small and medium enterprises in Northern Italy who had daily contact with their immigrant workers. We tested a model in which contact ameliorated explicit attitudes, measured as support for social policies toward immigration, through reduced negative outgroup stereotypes. Furthermore, we predicted that contact would have a direct, unmediated effect on improved implicit attitudes toward immigrants, assessed with an Implicit Association Test (Greenwald et al., J Personal Soc Psychol 74:1464-1480, 1998). The results were fully consistent with predictions, thus providing strong support for the contact hypothesis at both an explicit and at an implicit level. The lack of correlation between explicit and implicit attitudes supports dual-process models, suggesting that the two types of attitudes are formed through different processes. The theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Media framing of proposed nuclear reactors: An analysis of print media
AN  - 764417453; 201064623
AB  - Nuclear energy has received substantial recent attention, marketed as a 'green' solution to global climate change (GCC) with calls for new reactors. However, considerable debate exists about whether it represents a viable solution to GCC. Given the complexity and urgency of the issue, a full and balanced debate is desirable. Since media play an important role in shaping public perception, we examined print media coverage of proposed reactors in Georgia-one site in the southeastern United States, which has been the focus of such proposals. We analysed the content of editorials and news articles from two local newspapers-the Augusta Chronicle and Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The former exclusively published pro-nuclear opinion pieces whereas the latter published a mix of pro- and anti-nuclear opinions. The majority of news articles in both newspapers generally presented balanced arguments. Pro- and anti-nuclear arguments most often reflected economic and environmental benefits and risks, whereas informational text primarily detailed regulatory processes and financing. Findings suggested that informational text was not necessarily 'neutral', sometimes masking covert pro- and anti-nuclear content. Implications for how findings might shape public opinion and strategies for shaping media and extending public deliberation are discussed. [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Divergent trends of euroscepticism in countries and regions of the European Union
AN  - 758122352; 201058265
AB  - Changes in different aspects of euroscepticism developed at different paces and in varying directions in the regions and countries of the European Union (EU) from 1994 to 2004. Using Eurobarometer data, along with data on country and region characteristics, information on the positions of the political parties and media attention paid to the EU, it is tested in detail whether opposite developments in euroscepticism were associated with opposite developments in influencing contextual characteristics. The authors found that the Netherlands became systematically more sceptical towards the EU, whereas the opposite trend was found in Spain. The introduction of the Euro partially explains these divergent trends, but the direction of this effect varies with countries' GDP. Changes in media attention on the EU further explain the changes in the public's attitude. However, this effect is contingent upon specific circumstances. Growing media attention increases political euroscepticism in countries with a negative EU budget balance, whereas it decreases such scepticism in countries with a positive balance. The effect of left-right ideological placement is contingent upon the EU budget balance as well. Finally, the effect of education on euroscepticism is found to be smaller in countries with a higher GDP. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Candidate Image in Election Campaigns: Attribute Agenda Setting, Affective Priming, and Voting Intentions
AN  - 754040399; 201050378
AB  - Combining three telephone surveys during the 2006 Israeli elections and a content analysis of leading Israeli newspapers, this study extended the function of attribute agenda setting and priming. Analysis documented that throughout the course of a campaign, public opinion fluctuates in tandem with the saliency of candidate attributes emphasized in the news. We also found an important consequence of attribute agenda setting, affective priming of candidate attributes, by which the prominent tone of the media's candidate attributes functions as a criterion for evaluating a candidate's suitability. Finally, this public evaluative tone was linked with voting intentions for the candidate's political party. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - THE IMPACT OF EXPOSURE TO MASS MEDIA CAMPAIGNS AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ON LEVELS AND TRENDS OF HIV-RELATED STIGMA AND DISCRIMINATION IN NIGERIA: TOOLS FOR ENHANCING EFFECTIVE HIV PREVENTION PROGRAMMES
AN  - 203900188; 20018118
AB  - People living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHAs) often face stigma and discrimination, especially in developing countries. HIV-related stigma is expressed through social ostracism, personal rejection, direct and indirect discrimination, and denial from families and friends. Consequently, it is associated with reduced adoption of preventive and care behaviours, including condom use, seeking for HIV test and care-seeking behaviour subsequent to diagnosis. Ignorance about the epidemiology of the disease on modes of transmission and prevention aggravates HIV-related stigma in Nigeria. Behaviour change communication activities through mass media have been shown to be an effective approach in improving people's knowledge about the disease. This paper monitors trends in the level of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs in Nigeria between 2003 and 2007. It also evaluates the impact of exposure to mass media and social support on the levels of accepting attitudes towards PLWHAs. A significant and positive trend was evident between 2003 and 2007 (p<0.0001). Furthermore, exposure to mass media communications on HIV and AIDS issues and social support were significantly related to the reduced stigma and discrimination against PLWHAs (p<0.0001).

T1  - But I'm No Bigot: How Prejudiced White Americans Maintain Unprejudiced Self-Images
AN  - 1866473421
AB  - Four experiments investigate a modern paradox: White Americans harbor racial prejudice, but view themselves as unprejudiced. We hypothesized that social representations of prejudice available in American culture lead many Whites to conclude that they are relatively unprejudiced. In Experiment 1, participants primed with the bigot stereotype viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiments 2 and 3, participants exposed to media representations of racists viewed themselves as less prejudiced. In Experiment 4, participants sought exposure to media representations of prejudice after a threat to their unprejudiced self-image. These experiments suggest that representations of prejudice in American culture lead prejudiced individuals to view themselves as unprejudiced, and the effect of these representations on people's unprejudiced self-images can be passive or intentional.

T1  - Prejudiced People Perceive More Community Support for Their Views: The Role of Own, Media, and Peer Attitudes in Perceived Consensus
AN  - 1866473486
AB  - People often overestimate others' support for their views (false consensus effect). Recent research has shown that this is particularly marked in the relation between perceived consensus and prejudice. The current research asked whether this partly arises in an in-group stereotype of the community as prejudiced. We investigated relations between different sources of normative information (self, media, peers), estimates of community attitudes, and perceived consensus in a sample of 135 community members. Media prejudice predicted community attitudes, and this further predicted consensus. However, strongest was a direct relation between own prejudice and perceived consensus. The results indicate a desire to appear nonprejudiced, relative to others. Confronting prejudiced people with information about community norms is a promising intervention under these circumstances.

T1  - The Glocalization of Politics in Television: Fiction or Reality?
AN  - 743064723; 201027669
AB  - This article investigates the 'glocalization' of the US TV popular drama series The West Wing, while focusing on one (in some ways) exceptional episode. Because politics is inherently linked to language, discourse & communication, I will take an approach from the perspective of critical discourse analysis (the discourse-historical approach), with a particular focus on elements of argumentation theory & rhetoric, & combine this with media studies. More specifically, I attempt to illustrate how a thorough understanding of the topoi operating within the complex dialogues & interactions helps to reveal the series' (manifest & latent) political & didactic objectives, embedded in a longstanding tradition of conveying US American liberal values via films & TV. The episode analyzed in this article, Isaac & Ishmael (which was broadcast immediately after 9/11) is exceptional because it explicitly relates to salient real life events; its topical focus on the 'war on terror' shifts attention from US domestic politics to an issue that, according to US policy rhetoric, concerns the whole world. Thus, this episode links the debates taking place in one of the world's most famous institutions, The White House, with those occurring in workplaces across the world: a truly 'g/local' moment. The interdisciplinary analysis allows insight into the intricate & complex discursive construction of new glocal narratives, particularly in times of political crisis, revealing which norms are projected & recontextualized both locally & globally, given the many translations of the series worldwide.
