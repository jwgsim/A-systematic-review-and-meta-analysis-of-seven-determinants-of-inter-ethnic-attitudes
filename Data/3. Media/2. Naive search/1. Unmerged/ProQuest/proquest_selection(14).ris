T1  - Contro i “taxi del mare”. La contronarrazione delle ONG e il caso SeaWatch3
AN  - 2567972416
AB  - With the end of Mare Nostrum, the outsourcing of rescue operations and the attempt to europeanise the crisis, the role of NGOs in the SAR area is shifting from a complementary to a fundamental one in rescue operations as a whole. The rapid change in the regulatory framework governing Italian and European actions requires a constant redefinition of their roles and action strategies in the SAR area. A consequence (unforeseen) of their presence has been the criminalization of their activities, which are considered functional with regard to human trackers. The rhetoric of “sea taxis” has produced a change in NGO communication strategy, with a more careful description of their actions to save migrants. The structures of communication have become more complex and professionalized, while a shrewder use is made of social networks in a hybrid system. The SeaWatch3 and Carola Rackete case study is an example of this change in strategy, which involves major personalization of communication, with extended use of the personal stories of migrants, crew and supporters. The case study is conducted with a qualitative methodology that takes into account the press review of 17 national newspapers, self-produced images by NGOs, and the collection of tweets (with NODEXL) during the long phases of the crisis. From the twittersphere emerges a) the progressive internationalization of the case, with the intervention of the main European media, the main political actors, the NGO network, and b) the attempts of reframing promoted especially by NGOs.

T1  - International Platforms, International Prejudice in the Platformization of Crafting
AN  - 2447803461
AB  - The platformization of crafting in an unequal world encourages discriminatory attitudes toward ethnic Others. Imagining that the “magic circle” of a subcultural platform can insulate users from racism is deeply misguided. We examine this thesis through a mixed-methods approach combining an online survey assessing perceived experiences of racism online and willingness to communicate with people of different ethnicities, discourse analysis of crafters’ online posts, and ethnographic interviews. As the e-commerce platform Etsy allowed “manufactured goods” to be sold in their marketplace as handmade, Western crafters channel their frustrations with a broken platform economy into racist sentiment against Chinese crafters. This study explores the implications of these Orientalist sentiments as a reinforcement of Western exceptionalism around originality and creativity, and it analyzes White fragility and the assumption of Whiteness within the crafting subculture.

T1  - Mobilizing in a hybrid political system: the Artvin case in Turkey
AN  - 2400022886
AB  - Hybrid political systems, which are neither rigorously liberal nor authoritarian, create ambiguous political environments for protests and social movements. We argue in this study that the power-resistance dynamics become more sophisticated within the ambiguous context of hybrid systems, such as the one in Turkey, where democratic channels are not totally suspended, but significantly weakened. Examining an episode of contention between an anti-mining movement and the Justice and Development Party (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi, AKP) government on the issue of gold mining in Artvin, a city in the Northeastern Black Sea region, we demonstrate that in the electoral authoritarian context of Turkey the anti-mining movement gained a political role and significance well beyond its original specific aims, transforming into a conflict between those discontented with the authoritarian features of the existing system and the incumbents of that very system. Our study implies that social movements in hybrid political systems may turn into broader struggles not only because they open up political avenues for various groups to express their resentment with the prevailing undemocratic system, but also because the hegemonic forces attempt to consolidate the existing regime by mobilizing a popular support for the repression of these mobilizations.

T1  - Asylum seekers in the global context of xenophobia: Introduction to the special issue
AN  - 2355233178
AB  - In 2015 the global media fixated on the ‘Syrian crisis’ that became the ‘refugee crisis’ for Europe. This construction of crisis was Eurocentric, temporally narrow and presented as problem for European nation states. We view the ‘problem’ rather as the nationalism and racism of receiving countries with a resurgence of a discourse of ethno-nationalist European identity sharpened by the global financial crisis and neoliberal austerity.Despite disparate national histories, we discern:a ‘blame-the-victim’ tendency to view those most harmed by the ‘refugee crisis’ as the ‘problems’ that constitute it;a state-centred perspective that requires the ‘problem’ to be addressed by nation states;a ‘charity starts at home’ ideology, usually from those sectors of society that are least willing to extend compassion ‘at home’;a systemically cruel state disposition towards asylum seekers as part of a regime of deterrence from seeking asylum in that state;a racialised and gender-blinkered regime of determination of refugee status;a politically opportunist populism that deploys ethno-nationalist ‘othering’ or scapegoating in times of economic distress and political instability;a wilful and convenient blindness to the histories of the contemporary conflicts as the legacies of colonialism;a globalised Islamophobia, casting Muslim asylum seekers as a potential security threat and undermining of national (or ‘western’, or civilisational) values;a gender-inflected racialisation that demonises the asylum-seeking other as hyper-patriarchal and occludes or minimises the patriarchy of the ‘civilised’ west. *repeats six paras on*

T1  - ‘Art is my language’: Afghan cultural production challenging Islamophobic stereotypes
AN  - 2355230950
AB  - Afghans and Afghanistan have, since September 11, risen to prominence in Western popular imagination as a land of tradition, tribalism and violence. Afghan women are assumed to be silent, submissive, and terrorised by Afghan men, who are seen as violent patriarchs driven by an uncompromising mediaeval religion. These Islamophobic tropes also inform perceptions of Afghans seeking asylum. In transit, identities are further reduced; asylum seekers lose even a national identity and become a Muslim threat – criminals, terrorists or invaders. These narrative frames permeate political discourse, media, and reports of non-governmental organisations (seeking donor funds to ‘save’ Afghan women). Drawing on fieldwork in Afghanistan and Indonesia, this article looks at how Afghans in Kabul and Indonesia are using art and other forms of cultural production to challenge over-simplified hegemonic narratives in the West, to open spaces for dialogue and expression within their own communities, and to offer a more nuanced account of their own identities.

T1  - War Frenzy: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism
AN  - 2541848835
AB  - Following a speech against the war on terror the author presented at a conference on Violence Against Women, she was publicly attacked and threatened for “hate-mongering.” This paper was written in the aftermath of the controversy that followed. The author’s speech highlighted the history of U.S. foreign policy and sought to mobilize feminist opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. The war, she argued, was reviving the colonial/imperial global divide and would be catastrophic. The author explores here how a number of carefully considered words used in the speech were treated in the public controversy that followed as too “incendiary” and used to shut down political opposition to the invasion of Afghanistan. By publicly branding her an ungrateful and hate-filled immigrant woman, and an apologist for terrorism, the media provided a platform to shut down political opposition and advance the racist and Islamophobic political ideology of the war.

T1  - PERSECUTION AND THE ART OF FREEDOM: ALEXIS DE TOCQUEVILLE ON THE IMPORTANCE OF FREE PRESS AND FREE SPEECH IN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY
AN  - 2521434580
AB  - According to Tocqueville, the freedom of the press, which he treats as an extension of the freedom of speech, is a primary constituent element of liberty. Tocqueville treats the freedom of the press in relation to and as an extension of the right to assemble and govern one’s own affairs, both of which he argues are essential to preserving liberty in a free society. Although scholars acknowledge the importance of civil associations to liberty in Tocqueville’s political thought, they routinely ignore the importance he places on the freedom of the press and speech. His reflections on the importance of the free press and speech may help to shed light on the dangers of recent attempts to censor the press and speech.

T1  - The Tragedy of The Girl-Child: A Feminist Reading of Ngozi Omeje's The Conquered Maiden and Amma Darko's Faceless
AN  - 2354876219
AB  - This paper is a critical interrogation of Ngozi Omeje's The Conquered Maiden and Amma Darko's Faceless from the feminist ideological perspective. While Ngozi Omeje looks at the place of the girl-child from the Igbo's cultural world view using the platform of the theater, Amma Darko explores the predicament and the subjugation of the girl-child from the Ghanaian socio-cultural perspective using the novel as her medium. This paper examines the predicaments and the socio-cultural prejudice against the girl-child in the patriarchal society of Nigeria and in matriarchal Ghanaian society. The theoretical framework of the paper is based on the feminist sociological theory that re-examines and compares the treatment of women vis-a-vis men in society. This theory also evaluates issues of bias, prejudice and discrimination against women, and by implication the girl-child, to determine whether or not women have been fairly or justly treated in society. This paper establishes, based on visual and non-visual signifiers in the texts, that the girl-child is a victim of discrimination in both Nigerian and Ghanaian societies. Both texts confirm the hostility of society towards the girl-child, and its preference for the men who are seen to be more reliable and dependable, and who are believed to be the carriers and preservers of the seed of progeny. This paper analyzes the writers' condemnation of these prejudicial, discriminatory and hostile behavioral attitudes against the girl-child. Both texts are thus interpreted as a biting satire against gender discrimination in African societies.

T1  - The impact of race relations on NFL attendance: An econometric analysis
AN  - 2344551098
AB  - Recent protests by athletes focused on raising awareness of social issues and injustices, such as the Black Lives Matter protests led by Colin Kaepernick of the National Football League’s San Francisco 49ers, have generated a great deal of attention and debate within society. Notably, the protests conducted by these players before games in the 2016 and 2017 seasons became such a sensational topic, that extraordinary amounts of attention was paid to it by the media, consumers, and even politicians who often denounced the players as being unpatriotic. Against this backdrop, the current research examines whether fluctuations in attendance at National Football League games are associated with explicit attitudes towards race, implicit racial prejudice, and racial animus within a population. Specifically, using multiple measures of racial attitudes as part of an econometric model estimating attendance at games, the results suggest that having a higher level of implicit bias in a market leads to a decline in consumer interest in attending games. Additionally, using interaction effects, it is found that while protests generally reduced the negative effects of implicit bias on attendance, markets with lower levels of implicit bias actually had greater declines of attendance during the protests. From this, the current study advances the understanding of racial attitudes and racial animus, and its impact on consumer behavior at the regional level. That is, this research highlights that racial sentiments in a local market were able to predict changes in market behaviors, suggesting that race relations can have wide reaching impacts.

T1  - Failing victims, fuelling hate: challenging the harms of the ‘Muslim grooming gangs’ narrative
AN  - 2337944990
AB  - ‘Muslim grooming gangs’ have become a defining feature of media, political and public debate around child sexual exploitation in the UK. The dominant narrative that has emerged to explain a series of horrific cases is misleading, sensationalist and has in itself promoted a number of harms. This article examines how racist framings of ‘Muslim grooming gangs’ exist not only in extremist, far-right fringes but in mainstream, liberal discourses too. The involvement of supposedly feminist and liberal actors and the promotion of pseudoscientific ‘research’ have lent a veneer of legitimacy to essentialist, Orientalist stereotypes of Muslim men, the demonisation of whole communities and demands for collective responsibility. These developments are situated in the broader socio-political context, including the far Right’s weaponisation of women’s rights, the ‘Islamophobia industry’ and a long history of racialising crime. We propose alternative ways of understanding and responding to child sexual exploitation/abuse. We contend that genuinely anti-racist feminist approaches can help in centring victims/survivors and their needs and in tackling serious sexual violence without demonising entire communities.

T1  - The dual causes of fragmentation: Democratic security and the communitarian state in Colombian politics
AN  - 2327863069
AB  - This chapter analyzes speeches delivered by former Colombian President, Álvaro Uribe Vélez, between August 2002 and August 2009, which can be found on the official website of the presidency: (http://web.presidencia.gov.co/discursos/). We attempt to identify the webs of meaning surrounding the concepts of ‘Democratic Security’ and ‘Communitarian State’ with awareness of the relationship between discourse, ideology and power. The aim is to better understand the political power of the plans, programs and projects developed by Uribe’s administration, and how this was affected by widespread deployment of the media. These policies are conditioned by a set of colonialist principles that are embodied in symbolic-discursive strategies that result in representations, by means of which mechanisms of marginalization, discrimination and polarized hierarchy are legitimized from the different social spheres. During the 7-year period analyzed there were controversial debates over the commission of crimes against humanity by national security agents, as well as corruption scandals over topics like ‘para-politics’, ‘false positives’, selective arrests, extrajudicial killings and violations of the sovereignty of bordering countries. Within this political context, we attempt to identify the inherent tensions and social conflicts. It is argued that the analyzed discourses reproduce colonialist thoughts, in relation to neoliberal principles and the application of global policies. Using the principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), we explore the strategies and resources used in Uribe’s speeches and how major themes are positioned to reproduce systems of beliefs, values and attitudes.

T1  - National Leaders’ Personality Cues and Americans’ Attitudes Toward Their Countries
AN  - 2431022222
AB  - The increasing visibility of national leaders in news media generates cues that might contribute substantially to the structure of international mass opinion regarding their nations. This study shows that Americans’ behavioral intentions in favor or against a foreign nation are affected by their perceptions of its leader. Using data from four experiments (N = 1,751), we demonstrate that exposure to news coverage of a foreign leader's behaviors is causally related to intentions (a) to support a foreign policy (i.e., economic and military aid) in favor of that leader’s country, (b) to purchase products imported from there, and (c) to visit it as a tourist. We discuss the theoretical implications of the findings for the management of foreign relations, public diplomacy, and other aspects of the international arena.

T1  - Anti‐Muslim hate speech and displacement narratives: Case studies from Sri Lanka and Australia
AN  - 2321381020
AB  - Muslim communities have frequently been the victim of vilification and discrimination in Australia and the broader Asian region. This article discusses and compares the narratives around Muslim vilification in Australia and Sri Lanka. Despite the fact that these two nations are vastly different in size, demographics and cultural history, I will argue that there are remarkable similarities in how Muslims are subject to attack in both nations. The hate speech occasioned against Muslims in Sri Lanka and Australia is shaped by almost identical narrative structures and is cultivated in similar online environments. In both cases, anti‐Muslim animus is fuelled by a fear of displacement and perceived contamination of what nativists regard as ethnically sovereign territory. I will argue that the underlying sub‐text in both cases is owed to a repulsion to the physical presence of Muslims which can be understood in terms of Mary Douglas' concept of the moral pollutant.

T1  - Challenging Terrorism as a Form of "Otherness": Exploring the Parallels between Far-right and Muslim Religious Extremism
AN  - 2410495868
AB  - It is commonly argued in public, media, and political discourse that Muslim religious extremism is the primary form of violent extremism plaguing western nations, thus casting terrorism and political violence in the realm of Otherness. With the growth of farright and white supremacist groups in a number of North American and European societies these arguments become increasingly tenuous and ambivalent. This paper sets out to do a comparative analysis of far-right extremism and Muslim religious extremism to challenge the notion that terrorism and violent extremism is a form of Otherness. This article draws parallels between far-right and Muslim religious extremism in the realm of tactics and ideology. By understanding these similarities, holistic and comprehensive policies relating to countering violent extremism can be developed, addressing issues of marginalization, empowerment, and education, which attend to issues affecting individuals inclining towards both forms of extremist thought.

AN  - 2410494900
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to analyze the constitutive figure of the Islamophobic discourse: the Muslim dissident. We establish a typology of the main figures that fall under the definition of Muslim dissidents, as well as of the social context through which they operate. We identify dissident Muslims as a social group through their intellectual contributions and compare their trajectories as well as their social attributes. This allows us to analyze their position and the medium of their intellectual statements.

T1  - Manufacturing Contempt: State-Linked Populism in South Korea
AN  - 2281574073
AB  - The current crisis in South Korea-Japan relations partly originates from a South Korean state that is neither fully authoritarian nor liberal. In the past, right-wing, authoritarian regimes in Seoul fomented populist-nationalist contempt against Japan and North Korea, with biased and censored public discourse, but ignored public sentiments when negotiating with the target states. Since the democratic transition in the 1990s, South Korean governments no longer ignore public sentiments. Left-wing leaders and groups have pluralized public discourse about North Korea, exposing citizens to various views and information, and generated public support for Seoul to pursue rapprochement; but, no comparable groups generate counter-narratives about Japan. Instead, left-wing groups have accelerated negative portrayals and coopted state officials to censor dissenting views. Korean censorship follows illiberal trends in western democracies to ban certain public expressions considered offensive to historically victimized groups. The Korean case demonstrates that, without meaningful opposition and counter-narratives, activists for populist causes link with state power to infringe on the rights of domestic citizens and foreign entities. The remedy is liberalized public discourse that critically discusses complex realities.

On the other hand, for the researchers--both in discourse analysis and in other areas such as sociology, politics and communication--the book shows and clarifies the implicit contents that lie in the text, a fact that contributes to the persuasive process of discourse. Collective identity is fragile and must be constantly defended (differentiation process). Public opinion needs motives: events that present themselves to it and to the group that supports it (politicians, opinion polls, media), and emerges by reaction of individuals in situations they deem unsustainable. Thus, for public opinion to manifest itself, it is necessary to emerge an event likely to sensitize many individuals. An event that causes problems and that is not resolved.

T1  - Civic discourse on Facebook during the Australian same‐sex marriage postal plebiscite
AN  - 2293077288
AB  - In 2017 the Australian Government undertook a national survey to determine public support for the legalisation of same‐sex marriage. This raised concerns the ‘plebiscitary' act may create harms to two groups: LGBTI people and those religious people with strong attachment to heteronormative marriage. Justifying the process, the Government advanced the possibility of civil dialogue generative of understanding. While instances of hate speech in public spaces were reported, this paper examines comparatively private speech during the period. Based on an analysis of posts to relevant Facebook pages, this analysis found opponents to same‐sex marriage were more highly mobilised online, and considerable differences in the character of online debate for and against the proposed changes. Importantly, while uncivil and ‘hate' speech were part of online conversations, the overall quantum of this uncivil discourse was lower than many feared. Additionally, the process did not generate considerable democratic dialogue around policy alternatives and rationales, particularly among ‘Yes' campaign supporters who were more homogenous in their acceptance of dominant campaign framing of the issue than their opponents. Significantly for ongoing public debates about public values like educational access and freedom of expression, opponents to change focused their arguments against same‐sex marriage around a subset of unrelated issues: free speech, religious freedoms, and diversity in public schools.

T1  - Analyzing social movements from multiple perspectives: Key concepts and methodologies of study
AN  - 2293791873
AB  - Social movements happen worldwide nowadays. They have clear or diffuse motives, imply innovative or familiar sorts of manifestations. The study of social movement can be found in sociology, social psychology, economics, political science, history, anthropology. No matter the field of study, the research interests are focused on how, why and where do mass movements occurs. Together with the development of the theoretical study over social movements through history, we can notice also a diversity of opinions regarding the methodology that should be used in order to better analyze collective actions. Brouder studies refer to the development of social movements (actors involved, narrative used, defined goals and identity). up to the impact of collective actions over the political spectrum or the discernible changes generated within a society. Strictly from a sociological point of view, social movements are collective and goal-oriented actions, based on informal networks, shared beliefs about conflictual issues and with a possible high impact over society, generating change and laying the foundations for the state's modernisation. Talking in terms of social psychology or communication, we can infer that a social movement's narrative and its reflection in media and public agenda represent key-elements to its developments and indicators over the strength of the social networks involved.

T1  - Populism in political cartoons: caricatures of Nordic populist leaders
AN  - 2248219090
AB  - This article analyses political cartoons that depict contemporary populist politicians in Denmark, Finland, and Sweden between 2005 and 2015, a period which focuses on the electoral successes of these movements. The hypothesis is that by analyzing cartoons we can explore the underlying moral and normative confrontations linked to current political populism in the Nordic liberal democracies, which arose during the insurgent phase of the domestic right-wing parties. In total, 60 political cartoons are analyzed by means of content categorization and visual semiotics. The most popular caricatures in the cartoons depicted the leaders of the populist parties, while the most common signifiers linked the populism in the cartoons explicitly to fascism, Nazism, nativism, and racism. In this, the cartoons differed from news journalism, reflecting the specific role of cartoons in public opinion discourse and indicating special characteristics that derive from particular political contexts and also the cartoonists' own perspectives.

T1  - YouTube Commentaries on Trans Time-lapse Videos: Transforming Misgendering Stances into Pedagogical Moments
AN  - 2577070527
AB  - The distribution and consumption of transgender time-lapse videos on YouTube have increased over the last few decades, providing trans communities with a valuable resource for self-making. On YouTube, vloggers can present images and videos of their bodies as they document their gender transitions through several practices that rely on temporality and time-space compression. As a genre, time-lapse videos comprise creative worldmaking practices where users document their gender transformations using hundreds to thousands of still photos or video segments which show their social, somatic, and biochemical changes. Although scholars have discussed different worldmaking and community organising practices that take place as trans vloggers display their gendered subjectivities online, there is sparse scholarship studying the recurrent patterns of behaviour on the comment space below these videos. In this article, I draw on critical discourse analytic studies of new media and stance-taking as I review and analyse discriminatory strategies – principally misgendering and ungendering – that YouTubers used to denigrate the self-identified gender of a given vlogger. Stance-taking enables us to identify and track reoccurring attitudes steeped in cisgenderism. At the same time, capturing how vloggers and trans allies respond to (intentional or unintentional) text-based forms of prejudice, can create teachable moments for YouTube spectators. While misgendering stances aim to pressure their targets into certain kinds of gender and sex embodiments, insurrectionary stance-acts co-opt and call out the language of discrimination, lending legitimacy and authority to trans vloggers to create, enact, and live their own genders.

T1  - CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND ITS MEASUREMENT IN FITNESS CLUBS OF WARSAW
AN  - 2277983146
AB  - Consumer satisfaction is an important issue in marketing research and consumer surveys. In the literature on the subject, there is a consensus among researchers regarding the requirement to design tools measuring consumer satisfaction for various industry sectors. Because of that, the authors of the article decided to design their own consumer satisfaction survey adapted for one of the biggest fitness club chain in Warsaw. An innovation of the designed tool is a comprehensive reference to the overall line of business of the fitness organization in accordance with the 7P theory for services, relating to marketing instruments used by organizations to influence the customer. The aim of this work is to present the methodology of designing and using the CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) for companies providing fitness services. Designed approach can be universal for all fitness companies providing fitness services and it covers all 7 instruments of marketing mix. The methodology of measuring customer satisfaction seems to be adapted to the nature of customers of the fitness sector as well as small and medium enterprises dominating in this field. Measuring customer satisfaction makes it possible to take decisions and contributes to the quality of the services offered.

T1  - (In/exclusion) Humor and diversity in Finnish public radio: ‘If all immigrants were as funny as you guys, nobody would have any problems’
AN  - 2205313002
AB  - Similar to the rest of Europe, multicultural programming in Finland has become risky for public broadcasting. Programs aimed at encouraging social inclusion may not attract sufficiently large audiences and may be attacked by ever louder anti-immigration voices. This article focuses on what seems to be an exception in this respect: Ali and Husu. Hosted by immigrants from Iran and Somalia – a stand-up comedian and a politician – this popular talk show aired on Finnish public radio between 2013 and 2016. Through interviews with the producers and the analysis of a selection of episodes, we examine Ali and Husu’s daring and unapologetic ethnic/racial humor as well as its combination of funny and serious talk. Our findings underscore specific ways in which multicultural programming can use humor strategically to engage relatively large and diverse audiences in discussions meant to humanize immigrants and challenge social prejudices, while minimizing right-wing criticism and unintended readings.

T1  - Gay shame in a geopolitical context
AN  - 2178915736
AB  - With the developing acceptance of gay equality in the west, it is assumed that we live in a post-shame era, with 'the world we have won'. However, this is a chimeric cliché of neoliberalism (rather like the idea that we are all postfeminist now). The 'proud' homosexual of the west is discursively constructed against the 'shamed' homosexual of the east, a typecasting resonant with postcolonial clichés of the primal, religious, and homophobic savagery of the global south in contrast with the civilising, liberal evolution of the secular global north. Shame displacement is of course a dynamic of shame itself. The perceived failure in achieving the 'proud iconic gay' of media cultures in the global North results in a traumatic double bind of being ashamed of being ashamed. This article will reconsider the cultural politics and temporality of shame for primarily white gay identities after the 'War on Terror'. As Islamophobia has exponentially increased, some western gays translocate their unacknowledged shame onto a misconceived 'brown threat' in a complex, aggressive, and racist shame loop [Lewis, H.B., 1971. Shame and guilt in neurosis. New York: International Universities Press; Scheff, T.J., and Retzinger, S.M., 1991. Emotions and violence: shame and rage in destructive conflict.

T1  - Muslims’ Representation in Donald Trump’s Anti-Muslim-Islam Statement: A Critical Discourse Analysis
AN  - 2326940079
AB  - [...]in 2016, after the Orlando massacre at a gay nightclub, Hillary Clinton notoriously called Americans to come forward and return to the ‘spirit of “9/11”; a deeply conservative term following the 9/11 tragedy, which supports the nationalist move that basically gives license to the institutional scapegoating of Muslims, immigrants, Arabs, and South Asians on the basis of structured Islamophobia (Tolan 2016).

For the macro-analysis, Van Dijk (1998, 2004, 2006) has identified four basic strategies that are used in order to legitimize the self and de-legitimize the other; 1 emphasize positive things about ‘us’; 2 emphasize negative things about ‘them’; 3 de-emphasize negative things about ‘us’; and. 4 de-emphasize positive things about ‘them’.

[...]in terms of macro-analysis, the research’s epistemic underpinning focuses upon the self-other binary is as demonstrated below; Donald Trump: Self, We, Us → In-group Muslims: Others, They, Them → Out-group In terms of the micro-analysis, this model comprises 25 key terms or can be said as rhetorical discursive strategies; Actor description, authority, burden, categorization, comparison, consensus, counterfactual, disclaimer, euphemism, evidentiality, argumentation, illustration/example, generalization, hyperbole, implication, irony, lexicalization, metaphor, national self-glorification, norm expression, number game, polarization (us-them), populism, presupposition, vagueness, and victimization.

After this bloody incident, the global media was critical of the Muslim community and further associated them with global terror.

[...]former President Barack Obama called on Americans to show tolerance towards the Muslim community and asserted that America is at war against terrorism, not Islam.

Since the very early stage of his political career, he has propounded high levels of Islamophobia.

[...]it can be concluded from the whole discussion that President Donald J. Trump has employed an anti-Islam and anti-Muslim strategy since the announcement of his candidacy for the presidential race on the Republican card in order to build an affinity between the populist anti-Muslim sentiments of Americans and himself.

T1  - 'I can't remember a more depressing time but I don't blame anyone for that': remembering and commemorating the wartime internment of enemy aliens in Britain
AN  - 2173651037
AB  - In October 2000, David Cesarani decried the unnecessary internment of refugees from Nazi Germany in Britain during the Second World War on the BBC Radio 4 programme Behind the Wire. Until the last few decades, little was known about the internment of enemy aliens by the British during the war. However, in recent years, novels such as David Baddiel's The Secret Purposes, published in 2004, and exhibitions such as 'Schwitters in Britain' at the Tate Britain in 2013, have introduced a wider audience to this oft-forgotten part of the British wartime narrative. Some of those interned in Britain were sent to Canada and Australia, which led to the greatest tragedy of the entire internment debacle, the sinking of the Arandora Star. The year 2015 marked the seventy-fifth anniversary of this tragedy, and the memory of those who were lost lives on in the British-Italian community. However, outside those affected by the Arandora Star disaster, little is commemorated or understood by the general public. Yet the legacy of the former internees is all around us. Who has not, on visiting the British Library, walked past former internee's Eduardo Paolozzi's statue of Newton? What connoisseur of classical music has not enjoyed the sound of the Amadeus Quartet, perhaps the only positive outcome of internment? Pistol's article will examine the memory of the camps and consider the differences between how internment has been remembered and commemorated by former internees and the general public.

T1  - ‘Sexual misery’ or ‘happy British Muslims’?: Contemporary depictions of Muslim sexuality
AN  - 2170178471
AB  - We begin this article with a close look at some contemporary pictures of sexual life in the Muslim world that have been painted in certain sections of the Western media, asking how and why these pictures matter. Across a range of mainstream print media from the New York Times to the Daily Mail, and across reported events from several countries, can be found pictures of ‘sexual misery’. These ‘frame’ Muslim men as tyrannical, Muslim women as downtrodden or exploited, and the wider world of Islam as culpable. Crucially, this is not the whole story. We then consider how these negative representations are being challenged and how they can be challenged further. In doing so, we will not simply set pictures of sexual misery against their binary opposites, namely pictures abounding in the promise of sexual happiness. Instead, we search for a more complex picture, one that unsettles stereotypes about the sexual lives of Muslims without simply idealising its subjects. This takes us to the journalism, life writing and creative non-fiction of Shelina Zahra Janmohamed and the fiction of Ayisha Malik and Amjeed Kabil. We read this long-form work critically, attending to manifest advances in depictions of the relationships of Muslim-identified individuals over the last decade or so, while also remaining alert to lacunae and limitations in the individual representations. More broadly, we hope to signal our intention to avoid both Islamophobia and Islamophilia in scrutinising literary texts.

T1  - The emotional costs of computers: an expectancy-value theory analysis of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority students' STEM attitudes
AN  - 2116068275
AB  - There is a strong push to increase American students' interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) careers. However, minority and female students remain underrepresented in the STEM fields. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to examine the potential factors that both incite and dissuade STEM interest. We apply Expectancy-Value Theory (EVT) to examine STEM attitudes of predominantly low-socioeconomic status minority elementary school students over the course of a computing intervention. Furthermore, we integrate the digital inequality mental access conceptualization of 'emotional costs' into the EVT model in order to predict students' negative STEM attitudes. Data are from a large-scale computing intervention that took place in a primarily minority, high poverty, urban elementary school district located in the southeastern USA. Results indicate that positive expectancies for success and subjective task values predict students' positive STEM attitudes. Emotional costs toward technology primarily predict negative STEM attitudes. Students' expectancies/values and emotional costs may have a 'push-and-pull' effect on the formation of STEM attitudes. This study successfully links digital disparities to STEM disparities by integrating the digital inequality concept of emotional costs. Practically, we conclude that future computing interventions should increase students' academic-related expectancies and values while also minimizing their emotional costs in order to address both digital and STEM inequalities. Theoretically, we conclude that broad conceptualizations of emotional costs should be included in future studies to help explain negative attitudes/motivations toward STEM-related topics.

T1  - Media and Corruption: The Other Way Round—Exploring Macro Determinants of Journalists’ Perceptions of the Accountability Instruments and Governmental Pressures
AN  - 2430087058
AB  - This article reverses the direction of the causal link between corruption and media, in particular, journalism, as it has been commonly investigated in communication studies. Few existing studies have explored the effects of corruption on journalists’ practices and self-conceptions. Based on a comparative survey of 1,764 journalists in 12 European countries and two Arab states, conducted in 2011 and 2012, this article investigates how perceived corruption—considered as an extra-media macro determinant—affects journalists’ perceptions of Media Accountability Instruments (MAI) impact and of governmental pressures on journalism quality. The empirical results obtained show that the more widespread corruption is in a country’s public sector, the lower the journalists’ perceptions of the MAI impact and the higher their perceptions of government pressures.

T1  - Perceptions and Experiences of Non-Muslim Minority Students on the Muslim Image
AN  - 2331235369
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore non-Muslim minority students attending a minority-serving university in a rural community on their knowledge and experiences of the Muslim image. Research is dominated by majority-minority interactions and perspectives regarding subjective reports of controversial issues, especially the heightened awareness of Muslim image in the United States over the past two decades. This trend has perpetuated a growing gap in knowledge of understanding the unique minority-minority perceptions and the development of minority cultural awareness; therein, generating the motivation for this study. The researchers applied a qualitative assessment exploring non-Muslim understanding of foundational components associated with the Muslim image, such as basic Islamic vocabulary competencies and additional open-ended questions regarding experienced social interactions. From the responses of the participants stemmed five emerging themes: enculturation, geographic association, stigmatization, influencers, and empathy. These results demonstrate a general openness toward the Muslim identity but also include consistent misconceptions that may be easily rectified by interactive-educational interventions. The findings acknowledge the propensity of non-Muslim minority students' willingness to learn from authentic Muslim image, despite the influence of disingenuous Muslim images depicted by current media outlets.

T1  - Training the Porous Body: Evangelicals and the Ex‐Gay Movement
AN  - 2133729625
AB  - In this article, I examine how US evangelical opposition to LGBT rights stems from a unique understanding of sexuality and the person. As my respondents explained to me in over sixteen months of field research, evangelical rejection of LGBT individuals and practices is rooted not simply in prejudice but also in a culturally specific notion of personhood that requires Christian bodies to orient themselves to the divine. In evangelical Christianity, the body, along with its capacity to feel and communicate, is understood as a porous vessel receptive to communication with God. In contrast to a dominant idea that sexual orientations shape individual identities, sexuality within this religious world instead facilitates the movement of moral forces across individual bodies and geographic scales. Sexual desires and sexual acts are broadly understood in evangelical cosmology as communicative mediums for supernatural forces. This understanding of sexuality as a central component of moral agency shapes widespread practices of ostracism of people who identify as LGBT within evangelicalism and often leads to anti‐LGBT political positions. Claiming an LGBT identity is seen as making one a distinct kind of person incommensurate with evangelical porosity. [evangelical, sexuality, embodiment, United States]Alternate abstract:RESUMENEn este artículo, examino cómo la oposición evangélica en Estados Unidos a los derechos de la comunidad LGBT proviene de un entendimiento único de la sexualidad y la persona. Como mis respondedores me explicaron en más de dieciséis meses de investigación de campo, el rechazo evangélico a individuos y prácticas LGTB está enraizado no simplemente en prejuicios sino también en una noción culturalmente específica de la condición de persona que requiere que los cuerpos cristianos se orienten en sí mismos hacia lo divino. En la cristiandad evangélica, el cuerpo, junto con su capacidad de sentir y comunicarse, se entiende como un recipiente poroso receptivo de comunicación con Dios. En contraste a una idea dominante que las orientaciones sexuales dan forma a las identidades individuales, la sexualidad dentro del mundo religioso, en cambio facilita el movimiento de fuerzas morales a través de cuerpos individuales y escalas geográficas. Los deseos sexuales y los actos sexuales son ampliamente entendidos en la cosmología evangélica como medios comunicativos para las fuerzas sobrenaturales. Este entendimiento de la sexualidad como un componente central de la agencia moral le da forma a las prácticas extendidas de ostracismo de las personas quienes se identifican como LGBT dentro del evangelicalismo y a menudo lleva a posiciones políticas anti‐LGBT. Reivindicar una identidad LGBT se ve como el hacer un tipo distinto de persona inconmensurable con la porosidad evangélica. [evangélica, sexualidad, corporeización, Estados Unidos]

T1  - Online Gamers, Lived Experiences, and Sense of Belonging: Students at the University of the Free State, Bloemfontein
AN  - 2139622802
AB  - Individuals who partake in video games are often regarded with prejudice. It is an activity that is perceived to be mainly related to senseless leisure and teenage entertainment. However, many diverse people make video games such an important part of their lives that they become passionately engaged in it. Video games and online video gaming offer the player immersive experiences unlike any other forms of media. A phenomenological and interpretive exploration is undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of the narratives of online gamers and their experiences of a sense of belonging to the associated online communities. Through the use of in-depth interviews, the article explores various aspects of the life stories of a group of eight South African university students. It attempts to show how online gaming has become a part of their lifeworlds. The aim of this article is to present the narratives of online gamers as rich and descriptive accounts that maintain the voices of the participants. Various aspects of the lifeworlds of online gamers are explored. Firstly, an exploration is undertaken to gain an understanding of what it means to be a gamer. It focuses on how a person can become involved with gaming and how it can evolve into something that a person is engaged with on a daily basis. Secondly, it explores how video games influence the perception of reality of gamers. Immersion in video games can transfer a player into an alternative reality and can take the focus away from the real world. This can lead to feelings of joy and excitement, but can also lead to escapism. Lastly, the article shifts attention towards how online video gamers experience online communities. Players can have positive experiences with random strangers online, but because of the anonymous nature of the online environment, it can also lead to negative and isolating experiences.

T1  - Would you date ‘the undateables’? An analysis of the mediated public debate on the reality television show ‘The Undateables’
AN  - 2092734411
AB  - This article examines the different discourses in the online public debate surrounding the television dating show ‘The Undateables’. The programme, which exclusively focuses on dates of disabled people, was launched in the UK in 2012, and local adaptations of the format were broadcast in Belgium and the Netherlands. The article applies the dis/ability approach of Goodley and Runswick-Cole (2014) to examine the way in which representations of disabled singles are evaluated online. As a perspective, dis/ability destabilizes notions of normativity and enables an inquiry into not just marginalized identities, but also dominant identities. The analysis of blog posts, tweets and online press reviews of the first series of the British, Flemish and Dutch version of ‘The Undateables’ provides more insights into hegemonic and resistant notions on disability, dating and romantic relationships. This article argues that prejudices, as already identified by Morris in 1991, are still very dominant today.

T1  - The marketing of sugar‐sweetened beverages to young people on Facebook
AN  - 2266267560
AB  - Objective: We explored how sugar‐sweetened beverages are marketed to Australian young people through sugar‐sweetened beverage brand Facebook pages.Methods: We undertook a content analysis of Facebook posts made by six of the most popular sugar‐sweetened beverage Facebook pages in Australia. Data were collected for a six‐month period and were quantitatively analysed for descriptive data and explicit marketing techniques and then thematically analysed for implicit marketing messages.Results: There were almost 1.9 million engagements across the six pages over the six‐month period. Most posts (70%) included one or more calls to action through which followers were encouraged to do something. Content by sports and energy drink brands were heavily dominated by ‘sporting prowess’ and ‘masculinity’ themes while content by Coca‐Cola shared the message of ‘having fun with friends’ and ‘happiness’. All pages used outdoor setting scenes.Conclusions: Sugar‐sweetened beverage brands use Facebook to align their marketing with the socio‐cultural values and practices likely to be regarded as important by young people.Implications for public health: Our findings provide challenges and opportunities for those in public health advocacy and policy to consider for future obesity‐reduction strategies.

T1  - Measuring Populist Attitudes on Three Dimensions
AN  - 2430088135
AB  - Theoretically, populism has been conceptualized as a political ideology with three sub-dimensions: anti-elitism attitudes, a preference for popular sovereignty, and a belief in the homogeneity and virtuousness of the people. However, empirical research to date has treated populist attitudes as a unidimensional construct. To address this issue, we propose to conceptualize populist attitudes as a latent higher-order construct with three distinct first-order dimensions. A 12-item inventory was developed using two survey studies conducted in Switzerland in 2014 and 2015. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to test the construct validity of this measure of populist attitudes. The measurement that is proposed allows for a fine-grained study of populist attitudes in the general public.

T1  - The multimodal construction of race: a review of critical race theory research
AN  - 2050474882
AB  - Issues of race periodically rupture in the national and international consciousness, while at other times, there is a false belief that society has arrived at a post-racial era. Either way, there remains impetus for the critical interrogation of the racialisation of multimodal literacies in education, and critical race theory (CRT) is a leading approach. This article reviews original studies that collectively analyse multimodal texts and practices to understand the construction of race in education. Multimodal texts have proliferated in online textual ecologies due to the ease of production and rapid global dissemination of image-based texts in the twenty-first century. Such texts combine two or more modes, such as images, words, sounds, and gestures. Sites for the circulation of multimodal literacies - online and offline - serve to disrupt, reify, or perhaps even exacerbate racial identities, prejudice, and subordination in education. The review highlights the prevalent themes: (a) Discursive construction of race in the spoken mode, (b) Anti-racist and multimodal counter-narratives, (c) The racialisation of multimodal literature for children and adolescents, and (d) Race in music, visual and performing arts, and digital media. Gaps in CRT research and challenges are posed for future research of race in the context of cultural and technological change.

T1  - Race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals: Arab physicians and nurses in Israeli public healthcare organizations
AN  - 2012859218
AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

T1  - Risk Perception of Nuclear Energy After Fukushima: Stability and Change in Public Opinion in Switzerland
AN  - 2430088144
AB  - The accident at Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant in 2011 greatly affected attitudes toward nuclear energy in many countries, including Switzerland. In this study, we analyzed the evolution of public opinion about nuclear energy in Switzerland from 2012 to 2014 to determine how different dimensions of attitudes toward nuclear energy changed in the years following the accident and which factors influenced general opinion about nuclear energy. The primary findings show that public opinion about nuclear energy became only slightly more positive as time passed and that the most important predictor of the general opinion about nuclear energy was the individual assessment of its benefits and risk.

T1  - The New Portrayal of Female Child Sexual Offenders in the Print Media: A Qualitative Content Analysis
AN  - 1994285072
AB  - The mass media has the ability to shape public opinion on child sexual offenders. To date, research has found that offenses committed by female child sexual offenders have been portrayed in the media with undertones of sympathy and romanticization. With the apparent shift in gender roles toward gender egalitarianism, the aim of the present study was to obtain an up-to-date understanding of how female child sexual offenders are portrayed in the print media across western countries. The study utilized newspaper articles involving female child sexual offenders, published in English across western countries from 2012 to 2016 (N = 35 articles). A qualitative content analysis revealed two major themes: female child sexual offenders are dangerous and they are accountable for their actions. The findings of the current study are positive and shed light on the potential advancement of the reporting of female child sexual offenders in the print media at an international level.

T1  - Status Threat, Material Interests, and the 2016 Presidential Vote
AN  - 2313920791
AB  - The April 2018 article of Diana Mutz “Status Threat, Not Economic Hardship, Explains the 2016 Presidential Vote,” was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences and contradicts prior sociological research on the 2016 election. Mutz’s article received widespread media coverage because of the strength of its primary conclusion, declaimed in its title. The present article is a critical reanalysis of the models offered by Mutz, using the data files released along with her article. Contrary to her conclusions, this article demonstrates that (1) the relative importance of economic interests and status threat cannot be estimated effectively with her cross-sectional data, and (2) her panel data are consistent with the claim that economic interests are at least as important as status threat. The preexisting sociological literature has offered interpretations that incorporate economic interests and, as a result, provides a more credible explanation of the 2016 election.

T1  - Ecological Factors that Impact Adjustment Processes and Development of Ugandan Adolescent Immigrant Females
AN  - 1984680859
AB  - Existing literature suggests that acculturation and integration processes for immigrant youth from East Africa are complicated by family values, interaction styles, and social roles that are in conflict with those of the US host culture. The purpose of this study was to explore first-generation female Ugandan immigrant youth perceptions, beliefs and attitudes toward self-development and identify factors among their social contexts that impact their development and adjustment. This study utilized dimensional analysis, an approach to the generation of grounded theory. Data collection included over 100 h of community participatory observation and 28 interviews in total. Participants included 20 English speaking Ugandan females aged 16–25 years who immigrated to the US after age of eight. Participants’ adaptations and adjustments led to an altered developmental path, including their beliefs about gender, ethnic and racial identities, and how they balanced and integrated US culture into their existing understandings and cultural awareness. Conditions that impacted the identity development process include timing of their immigration, the contexts of reception, media, the Ugandan Community, the school social setting, the perceived value of Ugandan cultural maintenance vs. the value of adopting certain American traits, and experiences of prejudice and discrimination vs. new future opportunities. The findings represent an in-depth consideration of the cultural, linguistic, religious, racial, and social attributes of the female Ugandan immigrant youth population and can therefore be seen as an important step in the direction of developing an understanding of the developmental assets and risk/protective factors that characterize this young immigrant population.

T1  - Is it possible to understand the Holocaust? Insights from some German school contexts
AN  - 2566054644
AB  - Against the background of the uniqueness position regarding antisemitism, this study seeks to find out whether there are thought patterns, as expressions of cultural memory, in members of school communities in Germany, that obscure the possibility to understand the Holocaust. Using an ethnographic data gathering and a historiographical data analysis method, narratives were constructed from recorded opinions, interviews and conversations with teachers and pupils around this topic. Such interactions were facilitated by the introduction of an educational DVD medium called “Witnesses of the Shoah.” Results show that four such thought patterns could be identified: incomprehension or incomprehensibility; relativization; externalization and generalization; and emotional defensiveness against prejudice. These results are discussed and their implications explored.

T1  - A National Survey on the Professional Role Conceptions of Journalists in Kenya
AN  - 1941399328
AB  - The professional role conceptions of journalists have for many years remained a central strand in journalism studies. The present research investigates the professional role conceptions that Kenyan journalists perceive to be the most important in their work. Similarly, the professional role they consider the most important is further analyzed in relation to demographics (age, gender, education, contract type, media type, and media ownership). Findings from a national survey of 504 Kenyan journalists indicate that "providing citizens with information" is the most important role (61.3 percent), followed by "advocate for social change" (51.7 percent). The other major roles include to "support official policies" (46.9 percent), "motivate people to participate in civic activities" (45.6 percent), and "act as watchdog of government" (35.3 percent). The most important role-providing citizens with information-is backed across all demographics with a strong mean of 4.4 on a five-point scale ranging from 1 ("not important at all") to 5 ("extremely important"). However, the difference of means across all the analyzed demographics are not statistically significant.

T1  - Academic Freedom and the Future of Anthropology in India
AN  - 1928299830
AB  - With the rise of nationalistic and xenophobic movements in different parts of the world today, it is important to question the role and ability of anthropologists to offer critical insights into the workings of the larger society. Several scholars have pointed to the need for anthropologists to “step up” and produce incisive analyses of contemporary sociopolitical trends. For instance, Paul Stoller (2016)called on ethnographers to contribute their “anthropological impute to combat the coming onslaught of Trumpism,” including “racial and religious intolerance” (Henrietta Moore,in a Hufﬁngton Post blog [2016], has written on the need for Trump to look at internal socioeconomic problems in America rather than targeting migrants); and Brexit saw anthropologists demand of each other more vocal treatment of issues of ethnocentrism, racial prejudice, and immigration (Stein 2016). In all these calls, a central theme has been the need to address audiences beyond the conﬁnes of academia, interlinked with the question of language, both in the sense of medium of instruction (an issue particularly relevant in the context of postcolonial, multilingual nations such as India where English is the ofﬁcial medium of instruction and preferred by academic elites) and as a discursive space of engagement between anthropologists and their audiences.This essay questions anthropologists’ need and ability to engage with the public in India in the context of growing religious nationalism that claims to express majoritarian interests. What are the implications of growing religious nationalism for scholarly pursuits in India and the ways in which we as anthropologists from or living in India grapple with the challenges posed to us in the form of rising anti-intellectualism? This is an important question to ask be-cause the extent to which anthropology in India can and/or should address nonacademic audiences depends on the availability of a dialogic space to articulate these views without fear of repercussions. I ask if we ought to pay more attention to the political opinions of the urban, upwardly mobile middle classes of India and their reaction to academic work that is seen as “insulting” to majoritarian ideology. In particular, the language of anthropological work needs to be more mindful of its readership and its audiences’ contestation of academic authority.

T1  - STEREOTYPICAL GENDER REPRESENTATIONS IN CHHOTA BHEEM: KIDS' CARTOON PROGRAMME ON POGO CHANNEL
AN  - 1990432567
AB  - Cartoon watching is usually supposed to be a fun time for children; it also serves as a potential learning tool This paper is based on content analysis of a popular television cartoon series in the Hindi/Urdu languages, Chhota Bheem by Pogo, an Indian channel for young children that is televised by local and foreign T V channels. To analyse the contents of these programmes, seven dialogues are selected through purposive sampling to help understand how gender discrimination is projected through these kids' shows. Qualitative data analyses is made in the light of the model presented by Mills' (1995) and Beauvoir's (1997) notion of social construction of women as the "other" and is applied to assess societal oppression and stereotypic treatment of women as inferior to males. Analysing these cartoons with respect to gender representation by looking at the ratio of male to female characters shown, the physical characteristics of these characters, and the language of selected dialogues, this research shows that the cartoons reflect gender prejudices that exist in the psyche of adults, thereby transmitting negative messages to children during the formative stage of their brain development. The findings show that the portrayal of male and female characters in these series is stereotypical to the extent that they influence children to believe and idealize these roles in their everyday social interaction.

T1  - Exploring representations of Black masculinity and emasculation on NBC's Parenthood
AN  - 2013187969
AB  - Here, representations of Black masculinity and emasculation are explored on NBC's Parenthood. We question whether depictions of Black masculinity represented through Parenthood's character, Alex, are empowering or stereotypical; how do they reflect, destabilize, and/or reinforce heteronormative depictions of Black community members? Two seasons were analyzed using Owen's thematic analysis. Ultimately, Black males are portrayed as being societal failures, criminals, violent, and hypersexualized through his character. This embodiment ultimately preserves long-held images of Black men as "Toms, coons ... bucks ... as oversexed, aggressive, violent, animalistic, or emasculated" (Jackson, R. L. II. 2006. Scripting the black masculine body: Identity, discourse, and racial politics in popular media. Albany, NY: State University of New York Press). Practical recommendations and suggestions for researchers and media practitioners are provided.

T1  - Attitudes of Professional Associations' Members towards Jordanian Political Mobility during the Arab Spring Era
AN  - 2633263372
AB  - This study aimed to identify the attitudes of the members of professional associations (PAMs) attitudes towards the Jordanian political mobility during the Arab Spring era via delineating its efficiency, future, and role in the political reform process. The study also attempted to pinpoint the PAMs' stance from such mobility and their potential future involvement in its activities. Besides, the study shed light on the extent of PAMs' participation in this sort of mobility, along with the common means of expression they used to this end. The study sample consisted of 661 members selected by a multi-phase sample. Using a three point Likert-scale, a structured questionnaire was specially designed by the researchers to fulfill the study objectives. Results showed that 86.7% of the PAMs participated in the political mobility; their participation took many forms, including writing and/or commenting on hard or soft copy newspapers. Findings also revealed that social networks were the most common means used by PAMs, accounting for 77% of the used media. Career and job demands formed the primary motivation behind PAMs' participation in the political mobility. Comprehensive economic reforms, on the other hand, came second as a major motivating factor for their participation in the activities of this mobility. Moreover, findings explicitly indicated that the efficiency of the political mobility in the future, its role in the political reform process, PAMs' stance from this mobility, along with their future potential participation in its activities are inclined to be passive. Additionally, the attitudes of the PAMs towards the continuity of the political mobility in Jordan indicated that it is inclined to backtrack.

T1  - Production Conditions of a kidnapping-testimonial literature boom in Colombia
AN  - 1953901137
AB  - In Colombia, at the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century, there was a rise of kidnapping testimonial literature whose authors were politicians, members of the Armed Forces and foreigners involved in the fight against drug trafficking. Theyconstituted a group commonly known as “the exchangeables” since their captivity responded to a strategy of the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) established during the Caguan peace negotiations (1998-2002) to kidnap publicfigures, soldiers and police in order to press for a humanitarian exchange. The article aims to outline the conditions of production of a boom in kidnapping testimonial literature by these “exchangeables” in the political and media context of Colombia between 2002 and 2010, and the close relationship of the global publishing industry with the publication of testimony, widely disseminated internationally. The main analytical assumptionof this work is that the testimonial texts are cultural constructions framed in a specific social and cultural context of production and respond to the way society is symbolically organized. Along with this, it is necessary to understand how the rise of memory induces cultural products turned towards the past that reveal traumaticevents in the history of the armed conflict in Colombia. The methodology consisted of a review of written primary and secondary sources and interviews with journalists and experts of the publishing world to establish a production context of testimonial booksconsidered cultural objects. One of the main findings was that the rise of kidnapping testimonial literature by the “exchangeables” was a response to the ideological climate of the country under PresidentAlvaro Uribe, a period in which the farc became the enemy of the nation; therefore, the testimony denouncing their crimes echoed massively in privately owned media and in general in Colombian public opinion.

T1  - Do global climate summits influence public awareness and policy preferences concerning climate change?
AN  - 1841788815
AB  - A survey-embedded experiment implemented around the time of the 2014 annual Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (N [approximate] 1200) examined whether such summits are able to increase citizens' awareness of climate problems. This study finds that exposure to positive or negative cues about the COP increases climate change awareness, particularly among participants who start out with a low level of awareness. Neither positive nor negative cues about the COP significantly affect people's policy preferences. Our finding resonates with Bernard Cohen's observation that the mass media may not often be successful in telling people what to think, but they are successful in telling readers what to think about.

T1  - The micro-macro link in deliberative polling: science or politics?
AN  - 1818404812
AB  - In this article, we critically examine the question of how to link the 'micro' of deliberative mini-publics with the 'macro' of the democratic system. To explore this puzzle, we relate to EuroPolis, a transnational deliberative experiment that took place one week ahead of the 2009 European Parliamentary elections. The main argument is that although the scientific design of deliberative polls is a necessary condition for the fulfilment of the criteria for equal participation and informed opinion-making of selected citizens (the micro-dimension), this does not necessarily translate into a democratically representative and legitimate proxy for the broader political constituency (the macro-dimension). This problem is potentially exacerbated in deliberative settings that cut across domestic political cultures and nationalized public spheres.

T1  - Flood Realities, Perceptions and the Depth of Divisions on Climate
AN  - 1870941878
AB  - Research has led to broad agreement among scientists that anthropogenic climate change is happening now and likely to worsen. In contrast to scientific agreement, US public views remain deeply divided, largely along ideological lines. Science communication has been neutralised in some arenas by intense counter-messaging, but as adverse climate impacts become manifest they might intervene more persuasively in local perceptions. We look for evidence of this occurring with regard to realities and perceptions of flooding in the northeastern US state of New Hampshire. Although precipitation and flood damage have increased, with ample news coverage, most residents do not see a trend. Nor do perceptions about past and future local flooding correlate with regional impacts or vulnerability. Instead, such perceptions follow ideological patterns resembling those of global climate change. That information about the physical world can be substantially filtered by ideology is a common finding from sociological environment/society research.

T1  - Heterosexual Dating Double Standards in Undergraduate Women and Men
AN  - 1819312036
AB  - Traditional heterosexual dating and courtship scripts (e.g., men pay for date, women take partner's last name in marriage) reflect different standards of desirable behavior for women and men. Analogous to sexual double standards, dating double standards reflect the greater agency and power traditionally accorded to men in society. In the present study, we investigated factors related to young heterosexual adults' endorsement of dating double standards. Participants were 330 female and male U.S. undergraduates at a California public university (57 % female, ages 18-25 years-old) from diverse ethnic backgrounds. In the Heterosexual Dating Double-Standards Scale, respondents rate the desirability of five dating and courtship behaviors (initiate date, hold door open, pay for date, propose marriage, take spouse's last name) separately for women and men. Preliminary analyses revealed participants generally expressed double standards by rating the desirability of behaviors differently for female and male characters in the traditional direction (e.g., paying for a date rated more desirable for a man than for a woman). We predicted dating double standards would be positively related to factors previously found to predict traditional gender roles (viewing popular media, religious attendance) as well as attitudes that reflect traditional views (conservative political beliefs, benevolent and hostile sexism, disavowing a feminist identity). These hypotheses were generally supported. Among these correlations, dating double standards were strongly associated with benevolent sexism (among women and men) and with hostile sexism (among men). Implications for future research are discussed.

T1  - All the labor problems fit to print: the New York Times and the cultural production of the U.S 'labor problem', 1870-1932
AN  - 1778483710
AB  - The period that spanned the Gilded Age to the onset of the Great Depression saw the rise and relative decline of the US labor movement. The salient events of labor movements over these years undoubtedly shaped public perception about labor issues, and some scholars have been attempting to unpack the mechanisms through which depictions and characterizations of the 'labor problem' were produced in authoritative venues that could have shaped the future of the movement. This study goes beyond the standard practice of explaining news report volume to feature the political valance of the reports on the labor problem over a 63-year time period. The aforementioned period also saw significant changes in news reporting practices, with the rise of objective informational writing and the embrace of journalism as a profession. The change within journalism itself could potentially shape the depiction of the labor problem, yet such change has been overlooked by existing literature pertaining to the topic. This research makes a theoretical case for integrating social processes central to the labor movement and journalism from 1870 to 1932 and explains patterns in the cultural production of the labor problem in the New York Times by analyzing these two tracks of history in conjunction using both qualitative and quantitative data.

T1  - THE "SICK" RACIST
AN  - 1801833381
AB  - Since the early 1960s, there has been a movement among activists, scholars, and policymakers to redefine racism as a psychopathological condition, identifiable and treatable through psychotherapeutic and pharmacological interventions. This development reflects, and is reflected by, the popular framing among mass media and ordinary social actors of racism and racist events as individual pathology rather than as a social problem. This shifting perspective on racism, from a social problem and a system to an individual pathology, has increasingly become a part of academic and psychiatric discourse since Jim Crow. In this article, we have two aims: first, to trace the emergence of "psychopathological racism"; second, to illustrate the relationship between "psychopathological racism" and "colorblind racism" in the post-Civil Rights era. We argue that the psychopathological view of racism compliments colorblindness in that larger structural issues are dismissed in favor of individual pathos. Furthermore, psychopathological explanations for racism dismiss socio-political contexts, eschewing the contributions of well over fifty years of social scientific research in the process.

T1  - Islam as a Platform for Politics: The Post-9/11 U.S. Conservative Popular Security Discourse
AN  - 1789137382
AB  - Why, in the aftermath of 9/11, did a segment of the U.S. popular security experts, political elite, media, and other institutions classify not just al-Qaeda but Islam itself as a security threat, thereby countering the prevailing professional consensus and White House policy that maintained a distinction between terrorism and Islam? Why did this "politically incorrect" or counternarrative expand and degenerate into a scare over the country's "Islamization" by its tiny Muslim population? Why is this security myth so convincing that legislators in two dozen states introduced bills to prevent the Shariah's spread and a Republican presidential front-runner exclaimed: "I believe Shariah is a mortal threat to the survival of freedom in the United States and in the world as we know it"? This analysis offers a framework that conceptualizes popular discourses as highly interested fields of political struggle, deepens the prevailing characterization of this part of the U.S. popular discourse as "Islamophobia," and analyzes how it has functioned politically at the domestic level. Specifically, it examines how a part of the conservative elite and institutions, political entrepreneurs already involved in the ongoing culture wars, seized upon Islam in the emotion-laden wake of 9/11 as another opportune site to advance their struggle against their domestic political opponents, "the Left," and the more progressive societal institutions and culture in general.

T1  - Xenophobia across the class divide: South African attitudes towards foreigners 2003-2012
AN  - 1784417787
AB  - In May 2008 anti-immigrant riots in South Africa displaced more than a hundred thousand people. Despite the media attention that the riots attracted, there has been no study that presents trend data on anti-immigrant sentiment for the period after 2008. This paper uses data from the nine rounds of the South African Social Attitudes Survey over the period 2003-2012 to fill this gap and test the success of government commitments to reduce anti-immigrant prejudice. The results reveal that attempts to combat xenophobia have been ineffectual, with anti-immigrant sentiment prevalent and widespread in 2012. Afrophobia was observed, with a majority of citizens identifying foreign African nationals as the group they least wanted to come and live in South Africa. The government is advised to urgently address the alarming and widespread pervasiveness of anti-immigrant sentiment in South Africa.

T1  - Social Media and the Spiral of Silence: The Case of Kuwaiti Female Students' Political Discourse on Twitter
AN  - 1702279479
AB  - The theory of the Spiral of Silence (Noelle-Neumann, 1984), explained why the view of a minority is not presented when the majority view dominates the public sphere. For years the theory of the spiral of silence was used to describe the isolation of minority opinions when seeking help from traditional media, which play a significant role in increasing the isolation. The fear of isolation makes many people afraid of exchanging their views face-to-face with others. The main fear comes from identifying the people who hold a minority opinion. However, with the proliferation of social networks people have moved online to exchange their views, whether they hold a minority or a majority opinion, as long as their identities are concealed. Although women are the majority population in many Arab societies, their voices are still considered a minority view. In addition to the effects described in the spiral of silence, there are other obstacles to self-expression. Religion, culture, tradition, and education may have a negative effect, preventing women's voice being made public. Social networks have helped to promote women's voices while removing offline obstacles. This paper uses the theory of the spiral of silence in relation to women's online political participation in Twitter, even though they may not be willing to share their opinions offline (face-to-face), to learn whether the theory is still useful as an account of online relationships. The results show that the spiral of silence does not explain the behavior of women, either face-to-face or online.

T1  - Perceptions of and Objections to Christianity Among Unchurched and Dechurched Adults
AN  - 1768532498
AB  - Mars Hill Church—a large multisite church centered in Seattle—commissioned research examining the perceptions of and objections to Christianity among unchurched and dechurched adults in the United States. ‘‘Unchurched’’ persons were defined as those who attend worship services every few months or less and who did not regularly attend worship services growing up. The ‘‘dechurched’’ were defined as persons who attend worship services every few months or less but who regularly attended services as a child. Data were gathered using both a quantitative and a qualitative component. For the quantitative portion, GfK Public Affairs and Corporate Communications conducted a nationwide telephone survey using random digit dialing (RDD). To qualify for the study, respondents had to be between 18 and 44 years of age and be either unchurched (n = 259) or dechurched (n = 741) as defined above. The surveys were conducted on landlines and cell phones between late April and early June 2013 and took roughly 12 min each. Saurage Marketing Research conducted the qualitative portion of the research, which consisted of eight focus groups with unchurched and dechurched U.S. adults between the ages of 18 and 44 years. The groups were held in Austin, Boston, Phoenix, and San Francisco. In each city, two focus groups were conducted: one with women and another with men. The groups involved 68 respondents in total, who were selected to maintain diversity in terms of educational level and church experience for each group.The findings reveal that a majority of survey respondents describe themselves as spiritual, whether ‘‘very’’ (21 %) or ‘‘somewhat’’ (35 %). Being at least somewhat spiritual is much more common among the dechurched (61 %) than among the unchurched (42 %). The respondents tended to understand Christianity as mostly about acceptance, tolerance, and the Golden Rule, and they criticized Christians for not living in accordance with those values. While some tried to avoid over-generalizing, most respondents viewed Christians as off-putting. Many think that Christianity and Christian leaders play on fear of death and the unknown, and that Christianity is primarily an existential ‘‘crutch’’ that they do not need. For most respondents, their perceptions of church are derived from their exposure to the Catholic Church, Evangelical mega-churches, and television preachers.The primary objection to Christianity across all focus groups and demographics was that some Christians are too intolerant (55 % of survey respondents indicated this as an objection). Beliefs about sexuality and reproduction—especially gay marriage and abortion—were the second leading objection (50 %), followed in third place by the role of Christianity in U.S. politics (49 %).

T1  - Truth Scribbled in Blood: Women's Work, Menstruation and Poetry
AN  - 1654889059
AB  - Inspired by Hélène Cixous's 'The laugh of the Medusa', this paper revisits a public uproar over menstruation in the workplace triggered by a statement from the CEO of New Zealand's largest body of private sector employers, that periods make women take more sick leave than men. The utterance triggered an astonishing outpouring of public discussion and writing about working while menstruating, as well as about productivity and equal pay. We discuss how a comment about women's periods ruptured the status quo of menstrual repression by using selected online posts rendered as poems. Then, drawing on Cixous and the idea of poetic rapture, we discuss women's online writing in tandem with feminist writing on menstruation. In our theoretical reflections we consider how poetry, menstruation and social media can 'make trouble' for regimes of power. We argue that menstruation should be a required topic for organizational studies.

T1  - Producing and reconstructing knowledge on China in Singapore: perspectives from the academics and mass media
AN  - 1680153208; 201514103
AB  - In Singapore, intellectuals, especially those in media and education, are considered as the driving force of formatting public opinion over the social imagination of China and Chineseness. This article, largely based on oral histories of some Singaporean scholars and media professionals and memoirs of related figures, analyzes the choice and acquisition of their knowledge on China. Through the analysis and comparison of their construction of knowledge on China, this article also discusses the accuracy of their understanding of China and how such understandings were formed along with their personal experiences from domestic socialization, education, and professional accumulation. The authors consequently map out the process of how public intellectuals from mass media and academia transform their knowledge imagination of China into the professional opinions that help to reconstruct and shift Singaporean's impression and understandings of China.

T1  - Loving but not living the vernacular: A glimpse of Mazandarani-Farsi linguistic culture in northern Iran
AN  - 1738476867; 201538769
AB  - Traditional top-down conceptions of language policy and planning have been questioned by recent perspectives that advocate more localized accounts of language policy concerns in real-life social contexts. Schiffman's (1996) conception of linguistic culture is one of these bottom-up approaches, which focuses on covert language policies. This study investigates some aspects of such covert orientations of speakers of the Mazandarani language towards their local vernacular in the bilingual Mazandarani-Farsi context of northern Iran. It specifically attempts to explore the current linguistic culture atmosphere in terms of assumptions, prejudices, attitudes, and stereotypes with regard to Mazandarani. These aspects of public belief are particularly investigated as referring to language use in 'social situations', 'professional contexts', 'education', and 'media'. A group of 106 participants responded to a questionnaire that was aimed at eliciting their views on these linguistic culture domains as well as their 'attitude' towards Mazandarani. The study indicates that although the participants show very positive emotional attitudes towards their local language, their actual linguistic culture appears to be strongly in favor of the official national language, i.e. Farsi. Some concerns are raised as to the implications of such a loving-but-not-living linguistic culture for a more realistic understanding of language policy and planning. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Troubling news: challenging politics, perceptions and practices of newspapers contructions of teachers
AN  - 1719242618
AB  - Newspapers are instruments of the public domain; performative texts that enable public engagement in teachers' work. However, they are not neutral. They construct public opinion through specific portrayals of teachers that in turn work to construct particular knowledge. Through a discursive analysis of texts from The Australian newspaper and interviews with teachers and journalists, I provided insights into the politics and practices of what Foucault describes as 'regimes of truth' that circulate in the media about teachers' work. My study identified four media constructs of teachers: the regulated accountable teacher, the transparent audited teacher, the failing incompetent teacher and the privileged reckless teacher. These constructs identified in my findings were generally critical, negative, oppressive and reductionist regarding teachers and their work. I problematise such discourses as dangerous and potentially destructive as they erode public trust for teachers and the teaching profession. My analysis of the media constructions of teachers contributes to the sociology of education by enabling understandings of media practices and advocates for researchers and educators to actively participate in the media process and trouble the news, rather than being bystanders who are frustrated and annoyed with the troubling news they read in the press.

AB  - While it has become easier to find statistics of incest and child sexual abuse and other such 'data' from countries of the Global South such as Turkey and India, academic analyses of the issue from the perspective of organisations fighting against it and supporting survivors remain scarce. The purpose of this article is to lay out the existing discourses on gender, family, childhood, innocence and virtue alongside the social and media explosion on the issue, in order to locate the contradictions in social commentary within and against which three feminist organisations function: Mor Cati Kadin Siginagi Vakfi [Purple Roof Women's Shelter Foundation] (Mor Cati) and KA-MER (Kadin Merkezi) Vakfi [Women's Center Foundation] (KAMER) in Turkey and Recovering And Healing from Incest (RAHI) in India. Based on interviews with psychologists, lawyers and activists, this article looks at how these organisations challenge the prejudices that allow such abuses to thrive, creating new methods of resistance against incest in the process. In spite of Mor Cat and KAMER being more involved in developing a feminist critique of the public discourse on incest and challenging existing laws on the issue and RAHI focusing more on mental healing of survivors, all three organisations provide support for survivors and criticise patriarchal structures in similar ways in their attempts to break the silence surrounding incest.

T1  - How Authoritarian Social Contexts Inform Individuals' Opinion Perception and Expression
AN  - 1728662488; 201534814
AB  - In addition to perceptions of public opinion, individuals' readiness to voice personal opinions publicly is often subject to social context. For example, in authoritarian countries, people's willingness to voice opinions may be a function of their perceptions of the government's stance, and individuals are likely to refrain from expressing opinions that appear to contradict the authority. However, this tendency does not indicate that individuals' perceptions of public opinion are not relevant in such a context. On the contrary, individuals' perceptions of public support have such an impact that even authoritarian states have to concern themselves with managing perceived public opinion. For example, state-owned media in authoritarian regimes tend to highlight the consensus among people and the popularity of policies and political leadership (Chang, 1999). This tendency reflects the attempts of authoritarian governments to influence not only the opinions of individuals but also their perceptions of public opinion regarding government policies and leadership. Thus, how perceptions of the authority and perceived public opinion may be concurrently associated with people's opinion expression in such a context becomes an intriguing question. Singapore, which ranks 149th in the world press freedom index (Reporters without Borders, 2013), provides an ideal location for such an examination. Although it permits private ownership of the press, the Singapore government requires the press to renew their permits and licenses annually. The government also controls operations within the press by requiring newspapers to issue management shares (which command voting powers that are 200 times greater than that of ordinary shares) only to parties that are approved by the government (Tan & Soh, 1994). Such a context enables us to observe how a regulated press system interacts with the public's exposure to news, perception of public opinion, and expression of personal opinion. We choose the ongoing debate regarding lifting the ban on the sale of human organs in Singapore as the context of this study. Organ trading is a controversial topic that has been intensely debated in many countries, including Singapore, where the waiting list for a kidney transplant is up to nine years because of the scarcity of donors (Ritter, 2008). Supporters of organ trading argue that it is not wrong to offer monetary incentives to potential living donors, provided that a competent doctor has first determined that there are no health risks. However, opponents are concerned that only wealthy patients will be able to afford organs and that the poor will be the primary sellers, which will further jeopardize their health (January 18, 2007, The Straits Times, page H6). In contrast to the polarized perspectives presented by the two contending factions, the position assumed by the Singapore government appears rather ambiguous. Singapore has retained its strict penalties against organ trading and has declared that offering financial incentives for organ donation is morally and legally wrong (Channel News Asia, 2009). Nevertheless, the government permits financial reimbursement to living donors and has urged citizens to carefully review the idea of legalizing organ sales rather than utterly rejecting the notion (Tan & Tan, 2008). In view of the ambivalent messages sent by the government, Singaporeans' interpretations of the government's position may lean in either direction, which allows us to examine how perceptions of the news reports are associated with various interpretations of governmental opinion and affect individuals' opinion perception and expression.

T1  - Media Portrayals of Female Perpetrators of Intimate Partner Violence
AN  - 1692289324; 201524288
AB  - Preventing intimate partner violence (IPV) is a public health priority. An important component of designing prevention programs is developing an understanding of how media portrayals of health issues influence public opinion and policy. To better understand the ways in which media images may be informing our understanding of IPV, this study content analyzed portrayals of IPV in news media articles. Stratified media outlets were used to obtain a representative sample of daily newspapers based on their designated market areas. Researchers created constructed months using weeks from each season across a 2-year period. The first part of the study investigated quantitative differences in the coverage of female and male perpetrators (n = 395) and identified several areas where coverage differed. The second part of the study qualitatively examined coverage of female perpetrators (n = 61) to provide a richer description of such coverage. This study contributes to our understanding of female perpetrators and how these portrayals may contribute to the larger gender symmetry debate surrounding female aggressors. Implications for public health policy and research are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - Foreigners or multicultural citizens? Press media's construction of immigrants in South Korea
AN  - 1660024484; 201505747
AB  - This paper examines the ways in which new immigrants to South Korea are portrayed and constructed in press media. The influx of labour and marriage migrants from Southeast Asia and China to South Korea since the early 1990s has been significant enough to cause national concerns about diversity and the country's future as a multiethnic society. Mainstream newspapers in South Korea have been a major shaper of the public opinion of diverse groups of immigrants whose presence is becoming increasingly visible in this country with a strong self-image as a mono-ethnic nation. The ways in which these new immigrants, typically lower class, are constructed in public discourses expose the nexus of citizenship, class and ethnicity. Using articles from two major South Korean newspapers between 1990 and 2008 as data, the analysis highlights the economic and historical contexts in which public discourses on new immigrants have been formed and transformed.

AN  - 1684423612; 201520377
AB  - Crimes against American Indians and Alaskan Natives receive little, if any, mainstream media coverage and there is even less attention to hate crimes committed against each population. In light of this neglect, the following research seeks to answer two questions: what types of hate crimes are committed against American Indians and Alaskan Natives and do tribal law enforcement agencies define hate crimes against American Indians and Alaskan Natives as a serious problem? After surveying over 200 tribal law enforcement agencies within the United States, results suggest active discrimination and prejudice toward American Indians and Alaskan Natives, and mixed responses by tribal law enforcement personnel regarding the perceived seriousness of hate crimes.

T1  - The Let Down Effect: Satisfaction, Motivation, and Credibility Assessments of Political Infotainment: PROD
AN  - 1524932559
AB  - Using experimental design, this study compares first-time voters' gratifications and uses of a traditional News format with the increasingly popular fake news format. The data here found that while indeed young people may have initially assessed a greater level of gratification associated with the fake news genre, the group was significantly "let down" after exposure to such a program. Though first-time voters understand that traditional surveillance-type information-seeking activities are better associated with traditional News, they were ambivalent about approaching and avoiding both traditional News and fake news genres.

T1  - Americans' Perceptions of Commitment to Strong Families Across Race and Ethnic Groups
AN  - 1551001332; 201430614
AB  - Theories of prejudice examining perceptual differences of in-groups and out-groups, such as social dominance and group threat perspectives, have found them to be important in generating hegemonic identity formations. This study uses data from the General Social Surveys to explore how these hegemonic group perceptions influence attitudes toward stronger families using race and ethnic groups as proxy measures where Whites are considered the in-group. A modified ecosystemic-interactionist approach along with elements from group threat and social dominance theories as support was used to investigate the underlying premise that group membership influenced respondents' perceptions of their own family vis a vis others. Overall, the study found support for the underlying premise that membership influenced group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment to strong families. Additionally, these findings suggest that groups develop most of their beliefs and subsequently their attitudes from limited interaction with those they perceived to be in the out-groups. Other social factors, including media portrayals, geographic propinquity, and education, also play a role in group perceptions, group knowledge, and group beliefs about commitment toward strong families. They support the social dominance and group threat theories that give rise to hegemonic structure within the United States. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Tuning in to the RTLM: Tracking the Evolution of Language Alongside the Rwandan Genocide Using Social Identity Theory
AN  - 1512220743; 201409983
AB  - Transcripts from radio broadcasts that aired in pre-, early-, and late-genocide Rwanda were content analyzed from a social identity theory perspective to examine whether language use was consistent with theoretical predictions. The data yielded by these analyses (N = 59) are noteworthy because the broadcasters on this station were eventually charged with war crimes for inciting and endorsing the violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. The results from this study found that the transcripts contained language in support of theory such that the Tutsi out-group was increasingly dehumanized as the conflict escalated, the Tutsi were blamed for their fate-while the Hutu were presented as victims of the violence, and an overt prejudice that was initially directed at Tutsi rebel group grew to include all Tutsi people near the end of this conflict. These data provide compelling support for the communication processes that arise within intergroup conflict situations and support the continued application of social identity theory to real-world situations.

T1  - Social Cohesion Activities and Attitude Change in Cyprus
AN  - 1767329490; 201610765
AB  - Do social cohesion activities change the attitudes of the participants? This paper uses intergroup contact theory to explore attitude change resulting from contact with out-group(s) in social cohesion activities. Results from a pre-test/post-test design with fifty-five participants in two bicommunal camps in Cyprus show how attitudes change at the immediate end of these activities; an analysis of fourteen participants' comments after one, thirteen, and twenty-five months provides a medium- to long-term assessment of attitude change. Not all participants were completely positive towards the other community before they took part, as assumed by some. There is clearly space for impact in terms of attitude change. Social cohesion activities represent indispensable tools for reducing prejudice and improving relationships between former enemies in post-conflict countries. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - GLOBALIZATION: CULTURAL TRANSMISSION OF RACISM
AN  - 1767328537; 201605960
AB  - Globalization is examined by theorists such as, Iammanuel Wallerstein, Anthony Giddens, Martin Wolf, Thomas Friedman, Manuel Castells, David Held, Anthony McGrew, and Paul Hirst. However, globalization remains a significant subject area to analyze, theorize, and to empiric. In general, globalization is a contested topic within the field of social sciences through its various meanings. The topic of cultural transmission is a component of globalization; however, this topic has not been examined within all forms of transmission. For example, a critique of cultural transmission is examined through the transmission of racial bias, stereotypes, and prejudice. As a result, there are three central components of this literature review: description of globalization, description of racial bias, and the interconnectedness of cultural transmission through globalization in the form of racial bias. In addition, racial bias transmission is examined through the use of the mass media. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Music as a weapon of ethnopolitical violence and conflict: processes of ethnic separation during and after the break-up of Yugoslavia
AN  - 1494751508; 201401977
AB  - Using illustrations from the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s and their aftermath, Baker argues that understanding popular music and public discourses about it can help to understand the dynamics of ethnopolitical conflict. Studies of war and conflict have approached music as political communication, as an object of securitization, as a means of violence and as a symbol of ethnic difference, while international law in the context of another case of collective violence, Rwanda, has even begun to question whether performing or broadcasting certain music could constitute incitement to genocide. Drawing on poststructuralist perspectives on the media and ethnicization in conflicts, Baker explores and interrogates the discourse of popular music as a weapon of war that was in use during and after the violent break-up of Yugoslavia. Music during the Yugoslav wars was used as a tool of humiliation and violence in prison camps, and to provoke fear of the ethnic Other in line with a strategy of ethnic cleansing; it was also conceptualized as a morale-booster for the troops of one's own side. A discourse of music as a weapon of war was also in use and persisted after the war, when its referent was shifted to associate music-as-a-weapon not to the brave and defiant ingroup so much as the aggressive Other. This was then turned against a wider range of signifiers than those who had directly supported the Other's troops and had the effect of perpetuating ethnic separation and obstructing the reformation of a (post-)Yugoslav cultural space. Despite evidence that music did serve as an instrument of violence in the Yugoslav wars (and the precedent of the Bikindi indictment in Rwanda), Baker concludes that music should be integrated into understandings of ethnopolitical conflict not through a framework of incitement and complicity but with respect for the significance of music in the everyday.

T1  - Just Think About It: Mindfulness, Sexism, and Prejudice Toward Feminists
AN  - 1448991634; 201345322
AB  - This study examined the relation between mindfulness, sexist motivations and beliefs, and prejudice toward women who violate traditional gender roles-namely feminists. In a preliminary study, 672 (251 men, 421 women) undergraduates from a United States Midwestern university completed a measure of mindfulness and warmth toward feminists and consistent with hypotheses, more mindfulness was associated with more warmth toward feminists. Extending this initial finding to the main study, 653 (273 men, 380 women) undergraduates from a U.S. Midwestern university completed measures of mindfulness, motivation to respond without sexism, ambivalent sexism, and warmth toward feminists. Consistent with hypotheses, compared to women participants, men participants were lower on internal motivation to respond without sexism, higher on hostile and benevolent sexism and less warm toward feminists. Also consistent with hypotheses, for men participants, more mindfulness was associated with higher internal motivation to respond without sexism, less benevolent sexism, and more warmth toward feminists. In contrast, for women participants, more mindfulness was only associated with less hostile sexism. Finally, a path analysis revealed that the positive relation between mindfulness and warmth toward feminists for men participants was partially mediated by more internal motivation to respond without sexism (i.e., a significant indirect effect), but not by less sexist beliefs. Implications for mindfulness, sexism, and prejudice more generally are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Racism in the global era: Analysis of Korean media discourse around migrants, 1990-2009
AN  - 1364699429; 201325429
AB  - Racism has taken on subtle forms that are hard to notice unless given careful attention. In the era of globalization, interpreting racism becomes more complicated in that globalization intensifies both racist and anti-racist reactions. This article examines how racism in the global age has evolved into a subtler form. Using both frame analysis and critical discourse analysis, I examine the Korean media's discourse around migrants in the past two decades (1990-2009). Findings show that the dominant attitude taken by the Korean media toward migrants has been positive, which is counter-intuitive considering Korea's notorious ethnocentrism. However, a critical discursive approach reveals that these positive discourses have a variety of effects: they ironically 'victimize' and 'objectify' migrants, overlook the question of how to empower migrants, and reveal misunderstandings over what it means to embrace diversity. I conclude that in Korea, where the tension between globalization and nationalism is intense, racial prejudice becomes more disguised under the cliche of political correctness, such as the rhetoric of multiculturalism and diversity.

T1  - JUNO (JASON REITMAN, 2007): A PRACTICAL CASE STUDY OF TEENS, FILM AND CULTURAL STUDIES
AN  - 1429627695; 201336040
AB  - Jason Reitman's Juno (2007), the story of how a teenager handles her pregnancy, is the kind of film that leaves no one indifferent. Released at a time of conflicting discourses on sexual education, Reitman's film addressed the confusion experienced by teenagers as they came of age in a context where patterns of masculine and feminine behaviour were rapidly changing. In this essay I argue that Juno offers a complex understanding of the disorientation suffered by adolescents during the 1990s -- a time when anti-sex discourses coexisted with an increasingly sexualized youth culture. This said, my intention is to move towards the film in a roundabout way by focusing, first, on why so many, supposed 'cultural criticisms' of films turn out to be so superficial. In this introductory section, the argument will be made for an approach in film analyses that takes full account of cinema as a visual medium. After exposing my critical stance, I shall draw nearer to the film itself by examining various of the overlapping contexts that, together, created a conducive space for its success -- namely, the political scene; changing attitudes towards sex and gender; and most importantly, cinema's aesthetic dimension and the impact of genre conventions in the film-viewing experience. Once the complex diagram of differing (and sometimes contradictory) forces at work in Juno has been mapped out, my aim is to link these conjunctures to a detailed analysis of a key scene in the film as a means of demonstrating how the combination of film studies and Cultural Studies can operate as a method that eschews too easy, ideologically oriented, assumptions.

T1  - On the F word: A corpus-based analysis of the media representation of feminism in British and German press discourse, 1990-2009
AN  - 1221409167; 201245362
AB  - Research in social psychology has shown that public attitudes towards feminism are mostly based on stereotypical views linking feminism with leftist politics and lesbian orientation. It is claimed that such attitudes are due to the negative and sexualised media construction of feminism. Studies concerned with the media representation of feminism seem to confirm this tendency. While most of this research provides significant insights into the representation of feminism, the findings are often based on a small sample of texts. Also, most of the research was conducted in an Anglo-American setting. This study attempts to address some of the shortcomings of previous work by examining the discourse of feminism in a large corpus of German and British newspaper data. It does so by employing the tools of Corpus Linguistics. By investigating the collocation profiles of the search term feminism, we provide evidence of salient discourse patterns surrounding feminism in two different cultural contexts.

T1  - Photographing Handsworth: photography, meaning and identity in a British inner city
AN  - 1283644041; 201303284
AB  - 'If you say "Handsworth",' the novelist Salman Rushdie remarked in 1986, 'what do you see? Most people would see fire, riots, looted shops ... and helmeted cops ... a front page story.' In the 1980s, 'front page' images of violence and disorder had come to define areas of black settlement such as Handsworth. However, for both Stuart Hall and Paul Gilroy, photography has the potential of unearthing alternative histories of black people in Britain. Connell explores how this might work in practice by taking Handsworth, an inner-city area of Birmingham, as its case study. Following the Handsworth riots in 1985, a photograph of the 'black bomber' appeared on the front page of every national tabloid newspaper, and Handsworth became conceptualized by the media as 'Frontline Britain'. At the same time, there are numerous examples of photographs from within Handsworth that attempt to present a different view of the community: images taken at high-street portraiture studios, community photography projects and the documentary work of the professional photographers Vanley Burke and Pogus Caesar. What such images offer the historian, it will be shown, is not clear cut. Photographs from within Handsworth are suggestive of possible themes in any alternative history of race in Britain, particularly in their emphasis on everyday life. However, Connell shows that it is also necessary to understand what is often the unacknowledged politics behind these images, something that makes them-in differing ways-as problematic as the stereotypical narratives presented on the front pages of tabloid newspapers.

T1  - Masbirim Israel: Israel's PR Campaign as Glocalized and Grobalized Political Prosumption
AN  - 1221412983; 201244631
AB  - In 2010, Israel's Ministry of Information and Diaspora Affairs launched a new campaign: Masbirim Israel. Its purpose was to "recruit" Israeli citizens to the task of improving the nation's public image in the world. It was the first time a well-organized campaign was launched, systematically employing new-media tools and calling on Israeli citizens to independently take part in improving their country's international image-all at the behest of a government ministry. The executive authority in effect delivered some of its responsibilities and obligations to private hands. This article discusses prosumption in the political sphere and expands the idea of prosumption to a domain in which the state itself is the producer and its citizens are the consumers. Prosumption is perceived as acts conducted by citizens who operate to fulfill aims (i.e., produce products) that traditionally have been in the purview of the state. The article presents two arguments: First, the campaign is an expression of the idea of prosumption in the political sphere. By integrating Israel's citizens in the process of public relations (PR), they become prosumers in the sense that they participate in the production of a public good that traditionally has been supplied by the state. Second, the Masbirim Israel campaign is an expression of a glocalized and grobalized condition in Israeli reality, as it reflects trends of neoliberal values and practices of privatization and expresses the political opinions of (extreme) nationalism and particularism to nonformally "recruit" its citizens to the national PR effort.

AN  - 1037887007; 201231968
AB  - Few studies examine whether the public agenda responds to different types of issue coverage in the same way. After outlining why such differences are likely, this study takes advantage of daily polling data and a rare sequence of news cycles surrounding the issue of gun control to compare how coverage of different political actors and events drives an issue's placement on the public agenda. Coverage generated by the citizen activist group, the Million Mom March, is estimated to have a greater influence on public opinion compared to coverage of a string of school shootings or, finally, President Clinton's campaign. Tests show that group or political biases do not drive these results but, along with evidence from the 2009 health care protests, coverage of citizen demonstrations consistently outperforms presidential news in its association with the mass public agenda. Although elected officials are granted greater access to news media coverage, the findings suggest that such access does not grant a corresponding influence on the public agenda. More generally, it demonstrates that news storyline content has measurable implications for news media agenda setting at the national level. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Crime Control in the 2008 Presidential Election: Symbolic Politics or Tangible Policies?
AN  - 1322722932; 201313474
AB  - Presidential candidates regularly use crime issues to help win electoral support. Contrary to conventional wisdom, crime control became an issue in the 2008 presidential campaign. Despite decreasing crime rates and public opinion focused only temporarily on illegal immigration, the three major presidential candidates (Obama, Clinton, & McCain) discussed many anticrime initiatives during the campaign. Unlike past research which has found presidential candidates use primarily symbolic rhetoric in their anticrime rhetoric, all three presidential candidates in the 2008 presidential election were found to have employed tangible statements. The article discusses the different findings, making recommendations for future research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - A Nationwide Study of Norwegian Beliefs About Same-sex Marriage and Lesbian and Gay Parenthood
AN  - 1221408406; 201245919
AB  - In Norway, a gender-neutral Marriage Law that secured equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples took effect in January 2009. The aim of the current study was to explore Norwegian beliefs about equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples and the welfare of children with lesbian and gay parents. A sample of 1,246 Norwegians participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire. The majority reported that they were supportive of equal marriage rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples, whilst there was less support for granting gay and lesbian couples equal right to become parents. The negative attitudes towards equal parenting rights for lesbian, gay and heterosexual couples were explained mainly by concerns about the welfare of children growing up with gay and lesbian parents.

T1  - Personal and Vicarious Experience with the Criminal Justice System as a Predictor of Punitive Sentencing Attitudes
AN  - 1322718691; 201313392
AB  - This study examined the impact of prior personal or vicarious experience with the criminal justice system on sentencing attitudes. Existing research on sentencing attitudes has examined factors such as race, gender, income level, political affiliation, and education level, but few research studies have focused on actual contact with the criminal justice system and its influence on perceptions of sentencing as either too harsh or too lenient. The current study utilized data collected by the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research. Over 1,500 respondents were surveyed nationwide in 2006 regarding sentencing attitudes. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to assess the impact of factors of interest on sentencing attitudes. Results indicated that individuals who had been charged with a crime (personal experience), or who had an immediate relative or close friend who had been charged (vicarious experience), were more likely to perceive the criminal justice system as too harsh, regardless of race/ethnicity.

T1  - Olympic Proportions: The Expanding Scalar Politics of the London 'Olympics Mega-Mosque' Controversy
AN  - 964199273; 201208385
AB  - When cities host mega-events, such as the Olympic Games, these events change the context in which conventionally local political decisions are considered and made. This article follows Islamic movement Tablighi Jamaat's proposed plans to build the large Abbey Mills Mosque in Newham, East London, and the controversy that followed. The analysis builds from media accounts, interviews with a leading mosque opponent, and ethnographic observation from religious gatherings at the Abbey Mills site. Taking a scalar politics approach, we investigate how the 'mega' scale of the mosque was framed and debated in media and opposition campaign accounts, and how Tablighi Jamaat belatedly responded with counterframes of its own. The 'Olympics mega-mosque' controversy would grow to encompass an increasingly broad public sphere and larger anxieties about national identity, government competence, and the integration of Muslims in Britain. We conclude with implications of the case for studying contentious politics, Islamophobia, and contemporary governance.

T1  - Media and migration. Layers of knowledge in Romanian written press
AN  - 1040709145
AB  - This paper seeks to discuss the image that the media build around the phenomenon of migration in present-day Romanian society. I rely on a content analysis of newspaper articles on migration in order to explore layers of knowledge (understood as evidence which forms the basis of the representation about an issue) by identifying specific elements in each and every piece of news, such as: the current state of migration, the demographic profile of the migrant, geographical location, the orientation of the newspaper, the situation of migrants, the causes and effects of this phenomenon, and the policies implemented in the communities of origin and destination, respectively. All these elements are examined along the lines of emigration and immigration in order to reconstruct strategies of framing external migration within the journalistic discourse, and to identify the information which constitutes a reference point in shaping the attribute agenda on this topic. The discussion relies on the analysis of 473 articles in Romanian newspapers, published between 2007 and 2009, using as a sampling frame the archive of articles available on the website www.ziare.com.

T1  - "What I wanted to do was..." Discrepancies Between College Women's Desired and Reported Responses to Gender Prejudice
AN  - 1081860650; 201237948
AB  - When experiencing gender prejudice, college women engage in a dynamic decision making process about whether and how to respond. We examined the discrepancy between how college women wanted to respond and how they actually responded to gender prejudice events and explored their reasons for not using a desired response. In this study, 81 college women from the Western United States responded to a qualitative online daily diary about gender prejudice. In 34% (N=265) of the events, the women reported there was a discrepancy between what they wanted to do and how they actually reacted, with the most common discrepancy being a desire to utilize a confrontational response (91%, N=242). Over the two week period, women reported significantly more events during which they considered the use of a confrontational response (N=242) than they actually used one (N=199). Women's reported reasons for not using their desired response included: not being cost effective (25%), concern about social norms (37%), setting limitations (19%), personality characteristics (9%) and not being bothered enough by the event (10%). We also found that when women considered using a confrontational response but decided not to, they reported using all other response types instead. In these cases, women who did nothing during the event reported lower levels of distress during the event than women who used a psychological response or a different confrontational response. Implications and future research directions are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Community Perceptions And Treatment-Seeking Behaviour Regarding Reproductive Tract Infections Including Sexually Transmitted Infections In Lao PDR: A Qualitative Study
AN  - 896180851; 201121072
AB  - Creating community awareness of reproductive tract infections (RTF), including sexually transmitted infections (STI), and how to prevent them is essential to minimize their spread. Data on people's views about RTI/STI are entirely lacking in Laos. The aim of this study was thus to explore people's perceptions, treatment-seeking behaviour and understanding of information about RTI/STI, in urban and rural communities in two provinces in Laos. Fourteen focus group discussions and 20 in-depth interviews were held with 76 women and 56 men, selected purposively to provide diversity of socio-demographic backgrounds. Qualitative content analysis was employed for the data analysis. The major finding was that both male and female participants had a variety of misconceptions about the causes and symptoms of RTI/STI and their cure, and a reluctance to seek health care, which could cause delay in appropriate diagnosis and treatment. The most common treatment-seeking behaviour was self-medication through private pharmacies, following advice mostly given by friends and drug sellers. The main reasons for not going to health facilities were fear of social discrimination or shyness of genital examination. Complaints were also made about clinicians' negative attitudes towards 'dirty disease'. Although condom use was mentioned as a way to prevent RTI/STI, an unwillingness to use condoms was commonly expressed. The main media sources of RTI/STI information were radio and television, and access to health information was more difficult in rural areas. The health messages provided were mostly understood, except for some technical terms. The findings indicate that strengthening health education and promotion through interventions at the community level is recommended to improve quality of RTI/STI management. Health education messages should be more accessible in rural areas. There is also an urgent need to improve communication between RTI/STI patients and clinicians. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Red socks and purple rain: the political uses of colour in late apartheid South Africa
AN  - 887499210; 201118580
AB  - This article explores the extent to which colour functions as an independent mode in a particular context and explores the culturally produced regularities in the uses of colour in this context. Drawing on a Hallidayan metafunctional view of text, we look at how colour instantiated systems of knowledge and belief (ideational function) and social relations and identities (interpersonal function) in South Africa during the last decade of the apartheid government. In this type of repressive socio-political context, colour was a less policed mode, and thus had different affordances to images and the verbal modes. We argue that colour can function as an independent mode under certain conditions, such as stringent press restrictions, where the use of colour in a range of media (clothing, flags, posters) can play a crucial role in communicating.

T1  - Planning Context and Urban Intensification Outcomes: Sydney versus Toronto
AN  - 1916147133
AB  - There is a lack of knowledge about effective implementation of intensification policies. The paper concentrates on the intensification experience of Sydney, Australia, and Toronto, Canada. Historical narratives, which document intensification efforts and outcomes since the 1950s, paint different pictures. For much of the period, Sydney adopted a medium-density strategy sustained by public-sector incentives and regulations. In Toronto, in contrast, the focus has been on high-density developments driven mostly by market trends. Lately, however, the Sydney intensification strategy has shifted to high-density projects. The paper concludes by drawing out findings that are relevant to intensification policies in the selected metropolitan regions and elsewhere: the ubiquity of NIMBY reactions; the importance of senior government involvement because less sensitive to anti-density NIMBY reactions; the possibility of framing intensification strategies in ways that avoid political party confrontation; and the role of major environmental movements in raising public opinion support to intensification.

T1  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory
AN  - 1417524805; 201332225
AB  - Recent advances in intergroup contact theory and research are reviewed. A meta-analysis with 515 studies and more than 250,000 subjects demonstrates that intergroup contact typically reduces prejudice (mean r = -.21). Allport's original conditions for optimal contact -- equal status, common goals, no intergroup competition, and authority sanction -- facilitate the effect but are not necessary conditions. There are other positive outcomes of intergroup contact, such as greater trust and forgiveness for past transgressions. These contact effects occur not only for ethnic groups but also for such other groups as homosexuals, the disabled and the mentally ill. Intergroup friendship is especially important. Moreover, these effects typically generalize beyond the immediate outgroup members in the situation to the whole outgroup, other situations, and even to other outgroups not involved in the contact. They also appear to be universal -- across nations, genders, and age groups. The major mediators of the effect are basically affective: reduced anxiety and empathy. And even indirect contact reduces prejudice -- vicarious contact through the mass media and having a friend who has an outgroup friend. Of course, negative contact occurs -- especially when it is non-voluntary and threatening. Criticisms of the theory and policy implications are also discussed. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Racialized Media Coverage of Minority Candidates in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary
AN  - 896195493; 201120578
AB  - This article investigates the prominence of racial content in newspaper stories about Barack Obama and three other candidates running in the 2008 Democratic Party presidential primary. Content analyses of stories appearing in six national newspapers sought to ascertain how frequent racial references appeared in news accounts of the presidential contest, how salient the racial content was, and what factors explained race-related coverage. Consistent with previous studies, the presence of one or more racial minorities in the stories increased the likelihood and presence of racial references found in the story. However, results challenge the conventional wisdom that racial content is salient enough to serve as a prominent racial cue activating readers' or voters' negative racial prejudices. This study finds that more than any other factor, journalists' desire to heighten the election's competitiveness influenced the presence and degree of racial content present in stories.

T1  - Electronic media and popular discourse on Russian nationalism
AN  - 919904080; 201202454
AB  - This article analyzes electronic letters to the editor on the coverage of the riot in Kondopoga (2006) and the bombings in the Moscow subway (2010). Letters to electronic media are used for the first time as a source for popular opinion on nationalism and ethnic conflicts in Russia. The first argument of this study is methodological: a comparison between the polls and the letters suggests that letters to electronic media represent public opinion on nationalism even though Internet users still constitute a minority of Russian citizens. This study also claims that the letters under examination indicate a move from extreme nationalism to so called "banal nationalism," the term coined by Michael Billig, during the period between 2006 and 2010. Finally, the article argues that the concept of the civic nation is not yet well understood or accepted by Russian citizens. Although this concept, expressed in Russian by the newly coined word rossiane, became somewhat more popular in 2010 than it had been in 2006, the ethnic understanding of Russian still prevails. The basis for the new identity rossiane, as it is presented in the letters, lacks common memories, myths and traditions that would resonate strongly in popular imagination.

T1  - A Tale of Two Counties: Natives' Opinions Toward Immigration in North Carolina
AN  - 758121612; 201057035
AB  - This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.

T1  - When Contact Correlates with Prejudice: Adolescents' Romantic Relationship Experience Predicts Greater Benevolent Sexism in Boys and Hostile Sexism in Girls
AN  - 758126123; 201060039
AB  - The present research examines how romantic relationship experience and age predict ambivalent sexism in adolescents. We measured sexist beliefs and romantic relationship experience in a large sample of Spanish adolescents (N?=?1447), ranging from 12 to 19NByears of age. Consistent with prior research, age predicted less sexist beliefs. Controlling for the effects of age, relationship experience predicted increased hostile sexism in girls and increased benevolent sexism in boys. Additionally, younger boys (12-14NByears) with greater relationship experience tended to endorse hostile sexism more strongly. The general decline in sexism over the course of adolescence masks a contrasting effect of romantic experience, which suggests that heterosexual adolescents' desire to attract romantic partners may foster, rather than reduce, sexism.

AN  - 754037723; 201050336
AB  - This article contests the characterisation of the popular and acclaimed film, Slumdog Millionaire, as a realistic portrayal of India's urban poverty that will ultimately serve as a tool of advocacy for India's urban poor. It argues that the film's reductive view of slum-spaces will more probably reinforce negative attitudes towards slum-dwellers, lending credibility to the sorts of policies that have historically dispossessed them of power and dignity. By drawing attention to the film's celebration of characters and spaces that symbolise Western culture and Northern trajectories of 'development', the article also critically engages with some of the issues raised by the film's enormous success.

T1  - The Contact Space: A Novel Framework for Intergroup Contact Research
AN  - 1928167421
AB  - This article presents a new framework for understanding research on the intersection between language, communication, and intergroup contact. Contact theory has described a variety of ways in which contact between groups can reduce prejudice and improve intergroup relations. However, the field has become fragmented by the study of a variety of forms of contact whose interconnections have not been elucidated, and it has paid insufficient attention to the language and communicative dynamics of the contact event itself. This article accounts for the variation in forms of contact studied by arraying them in two-dimensional space organized by (a) involvement of self in contact and (b) richness of self-outgroup experience. The former pertains to whether an individual is directly involved in interaction with an outgroup member (vs. merely observing such contact); the latter pertains to the multiplicity of channels and senses through which one experiences the outgroup member. These two dimensions are argued to be largely orthogonal. The two-dimensional space is used to organize mediators and moderators in the field, to specify in detail the intersection between contact and issues of language and communication, as well as to outline areas of particular promise for specific contact interventions.

AB  - The aim of this article is to analyse the strategies of the first Italian commercial broadcaster (Fininvest/Mediaset) in the media sector, from its foundation to the present, considering four parameters: politics, the market, technology and society. Analysing the uniquely Italian political, economic, technological and societal traits and the strategies adopted by Fininvest/Mediaset in each of these four areas, the authors read the company's history in a new light and identify some elements that have contributed to its success over the last 30 years. For example, the ever-closer ties with politics: the ability to foresee and adopt pioneering marketing strategies, the defence of the regulatory and technological status quo: and. finally, the close relationship with public opinion and Italian society.

T1  - The Changing Face of Racial Discrimination: Hispanics as the Dominant Minority in the USA - a New Application of Power-Threat Theory
AN  - 1928744558
AB  - According to Hubert Blalock's 1967 power-threat theory, the larger the minority group's size the greater the threat to the majority group. Most of Blalock's examples, and much of the subsequent empirical investigation into the power-threat thesis, focus on Anglo and African American relations. Changing demographics will likely alter existing majority-minority relations as Hispanics displace African Americans as the largest minority. This will change the face of racial discrimination in the country. Indeed, this paper suggests that the animosity toward Latinos by both the majority white and minority black populations may be more intense than those shaping contemporary white-black relations. Two key lifestyle features that have not contaminated black-white relations may exacerbate hostility toward Hispanics: their perceived illegal status in the country, and the perception that Hispanics resist learning English. The role of the media in perpetuating these stereotypes and inflaming hostility toward Latinos is also discussed.

T1  - Issue Engagement on Congressional Candidate Web Sites, 2002--2006
AN  - 60339732; 201011370
AB  - When candidates engage in robust policy debate, it gives citizens clear choices on issues that matter. Previous studies of issue engagement have primarily used indicators of campaign strategy that are mediated by reporters (e.g., newspaper articles) or indicators that may exclude candidates in less competitive races (e.g., television advertisements). We study issue engagement with data from a unique source, congressional candidate Web sites, that are unmediated and representative of both House and Senate campaigns. We find that the saliency of issues in public opinion is a primary determinant of candidate engagement. And, despite the unique capacity of the Internet to allow candidates to explain their positions on a large number of issues, candidates continue to behave strategically, selecting a few issues on which to engage their adversaries.
