AN  - 2465951572
AB  - PurposePoliticians' response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic worldwide relied on war scenarios having a tradition in disease management. The study contrasts how the political measures introduced during the state of emergency were presented by the Prime Minister of Hungary in his social media posts and his speeches and announcements broadcast by public media.Design/methodology/approachA computer-assisted content analysis was conducted to extract data on war and military metaphors, followed by a qualitative analysis of the metaphor scenarios used for explaining the situation and justifying action. The role of the prime minister (PM) indicated by the social media posts and by his transcripted speeches was compared with the suggestion of the visual illustrations.FindingsThe study’s findings were that verbal communication shifted between war-related metaphoric to military-related realistic. The third conceptual domain identified was fear. Messages were mostly about national cohesion, however, visually, the PM was the protagonist of the events. The communication proved efficient according to opinion polls.Originality/valueThe research revealed how the securitization of the pandemic took place via the political discourse constructed both for Internet users and traditional media consumers. Metaphors of fear, war and military action created the justification of the declaration of a state of emergency. The PM as a capable and responsible leader was placed in focus of the events. Although verbal messages by the PM were centred on a sense of community and joint action, the personalization of political action was remarkable by indirect means, such as visual messages. The personalization of politics throughout the period researched served the purpose of securitization of the pandemic with the PM as a charismatic leader attracting attention and giving credit to the severity of the threat along with the introduction of extraordinary measures.

T1  - Going global: Filmic appropriation of Jane Austen in India
AN  - 2419909128
AB  - The dual edged implications of the introduction of English literary studies notwithstanding – the presentation of a fresh cultural perspective and the complete cultural takeover of colony – the pride and fascination of the British with the works of Jane Austen has had a deep impact on cultural production in India and its diaspora. Down the years, keeping pace with changing times and backed by technological developments, the Jane Austen-facilitated coming together of the two nations and two cultures, has seen several multilingual, multicultural screen adaptations of the Austen novels for both television and the big screen: Sense and Sensibility by Tamil cinema as Kandukondain Kandukondain; Pride and Prejudice as Trishna, a serialized Hindi adaptation for Indian national television, and later, for the big screen by a British Indian in English and Hindi as the internationally acclaimed Bride and Prejudice/Balle Balle Amritsar to L.A. and more recently, Emma by mainstream Bollywood in Hindi as Aisha. The essay broaches an analysis of the nuancing that takes place in the interstices between the word and the visual art forms and of the complexities arising from this interface. The complex agenda of the adaptive engagement underlying this vibrant colloquy between two cultures, between two mediums is interesting enough, but the added dynamic of a hybrid cosmopolitanism that is sometimes gratifying and sometimes problematic, makes the study even more challenging.

T1  - How Has Cultural Heterosexism Affected Thinking about Divorce? Asymmetric Framing of Same-Gender and Mixed-Gender Divorces in News Media and in Minds
AN  - 2403185152
AB  - Herek’s notion of cultural heterosexism describes an ideology that works implicitly through language, and leads non-heterosexuals to be framed as “others.” National statistics in many countries indicate group differences between same-gender and mixed-gender couples in divorce rates, and we used media accounts and individual interpretation of group differences in divorce to operationalize it here. We found qualified support for three hypotheses in two studies. In Study 1, analysis of 412 English-language news articles on divorce indicated that comparative statements overwhelmingly positioned same-gender couples as figure and mixed-gender couples as ground. In Study 2, 88 participants read about how same-gender couples differed from mixed-gender couples, or about how mixed-gender couples differed from same-gender couples in their reasons for dissolving relationships. Results indicated that participants showed higher perceived legitimacy of inequality, higher sexual prejudice, and higher estimates of global divorce rates in the former conditions. Analysis of participants’ explanations of group differences in divorce rates indicated that they spontaneously contrasted mixed-gender couples against same-gender couples more of the time. As the media discourse focused on male couples (Study 1) and the effects of linguistic framing was evident only when male couples were described (Study 2), we discuss how these studies, which operationalized and evidenced cultural heterosexism, may point to the emergence of homonormative ideologies that recognized gay men more than lesbians in twenty-first century politics.

T1  - It takes a village to manipulate the media: coordinated link sharing behavior during 2018 and 2019 Italian elections
AN  - 2412761453
AB  - Over the last few years, a proliferation of attempts to define, understand and fight the spread of problematic information in contemporary media ecosystems emerged. Most of these attempts focus on false content and/or bad actors detection. In this paper, we argue for a wider ecological focus. Using the frame of media manipulation and a revised version of the ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ original definition, the paper presents a study based on an unprecedented combination of Facebook data, accessed through the CrowdTangle API, and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election. By focusing on actors’ collective behavior, we identified several networks of pages, groups, and verified public profiles (‘entities’), that shared the same political news articles on Facebook within a very short period of time. Some entities in our networks were openly political, while others, despite sharing political content too, deceptively presented themselves as entertainment venues. The proportion of inauthentic entities in a network affects the wideness of the range of news media sources they shared, thus pointing to different strategies and possible motivations. The paper has both theoretical and empirical implications: it frames the concept of ‘coordinated inauthentic behavior’ in existing literature, introduces a method to detect coordinated link sharing behavior and points out different strategies and methods employed by networks of actors willing to manipulate the media and public opinion.

T1  - Framing the Opioid Crisis: Do Racial Frames Shape Beliefs of Whites Losing Ground?
AN  - 2507991420
AB  - Context: Although research has begun to examine perceptions of being on the losing side of politics, it has been confined to electoral politics. The context of health disparities, and particularly the opioid crisis, offers a case to explore whether frames that emphasize racial disadvantage activate loser perceptions and the political consequences of such beliefs.
Methods: White survey participants (N = 1,549) were randomized into three groups: a control which saw no news article, or one of two treatment groups which saw a news article about the opioid crisis framed to emphasize either the absolute rates of opioid mortality among whites or the comparative rates of opioid mortality among whites compared to blacks.
Findings: Among control group participants, perceiving oneself a political loser was unrelated to attitudes about addressing opioids, whereas those who perceived whites to be on the losing side of public health had a less empathetic response to the opioid crisis. The comparative frame led to greater beliefs that whites are on the losing side of public health, whereas the absolute frame led to more empathetic policy opinions.
Conclusions: Perceptions that one's racial group has lost ground in the public health context could have political consequences that future research should explore.

T1  - Where the Other Side Gets News: Audience Perceptions of Selective Exposure in the 2016 Election
AN  - 2431020364
AB  - Building on research on selective exposure, hostile media perceptions, and presumed media influence, this study explores what citizens believe about their political rivals’ news habits and introduces the idea of perceived selective exposure: the extent to which citizens believe their political opponents curate media diets of like-minded political news. Results from a national survey of voters (N = 657) show that during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, voters disagreed about the extent to which prominent news sources favored Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump. The more undesirably biased voters considered a source, the more news they assumed their political rivals received from that source. This perceived selectivity was consequential: A belief that others’ news habits were weighted toward like-minded media was linked to a belief that others’ election news choices had reinforced their attitudes. Partisans think their political rivals are selecting biased news sources that bolster extremity.

T1  - Military Know-Nothings or (At Least) Military Know-Somethings?: Knowledge of Defense Policy in Germany and Its Determinants
AN  - 2365034283
AB  - There is little empirical evidence of the widely shared belief that most civilians know next to nothing about defense policy and armed forces. This article examines knowledge of defense policy in Germany and its determinants. The database is a public opinion survey from 2016. The survey included six questions on various aspects of knowledge of defense policy. Its results show that knowledge of defense policy is approximately on a level with general political knowledge in Germany. Determinants from the categories of resources and sociodemographics, motivations, and opportunity structures explain individual knowledge levels. Internal efficacy, interest in politics, the intention to vote, and the perception of the Bundeswehr’s presence in the media are among the most important predictors. These results indicate that the armed forces can bridge the gap between the public and the military, the civil–military gap, by being present in society and active in personal and mass media communication.

T1  - Exploring U.S. Shifts in Anti-Asian Sentiment with the Emergence of COVID-19
AN  - 2635380834
AB  - Background: Anecdotal reports suggest a rise in anti-Asian racial attitudes and discrimination in response to COVID-19. Racism can have significant social, economic, and health impacts, but there has been little systematic investigation of increases in anti-Asian prejudice. Methods: We utilized Twitter’s Streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 3,377,295 U.S. race-related tweets from November 2019–June 2020. Sentiment analysis was performed using support vector machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning model. Accuracy for identifying negative sentiments, comparing the machine learning model to manually labeled tweets was 91%. We investigated changes in racial sentiment before and following the emergence of COVID-19. Results: The proportion of negative tweets referencing Asians increased by 68.4% (from 9.79% in November to 16.49% in March). In contrast, the proportion of negative tweets referencing other racial/ethnic minorities (Blacks and Latinx) remained relatively stable during this time period, declining less than 1% for tweets referencing Blacks and increasing by 2% for tweets referencing Latinx. Common themes that emerged during the content analysis of a random subsample of 3300 tweets included: racism and blame (20%), anti-racism (20%), and daily life impact (27%). Conclusion: Social media data can be used to provide timely information to investigate shifts in area-level racial sentiment.

T1  - Let There Be Clamor: Exploring the Emergence of a New Public Sphere in India and Use of Social Media as an Instrument of Activism
AN  - 2322427903
AB  - This article traces the emergence of a new public sphere in India by applying a critical-cultural theoretical lens to the digital discourse on the Twitter platform surrounding the 2014 Jadavpur University student movement against on-campus sexual violence. Social media platforms allowed the student movement to challenge not only the sociopolitical complications in academia but also the structural silence surrounding issues of sexual assault in the country. In this study, the method of qualitative textual analysis is used to critically analyze the tweets made using the hashtag #hokkolorob (meaning “let there be clamor”), during the movement. The findings in this examination indicate that the Internet today has the capacity to guide public opinion formation, influence collective action, and is emerging as a discursive public sphere among the youth of India. This study contributes toward an understanding of the use of social media communication for political mobilization in the Indian context.

T1  - When Can Exemplars Shape White Racial Attitudes? Evidence from the 2012 U.S. Presidential Campaign
AN  - 2431020183
AB  - Prior research finds that exposure to outgroup exemplars reduces prejudice, but it has focused on most-likely cases. We examine whether salient outgroup exemplars can reduce prejudice under more challenging conditions, such as when they are counter-stereotypical but not well-liked, and the audience is heterogeneous and holds strong priors. Specifically, we assess the impact of the Obama exemplar under the less auspicious conditions of the 2012 U.S. presidential campaign. Using panel data, we find that racial prejudice declined during the campaign, especially among Whites with the most exposure to Obama through political television. Liking Obama proved irrelevant to these effects, as did partisanship. Racial prejudice increased slightly after the campaign ended, but the effects remained largely intact weeks later.

T1  - Numbers, Narratives, and Nation: Mainstream News Coverage of U.S. Latino Population Growth, 1990–2010
AN  - 2406941440
AB  - Ideologies that support racial domination and White supremacy remain foundational in U.S. society, even as the nation becomes increasingly diverse and progressively focused on quantitative measurement. This study explores how a prominent mainstream news outlet represents the growth of the nation’s second largest population, Latinos, within this changing demographic and numeric environment. Drawing from two frameworks, the Latino Threat Narrative and Color-Blind Racism, quantitative and qualitative analyses are conducted with 174 Los Angeles Times (LAT) articles about 2000 and 2010 census results. Reporters for the LAT, located in the single most important U.S. location for Latinos, frame Latinos and their population dynamics in line with the overtly racist narrative of Latino threat and the covertly racist ideology of color-blind racism. Moreover, the analyses reveal that quantitative logics circulating in the present evaluative climate further the view that Latinos pose cultural-demographic threats to the nation. Quantification also enhances color-blind frames and rhetorical strategies justifying present-day racial stratification and the subordinate locations of non-White groups. This suggests how White supremacy retains its power as the populations and metrics of evaluation change. Finally, given recent research linking demographic trends and media representations with attitudes, policy positions, and political partisanship, these representations have implications for the well-being of Latinos, other populations, and the nation.

T1  - Anti-Muslim racism and the racialisation of sexual violence: ‘intersectional stereotyping’ in mass media representations of male Muslim migrants in Germany
AN  - 2330737602
AB  - This article examines how German print media have represented male migrants with Muslim backgrounds in relation to mainstream society and the stereotypes drawn on and created, including that of the migrant Muslim man as a criminal and sexual perpetrator. Media reports about ‘lecherous refugees’ have risen in the wake of wider social controversies about the ‘European refugee crisis’ and the consequences of welcoming over 1.5 million refugees from predominantly Muslim countries into Germany in recent years. Many of these reports reflect the Cologne New Year’s Eve 2016 sexual attacks by migrant men against German women. This study of German print media identifies a racialisation and ‘islamicisation’ of sexual violence and proposes the original theoretical concept of intersectional stereotyping to conceptualise the intersecting of religious, racialised and gendered patterns in media representations of male Muslim migrants. The research combines and extends the analytical frameworks of intersectionality and stereotyping to develop a new concept useful in media studies and beyond. The article provides a previously unexplored insight into racialised anti-Muslim stereotyping in German society in socio-political and historical context through the lens of print media.

T1  - Does Watching This Make Me Feel Ashamed or Angry? An Examination of Latino Americans’ Responses to Immigration Coverage
AN  - 2287952706
AB  - Content analyses of U.S. English-language news coverage of immigration indicate that these stories are laden with negative, threatening messages and have an almost exclusive focus on Latino immigrants. However, little is known regarding how non-immigrant Latinos process and interpret these messages. The current survey of adult non-immigrant Latinos living in the United States addresses this question by applying insights from the rejection-identification model and research on vicarious shame. Based on this research, experiencing group shame in response to immigration news should drive Latinos to distance themselves from this identity, leading to greater affiliation with American identity (to maintain a positive self-concept) and stronger support for restrictive immigration policies (to mitigate the potential threats). Alternatively, experiencing anger in response to this coverage should result in less distancing from the shared Latino identity (i.e., greater affiliation), prompting decreased association with American identity and less support for restrictive immigration policies. Results from the mediation model tested here found support for predictions stemming from both vicarious shame and rejection-identification assumptions, indicating that they represent distinct pathways to views on immigration attitudes and identity management. Furthermore, in line with social identity theory, Mexican Americans (vs. non-Mexican Latinos) were more likely to distance from the immigration message and perceive immigration coverage to depict negative beliefs others hold about their ethnic group (owing to the disproportionate emphasis on Mexicans in this coverage). Results are discussed in terms of the implications for group standing as well as the importance of legitimacy of media messages in this context.

T1  - Media experiences in community-driven rural areas: exploring children's media cultures in rural Gujarat, India
AN  - 2246310258
AB  - In this paper, we examine how social structures of gender, caste, and religion, within which children in India operate, inform their engagements with media technologies/narratives. We demonstrate our approach using the case of three villages in the Ahmedabad district of Gujarat, India. We examine children's media cultures using ethnographic methods which occasion long-term immersion and paying attention to children's narratives. We also argue that children experience and enact their agency while engaging with media from within the limitations or norms imposed by the social structures. This is evident in the simple negotiation strategies they have developed to challenge social structures and norms prevalent in their societies. Based on empirical evidence we conclude that the children's exposure to and consumption of media narratives under adult management allow the families and communities to reinforce the dominant rationality of patriarchy, caste hierarchy, and religious prejudice.

T1  - Understanding a digital movement of opinion: the case of #RefugeesWelcome
AN  - 2233385451
AB  - Recent work on digital political engagement has extensively shown that social media platforms enhance political participation and collective action. However, the idea that citizen voice through social media can give rise, under given conditions, to a specific digital force combining properties of social movements and public opinion has received less attention. We fill this gap by analysing the digital discussion around the Twitter hashtag #RefugeesWelcome as a case of 'digital movement of opinion' (DMO). When the refugee crisis erupted in 2015, an extraordinary wave of empathy characterized the publics' reactions in key European hosting countries, especially as a result of viral images portraying refugee children as the main victims. Using a triangulation of network, content and metadata analysis, we find that this DMO was driven primarily by social media elites whose tweets were then echoed by masses of isolated users. We then test the post-DMO status of the hashtag-sphere after a potentially antithetical shock such as the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks, which polarized the network public. Overall, we argue that the concept of DMO provides a heuristically useful tool for future research on new forms of digital citizen participation.

T1  - CAN THERE BE A 'SAFE HAVEN' FOR TRAUMA SURVIVORS IN THIS SOCIAL MEDIA DOMINATED WORLD?

AB  - The 20th and 21st centuries have been marked by a number of traumatic events: with the two World Wars, Korean War and, especially in the last twenty-five years, with conflicts in the Middle East and in Africa, as well as others, vast numbers of people have been displaced and have had to journey far and wide to find not only a new home but a safe haven from the atrocities of war. While discrimination against newcomers to a country, prejudice, racism, nationalism, religious fundamentalism, and authoritarian dictatorships are not new phenomena, what makes the recent reactions to the current worldwide human influxes different is the use of language manipulation, propaganda and hate speech via social media to re-stigmatize and re-traumatize the new refugees, asylum-seekers, immigrants and migrants. Social media platforms give everyone the opportunity to express their views, whether positive or negative, about anyone who could be considered the other. Both right-wing and left-wing parties and governments also see the usefulness of using the manipulation of the labels given to newcomers and inciting fear of them for their own agendas. In this paper we will investigate how the use of linguistic labels and stereotyping about the other contribute to the rise of hate speech worldwide and how the presence of hate speech about the newcomers has re-traumatized many refugees who had thought they had reached a safe haven after fleeing the source of their original trauma. For the purpose of this study, we will be using data that primarily refers to Italy and Poland, as well as some other examples.

T1  - College Students’ Perceptions of Gender-Inclusive Language Use Predict Attitudes Toward Transgender and Gender Nonconforming Individuals
AN  - 2217425381
AB  - Transgender and gender nonconforming (TGNC) individuals face negative consequences linked to prejudice, including homelessness and violence. One medium that perpetuates prejudice toward TGNC individuals is our choice in language. Biased language is related to prejudiced attitudes. Use of gender-inclusive language, however, promotes gender equality. Previous research has examined gender-inclusive language use regarding cisgender men and women, but little work has focused on gender-inclusive language use regarding TGNC individuals. Two studies explored the connections between attitudes toward transgender individuals and perceptions of TGNC-inclusive language. Three hierarchical linear regressions and a mini meta-analysis were conducted. Results suggest that people with negative attitudes toward transgender individuals perceive greater difficulty in using gender-inclusive language. These findings suggest that inclusive language use may be indicative of more positive attitudes.

T1  - Framing and immigration through the trump era
AN  - 2213163747
AB  - For the last decade, undocumented or illegal immigration has been one of the most contested policy issues in the United States, with significant news attention on policies affecting the undocumented population, ranging from deportations to comprehensive immigration reform, the DREAM Act, and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals. Despite these prominent and multifaceted policy debates, scholarship on media framing and public opinion remain more focused on the portrayal of immigrants rather than policies affecting them. In general, scholars find that policy frames are far more consequential to public opinion than equivalency frames (variations in how news media describe unauthorized immigrants, either as “illegal” or “undocumented”) or episodic frames (whether news articles are heavy on human‐interest stories rather than policy facts and statistics). Also, negative frames generally have stronger effects than positive frames, and these effects sometimes vary by partisanship and family migration history. Finally, the relative infrequency of powerful frames in news stories, like a life spent in the United States, provides opportunities for advocates to move public opinion on immigration policy. These findings have important implications for future battles over immigration policy in the United States, which show no signs of abating.

T1  - On naming Arab revolutions and oppositional media narratives
AN  - 2209247779
AB  - The unfinished Arab revolutions produced unsettling conditions, sectarian wars, counter-revolutionary wars, proxy wars and transitional democracies. US and Arab media responses could not find effective words to describe them and their underlying geopolitical implications. Whether to name them ‘protest’ or ‘unrest’, American mainstream media initially welcomed the events with a cautious curiosity while Arab media favoured a romanticized coverage. But as the protests spread fast and continued, a more dominant popular narrative in the US shaped by the ‘exceptionalist’ perspective about the Middle East emerged. This article explains how dominant discursive framings deployed a form of ‘nature talk’, specifically through names, phrases and locutions such as ‘Arab Spring’, ‘Jasmine revolution’, ‘Arab transition’, and horticultural words like ‘flower’, ‘rose’ and ‘blossom’ to describe the Arab uprisings. Because of an intellectually limiting media-produced racial vernacular during the period of mass protest, this dominant mainstream narrative spoke about the events either by using neo-imperial language that characterized the revolutions as an Islamist threat or by employing culturally reductionist vocabulary which infantilized protesters. The goal here is to place specific media frames and images that such linguistic constructions create and disseminate within the context of power relations, the politics of naming and knowledge production.

T1  - "A Kangaroo and Bradman"
AN  - 2197710987
AB  - Academic research on White Australia Policy and the Colombo Plan has spanned across the history of Asian migration, policy-making initiatives and Australia-India relations. But the role of popular transnational media images and stories that informs the sociocultural understanding of these relations has been under evaluated. In this article, using newspaper reports and notes of the tours, I highlight the building of popular perceptions under the Colombo Plan (1950-1957). By focusing on Indian journalists and editors, E. P. W. da Costa, J. N. Sahni, Frank Moraes, and Durga Das, this article contributes to the historiography of Australian-Indian relations. As these culture exchanges created a dialogue between the two countries that still influences the public opinion. The article concludes that journalists from both India and Australia sought to play a key role in image-making process and wanted a fresh start in relationship--politically, economically, sociologically and technologically.

T1  - Unfolding the pattern of contentious participation in Taiwan
AN  - 2216895771
AB  - Global violent revolts against both democratic and non-democratic regimes have caught the attention of governments and academia (Tilly and Tarrow, 2015). On December 17, 2010, the self-immolation of Mohammed Bouazizi, a Tunisian street vendor, sparked countrywide protests against the injustices of the local police. Scenes of protest played out again and again in Algeria, Oman, Yemen, Egypt, Syria, and Morocco. The wave of uprisings spread upwards into Europe. Mass protests erupted in London and Stockholm in 2011 and 2013, respectively. While deprivation and poverty could be the key causes of these riots, still other possible factors could lead to contentious activities. In South America, research suggests that economic slumps and corruption were the key reasons why Venezuela, Paraguay, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and French Guiana all faced large demonstrations. On August 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, an 18-year-old African American youth was fatally shot by a white police officer. The death of Michael Brown instigated a certain amount of street violence, while the Black Lives Matter movement has since organized a handful of national and local protests. Looting and vandalism occurred at the same time. In Asia, laborers and students gathered in South Korea's major cities on August 23, 2013, protesting an election manipulation scandal that erupted in the 2012 presidential election. In 2015, Koreans protested the National Intelligence Service's (NIS) attempt to sway public opinion ahead of the presidential election out of fear that these kinds of abuses of power would happen again. From mid-September to mid-December 2014, students in Hong Kong led a series of sit-in street strikes pressing Beijing to adopt universal suffrage in the 2017 Chief Executive election. This galvanization of political activism among youth has been widely noticed. These widespread movements across Europe, Africa, America, and Asia pose challenges for democracy and globalization. To explain the underlying causes of individual activism, scholars have tapped into the literature on political participation and democratization. While economic grievances may account for high participation in the Arab Spring (Beissinger et al., 2015), online mobilization could be a key reason why millennials and the younger generation have partaken so much in recent social movements (Chen et al., 2016). In addition to a generational difference in contentious participation, religious beliefs have been demonstrated as another important factor in an individual's conventional and unconventional participation in Taiwan (Chang, 2016). Considering the scope of unrest and its effect on democracy, it is necessary to devote more research toward factors other than personal grievances and demographic backgrounds. More specifically, we would like in this study to address the enduring puzzle of the relationship between age and social disorder. While the younger generation seems to represent the majority of protesters, there is as yet no definitive evidence regarding the effects of age on contentious action (Chung, 2016; Wang and Weng, 2017). As we believe that it is imperative to study protest behavior with a solid theoretical foundation, the civic voluntarism model was chosen to test whether personal resources and political attitudes may have a bearing on patterns of contentious politics. We contend that the probability of taking part in a demonstration increases with age because older people tend to acquire more skills and personal resources. Accordingly, we examined the effects of education, political efficacy and cognitive mobilization on protests, which may contribute to the current literature on contentious action. We chose Taiwan as a case study to test our hypotheses. Taiwan has held routine elections at the national and local level since the 1960s. Before democratization in the 1990s, however, people often decided on contentious action to express their discontent with labour, the environment, and civil rights issues. Many of the activists organized the opposition party, Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), and challenged the ruling party, Kuomingtang (KMT), both in the elections and on the streets. Contentious politics continues after the second party turnover in 2008, and Internet and social media is used to diffuse messages. In March 2014, several groups of college students protested against a congressional review of a trade pact with China, which had been passed by the standing committee. From March 18 to April 10, hundreds of students stormed and occupied the Legislative Yuan, the national legislature, to paralyze the legislation. Under pressure from students and civil society, KMT agreed not to pass any agreement without first enacting a law to regulate the review process. It was named Sunflower student movement because students held the sunflower to symbolize their call for more sunshine on the legislative process. Quite a lot of research pointed to the influence of national identity (Tsai and Chen, 2015), civil disobedience (Wang and Weng, 2017), and social networks (Chen et al., 2016). Since political participation is “a social and psychological decision” (Dalton, 2014:78), the role of political attitudes such as political efficacy and political cognition should be examined closely. In agreement with previous literature, this research aims to provide evidence that factors such as political efficacy, expectations for government transparency, political discussion, and partisanship help to explain civic activism in an East Asian democracy. We also contend that the tendency to take part in demonstrations increases with age. These empirical findings may shed light on the dynamics of global activism and contribute to the literature on political participation in general.

T1  - Impersonal subjectivation from platforms to infrastructures
AN  - 2170231986
AB  - The rapid expansion of social media has led to the concentration of digitized, networked, and mediated processes into the hands of a few giant corporations (e.g. Google, Facebook, and Amazon), their partners and affiliates. From smart watches to targeted advertising and reputation scores, this new political economy of subjectivation – or subject making – sees an intensification of datafication to sell commodities, manipulate moods, inject ideologies, and influence behaviors. This article argues that in order to understand this new political economy of subjectivation, we need to complicate and build upon framework that focus on the collection of personal data and its risks on individual users. We argue that as social media and digital media giant corporations move away from an enclosed platform model toward a distributed, impersonal infrastructure, the mining of individual data and the shaping of individual attitudes is increasingly geared toward establishing relationships between user data and a plethora of non-human, environmental data. Such an infrastructure invokes impersonal subjects, and thus requires a new politics of relationality.

T1  - National identity and distrust in the police: The case of North West Wales
AN  - 2165984454
AB  - Trust in the police, as defined by perceived procedural fairness, just decisions and effectivity, may be impacted by deep political divisions among the population, especially where citizens adopt opposing national identities. In Europe, North West Wales is one such area. Nationalism is intensified by language issues (Welsh vs. English) and historical experiences of UK institutions. A sample of 207 residents living within the local authority of Gwynedd were asked to take part in the study. A questionnaire survey addressed how much trust in the police ultimately depends upon national identity as expressed by preference for the Welsh language, trust in UK institutions and attitudes towards political symbols. Other factors tested included personal experience of the police, the influence of news reports and police TV series, as well as the perceived effectiveness of the police in addressing crime. Trust in UK institutions, preference for the Welsh language and news reporting were found to have most influence on trust in the police.

T1  - Revolution in the making? Social media effects across the globe
AN  - 2116067047
AB  - Social networking sites are popular tools to engage citizens in political campaigns, social movements, and civic life. However, are the effects of social media on civic and political participation revolutionary? How do these effects differ across political contexts? Using 133 cross-sectional studies with 631 estimated coefficients, I examine the relationship between social media use and engagement in civic and political life. The effects of social media use on participation are larger for political expression and smaller for informational uses, but the magnitude of these effects depends on political context. The effects of informational uses of social media on participation are smaller in countries like the United States, with a free and independent press. If there is a social media revolution, it relates to the expression of political views on social networking sites, where the average effect size is comparable to the effects of education on participation.

T1  - The Virtue of Moderation: A Cross-National Analysis of Exposure to Cross-Cutting Information and Turnout
AN  - 2430088727
AB  - This study examines whether exposure to political disagreement through the media makes citizens more or less likely to vote. Previous research provides mixed and inconclusive results on the mobilizing effects of exposure to cross-cutting, or non-like-minded, viewpoints. Relying on both 2009 European Election Studies (EES) media content analysis and voter survey covering 27 European Union countries, we construct two measures of cross-cutting news media exposure. We find that the relationship between exposure to cross-cutting information and turnout is nonlinear. While extreme levels of cross-cutting news exposure are negatively associated with turnout, exposure to a moderate degree of non-like-minded news increases the likelihood of voting.

T1  - Birth and Death(?) of the Anti-Fracking Movement: Inferences from Quantity of Coverage Theory
AN  - 2126731820
AB  - Public opposition to fracking is one of numerous movements expressing concern about health or environmental risks of a (usually) new technology. These have at their core an esoteric dispute between technical experts, but laypeople also become actively involved, usually as volunteers. They may live close to pertinent sites, motivated by fears for their families and property, or they may be people living farther away, attracted to the opposition for ideological reasons. (Opposition to fracking is a politically liberal position.) Activism is increasingly motivated when the issue is “hot” and diminishes when it cools down. According to Quantity of Coverage Theory (QCT), the “hotness” of an issue – therefore the degree of activism -- largely depends on its presence in the mass media. The American anti-fracking movement arose fairly quickly around 2010–11. News coverage peaked during 2012–14 and is now diminishing. Similar peaks and declines are observed in British and German news media, consistent with the power of central American media to influence news coverage in other industrial nations. Inferentially, from declining news coverage, the anti-fracking movement is waning, perhaps dying. Lacking direct measures of activism, QCT provides a lens through which to see the rise and fall of the movement.

T1  - Platformed antagonism: racist discourses on fake Muslim Facebook pages
AN  - 2099587229
AB  - This research examines how fake identities on social media create and sustain antagonistic and racist discourses. It does so by analysing 11 Danish Facebook pages, disguised as Muslim extremists living in Denmark, conspiring to kill and rape Danish citizens. It explores how anonymous content producers utilise Facebook's socio-technical characteristics to construct, what we propose to term as, platformed antagonism. This term refers to socio-technical and discursive practices that produce new modes of antagonistic relations on social media platforms. Through a discourse-theoretical analysis of posts, images, 'about' sections and user comments on the studied Facebook pages, the article highlights how antagonism between ethno-cultural identities is produced on social media through fictitious social media accounts, prompting thousands of user reactions. These findings enhance our current understanding of how antagonism and racism are constructed and amplified within social media environments.

T1  - Racialising domestic violence: Islamophobia and the Australian forced marriage debate
AN  - 2121029041
AB  - Amid claims that forced marriage is rife in Australia’s minority communities, 2013 saw the introduction of criminal legislation outlawing forced marriage in Australia. Within public debate, this punitive measure came to overshadow all other modes of addressing the problem; for instance, education programmes, civil legislation and targeted domestic violence support services. This article examines print media coverage of forced marriage over the thirteen-year period leading up to the introduction of criminal legislation. Exploring a discourse that overwhelmingly understands forced marriage as a problem of Islam and multiculturalism, and that marginalises the experiences of women and service providers, the author identifies distinct conservative and liberal representations of forced marriage which racialise domestic violence. Conservatives maintain that forced marriage is empirical evidence of an impending Muslim ‘takeover’ of the West precipitated by multiculturalism. Liberals reassert the importance of western values through specific criminal legislation to temper male minority ethnic violence. The material consequence of these Orientalist framings is a narrowing of services available to women seeking to escape violence. The article seeks to understand the processes of meaning-making in which forced marriage is implicated and how the issue is situated within the domain of national political ideology, as opposed to family violence.

T1  - Social Media and Regionalism in South Korean Voting Behavior: The Case of the 19th South Korean Presidential Election *
AN  - 2138552975
AB  - This study examines the moderating effects of social media use on regionalist voting behavior in South Korea. Analyzing the survey data conducted during the 2017 Korean presidential election, we test how social media functions in electoral processes, particularly with respect to region-based voting in the Korean electorate. The findings of this study reveal that social media use affects region-based voting behavior among the Korean electorate by connecting people with different regional backgrounds in online political communication. That is, social media use can create "bridging " social capital rather than "bonding" social capital in society. In this respect, results differ significantly from findings in the 2012 presidential election. In 2012, only the independent effects ofsocial media existed with a liberal bias, without revealing interaction with regional dummies. These independent effects disappeared in 2017, and different kinds of social media were statistically significant only when they functioned as moderating variables for regional dummies. This implies that as the functions of social media in the Korean election process have evolved in more complexity, they now are able to affect progressive as well as conservative voters.

T1  - A system for intergroup prejudice detection: The case of microblogging under terrorist attacks
AN  - 2114675679
AB  - Intergroup prejudice is a distorted opinion held by one social group about another, without examination of facts. It is heightened during crises or threat. It finds expression in social media platforms when a group of people express anger, resentment and dissent towards another. This paper presents a system for automated detection of prejudiced messages from social media feeds. It uses a knowledge discovery framework that preprocesses data, generates theory-driven linguistic features along with other features engineered from textual content, annotates and models historical data to determine what drives detection of intergroup prejudice especially during a crisis. It is tested on tweets collected during the Boston Marathon bombing event. The system can be used to curb abuse and harassment by timely detection and reporting of intergroup prejudice.

T1  - Brainwashing paranoia and lay media theories in China: the phenomenological dimension of media use (and the self) in digital environments
AN  - 2082932799
AB  - Drawing on the phenomenological tradition, this article focuses on the ‘lay media theories’ that ordinary people rely on to orient their media use. Existing scholarship on certain perceptions users hold about media and their behavioral consequences tends to assume that these perceptions by default rest on a sense of self that is pre-existing and immune to media. My empirical research troubles this theoretical assumption. Analyzing interviews and ethnography in China, I investigate the media practices of certain individuals under the influence of ‘brainwashing paranoia’. Through their engagements with the information abundance on the Chinese Internet, these individuals had, over time, revamped rather than enhanced their established political beliefs. I argue that in today’s high-choice environments, users’ lay media theories, especially their conceptions about media in relation to the self, should be taken into account as one major sociocultural factor that moderates or mediates the age-old tendency for selective exposure.

T1  - Free Media and Twitter in the 2016 Presidential Election
AN  - 2068695995
AB  - This article examines the surprising outcome of the 2016 presidential election, which saw Donald Trump defy nearly all of the conventional wisdom to become the 45th president of the United States. Political commentators and experts offered several immediate postelection explanations for Trump’s victory, one of which focused on how Trump was able to generate considerable unpaid or free media for himself, often directly through Twitter. This article explains the theory and rationale underlying the free media thesis (FMT) and then examines whether there is any preliminary empirical support for it. Using media tracking data and public opinion surveys, the results reveal that Trump indeed dominated the unpaid media market. Although the findings in this article cannot make causal claims about whether Trump’s advantages in free media are the primary reason for his upset victory, the results, nonetheless, suggest that some of the basic conditions necessary for the FMT were present in the 2016 election and that the FMT offers a plausible avenue for further analysis and future research.

T1  - News Quality and Public Opinion: The Impact of Deliberative Quality of News Media on Citizens' Argument Repertoire
AN  - 2430088689
AB  - This article investigates the impact of the deliberative quality of online news items on argument repertoire. Participants in an online experiment (N = 557) read a news item that covers a local debate on underground CO2 storage. Two dimensions of deliberative quality are manipulated: justification, or the extent to which arguments in the news item are substantiated, and constructive debate climate, that is, the extent to which stakeholders are reported to work together toward a solution. The findings suggest that public opinion quality would be higher, if news media would better meet deliberative standards.

T1  - The 'illegal' and the skilled: effects of media portrayals on perceptions of immigrants in Britain
AN  - 2046624212
AB  - Public perceptions often diverge widely from reality on the size and make-up of immigrant populations, with likely consequences for public opinion about immigration. Prior research has not established whether the media has any causal role in the construction of these perceptions. This paper examines whether and how actually occurring media portrayals of immigrants in Britain affect perceptions of immigrants among members of the British public. We begin by conducting a large-scale quantitative study of the British national press. We then report on an original survey experiment that tests for causal impact of news frames derived from the media study. Specifically, we focus on three depictions of immigrants: as 'illegal', Eastern European, or highly skilled. Results show that even subtle media interventions can shift public perceptions of immigration, in this case towards more realistic understandings of the overall size and make-up of the immigrant population in Britain. We suggest empirical, theoretical, and methodological implications for the study of media effects on public opinion towards immigration.

T1  - Politics Versus Place? The Relative Influence of Partisanship, Ideology, and Connection With Israel on Support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement
AN  - 2430088612
AB  - Analyzing data from the LA Jewish Journal Survey conducted in July 2015 (N = 501), the study empirically examines the relative influence of politics versus place on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement among members of the American-Jewish community. The results suggest that personal politics, or identifying as a Democrat and holding liberal political views, has the largest impact on support for the Iran Nuclear Agreement. Place, or having been to Israel, has the largest influence on opinion strength or supporting or opposing the deal rather than maintaining a position of ambivalence. The strategic implications of these findings for key stakeholders, including politicians, ethnic news media organizations, and lobbying groups, are discussed.

T1  - Communicating about Mental Illness and Violence: Balancing Stigma and Increased Support for Services
AN  - 2075659287
AB  - In the ongoing national policy debate about how to best address serious mental illness (SMI), a major controversy among mental health advocates is whether drawing public attention to an apparent link between SMI and violence, shown to elevate stigma, is the optimal strategy for increasing public support for investing in mental health services or whether nonstigmatizing messages can be equally effective. We conducted a randomized experiment to examine this question. Participants in a nationally representative online panel (N = 1,326) were randomized to a control arm or to read one of three brief narratives about SMI emphasizing violence, systemic barriers to treatment, or successful treatment and recovery. Narratives, or stories about individuals, are a common communication strategy used by policy makers, advocates, and the news media. Study results showed that narratives emphasizing violence or barriers to treatment were equally effective in increasing the public's willingness to pay additional taxes to improve the mental health system (55 percent and 52 percent, vs. 42 percent in the control arm). Only the narrative emphasizing the link between SMI and violence increased stigma. For mental health advocates dedicated to improving the public mental health system, these findings offer an alternative to stigmatizing messages linking mental illness and violence.

T1  - Algorithms, bots, and political communication in the US 2016 election: The challenge of automated political communication for election law and administration
AN  - 2037006543
AB  - Political communication is the process of putting information, technology, and media in the service of power. Increasingly, political actors are automating such processes, through algorithms that obscure motives and authors yet reach immense networks of people through personal ties among friends and family. Not all political algorithms are used for manipulation and social control however. So what are the primary ways in which algorithmic political communication-organized by automated scripts on social media-may undermine elections in democracies? In the US context, what specific elements of communication policy or election law might regulate the behavior of such "bots," or the political actors who employ them? First, we describe computational propaganda and define political bots as automated scripts designed to manipulate public opinion. Second, we illustrate how political bots have been used to manipulate public opinion and explain how algorithms are an important new domain of analysis for scholars of political communication. Finally, we demonstrate how political bots are likely to interfere with political communication in the United States by allowing surreptitious campaign coordination, illegally soliciting either contributions or votes, or violating rules on disclosure.

T1  - From “Ridiculous” to “Glad to Have Helped”: Debriefing News Delivery and Improved Reactions to Science in Milgram’s “Obedience” Experiments
AN  - 2017556586
AB  - Commentators on Milgram’s classic and controversial experiments agree that better integration of theories of “obedience to authority” with current archival research on participants’ viewpoints is essential in explaining compliance. Using conversation analysis, we examine an archived data source that is largely overlooked by the Milgram literature, yet crucial for understanding the interactional organization of participants’ displayed perspectives. In hundreds of interviews conducted immediately after each experiment, participants received one of two types of debriefing: deceptive or full. Analyzing 56 full debriefings from three experimental conditions, we find they featured interactional structuring as news delivery sequences and that debriefing news could transform initially ambivalent or negative assessments of the experiment into positive ones. Such findings reveal limitations of engaged followership, the currently dominant theory of “obedience.” Following discussion of improved assessments’ relevance to public attitudes toward science, we conclude that multiple social psychological processes were at work in producing Milgram’s results.

T1  - Audiences Perceptions of Informative Programs at Jimma Fana FM 98.1 in Jimma, Ethiopia
AN  - 2016337110
AB  - According to McCombs and Maxwell (2005), media are 'social institutions', hence, an organization that is critical to the socialization process that provides a support system for individuals as they struggle to become members of a larger social network.

[...]an analysis and interpretation of data was gathered through questionnaire and focus group discussion, focused on audiences' perceptions towards the five informative programs broadcasted from Jimma Fana FM 98.1 radio station that are analyzed and interpreted below.

In responding to item 8, 66 (36.0 %) of the respondents strongly agreed, and 67 (36.6 %) of them agreed that the Hello Fana program brought change in their attitudes and perceptions.

[...]from the above data analysis, it is possible to conclude that the Hello Fana program was positively perceived by the great majority of the audiences of the program, and the qualitative data gained from focus group discussions also support this conclusion.

[...]the program could not cultivate diversified arts found in the community as such. * The Gaddisa Jimata news program emphasizes on transmitting premium league sport news (not local and national sport), and though there are sports in Jimma zone, these sports are not sufficiently reported by the news program to audiences.

[...]based on the major findings and conclusions of the study, the following recommendations have been suggested: (1) Amharic and Afan Oromo news programs broadcasted from Jimma Fana FM 98.1 radio station should deliver current and fresh news to their audiences on time as much as possible; (2) Ahmaric and Afan Oromo news readers should read news in a medium speed so that the news listeners properly comprehend the news.

T1  - Mention effect in information diffusion on a micro-blogging network
AN  - 2015828896
AB  - Micro-blogging systems have become one of the most important ways for information sharing. Network structure and users’ interactions such as forwarding behaviors have aroused considerable research attention, while mention, as a key feature in micro-blogging platforms which can improve the visibility of a message and direct it to a particular user beyond the underlying social structure, is seldom studied in previous works. In this paper, we empirically study the mention effect in information diffusion, using the dataset from a population-scale social media website. We find that users with high number of followers would receive much more mentions than others. We further investigate the effect of mention in information diffusion by examining the response probability with respect to the number of mentions in a message and observe a saturation at around 5 mentions. Furthermore, we find that the response probability is the highest when a reciprocal followship exists between users, and one is more likely to receive a target user’s response if they have similar social status. To illustrate these findings, we propose the response prediction task and formulate it as a binary classification problem. Extensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of discovered factors. Our results have consequences for the understanding of human dynamics on the social network, and potential implications for viral marketing and public opinion monitoring.

T1  - Media’s Influence on Perceptions of Trans Women
AN  - 1992792646
AB  - Although media representations of trans women are becoming increasingly common, many trans women still face discrimination in their daily lives, in part due to prejudices and stereotypes that are perpetuated by media. In two studies, we investigated group differences in baseline transphobia linked to gender, sexual orientation, religiosity, and political ideology; we then measured whether different representations of trans women in media led to attitude change. After providing information about their baseline attitudes, participants were randomly assigned to positive, negative, or control film-viewing conditions, with a problematic condition (i.e., sympathetic portrayal of a trans woman by a cisgender male actor) added in study 2. In each condition, participants viewed two depictions of trans women from film or television shows. After watching the clips, participants’ attitudes toward trans individuals were re-assessed. Heterosexuals, Christians, conservatives, and men (study 2 only) showed greater transphobia at pretest than LGB individuals, atheists, liberals, and women, respectively. Attitudes of participants who viewed negative film depictions of trans women became more negative after viewing the clips. We discuss implications of these findings in relation to recent media interest in representing trans women.

T1  - Anti-refugee Mobilization in Social Media: The Case of Soldiers of Odin
AN  - 2313791847
AB  - In the wake of the international refugee crisis, racist attitudes are becoming more publicly evident across the European Union. Propelled by the attacks in Köln on New Year’s Eve 2015 and harsher public sentiments on immigration, vigilante gangs have emerged in various European cities. These gangs mobilize through social media networks and claim to protect citizens from alleged violent and sexual attacks by refugees. This article analyzes how racist actors use social media to mobilize and organize street politics targeting refugees/immigrants. The aim is to explore the relation between social media and anti-refugee mobilization in a time of perceived insecurity and forced migration. The study uses the vigilante network Soldiers of Odin as a specific case, looking at (1) how they communicate through social media, (2) how they are represented in the large “alternative” space of right-wing online sites, and (3) how they are represented in traditional mainstream news. Using a critical adaption of Cammaerts’ theory of “mediation opportunity structure,” the article explicates the (inverted) rationale of racist online networks. Using quantitative and qualitative content analysis, both social media content and traditional news media are examined. The results show that although racist actors succeed in utilizing many of the opportunities embedded in social media communication and protest logic, they are also subject to constraints, such as a lack of public support and negative framing in news media. The article calls for more research on the (critical) relationship between uncivil engagement and social media networks.

T1  - Negotiating empathy in the French and Cypriot-Greek press: Christian values or social justice in migration discourse?
AN  - 2161636036
AB  - Both news media and politicians, taking advantage of their cultural authority through spoken and written texts, contribute to forming public opinion, in particular with the use of discursive means, to shape the way people understand migration. Research has so far pointed to negative representations of the Other and argumentation against migrants and refugees revolves around the topoi of burden, illegality, insecurity, violence and threat, which are known to trigger emotions such as resentment, anger and fear. However, media coverage of refugees' arrivals can also contribute to a positive construction of migrants' identities: this is what has been called 'counter-narrative', i.e. a set of narratives aimed at changing the mainstream discourse, which is overwhelmingly negative. This study focuses on the thematic, lexical and syntactic choices in Greek Cypriot and French communist newspapers (Haravgi and L'Humanité respectively^ and the choices used to construct an argumentation which fosters the inclusion of migrants. Focusing mainly on headlines, the study adopts critical discourse approaches (Wodak 2001, inter alia; van Dijk 2001, inter alia) and uses tools from corpus linguistics methodologies (Bednarek 2008; Baker et al. 2008; van Dijk 1995, inter alia) to extract and analyze salient lexical items. The results show similarities in the way stance is constructed, for instance an anti EU stance is common to both newspapers, however the Greek Cypriot newspaper appeals to Christian values to foster charity and empathy, and the French newspaper appeal to the legal rights of migrants and the French citizen's duty to foster solidarity.

T1  - Bureau Clergyman: How the FBI Colluded with an African American Televangelist to Destroy Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
AN  - 2007620385
AB  - This article explains how the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) partnered with African American minister Elder Lightfoot Solomon Michaux to discredit and neutralize Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. The Elder, the nation's first minister (black or white) to have his own weekly television show, colluded with the Bureau to shape public opinion against King and cast doubt upon King's religious commitments and activities. Michaux was, what I call, a Bureau Clergyman: a minister who was an FBI "Special Service Contact" or on the Bureau's "Special Correspondents Lists." Far from secret informants, black and white male clergy in these official Bureau programs enjoyed very public and cooperative relationships with the FBI and were occasionally "called into service" to work in concert with the FBI. The FBI called upon Michaux and he willingly used his status, popular media ministry, and cold war spirituality to publically scandalize King as a communist and defend the Bureau against King's criticisms. In the end, the Elder demonized King, contested calls for black equality under the law, and lionized the FBI as the keeper of Christian America. The story moves the field beyond the very well known narratives of the FBI's hostility towards religion and reveals how the Bureau publicly embraced religion and commissioned their clergymen to help maintain prevailing social arrangements. Michaux's relationship with the FBI also offers a window into the overlooked religious dimensions of the FBI's opposition to King, even as it highlights how black clergy articulated and followed competing ideologies of black liberation during the civil rights movement.

T1  - Priming the Costs of Conflict? Russian Public Opinion About the 2014 Crimean Conflict
AN  - 2187591300
AB  - Many have argued that the 2014 Russia–Crimea conflict was inflamed by Russia’s hawkish media propaganda, such that it drove Russian public opinion to support Crimea’s annexation, proving consequential for the state’s foreign policy. This study draws on audience costs and the democratic peace literature to contend that media coverage that highlights the diplomatic, military, and economic costs of conflict may reduce hawkish attitudes among the public. Using an original survey of Russian Internet users, we randomly manipulated the order of question blocks to examine the effects of cost and hawkish primes on support for Russian foreign policy. We found that primes significantly influenced support for conflict, and this effect was moderated by Russian identity and support for the current regime. Implications for both theory and public diplomacy in the context of countering Russian disinformation are discussed.

T1  - Positioning young refugees in Australia: media discourse and social exclusion
AN  - 1952104036
AB  - The aim of this article was to examine how media attention affects the social exclusion of young refugees negotiating their way towards settlement in Australia. Emerging stereotypes and prejudices against young male refugees require new ways of understanding the impact of global, national and local issues on their social exclusion. The article brings together the impact of (a) the global politicisation and backlash against refugees, (b) Australians negative perception of refugees and (c) the increased reporting of young African-Australian and Pasifika-Australians as the perpetrators of youth violence. The article recognises the overlapping dimensions of social exclusion for young refugees and considers their 'spatial', 'relational' and 'socio-political' exclusion. The examination of media reporting of a landmark legal case of discrimination and racial profiling reveals a discourse of media attention that has perpetuated the social exclusion of a group of young African-Australian refugees living on a Melbourne public housing estate. The sensationalist and prejudicial media connection of the landmark legal case, youth violence and young African-Australians living on the Flemington Estate demonstrates the challenges young male refugees face in negotiating their settlement in Australia. This article makes a contribution to understanding the multi-dimensional nature of youth exclusion in contemporary times.

T1  - Who Says What to Whom: Content Versus Source in the Hostile Media Effect
AN  - 2506669614
AB  - Hostile-media-effect research has been built on the assumption that partisans are motivated to adjust their evaluations to accommodate preexisting attitudes that are especially sensitive to content. More recent literature, however, has suggested a rival hypothesis—that perceptions of media bias spring from social identity, keyed to source differences. To test these competing explanations, we designed an experiment around the teaching-alternatives-to-evolution controversy. Partisans from two adversarial groups read an op-ed article with manipulations of content (agreeable, balanced, or disagreeable) and source (in-group, neutral, or out-group). Both content and source influenced hostile media perceptions, but nuanced differences speak to the dynamic ways in which content, source, as well as group-level characteristics impact the processing and evaluation of news content.

T1  - Diversity of attitudes to English in non-professional public discourse: A focus on Lithuania: An analysis of the narratives people tell about English as a global language in the local context of Lithuania
AN  - 1944329320
AB  - This paper stems from the ongoing debate on the changing role and status of English in different parts of the world, with a special interest in the socio-historical background of a post-Soviet country. The international status of English has given rise to different reactions among speakers, ranging from attraction to resentment (cf. Onysko, 2009: 34). These reactions are expressed in public online discourse, which provides a rich resource of empirical evidence to study public attitudes and language ideologies. Digital media offers an especially important strategic site to disseminate ideologies and shape public opinions. This paper analyses the spectrum of discourses operating within Lithuanian digital media to perpetuate attitudes towards English and the values associated with it.

T1  - Freedom of Racist Speech: Ego and Expressive Threats
AN  - 1940964882
AB  - Do claims of "free speech" provide cover for prejudice? We investigate whether this defense of racist or hate speech serves as a justification for prejudice. In a series of 8 studies (N = 1,624), we found that explicit racial prejudice is a reliable predictor of the "free speech defense" of racist expression. Participants endorsed free speech values for singing racists songs or posting racist comments on social media; people high in prejudice endorsed free speech more than people low in prejudice (meta-analytic r = .43). This endorsement was not principled -- high levels of prejudice did not predict endorsement of free speech values when identical speech was directed at coworkers or the police. Participants low in explicit racial prejudice actively avoided endorsing free speech values in racialized conditions compared to nonracial conditions, but participants high in racial prejudice increased their endorsement of free speech values in racialized conditions. Three experiments failed to find evidence that defense of racist speech by the highly prejudiced was based in self-relevant or self-protective motives. Two experiments found evidence that the free speech argument protected participants' own freedom to express their attitudes; the defense of other's racist speech seems motivated more by threats to autonomy than threats to self-regard. These studies serve as an elaboration of the Justification-Suppression Model (Crandall & Eshleman, 2003) of prejudice expression. The justification of racist speech by endorsing fundamental political values can serve to buffer racial and hate speech from normative disapproval.

T1  - When populists become popular: comparing Facebook use by the right-wing movement Pegida and German political parties
AN  - 1934005687
AB  - Previous research has acknowledged the use of social media in political communication by right-wing populist parties and politicians. Less is known, however, about its pivotal role for right-wing social movements which rely on personalized messages to mobilize supporters and challenge the mainstream party system. This paper analyzes online political communication by the right-wing populist movement Pegida and German political parties. We investigate to which extent parties attract supporters of Pegida, to which extent they address topics similar to Pegida and whether their topic use has become more similar over a period of almost two years. The empirical analysis is based on Facebook posts by main accounts and individual representatives of these political groups. We first show that there are considerable overlaps in the audiences of Pegida and the new challenger in the party system, AfD. Then we use topic models to characterize topic use by party and surveyed crowdworkers to which extent they perceive the identified topics as populist communication. The results show that while Pegida and AfD talk about rather unique topics and smaller parties engage to varying degrees with the topics populists emphasize, the two governing parties CDU and SPD clearly deemphasize those. Overall, the findings indicate that the considerable attention devoted to populist actors and shifts in public opinion due to the refugee crisis have left only moderate marks in political communication within the mainstream party system.

T1  - Societal transformation, public opinion and Saudi youth: views from an academic elite
AN  - 1912185511
AB  - Saudi socio-politics is being affected by societal transformation; one that is being driven by a potent combination of demographics, improved education, wider access to the Internet and burgeoning new media usage. Whilst Saudi government decision-making remains 'top-down', the dynamic within this approach has shifted as the top-down system incorporates a consultation process that includes newly established civil society institutions. Nonetheless, of particular significance in Saudi Arabia is growing public awareness, particularly amongst young educated Saudis, of the need for government accountability, transparency and best-practices. 
This paper discusses the views of a group of young men who represent an academic elite. Saudi-related literature frequently centers on the status of Saudi women, but the perspective of young Saudi men is generally overlooked even though this constituency is going to be of critical importance to the Kingdom's future social and political stability. The author recognizes that this elite sample does not represent Saudi youth in its entirety, but the diversity of student backgrounds and access to their extended networks can act as a barometer of educated youth opinion regarding many of the pressing politico-economic and socio-cultural issues facing Saudi Arabia today.

T1  - Online Influence? Social Media Use, Opinion Leadership, and Political Persuasion
AN  - 2502810092
AB  - Opinion leaders can be influential in persuading their peers about news and politics, yet their potential influence has been questioned in the social media era. This study tests a theoretical model of attempts at political persuasion within social media in which highly active users (“prosumers”) consider themselves opinion leaders, which subsequently increases efforts to try and change others’ political attitudes and behaviors. Using two-wave U.S. panel survey data (W1 = 1,816; W2 = 1,024), we find prosumers believe they are highly influential in their social networks and are both directly and indirectly more likely to try to persuade others. Our results highlight one theoretical mechanism through which engaged social media users attempt to persuade others and suggest personal influence remains viable within social media.

This article discusses the circulation, impact, and permanence of digital-networked images that perpetuate nonstate hegemony and function as mechanisms for exercising power, disciplinary force, and social control reminiscent of Foucauldian theories of power-knowledge and governmentality.

T1  - 'We're Not Multicultural, but ... '
AN  - 1923057176
AB  - This article reconsiders the 2005 Cronulla riots after ten years. We begin by examining three examples of events misread ten years ago, to illustrate some key changes that have since shaped Australian racism. The first two, concern the rallying call to 'Leb and wog bashing day' at Cronulla in December 2005, and the attack there on two Bangladeshi students. These are shown to be indicative in a shift in the focus of racist Othering in Australia, from the 'Arab Other' to the 'Muslim Other', as Islamophobia becomes increasingly mainstreamed in Australian culture following the trend throughout the global West. Second, the incongruous chivalry-cum-feminism of the beachgoers who participated in the riot and were interviewed in the 2006 Four Corners television documentary, Riot and Revenge, illustrates some key features of Islamophobia as it has developed and become entrenched: such as accusing Muslims of hyperpatriarchy, and purporting to 'rescue' Muslim women while targeting them for racist vilification. We trace these and related ideological elements of Islamophobia inherent in the Cronulla riots, and show how these have unfolded in the Australian mainstream in the ten years since, becoming further enfolded into the commonsense as part of the 'new normal'.

T1  - Managing Content in Cross-Cultural Public Relations Campaigns: A Case Study of the Paris Terrorist Attacks: PROD
AN  - 1928127040
AB  - This article studies how traditional media functions have changed due the new media growth in terms of consumption and influence and how this has affected the public relations (PR) campaigns in terms of storytelling and managing content. The starting point of this article is the media coverage of the Paris attacks on the 13th November, as well as the institutional ceremonies that the French government organized as a tribute to 120 victims. The methodology of this article is based in a sample of the mainstream media in French and English language published in Europe. The analysis indicators are the following: (a) the "message," as the story based on organizational essentials, values and identity; (b) the publics in a media relations campaign: opinion leaders and opinion makers; (c) the social dimension and the agenda setting; (d) effectiveness versus excellence and vice versa; (e) role of the media: traditional media (or mainstream media) and new media; (f) trends and challenges for professionals. As we will see, new trends of communication are redirecting the media strategy in PR campaigns in terms of influencing other key publics that generates major engagement in institutional reputation. Hence, traditional media functions (setting agenda, transmitting values, and creating opinion) operate in a new digital context of mashup journalism where cross-cultural PR seeks to better align media agenda's with public and political agenda's in order to set frames of sociability and community engagement.

T1  - When School-Shooting Media Fuels a Retributive Public: An Examination of Psychological Mediators
AN  - 1873914736
AB  - Despite evidence suggesting proactive responses to youth crime are advantageous, juvenile justice relies heavily on punitive practices. This discrepancy is in part affected by public preferences for retribution, which are skewed by sensationalized media portrayals of youth crime. This experiment (N = 174) explores how youth crime media exposure translates into retributive attitudes by testing the hypothesis that media portrayals of school shootings increase retributive attitudes indirectly through either dehumanization or mortality salience. Statistical analyses suggest that dehumanization mediates the relationship between school-shooting media portrayals and retributive attitudes toward crime-involved youths. To promote support of less retributive juvenile justice policies, advocates may benefit by focusing emphasis on humanizing elements of young offenders.

T1  - Factors influencing the likelihood of choice of Gaelic-medium primary education in Scotland: results from a national public survey
AN  - 2012906762
AB  - This paper investigates the factors influencing the likelihood of choice of Gaelic-medium primary education in Scotland by means of the analysis of a national survey of public attitudes conducted in 2012. Binary logistic regression is used to investigate the association of five dimensions found in previous literature to be associated with the choice of Scottish Gaelic-medium education: (i) demographic characteristics, (ii) exposure to Gaelic, (iii) cultural and national identities, (iv) views on the future of Gaelic and (v) views on Gaelic in education. The present research found views about Gaelic in education and views on the future of Gaelic to have the greatest explanatory power in predicting likelihood of choice of Gaelic-medium education, for demographic characteristics and 'cultural and national identities' to have substantial explanatory power, and for exposure to Gaelic to have low explanatory power. The paper uses Baker's three contexts for the growth of bilingual education in Wales - bilingual education as language planning, as pedagogy and as politics - as its explanatory framework, and shows that these three contexts also underpin the potential growth of Gaelic-medium education in Scotland. Potential implications for policy and for methodological approaches to studying choice of bilingual education are presented.

T1  - Advocacy coalitions involved in California's menu labeling policy debate: Exploring coalition structure, policy beliefs, resources, and strategies
AN  - 1912585059
AB  - Advocacy coalitions often play an important role in the state health policymaking process, yet little is known about their structure, composition, and behavior. In 2008, California became the first state to enact a menu labeling law. Using the advocacy coalition framework we examine different facets of the coalitions involved in California's menu labeling policy debate. We use a qualitative research approach to identify coalition members and explore their expressed beliefs and policy arguments, resources, and strategies by analyzing legislative documents (n = 87) and newspaper articles (n = 78) produced between 1999 and 2009. Between 2003 and 2008, six menu labeling bills were introduced in the state's legislature. We found the issue received increasing media attention during this period. We identified two advocacy coalitions involved in the debate-a public health (PH) coalition and an industry coalition. State organizations acted as coalition leaders and participated for a longer duration than elected officials. The structure and composition of each coalition varied. PH coalition leadership and membership notably increased compared to the industry coalition. The PH coalition, led by nonprofit PH and health organizations, promoted a clear and consistent message around informed decision making. The industry coalition, led by a state restaurant association, responded with cost and implementation arguments. Each coalition used various resources and strategies to advance desired outcomes. PH coalition leaders were particularly effective at using resources and employing advocacy strategies, which included engaging state legislators as coalition members, using public opinion polls and information, and leveraging media resources to garner support. Policy precedence and a local policy push emerged as important policy- making strategies. Areas for future research on the state health policymaking process are discussed.

TT  - RUSSIAN INTELLIGENTSIA AND INSTITUTIONS: TRUST OR ALIENATION?
AN  - 2007968971
AB  - В статье рассмотрены особенности и структура институционального доверия гуманитарной интеллигенции; раскрыты сущность и предпосылки его возник- новения, охарактеризована структура институционального доверия, последователь- но рассмотрены элементы этой структуры. Высший уровень доверия интеллигенция демонстрирует президенту, однако доверяющие значительно отличаются по установ- кам и мотивам выражения доверия (истинные сторонники и пассивные наблюдате- ли). Декларируемое доверие к армии отражает признание ее заслуг и обеспечения безопасности государства. Проявление полного доверия к церкви свидетельствует об идентификации с ценностями и целями этой организации. Низкий уровень доверия к политическим институтам, демонстрируемый интеллигенцией, является современной международной тенденцией – распространение чувства несправедливости, отсутствие надежды на улучшение и уверенности в будущем, подрывающих доверие к государ- ству как таковому. Доверие полиции и судам на низком уровне во многом обуслов- лено распространенными предрассудками, низкой осведомленностью о деятельности этих учреждений и редкой практикой взаимодействия с ними. Доверие к телевидению и прессе среди интеллигенции весьма ограниченно, хотя телевидение остается основ- ным источником новостей; важной альтернативой ему становится Интернет. Низкий уровень институционального доверия в среде гуманитарной интеллигенции сочетает- ся с консервативными, патерналистскими установками, гражданской и политической пассивностью и свидетельствует скорее о разочаровании и отчуждении, чем о выра- жении критического настроя и активизации конструктивного потенциала недоверия.Alternate abstract:The article examines features and structure by institutional trust of the humanitarian intelligentsia. The highest level of trust is demonstrated to the President, but those two groups, who express “full” and “partial” trust, differ significantly in their motivations for trust (true supporters/passive observers). The declared trust to the army reflects recognition of its responsible function in ensuring security of the state, protecting the country, past merits. The manifestation of the full trust to the church testifies to the identification with the values and goals of this institution. A low level of trust in political institutions (excluding the President) is demonstrated by intelligentsia and it is a modern international trend, conditioned by the spread of a set of attitudes (feelings of injustice, lack of hope for improvement and confidence in the future, the desire for change), undermining confidence to the state system as a whole. The trust to the police and the court is at a low level, which can be largely due to widespread prejudices, low awareness of the activities of these institutions and rare practices of interaction with them. The declaration of trust to media (TV and the press) among the intelligentsia is not widespread. Despite the fact that television remains the main source of news, the Internet becomes an important alternative. The low level of institutional trust among the humanitarian intelligentsia is combined with paternalistic attitudes, civil and political passivity, and indicates disappointment and exclusion rather than activation of the constructive potential of mistrust.

T1  - Framing Child Sexual Abuse: A Longitudinal Content Analysis of Newspaper and Television Coverage, 2002-2012
AN  - 1870005636
AB  - The way in which the news media frame child sexual abuse can influence public perception. This content analysis of the child sexual abuse coverage of eight national news organizations in the United States from 2002 to 2012 includes the two dominant events of the Catholic Church and Pennsylvania State University child sexual abuse scandals. Census and systematic stratified sampling techniques were applied to articles obtained from the Lexis/Nexis Academic database, resulting in a sample of 503 articles. Intercoder reliability was ensured by double coding a randomly selected sample. Study findings indicate a shift in the attribution of responsibility of child sexual abuse among news organizations over the past decade from an individual-level problem with individual-level solutions to a societal-level problem with institutional culpability. Nevertheless, individual-level solutions continue to be framed as the best possible solution.

T1  - Blogging while Black, British and female: a critical study on discursive activism
AN  - 1796315046
AB  - This study explores Black British women's motivations for divulging racial and ethnic identity in the blogosphere (sometimes referred to as blogging while Black) and their use of blogs for discursive activism. It builds on previous research that gives voice to Black womens marginalized experiences through powerful counter narratives. The blogosphere is often perceived as a racially neutral space where shared interests across geographical and temporal boundaries limit the significance of racial and ethnic identity. However, the constructed narratives of Black British women in this study highlight their experiences of subtle forms of prejudice and discrimination perpetuated through dominant discourses in the mainstream media. The findings demonstrate how they use blogs as a medium for discursive activism to challenge stereotypical raced and gendered representation in the mainstream media. Much of the research on the blogosphere in Britain reflects its use by the White majority population. This study therefore extends understanding of the blogosphere and highlights alternative modes of political communication.

T1  - Women's Rights in Turkey and the European Union Accession Process: German Media Perspectives
AN  - 1843964365
AB  - The German public debate on Turkey's European Union (EU) membership revolves considerably around questions of cultural differences. One way to better understand the dynamics of this debate is to analyze German media coverage of women's rights in Turkey, a contentious issue in this debate. This article investigates how four German newspapers and magazines portray women's rights in Turkey. Contrary to earlier studies that point at biases and stereotypes in German media portrayals of Turkish women living in Germany and of Turks in general, this study finds that the media reflect the diversity of the women's rights issue, by the headscarf topic and problems of women in their families. Instead, they also cover the position of women in the wider public and the legal reforms that have taken place in Turkey since the late 1990s. Although progress is the most frequent tendency indicated in the press reports, the women's rights developments are only linked in a quarter of all reports to the EU accession process.

T1  - Social Media, Trust, and the Epistemology of Prejudice
AN  - 1816897052
AB  - Ignorance of one's privileges and prejudices is an epistemic problem. While the sources of ignorance of privilege and prejudice are increasingly understood, less clarity exists about how to remedy ignorance. In fact, the various causes of ignorance can seem so powerful, various, and mutually reinforcing that studying the epistemology of ignorance can inspire pessimism about combatting socially constructed ignorance. I argue that this pessimism is unwarranted. The testimony of members of oppressed groups can often help members of privileged groups overcome their ignorance. This paper argues that a particular type of speaker's trust-hopeful trust-can motivate hearers to become cognizant of their privilege and prejudice. I argue that hopeful trust is a powerful way of eliciting trust-responsiveness that can be an effective mechanism for challenging privilege and prejudice. To make this case, I draw on case studies of online attempts to challenge ignorance. While the problems of testimonial injustice, defensive ignorance, and the absence of privilege-cognizant role models can be barriers to challenging ignorance, I show that acts of hopeful trust can effectively overcome these barriers. Thus, hopeful trust can be a useful tool in remedying socially constructed ignorance.

T1  - Opposing the veil in the name of liberalism: popular attitudes to liberalism and Muslim veiling in the Netherlands
AN  - 1801901788
AB  - Is popular antagonism towards Muslim veils in Europe rooted in an exclusionary 'enlightenment liberalism'? By examining different conceptions of liberalism and readings of veiling in a Dutch survey from 2014, we present the first study that investigates this question empirically. We thus bring together two hitherto largely unconnected literatures. The first is the work on immigration and ethnicity, which has shown the centrality of enlightenment liberalism in anti-Muslim media and policy discourses. The second is the literature on anti-Muslim attitudes in public opinion, which explains support for veil bans as the result of perceiving veils as threatening the respondent's own, supposedly liberal, values - but has failed to distinguish between different conceptions of liberalism and thus reached inconclusive results. This, we show, can be remedied by distinguishing between 'enlightenment liberals', who hold negative attitudes, and 'reformation liberals', who hold positive attitudes towards Muslim veils.

T1  - Silent Majority: Childhood Vaccinations and Antecedents to Communicative Action
AN  - 1806575536
AB  - The topic of childhood vaccinations has received much news media attention recently, prompting scholars to examine how the public has responded. In light of this news, and the deep divide that seems to exist between parents who support childhood vaccinations and those who do not, this study examines how and why individuals may involve themselves in communication about vaccinations, particularly on social media or in other online environments. Focusing on the concept of communicative action and drawing from spiral of silence and other research, a survey of mothers (N = 455) found that those who do not support childhood vaccinations are more likely to engage in communication about the issue, including information seeking, attending, forefending, permitting, forwarding, and sharing. In addition, issue importance and affective and cognitive involvement help drive communicative action regarding childhood vaccinations, which could affect public opinion or public perceptions of the issue. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

AB  - This article offers a discourse analysis of media representations of para-athletes before, during and post the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games in print and online sources, drawing on the lens of critical disability theory. We consider the importance of the media-sport cultural complex in influencing public attitudes towards disability. We conclude that whilst the importance of discursive change cannot be underestimated at the level of the media agenda, change at the level of lived experience will only flow from carefully designed and executed political and policy initiatives rather than directly from changes in the media presentation or visibility of individual athletes.

T1  - A Tale of Many Cities: A Contemporary Historical Study of the Implementation of School Closures during the 2009 pA(H1N1) Influenza Pandemic
AN  - 1792595825
AB  - Applying qualitative historical methods, we examined the consideration and implementation of school closures as a nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) in thirty US cities during the spring 2009 wave of the pA(H1N1) influenza pandemic. We gathered and performed close textual readings of official federal, state, and municipal government documents; media coverage; and academic publications. Lastly, we conducted oral history interviews with public health and education officials in our selected cities. We found that several local health departments pursued school closure plans independent of CDC guidance, that uncertainty of action and the rapidly evolving understanding of pA(H1N1) contributed to tension and pushback from the public, that the media and public perception played a significant role in the response to school closure decisions, and that there were some notable instances of interdepartmental communication breakdown. We conclude that health departments should continue to develop and fine-tune their action plans while also working to develop better communication methods with the public, and work more closely with education officials to better understand the complexities involved in closing schools. Lastly, state and local governments should work to resolve lingering issues of legal authority for school closures in times of public health crises.

T1  - (B)Locked sites: cases of Internet use in three British prisons
AN  - 1774840829
AB  - Based on a qualitative scoping exercise in three British prisons, this article discusses digital inequalities experienced by prisoners and the potential opportunities that digital media in prisons offers for offender rehabilitation and resettlement. As they are currently denied access to online and social media that most of us take for granted, physically cut off from their communities, and unable to communicate with family and friends in ways that have become normal in society, we argue that prisoners experience profound social isolation and constitute one of the most impoverished groups in the digital age. Our results show that prisoners display high levels of both curiosity and enthusiasm as well as fear and reservation toward Internet-enabled technologies, depending on age and gender as well as the length of their sentence. On release from prison, they are not only faced with prejudice and poorer job prospects than the average citizen due to their criminal record, but their digital exclusion during incarceration may have compound effects and lead to supercharged digital and social exclusion. We argue that secure access would be highly beneficial to prisoners who pose a low risk to society, especially during the rehabilitation and release phases.

T1  - Collective Dynamics of the Spiral of Silence: The Role of Ego-Network Size
AN  - 1774576228
AB  - The spiral of silence persists as a major explanatory mechanism in public opinion research, linking individuals' perception of the opinion climate and their likelihood of speaking out. However, how locally expressed opinions (or, remaining silent) translate into global opinion distributions and the conditions affecting such generative processes have rarely been examined. Using agent-based modeling, this study attempts to explore a boundary condition affecting opinion dynamics -- the distributions of individuals' communication network size, which is affected by the widespread use of social media. The results suggest that the spiraling phenomenon on a global scale becomes more likely when enough people exist between those who have different perceptions of the opinion distribution, keeping the population from being polarized.

T1  - The impact of Islam and the public and political portrayals of Islam on child-rearing practices - Discursive analyses of parental accounts among Muslims living in Denmark
AN  - 1773275719
AB  - With the rise of Islamist terrorist attacks in the US and Europe the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices has become a matter of public attention and debate. Within the political discourse in the Western world and in the mass media, Muslims are often being portrayed negatively. Research has documented how Muslims living in the West are adversely affected by the negative portrayals of Islam associated with the War on Terror. The aim of the present study was to explore the impact of Islam on child-rearing practices and parental identity formation among self-identified Muslims in Denmark. Using a discursive approach to analyzing interviews with parents in 29 Middle Eastern refugee families, six rhetorical strategies were identified: (1) minimizing differences, (2) highlighting compatibility, (3) emphasizing positive aspects of Islam, (4) countering common prejudice, (5) actively distancing oneself from terrorists/extremists, and (6) separating Islam as a religion from cultural traditions. It is argued that the global as well as national political discourse post 9/11 is reflected in all of the six rhetorical strategies. Whether parents position themselves as having a high or low bicultural identity or a Muslim parental identity, their positioning involves drawing on the discursive resources from the mass media, the global and national political and public discourse. Furthermore, it is argued that all rhetorical strategies can be seen as attempts to counter the hurt associated with the negative portrayal of Islam.

T1  - It's The Sun Wot Won It': Evidence of media influence on political attitudes and voting from a UK quasi-natural experiment
AN  - 1770928594
AB  - Do print media significantly impact political attitudes and party identification? To examine this question, we draw on a rare quasi-natural experiment that occurred when The Sun, a right-leaning UK tabloid, shifted its support to the Labour party in 1997 and back to the Conservative party in 2010. We compared changes in party identification and political attitudes among Sun readers with non-readers and other newspaper readerships. We find that The Sun's endorsements were associated with a significant increase in readers' support for Labour in 1997, approximately 525,000 votes, and its switch back was associated with about 550,000 extra votes for the Conservatives in 2010. Although we observed changes in readers' party preference, there was no effect on underlying political preferences. The magnitude of these changes, about 2% of the popular vote, would have been unable to alter the outcome of the 1997 General Election, but may have affected the 2010 Election.

T1  - When the media meet: Problems and promises of EU–China dialogue in the journalistic sphere: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2039037463
AB  - This paper argues that lack of interpersonal interaction between media professionals in Europe and China partly accounts for continued misperceptions and gaps in understanding between both the nations. Investing into people-to-people dialogue is essential for journalists to overcome prejudice and to improve mutual knowledge. Days during which journalists are immersed into another country’s culture and media scene have great potential to induce changes in perceptions, both at the individual and societal level. This can be attributed to the built-in multiplier effect of media publications reaching wide audiences. Drawing on the “Europe-China Media Exchange ” set up, developed by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the article presents achievements (but also lessons) learnt from interpersonal exchange programs developed for European and Chinese journalists.

T1  - Pride and Prejudice: Pervasiveness of Colorism and the Animated Series Proud Family
AN  - 1784150856
AB  - Issues of race and racism continue to be subjects of interest for media critique; however, the more subtle notion of colorism is often ignored in the examination of media texts. An analysis of the popular children's animated series Proud Family demonstrates that even in a context where a "traditional" African American family and positive community relations are shown, colorism is still prominent. Rather than being critiqued or challenged, kids' media is used to reinforce colorist ideals within the African American community. Attributes of wealth, beauty, and intelligence are applied to characters with Eurocentric phenotypic characteristics while deviance, stupidity, poverty and unattractiveness typify characters with more Afrocentric facial features.

T1  - When Everyone is Laughing: The Presence, Characteristics, and Enjoyment of Disparagement Humor in Online TV
AN  - 1759350598
AB  - Two studies examine disparagement humor in online television and reasons people enjoy witnessing the comedic ridicule of other people. In Study 1, a quantitative content analysis, coders documented the prevalence and characteristics of disparagement humor in online television clips and its reception by audiences. Disparagement humor appeared in one in four video clips, often targeting physical appearance and weight. Studio audiences, other television characters, and online commenters often validated disparagement humor. Study 2, an experiment, investigated the contribution of existing prejudice and third-party audience reaction to the reported enjoyment of disparagement humor and willingness to share the insulting humor with others. Both validating audience reaction and existing prejudice positively predicted enjoyment of disparagement humor. Further, enjoyment of the disparagement humor significantly predicted participants' self-reported likelihood to share the insulting jokes with acquaintances.

T1  - "No Fracking Way!" Documentary Film, Discursive Opportunity, and Local Opposition against Hydraulic Fracturing in the United States, 2010 to 2013
AN  - 1721662550
AB  - Recent scholarship highlights the importance of public discourse for the mobilization and impact of social movements, but it neglects how cultural products may shift discourse and thereby influence mobilization and political outcomes. This study investigates how activism against hydraulic fracturing ("fracking") utilized cultural artifacts to influence public perceptions and effect change. A systematic analysis of Internet search data, social media postings, and newspaper articles allows us to identify how the documentary Gasland reshaped public discourse. We find that Gasland contributed not only to greater online searching about fracking, but also to increased social media chatter and heightened mass media coverage. Local screenings of Gasland contributed to anti-fracking mobilizations, which, in turn, affected the passage of local fracking moratoria in the Marcellus Shale states. These results have implications not only for understanding movement outcomes, but also for theory and research on media, the environment, and energy.

T1  - Framing Citizenship: Media Coverage of Anti-deportation Cases Led by Undocumented Immigrant Youth Organisations
AN  - 2076972370
AB  - Recent literature elucidates the ways in which news coverage of immigration and immigrants reflects, as well as shapes, discourse on citizenship, rights and belonging. Scholars find that undocumented immigrants are particularly vulnerable to media representations of illegality that reinforce bounded citizenship. However, more positive representations of certain groups of undocumented immigrants have emerged in recent years. This article draws upon content analysis of English-language print and online coverage of undocumented immigrants whose anti-deportation campaigns were led by national undocumented youth organisations in the USA. We find that campaigns for undocumented students were more likely to receive coverage than those of non-students. Regardless of a mention of educational status, articles included pro-immigrant quotes four times more frequently than anti-immigrant quotes. News coverage of anti-deportation cases represented citizenship in three related ways: citizenship as acculturation, citizenship as civic engagement (or 'good citizenry') and deservingness vis-à-vis victim status. We conclude that the media regularly expose the public to understandings of citizenship and membership that go beyond nationality, in ways that express empathy for particular immigrants during the enforcement (implementation) stage of the policy process. However, selective representations of citizenship may ultimately reinforce public support for restrictionist policies.

T1  - Media Effects on Support for European Integration in Old and New EU Member States
AN  - 1695229684
AB  - The study measures the strength of media effects on attitudes to EU integration. Media exposure is the independent variable; support for European integration is the dependent variable; socio-economic conditions and cognitive-cultural variables are contextual variables. The analysis covers 27 EU member states at the time of 2009 EP election. Both micro-level variables and country-level effects were taken into consideration in hierarchical linear models. Data from the PIREDEU study was used. Analyses document weak influence of media exposure on attitudes. The overall positive effect is mostly concentrated in stable democracies with well-developed media systems.

AB  - Public fascination with criminal detection has led to a plethora of images of investigational work in the media and to a radical reworking of public perceptions of the nature of the police investigator's role and of the occupation's dirty work elements. In this paper, we draw upon in-depth interviews with 31 Canadian police investigators to explore how they perceive the physically dirty elements of their job and their views related to the public treatment of those same elements as glamorous and exciting in the mass media. The investigators interviewed described how the daily realities of their work differ from the highly sanitised images presented in the media, although several noted that these portrayals led them to a career in policing. However, these investigators also explained that soon after entering the field they realised there is nothing glamorous or sexy about criminal investigation. Through a discussion of the contrasts between media portrayals of the physically dirty aspects of their jobs and police investigators' occupational realities, what is revealed is a far more complex portrait of police investigational work and what it is about this work that investigators themselves find to be exciting, satisfying and challenging.

T1  - The press in Catalonia: between the digital challenge and nation building
AN  - 1692287428; 201522263
AB  - This article discusses the challenges facing the Catalan press in a context marked by the digitization and by a political process that demands independence. The media landscape in Catalonia is populated by media produced at Spanish level and at Catalan level, and this applies to the press, radio and television. Mainstream paid-for newspapers, available to the citizens of Catalonia produced at a national, regional, local or state level, whether written in Catalan or Spanish merit discussion. This kind of press is the most influential in the shaping of Catalonian public opinion and therefore plays a central role in the political debate on independence. In this context, newspapers in Catalonia are facing the crisis of the print-only business model and falling revenues from a declining readership base and the subsequent fall of advertising revenue. To face this problem, newspaper publishers are throwing themselves into digital strategies (web, tablet, mobile phones). [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Hostile Media Perceptions, Presumed Media Influence, and Political Talk: Expanding the Corrective Action Hypothesis
AN  - 1792390708
AB  - The corrective action hypothesis predicts that hostile media perceptions and presumed media influence will be positively related to expressive political behaviors. According to this hypothesis, the presumed influence of biased media makes people attempt to "correct" perceived "wrongs" by voicing their own opinions in the public sphere. This study predicts that people with higher levels of hostile media perceptions and presumed media influence will talk politics more often and will seek out a wider array of viewpoints in political conversation. Analysis of survey data from a national representative sample of adults in Colombia largely supports these hypotheses, and also shows that presumed media influence mediates the relationship between hostile media perceptions and political talk diversity.

T1  - Gendered Islamophobia: hate crime against Muslim women
AN  - 1551000879; 201429242
AB  - Post 9/11, most western nations have seen dramatic increases in bias motivated violence against Muslims and those perceived to be Muslim. Predicated on the long-lived vilification of Muslims by the media and the state, such violence is a reactionary reminder of Muslims' outsider status. Interestingly, little attention has been paid to the particular vulnerability of women and girls to anti-Muslim hate crime. This paper begins such a dialogue. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - What Moves Public Opinion on Health Care? Individual Experiences, System Performance, and Media Framing
AN  - 1504422495; 201407538
AB  - Although Canadians generally support their health care 'model,' dissatisfaction with health care policy and demands for fundamental changes in the system often surface in public opinion surveys. We seek to explain variations in levels of dissatisfaction and demands for health care reform with a series of micro- and macro-level analyses that account for a combination of individual experiences with health care delivery, broader measures of system performance, and media framing. Empirical analyses are guided by a model of opinion on policy that distinguishes between personal and collective, and prospective and retrospective assessments. This view helps make sense of the fact that those who use the system can have generally positive experiences even as there is decreasing confidence in the system's ability to meet future needs, and increasing demand for reform. What drives these divergent perceptions? We suggest that system performance plays a role in driving the long-term trend, but media content may also be an important driver as well, particularly for collective attitudes.

T1  - The Subjective Group Dynamics of Inter- and Intragroup Criminality in the News: The Role of Prior Television News Viewing as a Moderator
AN  - 1680151028; 201514672
AB  - Participants read a crime news story featuring two perpetrators. Building on subjective group dynamics, we predicted that a perpetrator would be evaluated differently depending on the partner's ethnicity and participants' prior media use. Results show that heavy news consumers were more likely to (a) give a harsher sentence to a white perpetrator acting with a white (vs. Latino) partner, and (b) develop more negative attitudes toward Latinos when members of that group were portrayed in intergroup criminal partnerships. The implications of intergroup portrayals for perceptions of the ingroup, as well as the outgroup, and the moderating effects of news viewing on such effects, are discussed. .

T1  - Public Enemy No. 1?: Understanding Media Representations of Outlier Views on Climate Change: PROD
AN  - 1352770782
AB  - Outlier voices -- particularly those views often dubbed climate "skeptics," "denialists," or "contrarians" -- have gained prominence and traction in mass media over time through a mix of internal workings such as journalistic norms, institutional values and practices, and external political economic, cultural, and social factors. In this context, the article explores how and why these actors -- through varied interventions and actions -- garner disproportionate visibility in the public arena via mass media. It also examines how media content producers grapple with ways to represent claims makers, as well as their claims, so that they clarify rather than confuse these critical issues. To the extent that mass media misrepresent and/or gratuitously cover these outlier views, they contribute to ongoing illusory, misleading, and counterproductive debates within the public and policy communities, and poorly serve the collective public. Furthermore, working through mass media outlets, these outlier interventions demonstrate themselves to be (at times deliberately) detrimental to efforts seeking to enlarge rather than constrict the spectrum of possibility for varied forms of climate action.

T1  - Predicting Homophobic Behavior Among Heterosexual Youth: Domain General and Sexual Orientation-Specific Factors at the Individual and Contextual Level
AN  - 1285325607; 22956337
AB  - As a form of bias-based harassment, homophobic behavior remains prominent in schools. Yet, little attention has been given to factors that underlie it, aside from bullying and sexual prejudice. Thus, we examined multiple domain general (empathy, perspective-taking, classroom respect norms) and sexual orientation-specific factors (sexual orientation identity importance, number of sexual minority friends, parents' sexual minority attitudes, media messages). We documented support for a model in which these sets of factors converged to predict homophobic behavior, mediated through bullying and prejudice, among 581 students in grades 9-12 (55 % female). The structural equation model indicated that, with the exception of media messages, these additional factors predicted levels of prejudice and bullying, which in turn predicted the likelihood of students to engage in homophobic behavior. These findings highlight the importance of addressing multiple interrelated factors in efforts to reduce bullying, prejudice, and discrimination among youth.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Media coverage and public understanding of sentencing policy in relation to crimes against children
AN  - 1315600143; 201309304
AB  - This research examines how the media report on sentences given to those who commit serious crimes against children and how this impacts on public knowledge and attitudes. Three months of press and television coverage were analysed in order to establish the editorial lines that are taken in different sections of the media and how they are promoted by selective reporting of sentencing. Results indicate that a small number of very high profile crimes account for a significant proportion of reporting in this area and often, particularly in the tabloid press, important information regarding sentencing rationale is sidelined in favour of moral condemnation and criticism of the judiciary. Polling data indicate that public attitudes are highly critical of sentencing but also confused about the meaning of tariffs. The article concludes by discussing what can be done to promote a more informed public debate over penal policy in this area. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - The Coingate effect: The impact of scandal on attitudes toward, state and federal political actors
AN  - 1037878886; 201231969
AB  - What happens when a major, well publicized state-level scandal occurs? Do opinions of federal politicians improve because of relative comparisons to state politicians caught in the scandal? Do attitudes toward all politicians suffer? Little work has been done to investigate about how scandals related to one level of government affect attitudes about political actors at other levels. We investigate what happens when a major and well publicized state-level scandal occurs. Using individual-level public opinion data collected during the summer of 2006, we analyze the impact that a state-level scandal had on citizen approval of state and federal political actors, considering the mediating impact of exposure to media coverage of the scandal. Overall consumption of news coverage of state governors boosts approval of the governor relative to the president. At the same time, however, citizens exposed to negative scandalous news coverage of their governor show a decline in relative gubernatorial approval. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Looking for Cadeer: critiquing a prolonged search for a model used for mass persuasion in China
AN  - 1373427182; 201329415
AB  - This article presents findings of a narrative analysis of the lateral use of models by Chinese public opinion generators to shape the behaviours of the people. It begins with lexical, sociological and narratological explanations of the meaning of a Chinese model, before presenting a general introduction of Chinese models as a phenomenon, including the hype usually involved in their making and propagating. It then proceeds to a narrative analysis of the singular good-sounding story usually told by Chinese models. The focus of the article, though, is a narrative case study based on a prolonged search for a model named Cadeer, an ethnic Uyghur from Xinjiang Autonomous Region and on his deferred final discovery. From this, the author presents several arguments. First, Cadeer does not tell a typical good-sounding story. Second, not retelling the good-sounding story deferred his final discovery. Third, his deferred but eventual rise to modeldom is an indication of the continued obsession with the use of models for mass persuasion in China, a sign of changing times and of the changing media environment in the country, as well as a reflection of its ever-intensifying interethnic tension.

T1  - Explaining Ups and Downs in the Public's Environmental Concern in Sweden: The Effects of Ecological Modernization, the Economy, and the Media
AN  - 1905265920
AB  - In this article, the authors search for explanations to ups and downs in the Swedish public's environmental concern since the 1980s. In line with previous research, this study examines the effects of economic cycles and media coverage. In addition, the authors hypothesize that the economy will affect environmental concern less over time because of the entry of ecological modernization into elite discourse. Using time series regression analysis and a unique data set, we study Swedish public opinion during more than 20 years. Economic cycles affect the public's environmental concern but to a diminishing degree. Public environmental concern is also affected by the amount of media coverage. In accordance with earlier observations, it is concluded that both the economy and media content have an independent effect on public environmental concern. However, the previously observed conflict between economic cycles and public environmental concern is weakened, potentially because of the elite group embracement of an ecological modernization discourse.

T1  - Red State, Blue State, Flu State: Media Self-Selection and Partisan Gaps in Swine Flu Vaccinations
AN  - 1030869531; 201229708
AB  - This study assesses the relationship between political partisanship and attitudes and behavior with respect to the H1N1 virus (swine flu) crisis of 2009 in general, and the U.S. mass vaccination program in particular. I argue that even seemingly nonpartisan political issues like public health are increasingly characterized by partisan polarization in public attitudes and that such polarization is attributable, at least partly, to the breakdown of the information commons that characterized the U.S. mass media from roughly the 1950s until the early 1990s. In its place has arisen an increasingly fragmented and niche-oriented media marketplace in which individuals are better able to limit their information exposure to attitudes and opinions that reinforce, rather than challenge, their preexisting beliefs. I test my argument against a variety of data sources, including opinion surveys and state-level swine flu vaccination rate data. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Theodore Roosevelt and the Image of Presidential Activism
AN  - 1010360756
AB  - William Loeb, the White House secretary-a position that in those days encompassed the roles of chief of staff, press secretary, and several others-was also party to this hoodwinking, Tillman said; he was an "apothecary" who dispensed "pills on Panama, pills on Roosevelt, pills on railroad rates, and pills on everything pertaining to pubic affairs" ("Tillman Fiercely Attacks Roosevelt" 1906: 1).  Tillman was accusing TR of using the new mass media to arrogate power to the presidency and to turn the office from an administrative one into something akin to a monarchy. today, opponents of every president complain that the object of their animus has prevailed in the public mind through his devious manipulation of the news media-his use (or abuse) of public relations and hype, press management and rhetoric.

T1  - New Voters, New Outlook? Predispositions, Social Networks, and the Changing Politics of Gay Civil Rights
AN  - 902080268; 201122680
AB  - Objectives: This study examines the factors that shape public acceptance of homosexuality and support for same-sex marriage across age cohorts. Methods: We analyzed data from two national surveys. We constructed hierarchical logistic and hierarchical ordinary least squares regressions for relevant age cohorts in order to test our hypotheses and explore our research questions. Results: Our models suggest that personal contact has a greater impact on the attitudes of younger respondents, positively influencing public acceptance of homosexuality. Alternatively, religious and ideological predispositions have a greater impact on the attitudes of older individuals. When examining public support for gay marriage, we find that younger individuals have higher levels of deliberative engagement with the issue debate, while older individuals rely more heavily on their predispositions when determining issue stance. Interestingly, measures of media exposure are not significantly related to either public acceptance of homosexuality or support for same-sex marriage, suggesting that other factors may have a greater impact on public attitudes at this point in time. Conclusion: The implications of these findings are discussed in light of the emergence of a new political generation and the continuing struggle for gay civil rights.

T1  - Making the News: Movement Organizations, Media Attention, and the Public Agenda
AN  - 1883390440
AB  - Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.

T1  - How New Market Categories Emerge: Temporal Dynamics of Legitimacy, Identity, and Entrepreneurship in Satellite Radio, 1990-2005
AN  - 1911444747
AB  - We theorize how new market categories emerge and are legitimated through a confluence of factors internal to the category (entrepreneurial ventures) and external to the category (interested audiences). Using qualitative and quantitative analyses and multiple data sources overtime, we study the evolution of the U.S. satellite radio market over its initial sixteen years. We offer convergent evidence to show that the legitimation of a new market category precipitates shifts in the focus of market actors' attention from the category as a whole to the differentiation of firms within. This effect was demonstrated for entrepreneurial identity claims, linguistic frames, and announcements of interorganizational affiliations and endorsements, as well as in the focal attention of media and financial audiences. We synthesize these findings to offer an integrated theoretical framework on new market category emergence and legitimation.

T1  - Authoritarianism, Opacity and Proxies: The 2008 Olympic Torch Relay in the Italian Media
AN  - 925713711; 201205088
AB  - The study explores the representations enacted by Italian media around the 2008 Beijing Olympics torch relay, based on a sample of newspaper articles, television news programmes and online materials. While an explicit contrast between Olympic values and the concurrent violence due to the 2008 Tibetan crisis offered the main frame in Italian media, the study advances the hypothesis that these discourses simply gave new form to longer-standing representations about China, revolving around key notions of "opaqueness" and "authoritarianism". This "radically other" China and the Olympics (embodied in the torch) are continuously described as "incompatible", while in the process offering a number of actors (public opinion, media and industries) a rare chance for self-definition in opposition to the "other". In this sense, the Tibetan issue appears to be used as a proxy to speak about broader issues, often related to the ongoing economic competition between Italy and China.

T1  - Hearing it From Jon Stewart: The Impact of the Daily Show on Public Attentiveness to Politics
AN  - 743053625; 201032518
AB  - This study examines the impact of The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, an American political comedy show, on public attentiveness to politics. I found that watching the show was positively related to following the issues that were covered with relative frequency by the program (e.g., the Afghanistan War in 2002 and news about the presidential candidates in 2004) among politically inattentive viewers. As viewers' political attentiveness increased, however, the magnitude of the positive relationship decreased. These findings, in light of those from previous research on the show, call for further investigations of the potential effect of the program and others of its ilk on the U.S. democratic system. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Population Ratios and Prejudice: Modelling Both Contact and Threat Effects
AN  - 2076975549
AB  - Are small or large outgroup populations more closely related to an ingroup's prejudice? This paper addresses this question with national probability survey data from Germany focused on resident foreigners. Two interlocking processes underlie the complex relationship between population proportions and prejudice. Typically, larger outgroup population proportions simultaneously increase both threat and intergroup contact. The first process increases prejudice, the second decreases it. Using structural equation modelling, our analysis reveals that these two processes can be effectively combined into one complex model. Threat is perceptual; it involves what people think is the outgroup proportion and thus can be easily manipulated by political leaders and the mass media. Contact is experiential; it can reduce individual and collective threat as well as prejudice. The intricate relationship between threat and contact can be substantially altered by numerous moderators. Hence, rigid group segregation can limit contact, while unemployment can amplify threat. The paper provides evidence that reductions in prejudice have important consequences for intergroup relations.
