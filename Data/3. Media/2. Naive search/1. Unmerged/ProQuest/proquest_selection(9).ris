T1  - Demystifying Social Bots: On the Intelligence of Automated Social Media Actors
AN  - 2447803765
AB  - Recently, social bots, (semi-) automatized accounts in social media, gained global attention in the context of public opinion manipulation. Dystopian scenarios like the malicious amplification of topics, the spreading of disinformation, and the manipulation of elections through “opinion machines” created headlines around the globe. As a consequence, much research effort has been put into the classification and detection of social bots. Yet, it is still unclear how easy an average online media user can purchase social bots, which platforms they target, where they originate from, and how sophisticated these bots are. This work provides a much needed new perspective on these questions. By providing insights into the markets of social bots in the clearnet and darknet as well as an exhaustive analysis of freely available software tools for automation during the last decade, we shed light on the availability and capabilities of automated profiles in social media platforms. Our results confirm the increasing importance of social bot technology but also uncover an as yet unknown discrepancy of theoretical and practically achieved artificial intelligence in social bots: while literature reports on a high degree of intelligence for chat bots and assumes the same for social bots, the observed degree of intelligence in social bot implementations is limited. In fact, the overwhelming majority of available services and software are of supportive nature and merely provide modules of automation instead of fully fledged “intelligent” social bots.

T1  - Adolescents’ experiences and perceptions of dementia
AN  - 2421211993
AB  - Objectives: There is a lack of understanding about how adolescents perceive dementia, and what their dementia related experiences are. Without such information, it is hard to make a case for the need to raise awareness of dementia in adolescents, and the best strategies to achieve this.Methods: In a cohort of 901 adolescents (aged 13–18) from the South East of England, we explored what the experiences and perceptions of dementia were using a series of questionnaires. Descriptive data of individual items were reported, comparing differences between genders.Results: The adolescents within this study tended to have positive or neutral attitudes towards dementia, though there was evidence that a proportion of adolescents had misconceptions or held negative attitudes (e.g. 28.5% of adolescents disagreed with the statement ‘In general, I have positive attitudes about people with dementia’). We also identified that the adolescents had a range of experiences of dementia including providing some form of care for someone with dementia (23.2%), though most had indirect contact with dementia through TV and movies (77.3%), or adverts (80.2%). Females nearly always had better attitudes towards dementia and had significantly more contact with dementia.Conclusions: Considering that adolescents are already forming negative attitudes and misconceptions of dementia, it is important that we raise awareness about dementia in this age group.

T1  - Automobility and Oil Vulnerability: Unfairness as Critical to Energy Transitions
AN  - 2426921555
AB  - Climate policies in the European Union require a substantial reduction in carbon emissions from road transport. However, in the last decades the system of automobility has expanded considerably, establishing a process of path dependence that is very difficult to reverse. Changes in current patterns of automobility may increase oil vulnerability of citizens dependent on the use of the car, aggravating forms of social inequity. Based on an analysis of how television news framed a period of oil price rises in a country highly dependent on car use, the article shows that oil vulnerability may resonate with socially shared sociocultural meanings such as lack of trust in political leaders, which may aggravate the social perception of unfairness and compromise public support for energy transitions toward sustainability.

T1  - Media Framing of Larry Nassar and the USA Gymnastics Child Sex Abuse Scandal
AN  - 2405024722
AB  - The framing of child sex abuse in media has previously been examined to uncover the potential ways news media could influence public perception about the issue. This mixed methods analysis of the Larry Nassar sex abuse scandal involving USA gymnastics and Michigan State University, grounded in the principles of framing theory, examines the patterns in coverage, as well as the episodic and thematic frames evident in the coverage of the scandal and its victims. Findings fall in line with past research on child sex abuse; framing is done primarily at the episodic level, focusing on the individual responsible, detailed accounts of the abuse of the victims, and isolating the instances of abuse to the specific organizations, while ignoring the broader themes of prevention and societal impacts. Implications for framing, attitudes toward girls and women in sport, and implications for abuse in sport are discussed.

T1  - Migrant categorizations and European public opinion: diverging attitudes towards immigrants and refugees
AN  - 2400029060
AB  - In recent years, European media and public discourse have been increasingly categorising newcomers using terminology like ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’. The aim of this practice is to distinguish legitimate from illegitimate newcomers in the wake of the 2015 ‘refugee crisis’ in Europe. Drawing on data from an online survey in Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Sweden (n = 6000) in September and October of 2017, this article investigates how the use of these categories relates to public opinion on ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’. Findings show that people hold more positive attitudes towards ‘refugees’ than towards ‘immigrants’, a process which is likely driven by media framing. Attitude discrepancies within ‘immigrant’ and ‘refugee’ categories are also investigated, as categorical fetishism causes further differentiation of attitudes within these groups. Public opinion differences within ‘immigrants’ and ‘refugees’ are found along three cleavages: ethnicity, the economic situation of the origin country, and region of origin. Newcomers with the same ethnicity (vs. a different ethnicity), from ‘rich’ countries (vs. ‘poor’ countries), and from European countries (vs. non-European countries) are preferred in both categories. With these findings, this article reveals important aspects of the influence of migrant categorizations on public opinion towards vulnerable groups of newcomers.

T1  - “It’s not something I can shake”: The Effect of Racial Stereotypes, Beauty Standards, and Sexual Racism on Interracial Attraction
AN  - 2278322600
AB  - Sexual racism, a form of prejudice enacted in sexual or romantic settings, is a complex phenomenon that can interact with racial stereotypes and media representations of beauty to affect interracial attraction. Research suggests that racialized beauty standards and racial stereotypes can perpetuate broader racist tendencies in social interactions. This study aims to develop a critical understanding of how undergraduate students conceptualize the intersection of race and sexuality, and how racial identity shapes their sexual and romantic experiences. Using a qualitative methodology of survey analysis and in-depth interviews, this study examines the attitudes and behaviors of students at a large public university in California, and focuses on the thematic analysis of qualitative data obtained during eighteen student interviews. This research identifies three significant themes: (1) the impact of racial stereotypes on interracial attraction, (2) the media’s tendency to perpetuate Whiteness as a standard of beauty, and (3) the harmful consequences of sexual racism on students’ self-esteem and self-worth. Findings suggest that racial stereotypes, beauty standards, and sexual racism are prevalent among this student community and have harmful consequences for students of color, including decreased self-esteem, sexual repercussions, and internalized racism.

T1  - Introduction to Special Issue: Adolescent and Emerging Adult Development in an Age of Social Media
AN  - 2323388995
AB  - There is no shortage of public opinion-from unbridled enthusiasm to desperate hand wringing-about the impact of networked technologies on today's young people. Popular accounts typically fall into two overarching categories: general or extreme ... or both. Some paint youth with a very broad brush: Today's youth are all digital natives, born with an instinctive facility with technology. Teens are addicted to smartphones and social media, and it's hurting their development. Boys are obsessed with video games, and girls are obsessed with Instagram. Other accounts point out extreme cases: Greta Thunberg, the Swedish teen climate activist with more than 5 million Twitter followers who started the Fridays for Future youth movement and has since been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize; Kyle Giersdorf, the U.S. teen who won the inaugural Fortnite World Cup in 2019 ( and US$3 million) with more than 2 million viewers watching from around the globe. The deeply troubling, but still relatively rare, suicides attributable to online harassment. The highly visible-but again, relatively rare-youth influencers on Instagram, YouTube, and Twitter.

T1  - Dissolving into the sea: cinematic migrants and the problem of agency
AN  - 2336171133
AB  - Films about irregular migration to Europe that centre on the Mediterranean sea crossing often unwittingly strengthen the regime of migrant (in)visibility furthered by sensationalist media, which include topoi of shipwrecks, dramatic rescues, and body bags. Such films’ imagery of the Mediterranean as a metaphorical space of transformation into living death, actual death, or paradisiacal life also suggests that the identity of the migrant is indeterminable, zombie-like, even monstrous. Finally, focusing on the sea as central to the migrant journey makes invisible the broader geopolitical context, especially the continuing neocolonial relationship between the global North and the global South. My essay examines the political implications of focusing on migrant bodies in the middle of the sea, especially in sympathetic accounts which portray the Mediterranean as a gothic space where the perished yet ghostly migrants haunt Europe like revenants of its colonial past. Gianfranco Rosi’s acclaimed docudrama Fire at Sea (2016) exemplifies this approach. I analyse it in the context of similar visual representations before briefly contrasting it with Želimir Žilnik’s Logbook Serbistan (2015), which situates migrants in a broader geopolitical context and portrays them as non-idealised people with complex backgrounds, political opinions, and agency.

T1  - Media portrayal of terrorism and Muslims: a content analysis of Turkey and France
AN  - 2220517830
AB  - The media plays a crucial role in highlighting the important facts the public should know by selecting, broadcasting, and emphasizing what events the public should classify and comprehend as important and what the public should assess as a threat (Slone Journal of Conflict Resolution 44(4): 508-522, 2000, Papacharissi and de Fatima Oliveira The International Journal of Press/Politics 13(1): 52-74, 2008). This paper explores the notion that the media reinforces a false synonym between Muslims and terrorism. I begin with a description of news framing bias and how this bias impacts the portrayal of terrorism and Muslims through politically and emotionally charged discourse. Then, through a content analysis of local and national news articles, I examine selected terrorist events in France and Turkey, analyzing the U.S media’s portrayal of these events to uncover what elements journalists select, emphasize, and deemphasize in countries with predominantly Muslim and non-Muslim populations. This analysis is useful in uncovering the mechanisms allowing U.S perception of perceived threat to rise in tandem with U.S national security’s placement on the current policy agenda, while the actual risks posed by terrorism and Muslim populations are marginal in comparison and continue to decline (Powell Communication Studies 62(1): 90-112, 2011). The findings suggest that news media framing utilizes biased, negative imagery, portraying the events in these countries in a way that reinforces current prejudices against Muslims, even when Muslims are themselves the victims. This unequal reporting increases viewership while simultaneously allowing current perceptions about terrorism and Muslims to continue.

T1  - What influences media effects on public perception? A cross-national study of comparative agenda setting: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2289427588
AB  - Using a big data approach, this study explores the media agenda setting effects in 16 countries on five continents. Agenda setting effects were found to vary across the nations. Our findings provide empirical evidence that individual factors such as Age, Education, Living area, and Political ideologyand national macro variables, including Economic developmentand Media freedom, are associated with the strength of such effects. Results suggest that assessing agenda setting effects needs to be conducted in relation to the economic, political, and media context of a country. This study also proposes an alternative way to measure salience on the public agenda using Issue distance, which arguably allows for capturing the possible interaction between issue relevance to individual audiences and media cueing effects.

T1  - The Persuasive Power of Protest. How Protest wins Public Support
AN  - 2447242240
AB  - How do protest actions succeed in winning public support? In this paper, I theorize how features of protest can persuade citizens to support demonstrators. In particular, I argue that broadcasting an attractive collective identity by means of diverse, worthy, united, numerous and committed participants (dWUNC) triggers supportive reactions of observers through increasing identification with protesters. I test this argument by exposing respondents to manipulated television news items of a protest event in two video vignette experiments. Study 1 scrutinizes the effect of dWUNC displays in an asylum seeker demonstration on a sample of Belgian citizens. Study 2 replicates this design in the US for the Black Lives Matter issue of police brutality. Both studies show predispositions of citizens to strongly affect favorability towards protesters. On top of these potent receiver effects, however, also the dWUNC features prove persuasive. In both experiments, a consistent pattern of feature effects is found: demonstrations that mobilized more diverse participants, who behaved worthy and acted in unison, elicited more supportive reactions. Study 2 adds that these protest feature effects are in part mediated by increasing identification with the demonstrators. The heterogeneity of protest feature effects is explored.

T1  - The media factor influencing the effect of organ donation advocacy in South Korea
AN  - 2336248827
AB  - In this study, we investigated the influence of the media factor on the effect of and resistance to media advocacy for organ donation by conducting a web-based experiment with a 2 (media: conservative vs. progressive) by 2 (political orientation: conservative vs. progressive) factorial design with media and political orientation as between-subjects factors. The results demonstrate that organ donation intention after exposure to a message advocating organ donation was greater for conservatives in the conservative media group than for those in the progressive media group. The effect of participant–media agreement in regard to political orientation on organ donation intention was explained by perceived media credibility and psychological reactance.

T1  - Screen production on the ‘biggest set in the world’: Northern Ireland Screen and the case of <i>Game of Thrones</i>
AN  - 2296005067
AB  - The publicly funded screen development agency, Northern Ireland Screen, has been the key institutional actor in the exponential growth of the screen industries in Northern Ireland. The most prominent production to be based in Northern Ireland has been Home Box Office’s Game of Thrones, which had much of its eight seasons filmed in the region. Significant amounts of public finance have been offered to the screen industries, with direct funding provided to augment United Kingdom-wide tax breaks. However, there has been a lack of critical analysis of the recipients of this finance, on the precarious nature of many of the jobs that have been created, or on the stated benefits to the economy. This article subjects the role of Northern Ireland Screen to policy analysis to attempt to fill this scholarly gap. Setting the subject into the context of public support for film and television across the United Kingdom, it is argued that the economic argument for providing direct financial support to the screen industries needs to be viewed in the context of the overall impact on society.

T1  - Mining Social Media for Political Communication: Lessons from an Analysis of Twitter Use between Citizens and the African National Congress pre-2014 South African National Elections
AN  - 2266261998
AB  - Politweeting is becoming increasingly popular globally. It offers benefits to politicians and to citizens, especially during election periods. Twitter users in Africa are five times more likely to use the platform to voice their political views than those in the US and UK. Yet, few studies from African countries provide insight into such use. This paper attempts to provide insight into the use of the African National Congress (ANC) Twitter account by citizens and politicians in the run-up to the 2014 general elections. The Adaptive Structuration Theory is relevant to the study and netnography was applied to the study. Findings show that the platform was mostly used by citizens rather than the political party and its politicians. Citizens mostly engaged in political commentary amongst each other about party activities and officials. The political organisation mostly used it for image management for the party and its officials. If harnessed through planned design and implementation of digital communication strategies, social media has the potential to be used as effectively for mass communication, yet simultaneously enable interpersonal persuasion between participants, especially during times of elections.

T1  - Overcoming the Limits of Legal Opportunity Structures: LGBT Rights’ Divergent Paths in Costa Rica and Colombia
AN  - 2246375046
AB  - The most recent wave of democratization in Latin America, while formally including many previously excluded sectors of society into the political process, left others ineffectively represented or unable to protect their rights or advance their interests. These marginalized groups, including indigenous and displaced people, sexual and ethnic minorities, people living with chronic illness or in poverty, and prisoners, frequently found the promises of democratic governance to be largely unfulfilled. Yet one marginalized group, sexual minorities, specifically lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender people (LGBT), has made considerable strides in advancing its rights in many Latin American countries over the last two decades (Corrales 2010, 2015). Historically, even in well-functioning democracies, LGBT people were routinely discriminated against, consistently denied their constitutional rights, and often abused by state and private actors alike, which is a sharp contrast to recent adoptions of “some of the world’s most extensive policies for same-sex couples” (Piatti-Crocker 2010, 3), including the legalization of same-sex marriage (SSM) in five countries (IACHR 2015; New York Times 2014). A closer look suggests that these advances in LGBT rights can usefully be grouped into two broad categories. Many rights claims demand protections from state or private agents’ harassment, an end to anti-LGBT discrimination, and equal protection for property or welfare rights, including survivor pension benefits and partners’ health coverage. These rights and demands for protection and equality were common in many other developed countries. Their impact was limited to a relatively small group of people, they imposed low financial costs, they were achievable with minor legal or regulatory adjustments or training, and they tended to draw only a muted response from conservative and anti-LGBT groups. A second category of rights includes broader claims for SSM or adoption by same-sex couples, which directly challenged some groups’ deeply held religious beliefs or traditions and acted as a clarion call to action for conservative movements. These anti-LGBT movements, in turn, used litigation and legislative procedures to delay or block LGBT-friendly laws or the enforcement of successful judicial decisions protecting LGBT rights (see, e.g., Sáez and Moran 2016). This article argues that judicial reforms in many Latin American countries, starting in the 1980s, opened up new legal opportunity structures (LOS) that facilitated successful litigation to protect many of the rights in the first group. Yet the same LOS and strategies proved insufficient to win cases from the second group of rights, due partly to their lack of public support, the more controversial nature of those rights, their broader societal impact, and organized, effective opposition. Attempts to achieve this second group of rights through legislative arenas were generally unsuccessful, but LGBT movements’ use of more coherent, coordinated, sophisticated legal strategies or sympathetic political actors willing and able to animate new legal opportunity structures at the international level have proved more promising. This argument is illustrated by analyzing the evolution of LGBT rights protection in Costa Rica and Colombia. As existing research has established, LGBT people in both countries won many significant rights through new LOS, starting in the early 1990s (Wilson 2007, 2009, 2011; Gianella and Wilson 2016; Wilson and Gianella 2017). The article then explains how this strategy might still work to win claims for the first group of rights but has proved insufficient to win the more profound and contentious rights, which reveals a lacuna in our understanding of courts’ effectiveness in advancing marginalized populations’ fundamental rights. Thus, Costa Rica turned from an early leader in LGBT rights protection in Latin America to a laggard as it failed to legalize SSM and adoption rights in the face of a reluctant apex court and profound political and social opposition. Colombia, another early leader in LGBT rights advancement in Latin America, presented similar difficulties in achieving SSM legalization, but after lengthy political and legal battles, in which LGBT movements coalesced in an umbrella organization and worked closely with an LGBT-friendly litigation organization, LGBT groups successfully litigated same-sex marriages and adoptions, even while their demands remained very unpopular and were thwarted in legislative arenas. This article proceeds to review the role of courts in furthering social rights in general and LGBT rights in particular. It then discusses the case selection before conducting the comparative case study. It presents conclusions about how the Colombians overcame the limitations of LOS and why the second category of LGBT rights remains stalled in Costa Rica.

T1  - Re-presenting the Paralympics: (contested) philosophies, production practices and the hypervisibility of disability
AN  - 2229921702
AB  - Studies that have engaged parasport broadcasting, particularly through a narrative lens, have almost exclusively relied on textual and/or content analysis of the Paralympic Games as the source of cultural critique. We know far less about the decisions taken inside Paralympic broadcasters that have led to such representations. In this study – based on interviews with senior production and promotion staff at the United Kingdom’s Paralympic broadcaster, Channel 4 – we provide the first detailed examination of mediated parasport from this vantage point. We explore the use of promotional devices such as athletes’ backstories – the ‘Hollywood treatment’ – to both hook audiences and serve as a vehicle for achieving its social enterprise mandate to change public attitudes towards disability. In so doing, we reveal myriad tensions that coalesce around representing the Paralympics, with respect to the efforts made to balance the competing goals of key stakeholders and a stated desire to make the Paralympics both a commercial and socially progressive success.

T1  - Bullismo at School: a New Frame for Old Behaviours
AN  - 2229616383
AB  - The sensitizing concepts of Symbolic Interactionism are particularly useful to analyse and solve social problems. To understand the phenomenon of bullying we can consider it through the lens of concepts such as: definition of the situation, frame, moral panic, deviant career and so on. 'Bullismo' is, in Italian, a new word, but school aggressiveness is nothing new: behaviours which are now put into the frame of bullying were, in the past, tolerated or accepted; we can find testimonies of these attitudes in memories, autobiographies and novels. Mass media shows bullying as something new and terribly dangerous, driving public opinion towards a reaction of moral panic that amplifies it. To block deviant careers we must look at the phenomenon through rationality and not through exasperated emotions. We need better knowledge of the different definitions of the situation of the interacting parts, in order to neutralize the negative self-image of the offender and appeal, through both role-taking and behaving as looking-glasses, to the positive aspects of his/her self.

T1  - Prime and prejudice: Brief stereotypical media representations can increase prejudicial attitudes and behaviour towards people with schizophrenia
AN  - 2229167850
AB  - Prejudice against people with mental illnesses remains a significant problem in the United Kingdom and in many other countries despite sustained efforts by governments and charities. This is particularly so for people with schizophrenia, who are seen as dangerous and unpredictable. The present study investigated the effect of brief, casual, stereotypical representations on prejudice and behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia. Participants viewed Halloween costumes in an online environment under the guise of product research. In the experimental condition, they were exposed to a “Psycho Ward” Halloween outfit identical to one sold online by a leading supermarket chain in the United Kingdom. Participants in the control condition saw a neutral “pumpkin” Halloween costume. Exposure to the Psycho Ward outfit resulted in more negative behavioural intentions towards people with schizophrenia, mediated by increased prejudice. These findings confirm and extend earlier research that implicates adverse media stereotypes in the persistence of prejudice against people with mental illness. More research is warranted on the relative effects of different influences on community attitudes to mental illness.

T1  - Promoting pirate prisons: exploring the intersections of narratives, media, and criminal justice reform in East Africa
AN  - 2115921679
AB  - In March of 2011, several news media outlets published articles announcing the opening of a “pirate prison” in the northwest region of Somalia. Over the next five years, news articles about East African prisons holding piracy prisoners en masse were among the few ways in which the public came to know pirate prisons—what they look like, who they punish, and how they punish. Our analysis of the text and imagery in news articles about these prisons reveals that pirate prison narratives reflects the unique political, social, and economic issues of each location. The geographically-specific narratives are created, promoted, and in some cases silenced by different actors and entities to shape public perception of pirate prisons and motivate funding decisions. This case study aims to theorize what these pirate prison narratives tells us more broadly about the complexities underlying the promotion of criminal justice reforms in the media and the political economy of punishment in East Africa. We contend that the production and maintenance of particular pirate prison narratives helps various actors and agencies maximize benefits tied to a broader penal market where piracy prisoners are detained and transferred in exchange for development aid.

T1  - Framing ‘Friend’: Media Framing of ‘Man’s Best Friend’ and the Pattern of Police Shootings of Dogs
AN  - 2302717552
AB  - The representation and framing of events by news sources plays a critical role in the way society comes to understand a given phenomenon. For example, the use of force by police officers against civilians is covered regularly by news media outlets. Far less widely examined, however, is the excessive use of force against companion animals or pets. Thus, to understand the ways in which police use of force against animals is framed in the media, we conducted qualitative content analyses of 189 print news articles published in diverse regions of the U.S. over the course of a six-year period (2011–2016). Drawing on symbolic interactionism, analysis reveals that the media’s representation of incidents of police shootings of dogs speaks not only to the social value dogs have in society, but also to the acceptability of friendships between humans and dogs. Specifically, we argue that some dog–human relationships are more socially acceptable than others and, therefore, shootings against some dogs are perceived as less acceptable than others. Ultimately, we find that news media representation and the ways in which incidents are framed reify existent social hierarchies. This research contributes to growing bodies of literature on police violence, the shift in perspectives on animals in society, and the power of the media to affect public perception of incidents.

T1  - HPV vaccine acceptance among African-American mothers and their daughters: an inquiry grounded in culture
AN  - 2196498680
AB  - Background: Much of the research on African-Americans' HPV vaccine acceptance has largely focused on racial/ethnic differences related to cognitive, socio-economical, and structural factors that contribute to differences in HPV vaccine acceptance and completion. A growing body of literature suggest that cultural factors, such as mistrust of healthcare providers (HCPs) and the healthcare system, religion, and social norms related to appropriate sexual behaviors, also plays a prominent role in their HPV vaccine acceptance. However, these studies were limited in their use of theoretical approaches necessary to conceptualize and operationalize culture.Objective: To explore the influence of culture on African-American mothers' and daughters' HPV vaccine acceptance using the PEN-3, a culturally-centered conceptual framework.Methods: Grounded theory techniques were used to explore cultural factors that influenced the acceptance of the HPV vaccine among African-American mothers (n = 28) and their daughters (n = 34).Results: Positive attitudes towards vaccination stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine has cancer prevention benefits and that vaccinations in general protected against infectious diseases. Negative attitudes stemmed from beliefs that the HPV vaccine was too new, not effective, daughters were too young, and that vaccines were not a one-size-fits-all intervention. Majority of mothers and daughters indicated that their religious doctrine did not impede their HPV vaccination decisions. For a few mothers, religious beliefs could not be separated from their HPV vaccination decisions and ultimately deterred HPV vaccine acceptance. HCP recommendations were valued however mothers were often dissatisfied with the detail of information communicated. Support networks provided both positive and negative types of social support to mothers and daughters. The media highlighted the cancer prevention benefits of the HPV vaccine and unintentionally communicated negative information of the HPV vaccine, which deterred HPV vaccine acceptance.Conclusion: Study findings can inform the development of culturally appropriate interventions that advances the evidence on cervical cancer prevention.

T1  - Exploring national culture through international media: The publication of a viral pro-LGBT image compared against a nation’s wealth, level of religion, and democracy
AN  - 2269873726
AB  - Gay marriage is now legal in 22 countries around the world. However, homosexual acts remain punishable by death in 10 countries and are now illegal in a further 65 countries. Thus, there appears to be very clear national cultural distinctions in how local cultures consider the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people. In 2016, an image of a 12-year-old boy who stood against a sea of anti-LGBT marriage protesters in Celaya, Mexico went 'viral' around the world as an icon for LGBT rights. This research will examine newspapers from a sample of 17 countries to see where this particular pro-LGBT image was used. This research asks the question, what is the relationship between the publication of this image and a country's level of democracy, wealth and religion - socio-economic factors that have been found to be correlated to the acceptance of LGBT rights. The findings of this research could potentially suggest the presence of ideological biases at the national level in regards to how international news stories are told and also which news stories are even addressed. These factors may help to coalesce into a cultural perspective unique to each country examined

T1  - Negative Advertising Effects on Presidential Support Ratings During the 2012 Election: A Hierarchical Linear Modeling and Serial Dependency Study
AN  - 2193680929
AB  - In a literature where different research approaches generate inconsistent effects, we examine negative TV advertising effects on public support ratings of presidential candidates over time. Weekly national advertising and poll data from 2011 and 2012 were analyzed via (a) pooled time series analysis with growth curve modeling and (b) individual time serial dependency analysis with autoregressive integrated moving average. Study results support a social influence model derived from attribution theory, wherein negative TV ads did, in fact, influence poll results or public support ratings. In particular, spending on negative advertising increased the support for the sponsor of such ads. We also uncover a reciprocal effect of negative advertising between the competing candidates over time, such that spending on negative advertising attacking Mitt Romney predicted spending on advertising attacking Barack Obama in about 4 weeks at Lag 3 and Lag 4. Findings establishing the efficacy of negative advertising are discussed in the context of game theory.

T1  - Examining the effects of news coverage linking undocumented immigrants with criminality: Policy and punitive implications
AN  - 2185851746
AB  - Although research suggests that there is no meaningful real-world connection between crime rates and undocumented immigrants, media coverage of this group almost exclusively portrays them as criminals. The present two-study investigation experimentally tests the effects of exposure to crime news depicting undocumented immigrant suspects on White viewers' social judgments. To this end, assumptions from social identity theory were applied to research and theorizing on mediated intergroup threat and compound penalties for immigrant criminality. Results from Study 1 and Study 2 indicate that when White viewers are exposed to threatening crime news featuring undocumented immigrants, out-group bias emerges in the form of harsher sentencing. In Study 1, when exposed to highly threatening coverage, attitudes toward immigration and in-group identification partially mediated and moderated this relationship, respectively.

T1  - Selective Exposure on Polish Political and News Media Facebook Pages
AN  - 2248295451
AB  - Increasing numbers of citizens rely on social media to gather both political and non-political information. This fact raises questions about belief formation and belief updating in the social media setting. Using Facebook data on users' behaviour in Poland in 2017, I test the hypothesis that individuals tend to like content that confirms their beliefs. I measure the political preferences of nearly 1.4 million users who were active on the main political and news media pages and classify them as being supporters of certain political organisations or as being politically unaffiliated. Based on the principles of analytical sociology, I construct a theoretical model that may explain the results. According to the model, users tend to like posts from only one source of information. There are also statistically significant differences in the news media preferences of supporters of different political organisations. They are prone to like posts published by sources that accord with their views. The model also correctly predicts that politically unaffiliated users choose media outlets that are considered unbiased or less biased. The results support the hypothesis that users of social media prefer exclusive or near-exclusive sources of information.

T1  - Using deep-learning algorithms to derive basic characteristics of social media users: The Brexit campaign as a case study
AN  - 2171190108
AB  - A recurrent criticism concerning the use of online social media data in political science research is the lack of demographic information about social media users. By employing a face-recognition algorithm to the profile pictures of Facebook users, the paper derives two fundamental demographic characteristics (age and gender) of a sample of Facebook users who interacted with the most relevant British parties in the two weeks before the Brexit referendum of 23 June 2016. The article achieves the goals of (i) testing the precision of the algorithm, (ii) testing its validity, (iii) inferring new evidence on digital mobilisation, and (iv) tracing the path for future developments and application of the algorithm. The findings show that the algorithm is reliable and that it can be fruitfully used in political and social sciences both to confirm the validity of survey data and to obtain information from populations that are generally unavailable within traditional surveys.

T1  - Resisting dehumanization: citizen voices and acts of solidarity
AN  - 2099586905
AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the influx of asylum-seekers in Scandinavia, and in Denmark this has led to ever-tighter immigration control. This article discusses emerging practices of refugee solidarity and resistance to migration policy in Danish civil society in the wake of what has been referred to as the European refugee crisis. To accomplish this purpose, I analyse how participants in Facebook discussions construe topoi and attitudes when facing the ethical dilemma of respecting the law versus showing concern for humans in need, in line with what Foucault (1983. The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press) has referred to as 'ethical self-formation'. This is illustrated through a case study of an incident from September 2015, when a member of a Danish City Council offered private shelter to immigrants on their way to Norway. The incident led to legal proceedings in August 2016 for what the defendant referred to as 'the offense of helping fellow human beings in need'. The study is informed by Critical Discourse Analysis (Fairclough, N. (2003). Analysing Discourse. Textual analysis for social research. London and New York: Routledge; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and governmentality theory (Foucault, M. (1983). The subject and Power. In H. Dreyfus & P. Rabinow (Eds.), Michel Foucault: Beyond Structuralism and Hermeneutics (pp. 208-226). Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Foucault, M. (2007). Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977-78. (G. Burchell, Trans.). New York: Palgrave Macmillan; McIlvenny, P., Klausen, J. Z., & Lindegaard, L. B. (2016). Studies of Discourse and Governmentality. Amsterdam and Philadelphia: Benjamins). Data include media representations and facebook comments published during 2016. The analytical approach combines topos analysis (Wodak, R., & Meyer, M. (Eds.). (2010). Methods of Critical Discourse Analysis. London: Sage; Wodak, R. (2015). The politics of fear. London and New York: Sage) and appraisal analysis to tease out evaluative meaning.

T1  - Framing Muslims in the “War on Terror”: Representations of Ideological Violence by Muslim versus Non-Muslim Perpetrators in Canadian National News Media
AN  - 2124319441
AB  - This study compared representations of ideological violence by Muslim versus non-Muslim perpetrators in Canadian national news media (the Globe and Mail, National Post, and CBC). Both quantitative and qualitative disparities were examined. Acts of Muslim violence received 1.5 times more coverage, on average, than non-Muslim ones, and thwarted Muslim plots received five times more coverage. Muslim incidents were more likely to be labelled “terrorism” and linked to other episodes of violence, and Muslim perpetrators were more likely to be labelled by their religious and ethno-racial identities. These patterns in representation serve to stabilise the racial formations of the Canadian national security state in the “war on terror”.

T1  - Refugee or Migrant Crisis? Labels, Perceived Agency, and Sentiment Polarity in Online Discussions
AN  - 2313792734
AB  - In recent years, increasing attention has been dedicated to the hazardous and volatile situation in the Middle East, a crisis which has pushed many to flee their countries and seek refuge in neighboring countries or in Europe. In describing or discussing these tragic events, labels such as “European migrant crisis” and “European refugee crisis” started being widely used by the media, politicians, and the online world alike. The use of such labels has the potential to dictate the ways in which displaced people are received and perceived. With this study, we investigate label use in social media (specifically YouTube), the emergent patterns of labeling that can cause further disaffection and tension or elicit sympathy, and the sentiments associated with the different labels. Our findings suggest that migration issues are being framed not only through labels characterizing the crisis but also by their describing the individuals themselves. Using topic modeling and sentiment analysis jointly, our study offers valuable insights into the direction of public sentiment and the nature of discussions surrounding this significant societal crisis, as well as the nature of online opinion sharing. We conclude by proposing a four-dimensional model of label interpretation in relation to sentiment—that accounts for perceived agency, economic cost, permanence, and threat, and identifies threat and agency to be most impactful. This perspective reveals important influential aspects of labels and frames that may shape online public opinion and alter attitudes toward those directly affected by the crisis.

T1  - Questioning the Selective Exposure to News: Understanding the Impact of Social Networks on Political News Consumption: PROD
AN  - 2036624344
AB  - Within the current hybrid media system, in which the “old” and “new” media coexist, the role of social networks in the consumption of news has become increasingly important in recent years. Previous research has highlighted the importance and the transformational potential of user interactions in social networks in the traditional news cycle, when exchanging or discussing content related to news or public affairs, jeopardizing the traditional hegemony of the journalists and media as gatekeepers of public affairs. Our research follows a mixed methodological approach (survey plus focus groups) that reach relevant conclusions that expands the body of research about the role of news sites and social networks within the formulation of public opinion and its effects on audiences and journalism. Results showed how news sites and social networks, through links posted by friends, relatives, or acquaintances, facilitate people to access news outside their usual patterns of news consumption. Social networks, in this way, could break with the preestablished dynamics of selective exposure of individuals.

Historically, scholars have gained valuable insights into American perceptions pertaining to crime through a critical examination of American newspapers' reportage of crime. The central argument of this research is that the amount of press coverage of hate crimes isa determining factor in the formation of public perceptions, values, attitudes, and behaviors regarding hate crimes in the short run as well as in the long run. Previous studies reveal the existence of a unidirectional relationship between both news content and public opinion regarding social issues. The findings of this study suggest that the print media in the UK reports more stories of hate crimes than the print media in the US. The author concluded that the UK's more stringent laws regarding hate crimes might have contributed to the greater amount of print media coverage of hate crimes in the country.

T1  - Freedom of Speech in the Regional Media Routine
AN  - 2161642837
AB  - We can say that representatives of the media not only generate new ideas, but even construct a new worldview. They choose the direction for the general discussion, give certain meaning to events, set criteria for assessing them and conduct cultural wars. The importance of modern media cannot be overemphasized as the mass media can help to prevent not only a cultural war, but a real one as well. To investigate the situation with freedom of speech in Voronezh region from local media workers’ point of view, the Institute of Public Opinion «Qualitas» repeated research in 2015 that was previously conducted in 2004 and 1994 and interviewed Voronezh representatives of various media in different positions – from chief editors to rank–and–file journalists. The results of the research showed that there is no unambiguous assessment of the free speech – what is enough for one can be insufficient for another. Moreover, there is a request among the population for restriction of freedom of speech as it sometimes borders on permissiveness. Although the local government according to journalists remains a dominant source of freedom of speech infringement cases, a set of motives of different kinds finally form the agenda. Some journalists have never faced the situation when their material for some reason was refused to be published. «Self-censorship» is also very important during the process of preparing the material for the publication. The decision to publish material takes into account aggregate of various interests, where commercial interests and human weaknesses often play the main role.

T1  - Victims or Intruders? Framing the Migrant Crisis in Greece and Macedonia
AN  - 2057257455
AB  - Representations of immigrants in media are considered a major factor in shaping immigration attitudes. In the context of the migrant crisis in Europe, we analyze how news content about the migrant crisis is framed by media in Greece and Macedonia, two neighboring countries on the Balkan migrant route. By using framing theory as analytical framework, this study applies Benson's (2013) paradigmatic "security/threat" and "humanitarian/victim" frame dichotomy in migration coverage to the concept of issue framing. The content analysis of six print media outlets in both countries (N = 660) investigates the variety of subframes and framing devices within the scope of the two overarching frames, finding dominant portrayals of refugees as illegal trespassers, potential terrorists and social burdens in both countries. However, positive depictions of migrants are more common in Greece, which we attribute to the absence of ideological consensus and differences between the countries' political and media systems.

T1  - “Pretty Pressure” From Peers, Parents, and the Media: A Longitudinal Study of Appearance‐Based Rejection Sensitivity
AN  - 2296041931
AB  - Drawing from the tripartite sociocultural model of body image, the researchers examined whether direct messages and modeling from peers, parents, and media were concurrently and prospectively associated with appearance‐based rejection sensitivity (appearance‐RS) in young adolescents (Mage = 12.0 years). Appearance‐RS was higher among those who concurrently reported more appearance‐related teasing and pressure by peers, more parent teasing, and greater acceptance of media appearance ideals. In prospective analyses, greater increases in appearance‐RS over 1 year were found for adolescents who perceived higher levels of parental appearance‐related teasing and negative attitudes about their own appearance. Moderation analyses indicated the positive prospective association between parental negative appearance attitudes and appearance‐RS was found in younger but not older participants. Gender did not moderate associations.

T1  - The Role of Social Media as a Negotiation Sphere for ‘Public Good’: The Case North Cyprus
AN  - 1980700649
AB  - This study stems from accepting the idea that through new media technologies, a public sphere can be created where issues and policies regarding the future of a society and public good can be discussed. Within the framework of this research, the potential for social media to create more democratic and collective communication and to mould public opinion in Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is also questioned. For this purpose, in the context of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, three popular politicians’ official Facebook pages were chosen for data collection and analysis. Their activities on their official Facebook pages and public comments on their posts taken from a four month period were studied by using the Critical Discourse Analysis model. Consequently, it reflects that the political actors do not reply to the comments of citizens from their official Facebook pages, yet they share their opinions through replying the private or direct messages of citizens. This indicates a fast and dual communication between the political actors and voters via social media. Additionally, citizens assert whether they agree or disagree with the posts on such official Facebook pages, and a discussion environment is established through expressing different opinions among the citizens. Hence, ‘public good’ can be negotiated through social media and that can contribute on the formation of a public sphere.

T1  - Roma Press Center - 20 years of making a difference
AN  - 1969942565
AB  - The Roma Press Center (RPC) is the first Roma news agency in Hungary with the goal of reducing prejudice against the Roma. Their profile has been changed throughout the years, since the technological developments of the media and the political and economic changes of the country challenged their way of effectiveness. Until recently, the RPC was always about reacting to the negative stories about the Roma and balancing this image in the media. In the last 3 years, RPC changed its attitude by becoming a proactive media organisation which directly participates in shaping the public discourse about the Roma with their work. The interview with the two decisive characters of the RPC tells about this process.

T1  - The use of Facebook for information seeking, decision support, and self-organization following a significant disaster
AN  - 1917979925
AB  - The wide-spread proliferation of the Internet has revolutionized the ways that individuals obtain, interpret, and respond to information in the aftermath of disaster. An F3 tornado that impacted the community of Goderich, Ontario, on 21 August 2011 provided the opportunity to examine how people utilized Facebook and Facebook groups to seek out information, self-organize, and provide support. This mixed-methods project was conducted in two phases. First, semi-structured interviews (n = 35) were conducted with Goderich area residents on their experiences using social media after the tornado. Next, all of the publicly available posts and replies on the Goderich Ontario Tornado Victims and Support (GOTVS) Facebook group were gathered and analysed using computer-assisted content analysis. The results demonstrate that Facebook was a highly influential source of information and support, particularly in the immediate aftermath of the disaster. Although misinformation and gossip occurred, the tendency was for the group to self-moderate inaccurate information. Public engagement by local officials may further reduce misinformation and encourage public confidence. The results also show that GOTVS activity significantly declined after two weeks. This abrupt decrease in public attention suggests that the window for engagement by public officials is narrow. As such, officials should have a social media plan in place so that they may engage with the public during the critical response phase when their participation may yield the greatest benefit. Finally, this research underscores the potential for analysing Facebook content using computer-assisted content analysis, a method that may be of interest across the social sciences.

T1  - Colorblind Individualism, Color Consciousness, and the Indian Child Welfare Act: Representations of Adoptee Best Interest in Newspaper Coverage of the Baby Veronica Case
AN  - 2558485227
AB  - Transracial adoption debates revolve around adoptee best interest with support focusing on individual rights and opposition emphasizing identity. How the media portrayed the Baby Veronica case highlights tensions between colorblind individualism and collective color consciousness central to the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). Content analysis of 262 mainstream and Native American newspaper articles illustrates the complex use of both frameworks with Native American sources more often noting the importance of tribal ties and drawing from a more diverse range of authorities. Findings have implications for public attitudes regarding tribal rights, adoption and foster care policies and practices, and the future of ICWA.

T1  - War, Media, and War Journalism in Afghan Jihad
AN  - 2171641606
AB  - Abid talks about war, media, and war journalism in Afghan Jihad. War and media are intimately linked; both are waged campaigns and, as a more cynical worldview would contend, both are forms of communication. Public opinion about war is profoundly affected by how news about war is delivered. The parameters of war and the battlefield it is fought in, along with the stated goals, explicit or implicit, are shaped by media in its different forms. From organized and organizing bodies of knowledge that describe and define rules of engagement and set goals, to distinguishing between "allies" and "enemies," the duality between war and the plain that it is communicated in is of immense importance to hostile parties. The form and medium of communication (media) itself is not a mere question of technological resourcefulness but a socially and culturally sensitive process informed by contextual particularities.

T1  - Re-examining Socialization Theory: How Does Democracy Influence the Impact of Education on Anti-Foreigner Sentiment?
AN  - 1938319769
AB  - Socialization theory claims that the ability of education to reduce anti-foreigner sentiment varies cross-nationally because state authorities are not equally committed to accepting ethnic minorities: higher educated persons harbor less anti-foreigner sentiment because they spend longer in educational institutions that impose official democratic values, which forbid negative reactions toward ethnic minorities. Consequently, higher educated persons ought to diverge from the lower educated as democratic institutions progress. Analyses support these claims: the impact of education on reducing anti-foreigner sentiment is strongest in the oldest democracies, moderate among the medium-aged (e.g., South European) democracies and weakest among the youngest (East European) democracies; and higher educated persons are disproportionately influenced by the maturation of democratic institutions. Analyses utilize data from the 28-country 2008 European Social Survey.

T1  - Which factors affect the duration of hot topics on social media platforms?
AN  - 1929404634
AB  - Hot topics, as a common phenomenon on social media platform, play a major role in public opinion. This paper aims to discuss the issues about the duration of hot topics: which factors influence the duration of a hot topic on a social media platform? To answer this question, Cox regression model of survival analysis was introduced to make empirical analysis. The survey data containing 60 hot topics from 2011 to 2013 was collected from a popular social media platform of China. Besides, model verification is implemented to validate the adopted model and the calibrated parameters. As a result, this paper finds that the number of participants and opinion leaders have a significant positive influence on an incident's duration, and official response times have a significant negative impact; whereas, the number of attending media has no significant impact. Furthermore, the prediction accuracy in the validation is up to 85 %, which implies that the obtained results would be robust. The established model and the designed empirical analysis are demonstrated to be adaptable to analyze the duration of hot topics, and three factors are found to effect the duration of a hot topic based on our collected dataset. Our analytic method could also be adopted in numerous problems related to the duration issues in the field of information management.

T1  - Trump Gave Them Hope: Studying the Strangers in Their Own Land
AN  - 1933966393
AB  - This article argues that a set of recent books published in advance of the 2016 U.S. presidential election provides a road map for understanding its outcome and a research agenda for political communication scholars in the years ahead. This article focuses on sociologist Arlie Hochschild's Strangers in Their Own Land, a field study that documents the roles that identity, narratives, and emotions play in shaping the political beliefs and behavior of White Tea Party supporters. Building on these insights, through an analysis of 123 content analyses published in Political Communication between 2003-2016, we demonstrate gaps in our field and argue that scholarship can grow analytically and empirically by accounting for the findings of these books. We conclude with suggestions for future research into people's perceptions of identity, group status, deprivation, and political power, as well as the role of media, political actors, and social groups in creating these narratives of American politics.

T1  - Implementing media literacy training for social work programs at HBCUs: A literary analysis of barriers and opportunities
AN  - 1900934280
AB  - The image of the social work profession in the media is problematic for many reasons. Social work and its practitioners are often depicted as incompetent, ineffective, and unnecessary. Despite the necessity of the services provided to the public by social workers, public opinion of the profession remains low. To reverse the current trend, social work programs, particularly those at historically Black colleges and universities, can begin to provide media literacy training and media awareness within the curriculum to assist future social workers in stemming the tide of negative coverage and portrayals of the profession in the media. Using the media diffusion of information theory as an overview, this literary analysis provides a historical view of the profession and highlights current trends in social work practice, education, and media training.

T1  - Information wars: Eastern Ukraine military conflict coverage in the Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. newscasts: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1908213575
AB  - The war in Eastern Ukraine is happening on the battlefield as well as in the informational realm. The two sides of this military conflict, Russia and Ukraine, are trying to shape public opinion in their own countries as well as abroad. Depending on the leaning of a media outlet, its audiences see very different pictures of this crisis. This study examined a year's worth of coverage dealing with the Eastern Ukraine military conflict in major Russian, Ukrainian, and American newscasts. The analysis revealed significant differences in the choice of on-camera sources, reporting of civilian and military fatalities, and framing of the different sides of this conflict in these media.

T1  - Digital Trace Data in the Study of Public Opinion: An Indicator of Attention Toward Politics Rather Than Political Support
AN  - 1902320351
AB  - In this article, we examine the relationship between metrics documenting politics-related Twitter activity with election results and trends in opinion polls. Various studies have proposed the possibility of inferring public opinion based on digital trace data collected on Twitter and even the possibility to predict election results based on aggregates of mentions of political actors. Yet, a systematic attempt at a validation of Twitter as an indicator for political support is lacking. In this article, building on social science methodology, we test the validity of the relationship between various Twitter-based metrics of public attention toward politics with election results and opinion polls. All indicators tested in this article suggest caution in the attempt to infer public opinion or predict election results based on Twitter messages. In all tested metrics, indicators based on Twitter mentions of political parties differed strongly from parties' results in elections or opinion polls. This leads us to question the power of Twitter to infer levels of political support of political actors. Instead, Twitter appears to promise insights into temporal dynamics of public attention toward politics.

T1  - A multimodal discourse analytic approach to the articulation of Martini's "desire" positioning in filmic product placement
AN  - 2012907069
AB  - Product placement constitutes an amply used tactic in a marketer's Integrated Marketing Communications roster. Its merits in circumventing negative attitudes to advertising and in integrating brand values in sociocultural narratives in TV and cinematic filmic discourses have been repeatedly stressed. However, little attention has been placed thus far in the idiosyncratic mode that is scrutinized in this paper, that is product placement by leveraging uncertainty, surprise, postponement and displacement as defining characteristics of the discourse of desire. The analysis of the discourse of desire that unravels in a flirting sequence from the blockbuster movie "Hitch" demonstrates that although the concerned brand (Martini) is minimally visible in the analyzed scene, yet it attains to appropriate as part of its core DNA in "stealth" mode the above characteristics of desire by demarcating the cultural field of flirtation. The offered cultural analytic addresses this idiosyncratic product placement mode by drawing on Lacanian psychoanalysis and multimodal discourse analysis.

T1  - Elite cues, media coverage, and public concern: an integrated path analysis of public opinion on climate change, 2001-2013
AN  - 1881433270
AB  - To analyze the factors affecting US public concern about the threat of climate change between January 2002 and December 2013, data from 74 separate surveys are used to construct quarterly measures of public concern over global climate change. Five factors should account for changes in levels of concern: extreme weather events, public access to accurate scientific information, media coverage, elite cues, and movement/countermovement advocacy. Structural equation modeling indicates that elite cues, movement advocacy efforts, weather, and structural economic factors influence the level of public concern about climate change. While media coverage exerts an important influence, it is itself largely a function of elite cues and economic factors. Promulgation to the public of scientific information on climate change has no effect. Information-based science advocacy has had only a minor effect on public concern, while political mobilization by elites and advocacy groups is critical in influencing climate change concern.

T1  - Feeling the pulse of the Greek debt crisis: affect on the web of blame
AN  - 1862143791
AB  - This article examines the affective content of Greek media representations of the debt crisis, from 2009 to 2012. We analyze the content of opinion pieces from journalists, experts and public intellectuals published in Greek newspapers, and identify their affective tone towards political actors and institutions. We focus on anger, fear and hope, and identify blame attribution frames, which underpin the public's trust and confidence in domestic and European Union institutions. This article contributes to the systematic understanding of the impact of the debt crisis as a traumatic event on public opinion, and considers its implications for attitudes towards European integration.

T1  - Citizens’ attitudes towards migrant workers in Qatar
AN  - 2570341950
AB  - Public attitudes play a critical role in shaping policies towards immigration and the status of migrant workers. Facing growing pressure from international human rights organizations, media and other groups, the Gulf Cooperation Council states have begun efforts to reform the current kafala system, which prevails throughout the region. Yet despite these efforts, relatively little is known about what citizens actually think of this policy, let alone their more general attitudes towards foreign workers. In the following paper, we explore this question and focus on the case of Qatar. Recently, the Qatari government promised to reform their sponsorship system in 2015. Whether this reform succeeds will depend on public attitudes towards this new policy and how citizens perceive the role of foreign workers in the country. Drawing on data from a nationally representative survey in Qatar, we use a split sample technique to better disentangle citizens’ varying attitudes towards blue-collar and white-collar workers. The survey results suggest that Qatari citizens are ambivalent about foreign workers’ contributions and overall impact on their country. While they value foreign workers’ positive contribution to the development of their country in general, they have concerns about this population’s impact on economic and health resources. Ultimately, most citizens would prefer to maintain the sponsorship system, or kafala, as it is right now.

T1  - Longitudinal Effects of Religious Media on Opposition to Same-Sex Marriage
AN  - 1830830326
AB  - Religion and anti-gay prejudice in the United States are closely connected. Yet we still know little about the specific mechanisms through which religious subcultures may shape adherents' attitudes toward gays and lesbians. This study considers religious media consumption as a unique mechanism through which religious Americans are socialized and embedded within an anti-gay religious subculture. Drawing on panel data from the nationally-representative Portraits of American Life Study, and focusing on opposition to same-sex marriage as a measure of anti-gay prejudice, analyses show that more frequent consumption of religious radio and TV (but not internet) is associated with higher levels of opposition to same-sex marriage over time. These effects remain significant with different model specifications as well as controls for previous attitudes toward same-sex marriage, general media use, sociodemographic and religious characteristics, and intimate contact with gays and lesbians. We propose that consuming religious media over time may influence Americans' views toward LGBT issues directly through explicit messages about homosexuality and indirectly by embedding Americans within a broader religious subculture (largely, conservative Protestantism) that opposes homosexuality.

T1  - Debating LGBT Workplace Protections in the Bible Belt: Social Identities in Legislative and Media Discourse
AN  - 1794901714
AB  - This article reports a case study of the legislative and media discourse surrounding the addition of sexual orientation and gender identity language to the employment nondiscrimination ordinance of a city in the heart of the Bible Belt. The purpose of the study is to uncover how different identities were constructed and contested at city council meetings and in the news media on the way to passing legal protection for LGBT city employees in a region that is often characterized by anti-gay prejudice. This debate over the nondiscrimination ordinance centered on the question of whether LGBT identities are equivalent to identity categories based on race, gender, or religious belief, and it was shaped by various intergroup communication dynamics, specifically between members of the LGBT minority and the straight majority, between LGBT and Christian identities, and between "true" and "false" Christian identities.

T1  - The Truth Between the Lines: Conceptualization of Trust in News Media in Serbia, Macedonia, and Croatia
AN  - 1779379031
AB  - This study explored, by comparative thematic analysis, the conceptualization of trust in news media in Serbia, Macedonia, and Croatia -- three countries of Eastern Europe where past oppressive regimes might have left a heritage of distrust in all institutions. The analysis of 61 in-depth interviews showed the coexistence of three connotations of trust: trust as faith in news media as expert systems, trust in journalistic selectivity (found in all three countries), and trust as confidence in news media (found only in the Serbian sample). The analysis of the interviews also indicated a possible new dimension of journalistic selectivity and showed that, when looking for the truth in media messages, Serbians, Macedonians, and Croatians relied more on themselves than on the trustworthiness of their news media systems. The implications of these results on the measurement of trust in news media and on the relationship of Eastern Europeans toward their news media systems are discussed in light of sociological theories of trust, as well as specific historical, social, and cultural circumstances in the region.

T1  - A narrative future for Europe–China economic relations after the financial crisis
AN  - 2427491602
AB  - This article provides a detailed comparative analysis of how leading European media outlets—three elite newspapers from the United Kingdom, France, and Germany—reported economic news as it related to China from 2008, the beginning of the global financial crisis, until 2014. It illustrates the changing nature of European media perceptions of China and a growing interdependence between Europe and China after the financial crisis. Media messages directed toward domestic audiences and global stakeholders shaped public perceptions and influenced political, economic, and diplomatic narratives. In addition to a general increase in attention to news focused on China’s economy after the financial crisis, the three European newspapers also shared essentially the same news frames when they reported economic news about China. Some differences were noted, however, as the British and German newspapers focused on their domestic interests with China’s economy while the French newspaper preferred to discuss issues from the perspective of the European Union. All three newspapers were attentive to the pace of China’s rise and to the problems and obstacles of doing business in China as well as to China’s importance for Europe’s future economic development. The news narratives were dominated by a tension between hope and uncertainty.

T1  - Medicare as Reflected in Public Opinion
AN  - 1767327621; 201608069
AB  - In the 50 years since Medicare's passage, the public has been polled frequently on their opinions of the program and potential changes to it. A search of the Roper Center for Public Opinion Research archives reveals more than 6,000 individual survey questions about Medicare, asked since 1962 by academic, commercial, nonprofit, and media pollsters. Three key themes emerge: Medicare is a popular program; the public is concerned about Medicare's financial future; and, despite this concern, the public is resistant to most proposed changes, particularly to those that involve scaling back benefits. Before delving into public opinion on Medicare today, it's helpful to examine the historical context of opinion before the program was launched. The future of Medicare presents numerous challenges to policy makers as they seek to design and adapt policies that finance care for an aging population. This is particularly difficult when surveys show that Medicare remains popular among the public and that people are resistant to making major changes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Using Celebrity News Stories to Effectively Reduce Racial/Ethnic Prejudice
AN  - 1708525340; 201528947
AB  - This article argues that exposure to admirable media celebrities from racial/ethnic outgroups is an effective, proactive, and viable strategy for prejudice reduction and intergroup harmony. It uses mediated contact and exemplification theories to demonstrate that reading news stories about likable outgroup media personalities who serve as counter-stereotypic exemplars can subtly modify racial attitudes, which are malleable and context-sensitive. Specifically, results from a between-participants experiment (N = 88) show that exposure to news stories about counter-stereotypic African American media personalities as compared to stereotypical ones reduces stereotypical perceptions and symbolic racist beliefs of White Americans about African Americans. Furthermore, these favorable attitudes translate into an increased willingness to support affirmative action policies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Game Frames, Issue Frames, and Mobilization: Disentangling the Effects of Frame Exposure and Motivated News Attention on Political Cynicism and Engagement
AN  - 1792390661
AB  - This study combines a media content analysis (N = 1158) and panel survey data (N = 1612) conducted during the Swedish 2010 national election campaign, to analyze the effects of both game-framed and issue-framed news on political cynicism, institutional trust, and political interest. The findings show that news framing matters. Whereas game-framed news increases cynicism and depresses interest, issue-framed news has mobilizing effects. Furthermore, by conceptually and empirically distinguishing frame exposure from motivated news attention as two different modes of news media use, the results show that the effects of exposure to game-framed and issue-framed news are distinct from motivated news attention. These findings suggest two different mechanisms behind media effects and shine new light on the spiral of cynicism-virtuous circle controversy.

T1  - Justifiable Sensationalism: Newspapers, public opinion and official policy about commercial sex in mid-twentieth-century Britain
AN  - 1567045184; 201437506
AB  - While prostitution had been a staple of sensational reporting for decades, the explosion of newspaper exposes about vice in London in the late 1940s and the early 1950s is difficult to miss. Taking this sexual sensationalism as its starting point, this article examines the relationship between the press, public opinion and policy change around the subject of prostitution, paying particular attention to the rise in media attention in the mid-twentieth century that is understood to have helped bring the Wolfenden Committee into being in 1954. It argues that while sexual sensationalism can be read as a kind of moral panic and as a tool of moral regulation, looking closely at the narratives and function of sensationalism, as well as its reception by the police, the State and the public, complicates this story. To understand the political impacts of sensational media, we need to look at the conflicts as much as the consensus within the 'public sphere', criminal justice and politics. In the formation of policies about commercial sex, public confusion was as important as public opinion and conflict was as central as consensus. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1700675599; 201526030
AB  - If one believes polls, President Vladimir Putin enjoys tremendous approval ratings. His high standing, however, says more about the state of the political system - which steers public opinion with the help of television as well as mobilising, integrative symbols - than it does about society's attitudes. After all, society is cut off from the chance to influence politics. In a situation of political impoverishment where elective possibilities are missing and competition is nonexistent, the approval ratings of the Putin regime have a purely ceremonial, imitative character.

T1  - The Dynamics of Political Interest and News Media Consumption: A Longitudinal Perspective
AN  - 1559005447; 201432593
AB  - This longitudinal study investigates whether the impact of political interest-a key motivational factor behind news consumption-on various forms of news consumption has increased over time. The analysis is based on a unique large-scale representative annual survey conducted in Sweden over the years 1986-2010, enabling a comprehensive analysis of citizens' total and specific news consumption across multiple channels and platforms. Results show that news consumption has become more polarized between news-seekers and news-avoiders over time, and that political interest has become a more important determinant of news consumption in today's high-choice media environment.

T1  - Perceived Threat, Immigration Policy Support, and Media Coverage: Hostile Media and Presumed Influence
AN  - 1559004092; 201432595
AB  - This study, using survey data (N = 529), examined perceived immigration 'threat,' subjective knowledge, support for punitive and assimilative immigration policies, and opinions about media coverage effects. Perceived threat was not related to a third-person effect; however, perceived threat of immigrants was related to support for punitive immigration policies, and a strong 'hostile media perception' was confirmed. There was a significant belief among respondents that others would view immigration negatively, if only media were not biased in favor of immigration. Internet use, age, race, and education predicted threat perception; perceived threat, perceived favorableness of coverage, and daily newspaper reading predicted presumed influence of news coverage. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Funny, Ha-Ha: The Impact of User-Generated Political Satire on Political Attitudes
AN  - 1494749542; 201403176
AB  - The 2012 election season provided increased opportunities for the collaboration among citizens, new media, and democracy. The 'social media election' saw a rise in online user-generated political content posted to YouTube. These videos, often satirical in nature, were viewed by millions, making the potential impacts from this new form of political communication deserving of inquiry. Using experimental design, this study explored the relationship between user-generated political satire and 'normative' political attitudes. The results revealed that viewing satirical representations of political candidates did not affect individuals' level of political cynicism or political information efficacy; however, perceptions of candidate credibility and favorability were altered.

T1  - The Role of Mass Media and Secondary Groups in the Formation of Public Opinion
AN  - 1512219705; 201409398
AB  - The formation of public opinion is influenced by the media especially when they have high credibility in the eyes of the masses. The news media's major function is to shed light on public issues without adopting any particular point of view. The process of emphasizing certain issues in the media is called "agenda setting." The more emphasis an issue gets, the more important it becomes to the public. In contrast, advocacy journalism, which does take a position on issues, tends to lead public opinion towards polarization causing public opinion to split on opposite poles. Political advertising also influences public opinion, but not towards positions, but rather towards promoting politicians and it is usually done by professionals who are paid to do the job. Political advertising is similar to commercial advertising in that it tries to promote a specific product which in this case is the candidate. And, although the mass media does influence public opinion, people's opinions are not formed in a vacuum. This is where primary and especially secondary groups come into play. The group acts as an intermediary between the mass media and the audience. Groups come in different shapes and sizes from the small such as the family to the large such as labor unions. Further-more, the reasons groups form differ. Some groups form to satisfy a social identity, while others are formed based on mutual interests. The structure of groups also affects how they function. Some group members are leaders, while others are followers. Group structure sometimes leads to dysfunctional dynamics such as the phenomenon of "Groupthink". Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Social media divide: characteristics of emerging adults who do not use social network websites
AN  - 1463006365; 201346383
AB  - Public opinion has embraced social media as a vital tool to reach U.S. emerging adults, but this generation has not universally adopted social media technologies. Using in-depth interviews, this study examined the characteristics of 20 emerging adults (18 to 23 years old) who were non-adopters of social media. Compared to social media users, non-adopters had less economic stability, more fractured educational trajectories, and weaker support from parents and friends. Non-adopters did not use social media because they lacked access or leisure time, were not socialized into their use, lacked skills, or did not want to maintain social contacts via social media technologies. If social media are increasingly used in attempts to improve young people's lives, practitioners must understand who is left behind in the wake of these technologies.

T1  - Unpacking the Use of Social Media for Protest Behavior: The Roles of Information, Opinion Expression, and Activism
AN  - 1429629655; 201336644
AB  - Recent studies have shown a positive link between frequency of social media use and political participation. However, there has been no clear elaboration of how using social media translates into increased political activity. The current study examines three explanations for this relationship in the context of citizens' protest behavior: information (social media as a source for news), opinion expression (using social media to express political opinions), and activism (joining causes and finding mobilizing information through social media). To test these relationships, the study uses survey data collected in Chile in 2011, amid massive demonstrations demanding wholesale changes in education and energy policy. Findings suggest that using social media for opinion expression and activism mediates the relationship between overall social media use and protest behavior. These findings deepen our knowledge of the uses and effects of social media and provide new evidence on the role of digital platforms as facilitators of direct political action.

T1  - ICTs changing youths' political attitudes and behaviors in Bangladesh
AN  - 1364702240; 201324741
AB  - This article explains political activism among educated youths in Bangladesh and how information and communication technologies (ICTs) change their political attitudes and behaviors. The findings identify motivations and psychological factors that affect patterns of new media use in political participation. Data from 23 interviewees, alongside those of 69 focus group participants, reveal that Bangladeshi youths increasingly favor forward-looking agendas by rejecting traditional ideology-based party politics. They have a passion for shaping their opinions through social networking instead of processions, party meetings, and political violence. This study finds that youth engagement through virtual communication has no direct impact on political decision-making but may play a pivotal role in some policy-making processes in Bangladesh.

T1  - Don't ask don't tell: examining attitudes about black homosexuality and the media in an online forum
AN  - 1792349912
AB  - On 8 November 2005, a posting appeared on the BET.COM Bulletin Board under the heading Noah's Arc. It read: 'Has anyone caught the new show called Noah's Arc? It comes on a gay/lesbian channel called LOGO and the show is really good. It is about four gay men living and loving in Los Angeles ... it gives us a glimpse into a world of gay men and the struggles that they endure in life. I suggest that all of you watch it.' Using textual analysis, this study examines the responses of forum users addressing the following research question: Thematically, what attitudes and opinions emerged from the postings surrounding the question 'Has anyone caught the new show Noah's Arc?' Eight themes emerged from the postings submitted by 84 respondents as BET.COM visitors engaged in a four-month discussion about sexual orientation and identity, race, religion and spirituality. The analysis reveals that while many respondents were homophobic and heterosexist, others had a more sophisticated and enlightened understanding of sexuality, media images and stereotypes, religion, and identity politics. Results suggest that an inevitable consequence of discussions of homosexuality is a discussion of morality and religion.

T1  - Frame Spillover: Media Framing and Public Opinion of a Multifaceted LGBT Rights Agenda
AN  - 1429629321; 201337726
AB  - Between May and July 2003, a shift in how the US public viewed the legality of consensual homosexual sex occurred. While in May the largest percentage of respondents to date supported decriminalizing such activity, that percentage dropped eleven points two months later. Similar declines in support were evident in the same period over a range of gay and lesbian rights claims. The ruling in Lawrence v. Texas (2003) decriminalizing homosexual sex is the obvious intervening event. To explain this pattern, coding of print and televised news coverage of the ruling throughout 2003 was undertaken. Coverage was not overtly negative in terms of antigay rhetoric or hostility toward the judiciary; rather, the dominant media frame focused on the implications of Lawrence for an entirely separate rights issue: marriage equality. This article examines the dynamic of frame "spillover," or the idea that media focus on a distinct and not widely supported rights claim in a multifaceted rights agenda might depress support across the entire rights agenda. The findings call for further research, and they have implications for scholarship on public opinion, social movement framing, and ideational development and policy debate as studied within the broader field of American political development.

T1  - Communication About Health Disparities in the Mass Media
AN  - 1347785477; 201319841
AB  - A variety of scholars have explored the role of communication in reducing, maintaining, and even widening health disparities, but comparatively less attention has focused on the content and effects of communication about health disparities in the mass media. This article aims to summarize the current state of knowledge about these issues by identifying key outcomes and audiences for mass-mediated communication about health disparities, describing what is known about public opinion about health disparities, reviewing selected research on the content and effects of mass-mediated communication about health disparities, and identifying priorities for future research to better understand the role of communication in shaping public support and collective action to reduce health disparities.

T1  - Media Picture Politics: a Communicational Analysis of the Romanian Media Public Space
AN  - 1565694317
AB  - Our paper implies a comparative analysis of the Romanian media public space in the years 2011 and 2012, by pointing out the process, actors and themes of the communication. We inquire whether we have real communication autonomy in the public space and how public space' actors relate with journalists and politicians. We are interested in understanding how citizens and opinion leaders succeed to communicate and state their position, but also what are the themes they choose. The methodology is content analysis, with which we investigated the content of the messages within the media public space in Romania, the actors and the mechanisms of the communication. Also, our study implies a communication analysis of the public space, as it uses a content analysis method specific to public relations, communications lifecycle, developed by David Michaelson and Toni L. Griffin, in order to analyse the efficiency of the communication. Our study shows that there is a strong connection between the themes communicated by public space's actors and the topics spread out by the media. Moreover, we see that media is dominated by political messages, which have an important influence on the message content of the public space' actors, who don't seem to succeed in imposing new themes, or to generate a real debate on the issue at matter. Finally, our paper reconsiders the debate on the public space and the media public space, for a better understanding of their dynamics and communication mechanisms.

T1  - The framing of climate change in Italian politics and its impact on public opinion
AN  - 1494749173; 201402850
AB  - The article examines the issue of climate change and its importance to Italian politics. In particular, the authors analyse whether political parties and their leaders give due importance to the issues in their party literature and speeches. In order to investigate this phenomenon, the authors studied manifestos of those political parties represented in Parliament between 2008 and 2013, other official documents available on their websites and official statements of political leaders. The overall picture emerging is a substantial lack of attention paid to climate change, which is also poorly represented in the Italian media. One of the key problems, however, lies in what we define as the 'global' dimension of the climate change debate that makes it look unattractive to local political discourse (where Italian politics is traditionally rooted). We argue this impacts negatively on public opinion and the lack of Italian public policies aimed at ensuring sustainability and promoting good behaviour and environmental best practice.

T1  - Migrant melodrama and Elvira Arellano
AN  - 1073444910
AB  - This article trains a theater/performance studies lens on the struggle to control public perception of Elvira Arellano and coins the term "migrant melodrama" to describe how key media coverage, cultural production and social performance in Arellano's case recycled nineteenth-century melodramatic tropes. Elements of the nineteenth-century sub-genres known as domestic melodrama, sensation melodrama and race melodrama were recycled and deployed by both supporters and detractors of the single mother who sought sanctuary in a Chicago church together with her US-born son, and even by Arellano herself. The result was a kind of casting competition that sought to impose moral clarity and resolution on a complicated, fraught issue that in fact remains far from resolved. On the one hand, melodramatic spectacles of suffering insist on a common humanity and make ethical claims for inclusion into an imagined community that may extend across national borders. Yet on the other hand, they can also backfire by unintentionally setting the price of inclusion at an impossibly high level of virtue. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Tyranny of the Perceived Majority: Polling in the U.S. News Media Before the Invasion of Iraq
AN  - 1347781991; 201319861
AB  - Quantitative and qualitative methods are used to analyze media content about polled support for the invasion of Iraq before it took place. A tendency for journalists to emphasize data suggesting majority support rather than opposition is identified, and an associated perception of a pro-war majority is seen in letters to the editor. Analysis contrasts conceptual and methodological imprecision attending discussions of public opinion with numerical precision in survey data, arguing that a scientific reading of poll results should not be equated with public opinion. A perceived pro-war majority aligned with a pro-war political climate is explained in terms of a distinction between scientific, instrumental, and symbolic readings of polls, the mediated nature of public opinion, and symbolic power.

T1  - Monsters, playboys, virgins and whores: Rape myths in the news media's coverage of sexual violence
AN  - 1221408567; 201246325
AB  - Much of the news media's coverage of sexual violence perpetuates myths and stereotypes about rape, rapists and rape victims (Burt, 1980). This is troubling, as the news media shapes public opinion about rape (Soothill, 1991) and can affect policy-making, not to mention the running of the legal system itself (Emmers-Sommer et al., 2006: 314). The news media frequently portray rapists using monster imagery (Barnett, 2008; Mason and Monckton-Smith, 2008; Soothill et al., 1990), their victims classed either as 'virgins' attacked by these so-called 'monsters' or instead as promiscuous women who invited the rape (Benedict, 1992). These depictions can impact upon public opinion as the more frequently rape myths are used, the more accessible they become. This can be harmful to rape victims when individuals who subscribe to these myths are involved in the criminal justice system (Franiuk et al., 2008: 304-305). Through a lexical analysis of the newspaper coverage surrounding three news events gathered from three LexisNexis searches, this article assesses the use of rape myths within the British and American news media's reporting of such violence.

T1  - Unnecessary Roughness: ESPN's Construction of Hypermasculine Citizenship in the Penn State Sex Abuse Scandal
AN  - 1125219993; 201240664
AB  - This essay undertakes an analysis of ESPN's coverage of the "Penn State sex abuse scandal" during the first week following the release of the November 2011 Grand Jury presentment, which indicted former Penn State college football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky on 40 counts of criminal sexual abuse. Understanding ESPN's coverage-its particular framing of this story-is important and instructive, for it reveals how the news media shape public attitudes and opinions, pressure public officials, and model agentive citizenship in response to public traumas. Specifically, it is argued that ESPN's visual-narrative framing of the scandal perpetuates a hypermasculine (and heteronormative) fantasy of violent vigilante justice that reduces political agency to personal and private acts.

T1  - Ukrainianization, terror and famine: Coverage in Lviv's <i>Dilo</i> and the nationalist press of the 1930s
AN  - 2697556880
AB  - This article looks at the press coverage of Ukrainianization, the Soviet terror, and the famine (Holodomor), particularly in the years 1932–33, focusing on the largest Ukrainian daily outside Soviet Ukraine, the Lviv Dilo. It compares this coverage to the reporting in the press of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN). It argues that these two years were a turning point in political attitudes. Galician Ukrainians turned away from the Communist Party of Ukraine and support for the OUN began to grow. Ironically, the OUN had not led protests against the famine, but benefited from the lack of a strong response from European governments and international bodies. The article draws on a reading of the Ukrainian press of the 1930s, and on recent research by Polish and Ukrainian scholars.

T1  - Picturing obesity: Analyzing the social epidemiology of obesity conveyed through US news media images
AN  - 1023025945; 201226332
AB  - News media coverage can affect how Americans view health policy issues. While previous research has investigated the text content of news media coverage of obesity, these studies have tended to ignore the photographs and other images that accompany obesity-related news coverage. Images can convey important messages about which groups in society are more or less affected by a health problem, and, in turn, shape public understanding about the social epidemiology of that condition. In this study, we analyzed the images of overweight and obese individuals in Time and Newsweek coverage over a 25-year period (1984-2009), and compared these depictions, which we characterize as representing the "news media epidemiology" of obesity, to data describing the true national prevalence of obesity within key populations of interest over this period. Data collected included descriptive features of news stories and accompanying images, and demographic characteristics of individuals portrayed in images. Over the 25-year period, we found that news magazines increasingly depicted non-whites as overweight and obese, and showed overweight and obese individuals less often performing stereotypical behaviors. Even with increasing representation of non-whites over time, news magazines still underrepresented African Americans and Latinos. In addition, the elderly were starkly underrepresented in images of the overweight and obese compared to actual prevalence rates. Research in other policy arenas has linked media depictions of the populations affected by social problems with public support for policies to combat them. Further research is needed to understand how news media depictions can affect public stigma toward overweight and obese individuals and public support for obesity prevention efforts.

T1  - Framing the Egyptian Uprising in Arabic Language Newspapers and Social Media
AN  - 1081866269; 201236044
AB  - This study examines the framing of Egypt's January 2011 uprising in the country's state-run, independent and social media using a unique dataset of Arabic language content from newspapers and key social media posts collected during the peak of protests. Semiofficial (governmental) newspapers framed the event as "a conspiracy on the Egyptian state," warning of economic consequence and attributing blame and responsibility for the chaos on others. Social media posts used a human interest frame defining protests as "a revolution for freedom and social justice" and independent newspapers used a combination of these frames. Findings point toward the potential roles that news media will play in shaping public opinion and demonstrate why social media have wide appeal in times of political crisis.

T1  - Countering Islamophobia: Muslim participation in multifaith networks
AN  - 1660022024; 201507266
AB  - In recent years a heightened awareness of global risks has produced an unprecedented interest in global peace and security initiatives. This article discusses the impact of international crisis events on religiously diverse communities in Australia, in particular rising Islamophobia, migrantophobia and attacks on multiculturalism. Religious communities have been far from passive in their responses to the impact of these events, initiating dialogue and educational activities to dispel negative stereotypes and attitudes. In addition, state actors, including police, have prioritized engagement with religious leaders, and this has resulted in a rise of state supported multifaith peacebuilding activities. The article argues that, in response to global risks of terror and exclusion, multifaith movements and multi-actor networks, including religious leaders, state actors, educators and the media, have the potential to advance common security. In response to conflicts both local and global, these examples of cooperation between religious and non-religious actors in Australia can be instructive to other increasingly multifaith societies.

T1  - The shaping of Islam and Islamophobia in Belgium
AN  - 902079156; 201122343
AB  - The author discusses the way in which Islam has been cast as a political problem in Belgium and how Muslims have, particularly in Flanders, become framed by politicians and commentators in the media as a threat. The actual socioeconomic difficulties that Muslims (particularly those of Turkish and Moroccan descent) face are being redrawn as problems stemming from their culture and religion. State agencies are trying to shape the political organisation that will represent Belgian Muslims, as the issue of Islam is increasingly debated in terms of the 'clash of civilisations', and secularism and the Enlightenment are linked in public debate with a Christian Europe.

T1  - Assessing Public Opinion After 9/11 and Before the Iraq War
AN  - 896187972; 201120522
AB  - This study evaluates the frequency with which polls about Iraq and terrorism were fielded and reported in the media between September 11, 2001 and October 11, 2002. A content analysis of 4,481 poll questions and 4,964 references to poll-based public opinion in the media was conducted. There are strong relationships between media coverage of public opinion and the assessment of public opinion via polls. This study also examines whether the frequency with which the public was asked about Iraq and terrorism was related to the public's concern about these issues and to political elites' emphasis of these issues. Results suggest that public opinion polls do not consistently correspond with either the public salience of issues or the rhetoric of political elites. Instead, this paper argues, public opinion assessment is guided by prominent presidential speeches as well as by the priorities of the media. An analysis of how questions about Iraq and terrorism were phrased provides additional support for the influence of elites. Implications for the ability of polls to capture public opinion are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - ISLAMOPHOBIA: A PROJECTION OF THE WEST'S 'DARK SIDE'
AN  - 1448995280; 201344130
AB  - Humankind is more interconnected now than ever before. Some celebrate this shared humanity while too many others appear fixated more on their own ethnic group, nationality, or religion. In the personal view of the author, 'islamophobia' is an ungrounded fear of something/someone that does not exist in reality and which involves a psychological projection to create 'the other' as enemy. The focus of this spirited article is on the development of 'islamophobia' out of an earlier 'syndrome' of religio-political antagonism. It is seen by the author as spreading via the mass media 'like a virus'. He argues that this phenomenon is a psychological defence mechanism involving the projection of what he refers to as 'the West's dark side' onto Islam and its followers.

T1  - Introduction to Special Issue: Critical Essays on Health Care Reform
AN  - 907928769; 201125845
AB  - When the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was passed in March of 2010, it felt very monumental. The mainstream press had provided almost twenty-four-hour coverage leading up to the vote. Indeed, during the week of passage, almost half of all news coverage -- including print, online, network TV, cable TV, and radio -- was devoted to the bill. But it didn't just feel monumental; most political analysts, whether fans of the reform or not, agreed that a major political event had occurred. Many also agreed that a significant policy reform had passed, but debate quickly emerged as to whether this was a policy reform worthy of praise or derision. Indeed, as we all witnessed through the 2010 midterm campaigns and now after the elections, the debate that started before passage continued right on after its passage. Sadly, most Americans have yet to learn what is actually in the ACA. During the week of dramatic coverage, only 22 percent of media stories on the reform (again, including all sources) focused on what was actually in the bill and how the law might change the health delivery system, affect access to care, and control costs. The remainder of stories, nearly 80 percent, covered the horserace: how will the ACA ultimately be good or bad for Republicans and Democrats? I have no evidence regarding how this media coverage has impacted public opinion on the ACA, but it leads me to wonder why Americans would like a bill that evidently has more to do with politicians -- and their reelection possibilities -- than with their own ability to get affordable health care when they need it? The intent of this special issue is to provide a space both to make sense of the political craziness surrounding the bill and to understand better what is actually in the ACA.

T1  - Value Predispositions, Mass Media, and Attitudes Toward Nanotechnology: The Interplay of Public and Experts
AN  - 887499201; 201118590
AB  - This study examines the factors influencing public and experts' attitudes toward nanotechnology. Compared with the experts, the public judged nanotechnology as having greater risks and lesser benefits, and indicated less support for federal funding of nanotechnology. Experts used trust in scientists while public used religious beliefs as heuristic cues to make risk judgments. Although deference to scientific authority, science media use, and trust in scientists shaped perceived benefits in both groups, these heuristic cues influenced public perceptions to a larger extent than experts' perceptions. Experts used relatively less cues to form decision about funding support for nanotechnology as compared with the public. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]

T1  - The path to war: Exploring a second-level agenda-building analysis examining the relationship among the media, the public and the president: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1928816811
AB  - This study combines both the agenda-building and the second-level agenda approaches. It proposes an expansion of agenda-building research by examining the interaction among the president, the media and the public for an event that was not considered an existing 'real-world' condition. Specifically, this study uses former President Bush's five most prominent rationales for invading Iraq to explore the three-way reciprocal relationship among the media, the public and the president on attributes related to the pre-emptive strike on Iraq. The study found evidence of the information subsidies approach as Bush influenced media coverage of the Iraq War. The research also found more evidence of a linear model of agenda-building. The media and presidential agenda had only a limited influence on public concern about the war. Public concern influenced how much space the president devoted to the five issues on his Iraq War agenda and the press also had some limited influence on the issues stressed by the former president.

T1  - Thrown around with abandon? Popular understandings of populism as conveyed by the print media: A UK case study
AN  - 875717457; 201115595
AB  - This article examines the use of the term 'populism' in the UK print media and compares this with the scholarly usage. It assesses whether there is truth in the claim that the media uses the term too freely and imprecisely. Our finding indicate that populism is used for a wide range of seemingly unrelated actors across the world, that it is hard to find any logic in the set of policies that are associated with the term, and that populism is, more or less explicitly, regularly used in a pejorative way. Despite these findings, we refrain from labelling populism a useless term. We will, however, indicate that the inconsistent vernacular use of the term complicates a meaningful academic debate about the concept. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - (In)direct Framing Effects: The Effects of News Media Framing on Public Support for Turkish Membership in the European Union
AN  - 868009866; 201113201
AB  - News framing can exert a strong influence on public opinion. Following a media content analysis, this article investigates the effects of news framing on support for membership of Turkey in the European Union. A first experimental study (n = 304) showed a significant difference in the level of support for Turkish membership between respondents who were exposed to a positively valenced news frame and respondents who had received a negative frame. The results of a second survey-embedded experimental study (n = 1,632) corroborated the first study, and tested the hypothesis that frames affect the importance of certain considerations and that the valence of the news frames also directly affects opinion. Negative news frames yielded stronger effects than positive news frames, and high political sophisticates were more affected by positive framing. The study demonstrates that (change in) public approval of Turkish EU membership is contingent on the elites' and the media's coverage of the issue in interaction with individual characteristics.

T1  - Attacks on Indian students: the commerce of denial in Australia
AN  - 1928305719
AB  - The issue of racist violence appeared in the Australian media and politics in mid-2009 following a spate of attacks on international students in Melbourne and Sydney. The racist aspect of these attacks was downplayed, authorities describing them as 'opportunistic' and a 'regrettable fact of urban life'. The denial of racism is a familiar hallmark of contemporary racism; for some scholars, it is a defining criterion of what has been called the 'new racism'. But the denial of racism around the attacks on Indian international students also had an economic imperative. Negative media coverage within India posed a substantial threat to the AUS$18.6 billion international education export market, with potential students and sponsors becoming concerned about their security should they elect to study in Australia. Data from the Challenging Racism project provide compelling evidence on the racist context of the attacks. The Indian media and politicians maintained an outraged position on the attacks, affecting student interest in Australia. And as the substantial economic costs became clearer, Australian governments came to more openly acknowledge a racist element to the attacks, also hinting at structural issues regarding community relations and attitudes which required policy attention.

T1  - Race, Racial Resentment, Attentiveness to the News Media, and Public Opinion Toward the Jena Six
AN  - 862596171; 201109644
AB  - Objective. We outline the role of race, racial resentment, and attentiveness to news in structuring public opinion toward the prosecution of the Jena Six, the name given to six African-American high school students who beat a white student, five of whom were subsequently charged with attempted second-degree murder. Method. We rely on a telephone survey of 428 registered voters collected in the aftermath of the protests in Jena, Louisiana. Results. Public reactions were heavily filtered by race and associated with measures of racial resentment. African Americans followed news about the protests more closely, believed race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute, and believed the decision to prosecute was the wrong decision. Racially conservative white respondents were less likely to believe race was the most important consideration in the decision to prosecute and were more likely to believe that the decision to prosecute was the right decision. Consistent with theories of agenda setting and framing, attentiveness to the news influenced perceptions regarding the importance of race in the decision to prosecute but not whether the decision was the right decision. Conclusions. At least within the context of the Deep South, race and racial attitudes continue to be an important predictor of public reactions to racially charged events. Attentiveness to the news influenced the lens through which events were interpreted, but not perceptions of whether the outcome was the right decision. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An Experimental Test of the Effects of Fictional Framing on Attitudes
AN  - 862595973; 201110278
AB  - Objectives. Most studies of media effects in political communication focus on news media. A smaller body of work extends theories of news media effects to fictional entertainment media. Just as news media engage in priming and agenda setting, these studies suggest that fictional media do as well. In this study, we deal with fictional media's framing of issues. No research has sought to test the effects of framing in explicitly fictional media on political opinions. We develop the outlines of a theory we call 'fictional framing' and test it in an experiment. Methods. Participants in our treatment group watched the film Cider House Rules. The movie frames the issue of abortion in the case of incest in a pro-choice way, and frames morality in terms of following one's own conscience. Results. The film influenced opinions in ways consistent with the framing of these issues. Conclusions. Since abortion opinions and moral values tend to be entrenched, we consider this a strong first test of the effects of fictional framing. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Change of Public Opinion on US-China Relations
AN  - 887501387; 201118701
AB  - US-China relations recently have gone through ups and downs. I examine changes in public opinion that underpin the constrained relationship. In fact, public perceptions and media both in China and in the United States are increasingly critical of the relationship. Why has such a shift of opinion on the bilateral relationship occurred? What are the implications for policymaking of the change in public opinion? I seek to answer these questions by examining the way the issue of rising China affects public views and the role of mass media in shaping public perceptions of US-China relations. My argument is that the change in public opinion presents a challenge to policy-makers in both countries, since they need to promote further co-operation and accommodation not only at the intergovernmental level but also at the public level.

T1  - Public Opinion and the Press: Transnational Contexts of Early Media and Communication Studies in Prewar Japan, 1918-1937
AN  - 862597010; 201110285
AB  - As early as prewar Japan, thinkers of various intellectual proveniences had begun discussing the most important topics of contemporary media and communication studies (such as ways to define the social function of the press, journalism and the formation of public opinion). In this article, light is shed on press scholar Ono Hideo, his disciple the sociologist and propaganda researcher Koyama Eiz, Marxist philosopher Tosaka Jun and sociologist and postwar intellectual Shimizu Ikutar. Besides introducing the different approaches of these four figures, this essay also contextualizes the early discursive space of Japanese media and communication studies within international tendencies in Germany from three perspectives of transnational intellectual history (i.e. adaptations, reciprocities and parallels).

T1  - Deservingness versus values in public opinion on welfare: The automaticity of the deservingness heuristic
AN  - 835112327; 201101011
AB  - Public attitudes towards welfare policy are often explained by political values and perceptions of deservingness of welfare recipients. This article addresses how the impact of values and perceptions varies depending on the contextual information that citizens have available when forming welfare opinions. It is argued that whenever citizens face deservingness-relevant cues in public debate or the media, a psychological 'deservingness heuristic' is triggered prompting individuals spontaneously to think about welfare policy in terms of who deserves help. This is an automatic process, equally influential among the least and the most politically sophisticated. Moreover, when clear deservingness cues are present, the impact of values on opinions vanishes. These arguments are supported by data from two novel experimental studies embedded in separate nationwide opinion surveys. The findings revise conventional wisdom of how values and heuristics influence public opinion and have major implications for understanding dynamics in aggregate welfare opinion and attempts from political elites to manipulate public opinion.

T1  - Culture, Rap Music, "Bitch," and the Development of the Censorship Frame: PROD
AN  - 822923831
AB  - Drawing theoretically both from cultural studies and cultural criminology, this exploratory project suggests that negative public perceptions associated with rap music are in large part informed through both formal and informal censorship agendas and campaigns, what the author terms the censorship frame. The censorship frame consists of mass media reports that proclaim the cultural association between music and collectively shared and culturally agreed-upon perceptions of deviance. The focus of this project concerns rap music and the term bitch, a relatively recent common feature of everyday language use. This article (a) investigates the increased use and acceptance of "bitch" in popular culture; (b) examines this process in relation to the demonization of rap music; and (c) demonstrates the role of both mass media and claims-makers in shaping public opinion of rap music as deviant, even while other similar messages continue to remain virtually unchallenged throughout the popular cultural milieu. Implications for future research are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The Art of Narrating and the Question of Cultural Acknowledgment: The Case of <i>Die Kinder von Golzow</i> and a Reunified Germany
AN  - 1994216862
AB  - Some twenty years since the reunification of Germany, the cultural and interpersonal communication between eastern and western Germans remains problematic – complicated by oversimplified media representations of the GDR-past that induce an attitude of mistrust towards eastern Germans as well as making them feel unacknowledged. This paper explores the question of German integration post-1989 through an analysis of the documentary series Die Kinder von Golzow (Winfried and Winfried, 1961–2005). The aim is to show how the series, even if marginal in the public memory, offers a cultural meeting ground by narrating the recent past from the perspective of everyday-life. The paper argues that the construction of a political community is not only the result of institutional politics, but also of everyday praxis. In other words, it is necessary to distinguish between two levels of integration in the case of the reunification of Germany: on the one hand the acceptance of institutions of the Federal Republic; and on the other the exchange of historical (collective and individual) experiences, since these form the basis of a cultural and mutual acknowledgment of identity and difference among eastern and western Germans.

T1  - Media Bias, Public Opinion, and Policy Liberalism from 1956 to 2004: A Second-Level Agenda-Setting Study
AN  - 758125892; 201057982
AB  - This study aims to explore second-level agenda-setting at the national level. In particular, it examines the relationships among the citation bias of the New York Times, national level public opinion, and Congressional policies from 1956 to 2004 in order to better understand mass media's role in national policymaking. In addition, it also tests one important intervening variable of the relationships among the three attribute agendas (the media agenda, the public agenda, and the policy agenda)--the president's policy liberalism.

T1  - A Case Study of CCTV News 30 (China)
AN  - 925713760; 201205094
AB  - Based on a sample of the news report of CCTV News 30 during Beijing Olympics, this article analyses the key issues and spokesperson on four levels: frequency, framework of Olympic sports events report, public opinion and agenda. The conclusion is that Chinese television's Olympic-related reports took all factors into account in their agenda-setting: a focus on Chinese visuals, involvement in all areas -- from the sports events to the organization. While the perspectives focused mainly on the sports themselves, they gradually shifted towards the humanistic connotation of the Olympic spirit, with the report content changing from monotony to diversity and traits from simply the country's glories to a combination with the athletes' personal expressions.

T1  - Agenda Setting, Public Opinion, and the Issue of Immigration Reform
AN  - 743042786; 201027909
AB  - Objective. Agenda-setting theory is used to motivate hypotheses about how media coverage of immigration influences public perceptions of its importance. The authors seek to offer a more complete explanation of public opinion on immigration by exploring differences in the effects of immigration news in border and nonborder states. Method. This article employs content analyses of newspaper coverage of immigration and Gallup public opinion data over a 12-month period (January--December 2006). Respondents' identification of immigration as a 'Most Important Problem' is modeled as a conditional relationship between border state/nonborder state residence and media coverage, ethnic context, and individual-level demographics. Results. Media attention to immigration is greater in border states than in nonborder states; as a result, residents of border states are more likely to identify immigration as a most important problem than are residents of nonborder states. Conclusions. The analyses point to the importance of geography and news coverage in explanations of public opinion on immigration. Adapted from the source document.
