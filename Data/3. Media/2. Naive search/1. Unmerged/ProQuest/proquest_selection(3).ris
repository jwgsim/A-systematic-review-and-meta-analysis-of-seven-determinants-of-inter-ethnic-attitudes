T1  - The Influence of Media Coverage on the Negative Perception of Migrants in Chile
AN  - 2686123727
AB  - How mass media frame information about migrants is vital to further their well-being and social inclusion in the host society. However, it can also encourage forms of discrimination and xenophobia. In Chile, migration is a theme of great relevance due to a substantial increase in the flow of migrants over the last ten years, as well as the acts of extreme violence toward this group. Thus, this research analyzes how mass media coverage of migrants influences Chileans’ perception of migrants. Adopting an experimental design, we implemented a large-scale, representative online survey with citizens over 18 years of age (N = 2227) and an experiment with combined access to positive and negative news about migrants in different news outlets. The regression analysis showed differences between citizens regarding the type of daily relationships they are willing to maintain with the migrant population. Furthermore, exposure to news about migration was the primary variable that explains why people consider this phenomenon one of the main problems affecting the country, confirming the agenda-setting theory. The experiment also indicated a causal relationship between the exposure to negative content and negative judgment about this group and their presence in the country.

T1  - моциональная составляющая российской идентичности: позитивный и негативный контексты
TT  - Emotional Component of the All-Russian Identity: Positive and Negative Contexsts
AN  - 2659695300
AB  - В статье на основе концептуальных подходов теории социальной идентичности и социологии эмоций изучается эмоциональная составляющая российской идентичности. Описываются результаты анализа представленности моральных эмоций – «гордость за Россию», «вера в Россию», «стыд за Россию» – в сообщениях СМИ и медиапространстве за 2019–2020 гг. Позитивные эмоции в них широко представлены, тогда как негативная эмоция стыда, представляющая угрозу позитивной российской идентичности, не упоминается, хотя присутствует в массовых настроениях россиян. На данных всероссийских социологических опросов 2015 и 2020 гг. анализируется динамика чувств к России среди населения. Отмечается, что в структуре российской идентичности преобладают позитивные эмоции – любовь, гордость и уважение к своей стране. Возмущение, обида и стыд также вовлекаются в формирование российской идентичности, однако не носят массового характера. Наблюдается снижение уровня позитивных и повышение уровня негативных эмоций по отношению к стране в 2020 г. Выявляется взаимозависимость эмоциональной составляющей российской идентичности и ряда показателей субъективного благополучия – удовлетворенности работой, оплатой труда и жизнью в целом.Alternate abstract:The paper оffers the results of the study dedicated to the All-Russian identity on the basis of theory of social identity and sociology of emotions. It describes the analysis of the representation of moral emotions (pride, faith and shame vs Russia) in media during 2019–2020. Positive emotions were widely represented there, while negative emotion of shame posing a threat to positive All-Russian identity is not mentioned, although it is present in the public opinion of Russians. The dynamics of feelings towards Russia is analyzed basing on All-Russian sociological surveys in 2015, 2020. It is noted that the structure of All-Russian identity is dominated by positive emotions – love, pride and respect for the country. Indignation, resentment and shame are also present in the Russian identity, but they are not of a mass nature. There is a decrease in the level of positive emotions and an increase in the level of negative emotions towards the country in 2020. The article reveals an interdependence of the emotional component of All-Russian identity and some indicators of subjective well-being – satisfaction with work, wages and life in general.

T1  - The Techno-Optimists of Climate Change: Science Communication or Technowashing?
AN  - 2653020342
AB  - Although it is important to communicate scientific knowledge, it seems that this assumption is even more evident when it comes to environment-related themes, which have gained more relevance in the public sphere in the last decades. This article evaluates the spectacularization techniques of technology and science displayed as if they were the only solution to the environmental crisis. Firstly, from a literature perspective, this article shows the evolution of science communication and the relationship between society and science over the last centuries. After that, it presents a critical view on the excessive optimism around technology and scientific advancement, arguing that the possible solutions to the environmental crisis cannot come exclusively through technology substitution. The article thus shows that there is today a clear distinction between science communication and the communication of science as a mass product, which is promoted today by different stakeholders to manipulate public opinion for different reasons. Finally, the article identifies some common elements of this phenomenon that we call technowashing, insofar as it aims at a laundering of responsibilities and harmful impacts of business and political decisions.

T1  - Discourse, Immigration and the Spanish Press: Critical Analysis of the Discourse on the Ceuta and Melilla Border Incident
AN  - 2653018706
AB  - The Spanish press relayed the events that unfolded during the migratory incident that occurred in Ceuta and Melilla on 17 May 2021. Considering the media’s key role in social and ideological construction, the purpose of this article is to analyze the informative treatment that the Spanish press gave to this incident, contributing to the study of the image that is shown about the migrant population in the media. For this, the present qualitative study performed a critical analysis, using the Atlas software. Ti 8, of the discourse featuring in the newspaper publications of El País, El Mundo, La Vanguardia and ABC. The results demonstrated the following tendencies: a negative-tone discourse; the invisibility of migrant women; and a “we” vs. “them” narrative. In the light of this reality, we suggest that improvements be made, including a shift in the media’s populist discourse and a greater focus on diasporas.

T1  - How Does the Catholic Clergy Influence What Poles in the UK Know and Think about Brexit?
AN  - 2621351115
AB  - Religion can determine how people perceive socio-political reality, especially in a cultural context in which religious affiliation is an important part of national identity. This has a special significance in the Polish cultural context, in which Catholicism is considered the national religion, and its institutional dimension plays an important role in the Polish socio-political domain. The purpose of this study is to analyse how religion affects the socio-political attitudes of Poles abroad. This analysis focuses directly on evaluating the influence of the spiritual leaders of Polish community organisations in the UK on the knowledge and opinions of Brexit among Polish post-accession emigrants to the UK. The study was conducted on a sample of 620 Poles living in the UK (62.6% male) using a group-administered questionnaire. The study found that the Polish Catholic clergy did not play an important role in opinion-forming, i.e., in shaping what Polish emigrants to the UK know and think about Brexit. What proved to be the most powerful factor in terms of opinion-making was the British mass media. The influence of the Catholic clergy on the knowledge of—and opinions on—Brexit among Polish emigrants was only evident among elderly people who did not know English very well, and who regularly participated in religious activities.

Los resultados permiten relativizar el poder unilateral de las redes sociodigitales para informar o desinformar a la opinión pública, y demuestran que la familia, el ámbito doméstico y los referentes de autoridad personales y mediá-ticos no han perdido centralidad en la socializa-ción y la validación de la información política.Alternate abstract:This article presents the findings of an anthropological investigation on the practices of consumption and socialization of political in-formation, conducted in the context of the 2019 presidential election in Uruguay. The research sought to investigate the meaning of practices paying attention to the perspective of the sub-jects themselves. The results question the alle-gedly unilateral power of socio-digital networks to inform or misinform public opinion. It demons-trates that the family, household, and the perso-nal and media authority referents have not lost their central role in the socialization and valida-tion of political information.

T1  - Captain America? On the relationship between Hollywood blockbusters and American soft power
AN  - 2620226114
AB  - In 30 years, Hollywood movies have gone from making a majority of their money domestically to making a majority of their money internationally. This significant shift is underappreciated in scholarship such as International Relations research on soft power. This article argues that, counterintuitively, a growing global audience for Hollywood movies has diluted any soft power effect for the United States by globalizing their production and inducing content changes related to both setting and genre. In a globalized world, the connection between hard and soft power is more complicated than is traditionally understood.

T1  - Talk to me: towards a politics of transnational feminist solidarity
AN  - 2616475326
AB  - The 2012 gangrape of a young woman in Delhi, known as the Nirbhaya case, became an international media event that cast public spaces in India as unsafe, and situated sexual violence as a problem characterized by class difference and lack of development. This dominant media discourse reiterated long-standing neocolonial, classist and casteist tropes that signified a failure of transnational solidarity. At this time, Talk to Me, a public art intervention by the Bangalore-based feminist artist collective, Blank Noise, went viral on social media. The project took place near the Srishti School of Art, Design and Technology on a lane along which many women experience molestation and harassment. Students from Srishti engaged strangers – typically migrant and displaced men from the lower classes – in a conversation over tea and a snack. In this article, I analyse Talk to Me as an intervention that offered a counternarrative and countervisual to the dominant, fear-based characterization of public spaces in India. Talk to Me encouraged participants, through a process of dialogue and conversation, to identify and overcome their internalized biases about the lower-class, migrant men who are often constructed as sexual threats to upper-class women. These conversations, I argue, were designed to break down ingrained biases and internalized prejudice, and to attempt to create compassion and solidarity across the barriers of class, education, language, and gender. The intervention offers a model of building solidarity that is not passive or automatic, but rather requires the difficult and often uncomfortable labour of self-reflection and introspection.

T1  - Europe Abhors Donald Trump: The Opinion on the 2020 U.S. Presidential Elections and Their Candidates in the European Newspapers: PROD
AN  - 2611583365
AB  - What is the opinion held by the European press on the U.S. election campaign and the candidates running for president? What are the predominant issues that attract the attention of European print media? Does Europe detest Donald Trump? The objective of the present study is to analyze the perception European commentators had of the 2020 race for the White House. The media, the audience, and European governments were captivated more than ever before by how the U.S. election campaign unfolded, fixing their gaze on the contest between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. Through a combined quantitative and qualitative methodology, a combination of content analysis and the application of framing theory (hitherto scarcely applied to opinion pieces), our research centers on exploring the views, opinions, and analyses published in eight leading newspapers from four European countries (France, Germany, Spain, and the United Kingdom) as expressed in their editorials and opinion articles. This study observes how the televised presidential debates were commented on, interpreted, and assessed by commentators from the eight newspapers we selected. The goal was to identify the common issues and frames that affected European public opinion on the U.S. presidential campaign and the aspirants to the White House.

T1  - Language, Discrimination and Employability: Employers’ Othering and Racist Representations of Domestic Migrant Workers on Social Media
AN  - 2608408624
AB  - Discursive othering deals with the many ways in which language is used to express prejudice against minorities, and it outlines the processes and conditions that promote group-based inequality and marginalization. This article focuses on online othering, and it analyzes a corpus of 615 comments posted by Hong Kong employers of domestic migrant workers (DMWs) on social media. First, a quantitative analysis of the corpus outlines the content categories found in the posts, and second, a discourse analysis of representative excerpts illustrates the claims made about DMWs. Employers engage in othering of their helpers, and the analysis shows how demeaning racist comments function to publicly shame them and warn others not to employ them. The article uses Language and Social Psychology frameworks to analyze the posts, and it discusses the functions of using racist derogatory language. The paper concludes by discussing how research may be used to address pressing social issues.

T1  - Into the Cold: Neighborliness, Class, and the Emotional Landscape of Urban Modernism in France and West Germany
AN  - 2596364811
AB  - In France and West Germany, public opinion on modernist mass housing switched from positive to negative over a short period of time. The following article explores and compares this disenchantment with urban modernism in both countries. Analyzing TV documentaries, press reports, and sociological studies, as well as inhabitants’ reactions to them, it traces the discursive production of modern high-rise estates as arenas of social and emotional malfunction. It investigates how contemporaries came to contrast the apparent desolation of modernist high-rises on the periphery of French and West German cities with the warmth and solidarity of traditional working-class neighborhoods. Tracing the genesis of this socio-emotional framing, the article foregrounds the influence of psychological discourses and a new left-wing activism on contemporary urbanism and highlights the local repercussions of modern housing’s public denigration in France and West Germany.

T1  - “According to the Polls…” Opinion Poll Coverage in Network Evening News during the 2020 U.S. Election Campaign
AN  - 2617957984
AB  - After news media and pollsters were unsuccessful in predicting recent political outcomes such as the 2016 U.S. election, opinion polls came under scrutiny. Journalists were accused of not providing audiences the tools to correctly interpret poll information. Using a content analysis of all evening news items from CBS, ABC, and NBC from the final two months before the 2020 U.S. general election, we analyzed the quality of poll coverage. We find that half of the references to election polls are “diffuse,” in which journalists refer to “the polls” in a general manner. When news items do cover specific poll results, media often disclose the absolute minimal essential information (e.g., population and error margin), but fail to provide additional methodological details.

T1  - Visual Portrayals of People in Need: The Impact of Refugee Depictions, Compassion, and Support for Humanitarian Aid
AN  - 2617957676
AB  - As conflicts flare around the world, images of refugees have become a familiar presence in Western media. Drawing on existing accounts of visual influence, this analysis explores how (un)sympathetic refugee portrayals in news accounts affect distant viewers’ compassion responses and refugee policy attitudes. The study reports the results of three survey experiments, in Sweden, the United States, and the UK, involving 25 unique images and over 4,500 combined respondents. Building on previous work on Moral Foundations Theory, we find the manifest vulnerability of depicted refugees to be an important influence on how visual portrayals evoke sympathy and impact conservatives’ (but not liberals’) compassion responses. Once activated, compassion is found to mediate the effect of refugee portrayals on right-wing support for refugee aid.

T1  - The politics of identity: The unexpected role of political orientation on racial categorizations of Kamala Harris
AN  - 2614034742
AB  - The 2020 US Presidential election was historic in that it featured the first woman of color, Kamala Harris, on a major‐party ticket. Although Harris identifies as Black, her racial identity was widely scrutinized throughout the election, due to her mixed‐race ancestry. Moreover, media coverage of Harris's racial identity appeared to vary based on that news outlet's political leaning and sometimes had prejudicial undertones. The current research investigated racial categorization of Harris and the role that political orientation and anti‐Black prejudice might play in shaping these categorizations. Studies 1 and 2 tested the possibility that conservatives and liberals might mentally represent Harris differently, which we hypothesized would lead the two groups to differ in how they categorized her race. Contrary to our prediction, conservatives, and liberals mentally represented Harris similarly. Also surprising were the explicit racial categorization data. Conservatives labeled Harris as White more than liberals, who tended to categorize Harris as multiracial. This pattern was explained by anti‐Black prejudice. Study 3 examined a potential political motivation that might explain this finding. We found that conservatives, more than liberals, judge having a non‐White candidate on a Democratic ballot as an asset, which may lead conservatives to deny non‐White candidates these identities.

T1  - “Is It the Message or the Messenger?”: Conspiracy Endorsement and Media Sources
AN  - 2607602848
AB  - Public opinion literature on conspiracy theories mainly focuses on individual and contextual factors predicting people’s beliefs in conspiratorial news. However, little research to date has considered the role of the source of the news, and its interaction with the news content, in explaining people’s receptivity to those narratives. By employing a survey experiment on a sample of U.S. citizens, we test whether the conspiratorial/debunking content of a news and the type of media outlet publishing it (mainstream/independent) affect people’s perceptions of the news plausibility. Respondents are asked to evaluate the plausibility of a news headline supporting or debunking a well-known conspiracy theory (chemtrails), attributed to a mainstream media outlet or an independent blog. Results show that (1) conspiracy believers are more likely to believe in the conspiratorial account than in the debunking account and (2) the effect is stronger when the news comes from an independent source rather than a mainstream one.

T1  - Silencing by Not Telling: Testimonial Void as a New Kind of Testimonial Injustice
AN  - 2580196552
AB  - In this paper, I characterize a new kind of testimonial injustice (TI), a phenomenon I call ‘testimonial void’ (TV), which involves a substantial extension of the limits of the original concept put forward by Miranda Fricker. TV occurs when a speaker withholds epistemic materials on the basis of an epistemically and ethically faulty assumption that a hearer-to-be lacks the capacity to do anything epistemically relevant with them. As in testimonial smothering (TS), testimony is not proffered owing to an anticipated failure of uptake. However, unlike in cases of TS, the anticipated failure of uptake in TV is due to prejudice on the speaker’s part. By comparing TV with other forms of TI, I show that TV shares TI’s conceptual structure and harms. I argue that TV: a) shows the speaker to be a potential wrongdoer, b) reveals that TI cannot be equated with biased credibility assessments, c) entails both an indirect yet extreme form of silencing and d) the failure to extend a kind of epistemic trust implied by the enjoyment of epistemic relational equality. In addition, I explore intricate cases in which TV interacts with TS, identifying smothered instances of TV, as well as non-culpable cases of TV.

T1  - Organised interests in the media and policy congruence: The contingent impact of the status quo
AN  - 2578952745
AB  - While a multitude of studies have investigated the link between opinion and policy, we have little knowledge of how and when organised interests affect this linkage. We argue that the alignment of organised interests affects opinion–policy congruence by influencing the weight decision‐makers attach to citizen preferences. Moreover, we propose that alignment between majorities of groups and the public matters the most when status quo bias must be overcome for the public to obtain its preferred policy. We test our theoretical claims drawing on a comprehensive media content analysis of 160 policy issues in Germany and Denmark. Our results present a more sceptical picture of the ability of groups to suppress the opinion–policy linkage than the one frequently presented in the academic literature and public debate. We find that the capacity of groups to affect whether policy is congruent with the majority of the public is restricted to situations where the public supports a change in the status quo. In these cases, policy is less likely to end up reflecting public opinion if the majority of interest groups do not support the public position. In cases where the public is supportive of the policy status quo, the position of interest groups does not affect the likelihood that policy will eventually reflect the preferred position of the public. Our findings expand existing knowledge of organised interests in the study of policy representation and have important implications for understanding democratic governance.

T1  - Candidate Advertisements and Afro-Brazilian Political Marginalization
AN  - 2643280790
AB  - A televisao é uma importante ferramenta política na América Latina. Reconhecendo sua habilidade em conformar uma opiniao pública e influenciar o comportamento político, a lei eleitoral brasileira concede tempo gratuito de TV para que os partidos políticos possam apresentar suas campanhas nas semanas anteriores ao período eleitoral. Enquanto o horario político eleitoral gratuito busca nivelar a competiçao entre esses partidos, ele expressa também as desigualdades internas a eles na distribuiçao do tempo de TV dentre seus candidatos. Nosso argumento neste artigo é que vieses raciais influenciam o modo como os dirigentes partidários distribuem o tempo de televisao gratuito e, assim, contribuem para a marginalizaçao política das candidaturas afro-brasileiras (pardas e pretas). Utilizando dados inéditos das eleiçoes municipais de 2012 no municipio do Rio de Janeiro, mostramos que dirigentes partidários distribuem menos tempo de televisao para candidatos afro-brasileiros do que para seus pares brancos, mesmo quando controlamos outras de suas características. Mais importante ainda, nós encontramos diferenças no modo como os candidatos utilizam o tempo de campanha que recebem. Candidatos afro-brasileiros tendem a focar dez vezes mais em questoes raciais do que brancos, por exemplo. Esses resultados trazem novas perspectivas sobre porque candidatos afro-brasileiros sao pouco eleitos e os tipos de questoes que eles abordam quando eleitos.Alternate abstract:Television is an important political tool in Latin America. In recognition of its ability to shape public opinion and influence political behavior, Brazilian electoral authorities provide political parties with free television airtime in the weeks preceding elections. While Brazil's publicly financed electoral program levels the playing field between parties, it may contribute to intraparty resource disparities. This article contends that racial considerations influence how party elites distribute television airtime and thus contribute to the political marginalization of Afro-Brazilians. Using original data from Rio de Janeiro's 2012 municipal elections, it shows that party officials provide Afro-Brazilian candidates significantly less airtime than their white counterparts, even after controlling for theoretically important nonracial candidate characteristics. Moreover, it shows that there are racial differences in how candidates use the airtime they are awarded. Afro-Brazilian candidates are nearly ten times more likely than whites to focus on racial issues in their campaign ads. These results provide new insight about why Afro-Brazilians are rarely elected to public office and, when elected, the types of issues they may address.

T1  - Knowledge Acquisition in Times of the 2020 Coronavirus Pandemic: Evidence from a Four-Wave Panel Study
AN  - 2631533252
AB  - This paper focuses on the accuracy of COVID-19-related knowledge during the 2020 pandemic. We look at the effects of traditional vs. digital news use and distinguish between positive (number of recoveries) and negative (number of casualties) knowledge. Importantly, the moderating role of crisis context is examined when tracing media effects on knowledge. Relying on a four-wave panel survey fielded in the Netherlands, we find that people’s knowledge became more accurate over the course of the crisis. News exposure did not lead to more accuracy, in fact, a negative relation was found. The impact of digital news use weakened as the crisis continued.

T1  - Biomedicalization, Stigma, and “Re-Gaying” HIV/AIDS in the Israeli Media
AN  - 2591874813
AB  - HIV and AIDS are not merely biomedical conditions—they are socially constructed phenomena. Media coverage plays a prominent role in the public’s understanding of HIV/AIDS. “Biomediatization” denotes the coproduction of HIV/AIDS by biomedicine and mass media. Nevertheless, despite the importance of the media in the social construction of HIV/AIDS, research on HIV/AIDS coverage in the Israeli media is negligible. This study examined the social construction of HIV/AIDS in Israel. The sample includes all items (88 texts and videos) published in three of the top news websites in a 1-year period that mentioned HIV or AIDS. Thematic analysis was employed. Three themes were identified. “The biomedicalization of HIV/AIDS” depicted HIV/AIDS as a one-faceted, biological phenomenon that concerns the body of the individual and is a public health issue. The second theme, “HIV/AIDS and stigma,” consisted of subthemes: “acknowledging stigma” and “constructing stigma.” In the former, the stigma ascribed to HIV/AIDS was acknowledged and discussed. The latter revealed various mechanisms employed by the media to construct and perpetuate HIV/AIDS stigma. The third theme we identified, “re-gaying HIV/AIDS,” concerned the various venues through which HIV/AIDS is associated with gay men. The findings show that HIV/AIDS was depicted as a biomedical condition that concerns the individual. The implications of our study include a need to change the rhetoric of HIV/AIDS in the Israeli media such that it will address the complex issues of power and inequality that HIV/AIDS entails.

T1  - Beliefs, Attitudes, and Communicative Practices of Opponents and Supporters of COVID-19 Containment Policies: A Qualitative Case Study from Germany
AN  - 2586232043
AB  - In many countries, intense political contestation unfolded around the question of how Sars-CoV-2 should be contained. In this case study, I try to understand why members of the German public came to vastly differing judgements on the containment policies. In summer 2020, I conducted 48 semi-structured interviews to investigate respondents’ belief systems, attitude structures, and communicative practices. I found that disparate policy preferences were partly based on incompatible interpretations of the crisis and went hand in hand with deep institutional mistrust between strict opponents. Stereotypes about supporters and opponents had formed, and people avoided discussions with opposing camps. However, my data also suggest that moderate opponents and supporters overlapped in their criticism of anxiety-inducing media coverage and fuzzy governmental communication. No fully-fledged social identities had formed, and respondents were forcibly exposed to other opinions in their close personal networks. Altogether, my study extends the knowledge of political polarisation around COVID-19 by unravelling the interpretations and mechanisms that underlie disparate policy preferences during the pandemic.

T1  - Come Together, Right Now: Storylines and Social Identities in Coalition Building in a Local Policy Subsystem
AN  - 2578854233
AB  - How do social identities contribute to the formation of coalitions in a policy subsystem? Social identities help to understand the bundling of resources and common strategies for action. Thus, we argue that identification with a group and across groups discursively results in the formulation of shared and competing storylines. As coalitions are characterized by some kind of sameness of their actors which results in shared storylines, we thereby postulate that the link between storylines and social identities provides added value to the explanation of coalition formation. We test whether shared storylines can be traced back to social identities in the different discursive periods of traffic development on a local level in Germany. A media analysis of 110 articles and 14 interviews shows that the assignment of certain group characteristics is discursively confirmed, renegotiated, or rejected. Social identities, therefore, matter for coalition formation.Related ArticlesChang, Katherine T., and Elizabeth A. Koebele. 2020. “What Drives Coalitions' Narrative Strategy?

Por lo tanto, argumentamos que la identificación con un grupo y entre grupos da como resultado discursivamente la formulación de historias compartidas y en competencia.

T1  - The representation of Islam within social media: a systematic review
AN  - 2577600859
AB  - This systematic review was carried out to provide insights into how Islam has been represented in social media; and the omissions and gaps in the synthesized literature on the topic. Two databases – Scopus and the Web of Science – were explored to collect data. Primary searches between 2010 and 2019, revealed more than 100 studies dealing with the topic of investigation. After scrutinizing abstracts and removing duplicates, 36 studies came within the research criteria and were retained for analysis. A thematic analysis was conducted for the derivation of themes. The themes that emerged were: (1) Islam as a liberal religion; (2) Islam as a religion of extremism and terrorism; (3) Islam as religion of gender discrimination; (4) Islam as a religion of collective identity; and (5) Islam as a humane religion. Although the representation of Islam in social media is wide-ranging, more empirical studies found that social media users represent Islam negatively than studies which revealed positive view of Islam by social media users.

T1  - Framing immigration: a content analysis of newspapers in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States
AN  - 2567817076
AB  - This study examines the media framings of immigration in Hong Kong, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Using a content analysis of over 1700 newspaper articles published in 2014 in different cases, my findings show that, regardless of context, the media use a small number of frames to stereotype, generalize and reduce immigration to a singular dimension. My analysis also suggests that the media do not always only have a binary representation of bad or good immigrants. Instead, the media's othering of immigrants is a complex process, suggesting ambivalence despite superficial affirmation. Although my findings also demonstrate that some national differences exist, common patterns can be found across contexts that share similar historical, cultural, social, economic, and political dimensions of immigration. As one of the first cross-regional comparisons of media framings, this research reflects the power dynamics between the elites and immigrants and offers implications for how the media's reinforcement of stereotypes and outsider status of immigrants could potentially shape public opinion and policies regarding immigration.

T1  - The Political Culture of Asian Brazilians
TT  - A Cultura Política dos Brasileiros Asiáticos
AN  - 2685100676
AB  - Few studies have examined the relationship between race and politics for Asian Brazilians. Using data from the Latin American Public Opinion Survey, we examine this relationship along two axes: cognitive orientation towards politics and institutional confidence. We use factor analysis to create representative indices of these axes and estimate regression models using race as a predictive variable. We find no evidence that Asian Brazilians differ from white Brazilians along either of these two axes. However, we find that a university education has an especially strong relationship with cognitive orientation towards politics for Asian Brazilians. On average, Asian Brazilians with a university education had a cognitive orientation towards politics score 17% higher than Asian Brazilians without a university education, though we do not find a similar effect for institutional confidence. Overall, we find that ethnic identity, particularly for Asians, does not have a strong effect on either of the axes but education has different effects on them between different ethnic groups.Alternate abstract:Poucos estudos têm examinado a relação entre raça e política para Brasileiros Asiáticos. Usando dados do Projeto de Opinião Pública da América Latina, examinamos essa relação através de dois eixos: orientação cognitiva à política e confiança institucional. Nós usamos análise fatorial para propor índices representativos e estimamos modelos de regressão usando raça como uma variável preditiva. Não encontramos evidência de que Brasileiros Asiáticos diferem de Brasileiros Brancos em ambos os eixos. Porém, achamos que a educação superior tem uma relação particularmente forte com a orientação cognitiva à política para Brasileiros Asiáticos. Em média, Brasileiros Asiáticos com educação superior têm uma pontuação de orientação cognitiva à política 17% mais alta do que Brasileiros Asiáticos sem educação superior, apesar de não encontramos um efeito semelhante para a confiança institucional. No geral, descobrimos que a identidade étnica, particularmente para os asiáticos, não tem um forte efeito em nenhum dos eixos, mas a educação tem efeitos diferentes entre os diferentes grupos étnicos.

T1  - Media effects on policy preferences toward free movement: evidence from five EU member states
AN  - 2568191717
AB  - In a time when freedom of movement is being challenged by an increasing number of European Union member states, and where immigration has been dominating public debate for years, this study investigates the effects (i.e. frame salience and frame sentiment) of migration news on individuals’ attitudes about free movement. We are taking into account respondents individual media diet by linking a two-wave online survey in five European countries (n = 7,794) with an automated content analysis of online news coverage in these countries (n = 26,696). Findings indicate that overall the salience of specific frames (i.e. labour market and security), as well as sentiment, positively influence free movement attitudes among citizens. However, there are country-specific differences for both salience and sentiment effects. These findings have implications for our understanding of media effects on immigration attitudes and policy preferences as well as for comparative media effects research in general.

T1  - Discursive Practices: Old Hatred or New Solidarity? An (Un)Expected Approach in the Socio-Political Construction of COVID-19 in Romania
AN  - 2603457075
AB  - Communication serves the symbolic exchange of common, shared meanings and has a captious role in shaping the Social Construction of Covid-19. Influencing behavior and attitudes and advocating for a proper position and an adequate behavior, health communication along with the political discourse in Romania during the Pandemic was circumscribed to a defensive strategy aiming to manage the crisis in a society defined by a polarized imaginary and catastrophe consumption. Diaspora was targeted as a potential enemy in the public discourse and Mass media was seduced by this approach multiplying the effect of the lack of any professional risk strategy and increasing the climate of fear and mistrust. As a methodological approach, I have used Qualitative methods in Content Analysis and Critical Discourse Analysis, especially due to their merit, as non-reactive and nonintrusive methods, applied on public discourse in mainstream media and online. The segregation of the population by dividing Romanians into those who left and those who stayed, was observed as a vulnerable strategy unable in the long run to be a convincing approach and harming social solidarity. The collective imaginary and the public perception are seriously affected by ambivalence and de-rationalization of the manipulative public discourse when the social solidarity is redefined.

T1  - Conversations About Opioids: Impact of the Opioid Overdose Epidemic on Social Interactions for People Who Live With Chronic Pain
AN  - 2572166597
AB  - The objective of this study was to understand the impact of the opioid overdose epidemic on the social lives of people suffering from chronic pain, focusing on interactions within their personal and professional circles. The study was based on 22 in-depth interviews with people living with chronic pain in Canada. Using thematic analysis, we documented three main impacts of the opioid overdose epidemic: (a) increased worries of people in pain and their families regarding the dangers of opioids; (b) prejudices, stigma, and discrimination faced during conversations about opioids; and (c) stigma management attempts, which include self-advocacy and concealment of opioid use. This study represents important knowledge advancement on how people manage stigma and communicate about chronic disease during everyday life interactions. By showing negative effects of the epidemic’s media coverage on the social experiences of people with chronic pain, we underscore needs for destigmatizing approaches in public communication regarding opioids.

T1  - Exploring the dark and bright sides of Internet democracy: Ethos-reversing and ethos-renewing digital transformation
AN  - 2561103745
AB  - A broad spectrum of public opinion has long portrayed the Internet as a harbinger of liberal-democratic ethos-renewal. Recent empirical evidence, however, points to opposite, ethos-reversing effects. This paper theorizes how liberal polities condition ethos-renewing and ethos-reversing cycles of digital transformation. I advance a number of ideal-typical propositions on Internet-enabled ethos-renewal and ethos-reversal, illustrating my propositions with examples from two liberal polities with leading digital transformation ambitions: Finland and the UK. Ethos-renewal requires paradigm-shifting public investment by representative and direct democracy bodies in five complementary spheres of digital transformation: i) politics: enhance the representativeness of and participation in political decision-making through Internet-enabled direct democracy methods of deliberation, ii) media: invest private (social) media with a public journalism ethos to counter-balance profit-oriented amplification of post-truth phenomena, iii) identity: pro-actively renew emotional belonging to a moral digital community in face of globalization and individualization pressures, iv) education: create Netizens resilient to post-truth phenomena on (social) media, and v) markets: place digital transformation at service of an algorithmic and data commons rather than techno-feudal digital enclosures.

T1  - Changing the paradigm: Using strategic communications to promote recognition of child sexual abuse as a preventable public health problem
AN  - 2551711670
AB  - Child sexual abuse (CSA) is common, severe, and substantively contributes to the global burden of disease through its impact on physical, mental, and behavioral health problems. While CSA is preventable through non-justice system response efforts, the vast majority of resources support criminal justice efforts to identify, prosecute, punish and monitor offenders after CSA has already occurred. Policy makers have not supported CSA prevention efforts in part because the public does not view CSA as a preventable public health problem. Here, we describe a program of research to be conducted to bridge the gaps between expert and public opinion about CSA as a preventable public health problem. We propose such research use a three-step approach to alter the way experts communicate about CSA to increase audiences' understanding of CSA as preventable. The three steps are: 1) identify consensus expert and public perspectives about CSA and the differences between these perspectives; 2) develop and test communication strategies to align public with expert perspectives; and 3) broadly disseminate validated communication strategies. Through this approach, we seek to develop and disseminate an informed communications strategy that effectively and accurately translates the science of CSA prevention to the public and the media.

T1  - From asymmetric dependency to discursive disengagement: How social movements and the media/public talked past each other
AN  - 2549635970
AB  - Social movement-media/public interaction has been largely examined from the lens of “asymmetric dependency” in which both movements’ representation and self-understanding are mainly shaped by their media and public opinion environment. The introduction of digital technologies, however, has diversified this discursive environment and seemed to reverse the uneven dynamics. Using a case study of a protest campaign organized by Chinese American immigrants, this study demonstrates a new pattern of movement-media/public dynamics that goes beyond the “asymmetric dependency” model or its obverse. In the aftermath of a Chinese American police officer who shot a black man to death, Chinese immigrants stood with him and deliberated on WeChat, a China-based digital platform engineered like a “walled garden.” The technolinguistic enclosure of the platform facilitated the development of a separate interpretative universe in the WeChatsphere vis-à-vis the one in the mediasphere. Later, even when immigrant protesters confronted the public in the Twittersphere, they continued talking past each other. By unpacking the decoupling processes between movements and the media/public, this study shifts the research focus from understanding their interaction to examining their disengagement, as well as the “filter bubble” effects that contribute to contemporary fragmentation and polarization in political and civic engagements.

T1  - Breaking bad: how crisis communication, dissemination channel and prevalence influence the public perception of doping cases
AN  - 2542539659
AB  - The publication of doping cases evokes media interest and forces athletes to apply crisis communication to compensate for a potential loss of trust or to protect their reputation in the public eye. Based on case vignettes and experimental designs, this three studies paper shows that justification can be regarded as an efficient crisis communication strategy, whereas the dissemination of a statement via journalistic sources or social media as well as the doping prevalence of the type of sports is not decisive for the general public perception. The paper evokes the question of whether recipients are willing to be confronted with the dark side of high-performance sports.

T1  - Developing a Social Index for Measuring the Public Opinion Regarding the Attainment of Sustainable Development Goals
AN  - 2542530648
AB  - In 2015, United Nations adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to be achieved by 2030. Implementing SDGs is an important issue for companies as well as for nations. However, to consistently monitor and evaluate progress towards these goals, major efforts in developing objective indices for measuring the levels of SDGs are essential. Currently almost all SDG studies uniformly use available country-level official statistics to synthesize an SDG index, failing to reflect the feelings and opinions of the general public. In this paper we introduce an SDG Social Index developed by a Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm. By using social media text data rather than conventional survey data, this index can measure and evaluate the outspoken feelings and opinions of the public toward the SDGs. Here we produce an SDG Social Index for a global company and statistically assess its effectiveness. This framework for producing an SDG Social Index can easily be extended to make other indices where various text data are available. It can also be easily extended to yield country-specific SDG indices across nations. In Conclusion section we summarize the implications of our approach and discuss limitations and future research areas.

T1  - What Predicts Selective Exposure Online: Testing Political Attitudes, Credibility, and Social Identity
AN  - 2540700015
AB  - The online environment offers nearly unlimited sources and information, giving people unprecedented agency over selection. This article offers a test of three factors predicting selective exposure to opinionated news online—prior political attitudes, source credibility, and individual social identity based on race (Study 1) and gender (Study 2)—testing their independent and interactive effects. Two original selection studies on samples of adult Americans offered articles that were (1) pro- or counter-attitudinal with regard to individual attitudes on two political issues, (2) from high- versus low-credibility sources conceptualized in two different ways, and (3) featuring participants’ social in-group or out-group. Unobtrusively logged behavioral selection data suggest that prior political attitudes, and their strength and importance in Study 1, more strongly predict pro-attitudinal exposure than both source credibility and the demographically based social identity. Both studies additionally reveal nuanced interactions between the tested factors.

T1  - Kobe Bryant: Consent and the Carceral Shadow of a Life Incomplete
AN  - 2549479524
AB  - Abstract Kobe Bryant is now in the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame. He entered in what is perhaps the most decorated Hall of Fame class in the history of the institution. Among the events that inform how athletes and other public figures are perceived are off-court activities and events. On the last day of June 2003, Kobe Bryant had a sexual encounter with a young woman in his suite in a Colorado resort. What resulted from that encounter was part sports spectacle, part legal proceedings, and all public privacy. Legal decisions and actions of an NBA African American icon-under-construction became a part of news coverage for nearly 2 years. This coverage was the onset of Kobe’s “carceral shadow.” W.E.B. Du Bois (1899:254, 249) suggested that, “Crime comes either in spite of intelligence or as a result of misdirected intelligence under severe economic and moral strain… We must add to this the influences of social position and connections in procuring whites pardons or lighter sentences.” That young Colorado woman accused Kobe of sexual assault. Graphic accounts and other evidence presented in the court of public opinion led to a large payment to the alleged victim which ended the civil suit and the legal process. Despite the absence of a trial and conviction, one can understand Kobe through the lens of a carceral citizenship. Similar circumstances—on mere allegation alone—often led to the lynching death of many Black men throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Kobe’s carceral shadow followed him from that day forward through an arc of post-non-trial redemption. In this work, I consider these themes in relation to Kobe’s iconic “life incomplete.”

T1  - Racism and pride in attitudes toward confederate symbols
AN  - 2537931130
AB  - In this essay, I describe and evaluate the contemporary debate over support for Confederate icons. This debate is often stylized as “heritage” versus “hatred.” In this debate, one side alleges that their favored Confederate symbols represent pride in Southern‐Confederate identity, whereas the other urges that Confederate symbols represent racial hatred and white supremacy. I argue that the “heritage versus hatred” framing that typifies the public debate and the academic literature is not helpful. Additionally, the literature has largely ignored the views of Black Southerners, who have far more negative attitudes toward Confederate symbols compared to whites. Thus, many works implicitly assume a distinctly white southern past. Together, these shortcomings mean that existing research has likely overestimated overall public support for Confederate symbols and overstated the importance of Southern pride or heritage in informing that support, while at the same time underestimating the extent to which racial animus undergirds pro‐Confederate views among whites.

T1  - Ableist contours of Down syndrome in Australia: Facebook attitudes towards existence and parenting of people with Down syndrome
AN  - 2535020176
AB  - The emergence of online disability hate speech on social media platforms is the latest form of ableist expression. This was highlighted when an alarming amount of negative attitudinal responses emerged towards people with Down syndrome and their parents on the 60 Minutes Facebook platform to their segment ‘Does Australia really want to see the end of Down syndrome?’This article analyses the varying contours of ableism within these responses. The responses could be categorised into three broad themes: the construction of Down syndrome as an economic burden on society and a drain on public resources; social attitudes to Down syndrome; and bias related to information provided by the medical profession to pregnant women with a high probability of a Down syndrome birth.These findings allowed us to interrogate what this means in terms of how Australians view difference associated with Down syndrome, and to consider the operationalisation of ableism within the Australian social landscape.

T1  - TRENDS: Do Women Seek “Women of Color” for Public Office? Exploring Women’s Support for Electing Women of Color
AN  - 2528757575
AB  - Scholars frequently invoke the term “women of color” (WOC) in their research, and, increasingly, the media make reference to WOC in news stories. Despite this common usage, researchers have failed to investigate whether the phrase WOC is politically advantageous. That is, do all women, black, Latina, Asian, white, and mixed-race women, support WOC candidates? This omission is unfortunate considering the large body of literature about race and gender politics concerned with descriptive representation and the extent of coethnic voting and gender affinity effects. Using original public opinion data, we draw on theories of intersectionality and social identity to hypothesize about how different subgroups of women respond to the prospect of electing more WOC to Congress. Consistent with group differences in the historic processes of racialization, our findings reveal considerable complexity within the WOC umbrella. Even within this complexity, we found that black and white women are the most distinctive in their preference for electing WOC. We contribute to the gender and race fields by identifying WOC as a politicized identity, and thus complicate and expand the study of descriptive representation.

T1  - Social Accountability in Movies: Speculations on Legal Principle and Emotional Reasoning
AN  - 2565978171
AB  - The three films discussed here are all adapted works based on real‐life incidents that have happened in China pertaining to child trafficking, drug smuggling, and kidnapping. Although the films depict the roads traveled and lives lived by the particular characters, more importantly, they enable the audience to realize that characters cannot be viewed in terms of black and white. Rather, characters should be viewed as “gray.” Specifically, all characters are portrayed as both selfless and profit driven. They are forced to confront hidden pain caused by the trials and tribulations of life. That pain is coupled with a sense of helplessness and a need to face life’s changes brought about by the failure of the government’s social management system. Being under constant pressure, the dregs of society pursue their own selfish interests, thereby infringing on the interests of others. When criminals are at their worst, the audience is looking for their goodness amidst the opposing forces of legality and sentimentality, egoism and altruism. Audiences are hoping for some form of redemption in characters who are wrestling with responsibility and obligation. This not only gives the characters a sense of inclusiveness, but it also gives viewers comfort regarding our shared humanity. At the same time, the upsurge of public opinion triggered by these realistic films has accelerated government reform and enhancement of the social system. Thus, socially oriented movies in China have had large social value and practical significance.

T1  - Attitudes Toward Same-Sex Parents: Examining the Antecedents of Parenting Ability Evaluation
AN  - 2514989020
AB  - Hostility toward same-sex parenting is widespread. Literature supports one persistent argument against same-sex parenting which focusses on the concern for children’s wellbeing, whereas lesbian and gay parents’ ability is sometimes evaluated positively. In particular, the belief that children need both a father and a mother impacts the evaluation that same-sex parents are unfit to raise well-adjusted children. The present research aimed to investigate linking mechanisms and conditional processes underlying the evaluation of same-sex parents’ ability. Cisgender heterosexual Italian participants (N = 320) read one of four vignettes describing a family situation – two types of same-sex (step)parents (i.e., lesbian and gay (step)parents) vs. two types of different-sex (step)parents (i.e., heterosexual (step)parents) – in which a child misbehaved in the context of a mild family disagreement. After reading the vignette, the participants rated parenting ability and to what extent the child’s misbehavior was attributable to the parenting relationship. Moderated-mediation analyses indicated that same-sex (step)parents were perceived as being less capable parents compared to different-sex (step)parents by giving them greater responsibility for the child’s misbehavior, among participants with medium and high levels of gender role beliefs. Implications for research on sexual discrimination are discussed.

T1  - It’s Like Bisexuality, but It Isn’t: Pansexual and Panromantic People’s Understandings of Their Identities and Experiences of Becoming Educated about Gender and Sexuality
AN  - 2562380066
AB  - In this paper, we report on our survey research which sought to explore how pansexual and panromantic people experience and understand their identities. Eighty participants, mainly in the U.K., were recruited via social media and internet forums. Thematic analysis resulted in the development of two key themes. In The label depends on the context: It’s like bisexuality, but it isn’t, we report the blurred lines between pansexual and bisexual identities and discuss how, despite often having a preference for pansexual and panromantic, these participants nonetheless engaged in strategic use of both bi and pan terms. In the second theme entitled Educated and enlightened pansexuals we report how participants portrayed pansexual and panromantic identities as requiring an advanced understanding of gender and sexuality. This meant that those who engaged in these terms were represented as educated and enlightened. In the subtheme An internet education: Tumblr-ing into pan identities and communities, we discuss how educational resources and inclusive spaces were largely understood to exist only online. In this research, participants understood pansexual and panromantic identities to be related to, but distinct from, other identities (including bisexuality) and presented their identities as entailing distinctive experiences, including of prejudice and discrimination. We discuss the contribution and implications of our findings.

T1  - How Popular Culture Prompts Youth Collective Political Expression and Cross-Cutting Political Talk on Social Media: A Cross-Platform Analysis
AN  - 2547875580
AB  - Adopting a comparative cross-platform approach, we examine youth political expression and conversation on social media, as prompted by popular culture. Tracking a common case study—the practice of building Donald Trump’s border wall within the videogame Fortnite—across three social media platforms popular with youth (YouTube, TikTok, Instagram), we ask: How do popular culture artifacts prompt youth political expression, as well as cross-cutting political talk with those holding different political views, across social media platforms? A mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative content analysis of around 6,400 comments posted on relevant artifacts, illuminates youth popular culture as a shared symbolic resource that stimulates communication within and across political differences—although, as our findings show, it is often deployed in a disparaging manner. This cross-platform analysis, grounded in contemporary youth culture and sociopolitical dynamics, enables a deeper understanding of the interplay between popular culture, cross-cutting political talk, and the role that different social media platforms play in shaping these expressive practices.

T1  - Themes and tones of cannabis news reports and legalization outcomes
AN  - 2516149777
AB  - This project analyzed print news articles on cannabis legalization that were published in 2015 (N = 295) from newspapers across the United States. The following year, 2016, saw more states legalize cannabis for adult use and medical use than before. Therefore, one goal of this research was to investigate the relationship between reports on cannabis legalization and subsequent legal changes that occurred in states that reformed their cannabis laws. Findings reveal that cannabis legalization issues are reported in the media with tones that favor, oppose, or are neutral toward cannabis legalization. Overall, cannabis legalization stories were reported with a neutral tone. Additionally, arguments about whether cannabis should be legalized are framed using criminological, economic, medical, and political themes. The political theme emerged most frequently in all reports. Findings indicate that there is an association between the tone of positive reporting and subsequent cannabis legalization in states where those reports originated. These findings have implications for allowing policymakers and healthcare professionals to build on their existing knowledge of the relationship between media, public opinion, and emerging cannabis policy. Finally, this study provides some context for the connection between a story’s theme, tone, and how they can shed light on cannabis legalization outcomes.

T1  - The Editorial Opinion of the Mainstream Media During the Catalan Elections of 2017: A Madrid–Barcelona Comparative Study: PROD
AN  - 2504703094
AB  - This article is a follow-up to an article published in the American Behavioral Scientist in 2017, titled “Shaping public opinion for confrontation: Catalan independence claims as represented in Spanish, Catalan, Valencian, and Basque Editorials.” At that time, our study was based on opinions expressed in mainstream newspaper editorials during two significant events in Catalonia’s recent history: the demonstration against the Spanish Constitutional Court ruling on the Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia of July 10, 2010, and the mass pro-independence demonstration held on September 11, 2012. The research sought to compare the press reports published in Catalonia, Valencia, and the Basque Country with those from the rest of Spain (primarily Madrid).This study applies the same methodology to analyze editorial pieces published during the campaign prior to the Catalan parliamentary elections on December 21, 2017. This date was historically significant for Catalonia because for the first time since the restoration of democracy following the Franco regime, the Spanish state had intervened in Catalonia’s self-rule by using Article 155 of the Spanish constitution to call snap elections. At the time, the lead candidates for the pro-independence parties were Oriol Junqueras (Republican Left of Catalonia) and Carles Puigdemont (Together for Catalonia), the former in prison and the latter abroad (or in “exile,” according to secessionists). In light of the opposing opinions and perspectives, we believe it is worth analyzing and comparing mainstream editorials from Catalonia (Barcelona) and Spain (Madrid) once again, to ascertain the dominant narratives used in both to explain the Catalan and Spanish position and frame of reference. We have extended the scope to include mainstream online as well as printed media with a view to achieving a better understanding and providing a wider overview of the public agenda and debate at that time.

T1  - From advocacy to acceptance: Social media discussions of protected bike lane installations
AN  - 2503612925
AB  - Many North American cities are building bicycling infrastructure. Lively discussions on social media, where people passionately support or reject bicycling infrastructure projects, provide a unique data set on attitudes towards bicycling infrastructure. Our goal is to analyse social media posts in Edmonton and Victoria, Canada as new bike infrastructure was implemented to understand the thematic and social elements of the conversation and how these changed over time. We collected Twitter messages (n = 13,121: 7640 in Edmonton; 5481 in Victoria) and compared three timeframes: before lanes opened (January 2015 to lane opening); the first riding season (opening to April 2017); and the second riding season (May 2017 to November 2018). For each timeframe, we evaluated word-combination frequencies (to understand the use of language) and social network structures (to understand which accounts were influential and how they interacted). We observed a change in the three time periods. Before the bicycling infrastructure was built, Twitter activity was focused on advocacy, which was especially strong in Victoria. The first riding season had the most social media activity, the most diverse perspectives and the most controversy. The second riding season held more support. Based on the Twitter activity, we found that Edmonton had more support from local businesses and traditional media, launching a connected network of infrastructure with less social media opposition. Our results suggest that attitudes associated with change in bicycling infrastructure may have a cycle, with initial negative responses to change, followed by an uptick in positive attitudes.

T1  - Supporting the Message, Not the Messenger: The Correlates of Attitudes towards Black Lives Matter
AN  - 2503359053
AB  - Since the Black Lives Matter movement’s rise to prominence, there has been significant opposition from both media and political figures who believe that the movement is promoting a “war on cops.” Because there is no evidence to support this claim, the current study examines the basis for negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter using a sample of over 500 undergraduate students from a large Midwestern university. The findings indicate that the strongest predictors of negative attitudes towards Black Lives Matter are being white and holding symbolically racist attitudes. Perceiving the police to be equivalent to soldiers in a war on crime, perceiving police misconduct to be less common, and holding a conservative crime ideology are also significant in the model.

T1  - Claiming our Space: Muslim Women, Activism, and Social Media
AN  - 2501512274
AB  - This paper addresses the ways in which Muslim women seek to employ online media, particularly social media, to reclaim narratives around space, embodiment, and power. I argue that digital space is, like any other form of media, structured essentially by racism and patriarchy, but I also note the crucial potential for resistance exhibited by Muslim activists such as political leaders Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, Instagram influencer Ayesha Malik, and the largely anonymous women who participated in #MosqueMeToo, encouraged by the journalist and activist Mona Eltahawy. I draw upon a post/anti-colonial feminist framework and the tools of critical discourse analysis in examining specific instances where such women perform acts of resistance that, in turn, trigger a gendered and raced reaction. I note the ways in which some Muslim women, such as Saudi teenager Rahaf Mohammed, are constructed as media heroes, given that their stories can be co-opted to validate notions of the white colonial savior, while others directly challenge narratives of colonialism and oppression and are thus subjected to backlash. I point to the ways in which some of this vitriol continues to refer back to the notion that Muslim women should be silent, and to the fetishized Muslim woman's body: how it should look, where it can/should go, and what can be done to it.

T1  - Law Enforcement and the Depiction of Minorities and Women on Social Media: A Review of Municipal Police Department Facebook Pictures
AN  - 2500886896
AB  - There is a growing area of research today focusing on how the demographics of law enforcement officers and criminals are depicted. This research has concentrated on portrayals by the media, popular culture, criminal justice textbooks, training manuals, and other literature surrounding criminal justice. There is little known, however, about the way the race and gender of police and criminals are represented on social media. This study attempts to fill this void by examining police Facebook pages in the 171 largest cities in the United States. Specifically, 20,152 images of police and criminals on these police Facebook pages are examined to determine whether there are disparities in representation based on race, gender, and other variables. We found that female and minority officers are appropriately represented in the images of police on Facebook pages in relation to their actual representation in the field. In contrast, images of criminals tend to be disproportionately composed of Black males. Implications for the recruitment of minority officers and other relevant issues are discussed.

T1  - US media’s coverage of China’s handling of COVID-19: Playing the role of the fourth branch of government or the fourth estate?
AN  - 2504700691
AB  - The present study is an analysis of a sample of reports on China’s handling of COVID-19 by several major US media with a focus on a controversial op-ed by the Wall Street Journal. It is found that instead of covering it objectively as a public health crisis, these media reports tend to adopt the strategy of naming, shaming, blaming, and taming against China. In other words, they seize the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan as an opportunity to serve Trump’s “America First” doctrine by a coordinated attempt to destroy the Chinese dream and arresting China’s ascendency. First, the naming/shaming technique is used to tarnish China’s image as a virus. The op-ed on the Wall Street Journal describes China as “the real sick man of Asia.” In addition, a cluster of ferociously negative names are slung onto China to describe the coronavirus as “the Wuhan virus,” “the Belt & Road Initiative pandemic,” “the China virus,” and so on. Second, the blaming technique is applied. On top of such negative name-calling, these media tend to blame the Chinese leadership, the political system, and finally Chinese food culture for eating pangolins. Finally, the taming technique is used to constrain, isolate, or quarantine China. One goal behind such a China threat strategy is to fan American or foreign businesses to move (back) to the United States out of China. Another goal is to create the public opinion environment that would be conducive to some American groups’ litigations against China. It is concluded that American mainstream media while quarreling with the Trump administration for domestic affairs seem to be colluding with the conservative intellectual base in the United States in supporting Trump’s strategy to knock down and divide China.

T1  - ‘Re-educating the Roma? You must be joking. . .’: Racism and prejudice in online discussion forums
AN  - 2478227891
AB  - This article explores prejudicial and racist discourse in reader comments in internet news discussion forums. Based on data from an online debate among Czech commenters on the mainstream iDnes.cz news site, it seeks to contribute to the existing critical linguistic approaches to discursive strategies of othering. Analysing user comments referencing a news article on a sensitive social topic, namely the complicated reception of Central European Roma immigrants in the UK, the paper focuses on three salient themes found in the data: (a) the re-education of the ethnic minority; (b) the users’ perception of the media as politically correct and siding with the outgroup; and (c) the outgroup’s negative stereotype associating it with criminality. The paper argues that the discourse on these topics simultaneously relies on and reinforces the negative stereotype of the ethnic group, while revealing a complicated relationship between three stakeholders: the ingroup, represented by the commenters; the outgroup, made up of members of the ethnic groups; and the media, as representatives of the authorities and the elites. The findings reveal how quasi-humorous comments that involve such stereotypical representations contribute to the normalization of everyday racism against ethnic outgroups.1

T1  - The social acceptance of nuclear fusion for decision making towards carbon free circular economy: Evidence from Czech Republic
AN  - 2509312509
AB  - The social awareness and acceptance of new energy technologies are the key factors of their commercialization in Europe. The decision making in energy sector also requires integration of social preferences. In the context implementation of circular economy and moving towards carbon free economy target in 2050, all carbon free technologies require attention of decision makers including new nuclear technologies. The cutting-edge technologies, such as big data, have the potential to leverage the adoption of circular and carbon free economy concepts by the society. Therefore, the big data can play a major role in terms of acting as a facilitator for gaining the desired information for decision making in energy sector. In this paper, the big data was used for assessment of social acceptance of nuclear fusion. The diverse and representative sample from the Czech Republic (N = 1026, aged 15–95 years, 48.80% women, 18.50% with higher education) was employed to show the dynamics of the formation of public support in a country effectively unaware of the nuclear fusion (NF) (the total pre-survey awareness was 16.6%). The analysis of presentation on NF in Czech mass media concluded that similarly to other European Union countries, the presentation fragmented, insufficient, technical, aimed at people interested in technology with effectively no public discussion on the topic. When briefed with pros and cons of NF, three quarters of the respondents developed an idea on their support of NF in general and in Europe with the level of support reaching one third of the sample. We analyze the relation of NF support using a set of ordinal multinomial regression analyses with spline corrections of ordinal predictors to the four groups of factors: self-claimed awareness and knowledge of NF, sources of information including education, pros and cons of NF, and psychological and value aspects. We show that more information on NF positively influenced the support. Internet news were (negatively) and printed newspapers and magazines were (positively) related to support. The NF being and unlimited source of energy (positively) and using radioactive material and competing for renewables money (negatively) were related to support. Our findings have clear implications for public engagement and communication efforts on NF projects. We suggest that in order to change the level of acceptance for NF more communication and media presentation is needed. We present the ideas on how to frame the communication. Our results are in accord with similar studies from other European countries and therefore our outcomes might find practical applicability there.

T1  - COVID-19 conspiracy theories: GPIR
AN  - 2497530650
AB  - Conspiracy theories started to appear on social media immediately after the first news about COVID-19. Is the virus a hoax? Is it a bioweapon designed in a Chinese laboratory? These conspiracy theories typically have an intergroup flavour, blaming one group for having some involvement in either manufacturing the virus or controlling public opinion about it. In this article, I will discuss why people are attracted to conspiracy theories in general, and why conspiracy theories seem to have flourished during the pandemic. I will discuss what the consequences of these conspiracy theories are for individuals, groups, and societies. I will then discuss some potential strategies for addressing the negative consequences of conspiracy theories. Finally, I will consider some open questions for research regarding COVID-19 conspiracy theories, in particular focusing on the potential impact of these conspiracy theories for group processes and intergroup relations.

T1  - ‘Ruined’ lives: Mediated white male victimhood
AN  - 2493940499
AB  - When the hashtag #metoo began to circulate in digital and social media, it challenged a familiar interpretation of those who are raped or sexually harassed as victims, positioning women as embodied agents. Yet, almost exactly a year after the #metoo movement shot to visible prominence, a different, though eerily similar, story began to circulate on the same multi-media platforms as #metoo: a story about white male victimhood. Powerful men in positions of privilege (almost always white) began to take up the mantle of victimhood as their own, often claiming to be victims of false accusations of sexual harassment and assault by women. Through the analysis of five public statements by highly visible, powerful men who have been accused of sexual violence, I argue that the discourse of victimhood is appropriated not by those who have historically suffered but by those in positions of patriarchal power. Almost all of the statements contain some sentiment about how the accusation (occasionally acknowledging the actual violence) ‘ruined their life’, and all of the statements analyzed here center the author, the accused white man, as the key subject in peril and the authors position themselves as truth-tellers about the incidents. These statements underscore certain shifts in the public perception of sexual violence; the very success of the #metoo movement in shifting the narrative has meant that men have had to defend themselves more explicitly in public. In order to wrestle back a hegemonic gender stability, these men take on the mantle of victimhood themselves.

T1  - May the odds be ever in your favor: The Hunger Games and the fight for a more equal society. (Negative) Media vicarious contact and collective action
AN  - 2492897155
AB  - Various studies have found that reading books about positive interactions between ingroup and outgroup characters, known as media vicarious contact, can reduce prejudice. Focusing on the fantasy saga of The Hunger Games, we examined the effects of negative vicarious contact on collective action across two studies. Specifically, we tested whether reading about fantasy characters living in a postapocalyptic conflictual society with large social disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups leads advantaged group members to display greater willingness to engage in collective action on behalf of the disadvantaged group. Results from Study 1 (correlational survey in the United Kingdom and United States) and Study 2 (experimental intervention in Italy) revealed that reading The Hunger Games is indirectly associated with greater collective action intentions via increased anger toward injustice. In both studies social dominance orientation (SDO) acted as a moderator, but in opposite directions: mediation was significant for low‐SDOs in Study 1, and for high‐SDOs in Study 2. Results are discussed in relation to the importance of media vicarious contact via book reading for social change, and to the need to identify the contextual conditions allowing to anticipate the specific moderation pattern that is more likely to emerge.

T1  - A Longitudinal Content Analysis of the Use of Radical and Mainstream, Pro- and Anti-LGBT Organizations as Sources in <i>The New York Times</i> & <i>The Washington Post</i>
AN  - 2476820325
AB  - Public opinion about LGBT rights has shifted dramatically in the last 30 years. This study, a content analysis of 659 news articles from The New York Times and The Washington Post from 1977–2013, examined the use of pro- and anti-LGBT organizations as sources to explore how coverage changed over time and to examine if there were differences in coverage of mainstream LGBT advocacy organizations versus those that are more radical in nature. Results showed that stories about the topics of marriage/families, entertainment, AIDS, politics and protests were the most likely to use LGBT advocacy organizations as sources. Use of radical organizations as sources peaked in the 1990s, when the majority of AIDS and protest stories were published. Anti-LGBT organizations were used as sources in just under 20 percent of the coded stories but stories covering some topics like marriage/families saw much higher rates of anti-LGBT organizational sourcing. Implications are discussed.

AB  - Autism is an ambiguous, vague concept. In medical nomenclature, its semantic scope has already changed several times. The article presents the ways in which this concept appears in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems. The common feature of these definitions is a reductionist approach to the patient and thinking in terms of a disease or disorder (ASD – Autism Spectrum Disorder). Nowadays, there are also other views of autism whose validity is sought by social actors/ interest groups outside the medical establishment. In the public opinion, the association of autism with the puzzle or the blue color popularized by the Autism Speaks foundation is strongly rooted. Moreover, in media events, popular science and scientific publications, including therapeutic literature, the term Autism Spectrum Condition appears. It is important to show the dispute over the definition of autism because the arguments of each side have implications for health.Alternate abstract:Autism is an ambiguous, vague concept.

T1  - Performing Hybridity or Deflecting Islamophobia? Adaptable Identity Management amongst Young British Pakistani Muslims
AN  - 2612834823
AB  - This article engages with issues of identity construction and maintenance as expressed by a group of young British Pakistanis living in the North-West of England. Drawing on primary data from a qualitative study, we examine the ways in which Muslim identities are maintained, negotiated, and protected in relation to everyday situated cultural experiences. Nested within a context in which Islamophobia is pervasive, we discuss four salient processes of identity management articulated by participants: cherry picking; strategic adaption; ambassadorship and active resistance. Whilst these processes are to be considered as porous rather than mutually exclusive, our analysis elucidates evidence of both nimble and creative individual identity management and also an entrenchment of collective pride. We posit that, for the participants in this study, such practices constitute a grounded, pragmatic response to living in an environment in which their religious beliefs, political values and cultural commitments are frequently questioned within public life, the media and the political sphere.

T1  - Lessons from a Different Shore: Portrayals of Japanese American Incarceration and the Redress Movement by Western European Newspapers
AN  - 2580683594
AB  - The history of Japanese American incarceration is traditionally framed as one of the bleakest chapters in twentieth-century US history. Yet interest in the story of Japanese Americans and the lessons of the incarceration are not limited to the United States or the Japanese diaspora. This article examines media reactions to the story of the Japanese American incarceration and the redress movement of the 1980s in four Western European countries—the Netherlands, United Kingdom, West Germany, and France. In each country, media outlets discussed the redress movement and the Japanese American experience, larger issues of racism within the United States, and financial compensation for war victims. In doing so, these media accounts both dramatize the nature of public opinion on the subject of reparations and touch on larger debates on the collective memory of the Holocaust and colonialism that were emerging in Western Europe.

AN  - 2571979994
AB  - El objetivo principal de este estudio fue analizar los pasos dados por el gobierno de Indonesia para implementar diferentes políticas para su lucha contra el COVID-19. El gobierno de Indonesia ha tomado varias medidas, la más pertinente fueron las Restricciones sociales a gran escala (PSBB), para reducir la propagación de los casos de COVID-19. Este estudio utilizó un enfoque cualitativo como un estudio contextual que buscaba enfatizar el significado de un fenómeno en una situación de pandemia de COVID-19. El propósito de la investigación cualitativa era crear una imagen compleja. Los datos analizados se obtuvieron de diversas fuentes, incluida Internet, como los medios en línea y las redes sociales, y la literatura relacionada. Los datos se recopilaron utilizando Ncapture para la función Nvivo. El tiempo necesario para el análisis fue de marzo a mayo de 2020. Para realizar el análisis, este estudio también utilizó el software Nvivo 12 Plus. Esta investigación revela que las políticas gubernamentales, sobre todo las Restricciones Sociales a Gran Escala (PSBB), provocaron una disminución en la confianza pública. El aumento en el número de casos positivos de COVID-19 en varias regiones hasta mayo de 2020 ha hecho que las políticas gubernamentales consideradas no estén funcionando de manera óptima. Además, la crisis de confianza afecta el patrón de participación de la comunidad en la lucha contra la propagación de la pandemia de COVID-19 en Indonesia. Los hallazgos de esta investigación sugieren la necesidad de un estudio sobre cómo las políticas gubernamentales pueden funcionar bien y también respaldadas por la confianza públicaAlternate abstract:The main purpose of this study was to analyze the steps taken by the Indonesian government to implement different policies for its fight against COVID-19.

This study used a qualitative approach as a contextual study that sought to emphasize the meaning of a phenomenon in a COVID- 19 pandemic situation. The purpose of qualitative research was to make a complex picture.

Data were collected utilizing the Ncapture for the Nvivo feature. The time taken for analysis was from March to May 2020. In conducting the analysis, this study also used Nvivo 12 Plus software. This research reveals that the government policies, most importantly Large-Scale Social Restrictions (PSBB), triggered a decline in the public confidence. The increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in various regions up to May 2020 has made government policies deemed not running optimally. Further, the crisis of confidence affects the community's participatory pattern in combating the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in Indonesia. Findings from this research suggest the need for a study on how government policies can work well and also supported by the public trust.

I explore mainstream news coverage in Russia and Ukraine with a particular emphasis on how political leadership frames nationalist rhetoric in the two countries to emphasize certain issues over others. I focus on relevant media content that contains nationalist rhetoric before and after the invasion of Russia into Ukraine’s territory in the spring of 2014. Content analysis suggests that political leaders in both countries have focused on political issues, while largely ignoring economic issues in their nationalist rhetoric. The analysis also shows that state leaders can successfully promote nationalism by emphasizing cultural issues and concerns.

T1  - И всё-таки оно существует! К 50-летию доклада П. Бурдьё «Общественное мнение не существует»
TT  - And Yet It Does Exist! The 50th Anniversary of P. Bourideu's Report "Public Opinion Does Not Exist"
AN  - 2522424695
AB  - The article discusses sociological activity in the context of 50th anniversary of P. Bourdieu's insightful report "Public opinion does not exist". The basic points of the P. Bourdieu's argumentation amounting to tendentiousness, artificiality and political partisanship of public opinion are questioned. P. Bourdieu argues that surveys are far too simplistic to tell us anything about public opinion and this can be seen in the averaged estimates made up of numbers and statistics. Although P. Bourdieu does not believe that survey procedures are totally invalid, he asserts that media and policymakers completely misinterpret the process and results of public opinion pools. The key idea of the present paper is that attention to methodological problems of public opinion research may help increase the collective capital of the symbolic power of sociological science in Russia and elsewhere. Main difficulties to conceptualizing public opinion are related to methodological "multifamily" in modern sociological theory and to pluralism of socio-political life. Besides, sociological polemics about public opinion are associated with the opposites between researchers' and pollsters' approaches. Researchers are basically satisfied with a concept of public opinion which might be described not only as an object, but also as a method of sociological analysis of social reality. According to pollsters' position, public opinion is what is measured by quantitative surveys of target social groups. The article argues that some developments in survey practices include new thinking about how to recruit respondents, new methods for field control, and new approaches to reducing of the statistical error. At the same time, in the light of current theoretical disputes and taking into account Russian and global socio-political conditions, a need to ceaselessly defend scholarly status of sociology is emphasized.Alternate abstract:В статье обсуждаются перспективы социологической деятельности в свете 50-летнего юбилея доклада П. Бурдье «Общественное мнение не существует». Ключевая идея состоит в том, что привлечение внимания к методологическим проблемам изучения общественного мнения само по себе является вкладом в коллективный капитал символической власти социологов в России и за рубежом. Научной ревизии подвергаются тезисы французского социолога о тенденциозности, артефактности и политической ангажированности опросов общественного мнения. Основные сложностиконцептуализации данного феномена обусловлены методологической «многоквартирностью» современной социологии и плюрализмом общественно-политической жизни. Научная полемика также связана с принципиальным противостоянием полстеров и ученых-исследователей. Ученые-исследователи рассматривают общественное мнение не только как предмет, но и как метод социологической диагностики социальной реальности. Для полстеров общественное мнение – это скорее результат количественных опросов целевых социальных групп. Несмотря на совершенствование процедур и методов изучения общественного мнения, подчеркивается необходимость перманентного отстаи¬вания научного статуса социологии в контексте российских и мировых теоретических дискуссий и социально-политических реалий.

T1  - Security Perception and People Well-Being
AN  - 2509631457
AB  - This paper aims to present a methodology for monitoring and assessing the public perception of security on social media, given the great importance of security in determining the people’s well-being. The methodology is applied to different corpora obtained by collecting Twitter messages about three topics of the agenda setting related to security. It operates in two steps, in the first one, ETM is performed in order to identify topic representation and sentiment. In the second step, this information is transformed in a stream of numerical data and a composite index aggregates the information on the sentiment related to the three topics. The composite index embeds a penalty function, which reduces the weight of the sequences, which show the greatest volatility over time. Results show that this procedure allows for real-time measurement of the perception of security, which is mostly negative. It is net of the effect of communication hype, and it enables to quantify reliably any potential change in the public perception.

T1  - From “Just Say No” to “I Didn’t Inhale” to We Have “Bigger Fish to Fry”: The President, The Media, and Attitudes Toward Marijuana Legalization
AN  - 2472286549
AB  - Public opinion concerning marijuana legalization has varied greatly over time. While prior research suggests presidential drug rhetoric is related to public opinions on drugs, the relationship between the sitting president and attitudes specifically toward marijuana has not been explored. This study utilized data from the General Social Survey and the American Presidency Project to examine the relationship between the president and Americans’ attitudes toward marijuana legalization from 1975 through 2016. Findings indicate that confidence in the executive branch, fear of crime, and presidential drug rhetoric predict attitudes toward legalization despite controls for other factors such as estimated levels of marijuana use and arrests. These findings are discussed in the context of prior research that suggests presidential rhetoric, drug enforcement, and fear of crime may be related to American attitudes toward marijuana legalization.

T1  - Online Repression and Self-Censorship: Evidence from Southeast Asia
AN  - 2470862138
AB  - Governments around the world have crafted new laws to threaten, arrest, prosecute and incarcerate online political activists. While the primary effect of online repression is to silence criticism and forestall collective action, a secondary effect is to induce self-censorship among the masses. Yet scant research examines how self-censorship works, nor discusses its implications for entrenching authoritarianism and encouraging democratic backsliding. This article proposes a simple expected utility model of self-censorship, arguing that citizens will more likely self-censor when the expected costs of online political expression outweigh its benefits. Analysing the fourth wave of the Asian Barometer survey of 10,216 respondents across eight Southeast Asian countries, I find that higher income politically engaged social media users are indeed less likely to express their political opinions. Additionally, this correlation holds in states where online repression is most severe, but is non-existent in countries where online repression is moderate or low.

T1  - Family matters? Exploring media coverage of presidential candidates’ families by gender and race
AN  - 2571102457
AB  - Researchers have only recently begun to explore the role of parenthood and family in politics. While some scholars focus on the political attitudes of parents, others examine the advantages and disadvantages of politicians’ parental status on candidate viability. Building on the concept of politicized motherhood, we argue that focusing on candidates’ parental status alone provides an incomplete picture of the full range and symbolic functioning of family in political discourse. We coin the theory, politicized family, which includes narratives of candidates’ spouses, parents, grandparents, and children, and argue it provides a more useful frame for understanding these processes. We also move the literature forward by assessing how media coverage of families of presidential hopefuls varies along gendered and racialized lines. Using 2,458 articles and opinion pieces from the Washington Post, New York Times, and Wall Street Journal, we conduct a content analysis of candidate coverage from the 2004 and 2008 Democratic presidential primaries to explore how national print media portrays the family narratives of presidential candidates. Our results uncover both gendered and racialized family discourses embedded in media representations of presidential hopefuls. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of such portrayals for establishing candidates’ relatability and electoral viability.

T1  - A fake news inoculation? Fact checkers, partisan identification, and the power of misinformation
AN  - 2571101659
AB  - Previous research finds that misinformation is often difficult to correct once a person accepts it as truth. Nonetheless, a few studies have shown evidence that fact-checkers can help lower an individual’s susceptibility to believing false news and rumors. Our study builds on this research by examining the fact-checking inoculation effect on political misinformation (also known as “fake news”) that circulated on the Internet in the months following the election of President Donald Trump. Using an experimental design, we find only selected instances of inoculation effects. Instead, our results are consistent with previous studies that show individuals are more likely to accept or reject misinformation based on whether it is consistent with their pre-existing partisan and ideological beliefs. However, partisanship and ideology played a much stronger role in predicting believability for fake news stories critical of Democrats than stories critical of Republicans.

T1  - Do Improving Conditions Harden Partisan Preferences? Lived Experiences, Imagined Communities, and Polarized Evaluations
AN  - 2502808727
AB  - Despite growing attention to an increasing partisan divide and populist voting, little attention has been directed at how social contexts might encourage greater or lesser political polarization. We address this gap by studying how county-level conditions—economic resilience, population change, and community health—intersect with individuals’ political orientations and communication patterns to shape partisan evaluations. Our context is Wisconsin around the 2012 election, with our focus on two prominent political figures: Governor Scott Walker and President Barack Obama. Multilevel modeling reveals that partisans living in counties with more affluent, less precarious conditions during 2009–2012 exhibited more polarized partisan attitudes toward Walker and Obama. Our analysis also finds a significant role for interpersonal communication and digital media in shaping polarized attitudes.

T1  - Does Government Pay Attention to the Public? The Dynamics of Public Opinion and Government Attention in Posthandover Hong Kong
AN  - 2502806168
AB  - Government response to public opinion is essential to democratic theory and practice. However, previous research on the relationship between public opinion and government attention predominantly focuses on western societies. Little is known about such relationship in nonwestern or nondemocratic societies. Drawing upon time-series data of public opinion polls and government press releases, this study examines the dynamic relationships between public opinion and government attention in posthandover Hong Kong. The findings reveal that the responsiveness of the Hong Kong government to public opinion varies across issue domains and is constrained by the political power from the central government in Beijing.

T1  - THE PARADOX OF DISPARAGEMENT HUMOR: AN ANALYSIS OF WHATSAPP JOKES ON WOMEN IN THE FIGHT AGAINST THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
AN  - 2477274165
AB  - This qualitative theoretical paper hinges on literature and content analysis on the paradox of disparagement humor evoked by WhatsApp jokes that target women and are related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The paper employs the functionalist and feminist theory of mass media and the justification suppression model of prejudice as the bedrock to the debate and analysis. Although humor helps us to cope with pandemics, the paper finds several jokes on COVID-19 departing from this function and promoting dysfunctions such as humiliation and social exclusion of women. Inferences are made that such jokes that are derogatory and denigrating can elicit feelings of self-doubt and reduced physical and intellectual performance of women. The researcher advocates for assertive media polices and reforms that promote gender equality and freedom for all.

T1  - Intimacy Beyond Sex: Korean Television Dramas, Nonsexual Masculinities, and Transnational Erotic Desires
AN  - 2474491039
AB  - In the twenty-first century, Korean television dramas have gained transnational popularity in a phenomenon called Hallyu. Believing that these Korean television dramas accurately portray how Korean men are in real life, some white women from North America and Europe travel to Korea as Hallyu tourists to form intimate relations with Korean men. This essay is based on the data I gathered through ethnographic field research in 2017–18, during which I interviewed and observed these Hallyu tourists. Some of my Hallyu tourist informants claimed that they traveled to Korea because they were motivated by the nonsexual depictions of Korean men in the television dramas. They viewed Korean men as the racial, ethnic, and nonsexual others who would provide them with alternatives to sex-based intimacy. I examine my Hallyu tourist informants' desires for Korean men through the theoretical frameworks of nonsexuality and racialized erotics. I argue that some of my informants' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men reinforce Orientalist stereotypes about Korean men's sexuality. By examining the racial and sexual politics of some white female tourists' erotic desires for nonsexual Korean men, I demonstrate the indivisibility of nonsexuality from race.

T1  - The Emergence of COVID-19 in the US: A Public Health and Political Communication Crisis
AN  - 2466201064
AB  - The coronavirus public health crisis is also a political-communication and health-communication crisis. In this article, the authors describe the key communication-related phenomena and evidence of concerning effects manifested in the United States during the initial response to the pandemic. The authors outline the conditions of communication about coronavirus that contribute to deleterious outcomes, including partisan cueing, conflicting science, downplayed threats, emotional arousal, fragmented media, and Trump's messaging. The authors suggest these have contributed to divergent responses by media sources, partisan leaders, and the public alike, leading to different attitudes and beliefs as well as varying protective actions taken by members of the public to reduce their risk. In turn, these divergent communication phenomena will likely amplify geographic variation in and inequities with COVID-19 disease outcomes. The authors conclude with some suggestions for future research, particularly surrounding communication about health inequity and strategies for reducing partisan divergence in views of public health issues in the future.

T1  - Responsibilization and Sexual Stigma Under Austerity: Surveying Public Support for Government-Funded PrEP in England
AN  - 2449451437
AB  - IntroductionUnder austerity, governments shift responsibilities for social welfare to individuals. Such responsibilization can be intertwined with pre-existing social stigmas, with sexually stigmatized individuals blamed more for health problems due to “irresponsible” sexual behavior. To understand how sexual stigma affects attitudes on government healthcare expenditures, we examine public support for government-provisioned PrEP in England at a time when media narratives cast the drug as an expensive benefit for a small, irresponsible social group and the National Health Service’s long-term sustainability was in doubt.MethodsThis paper uses data from an original survey (N = 738) conducted in September 2016, when public opinion should be most sensitive to sexual stigma. A survey experiment tests how the way beneficiaries of PrEP were described affected support for NHS provision of it. Contrary to expectations, we found that support was high (mean = 3.86 on a scale of 1 to 5) irrespective of language used or beneficiary group mentioned. Differences between conditions were negligible.DiscussionSexual stigma does not diminish support for government-funded PrEP, which may be due to reverence for the NHS; resistance to responsibilization generally; or just to HIV, with the public influenced by sympathy and counter-messaging.Social policy implicationsHaving misjudged public attitudes, it may be difficult for the government to continue to justify not funding PrEP; the political rationale for contracting out its provision is unnecessary and flawed. With public opinion resilient to responsibilization narratives and sexual stigma even under austerity, welfare retrenchment may be more difficult than social policymakers presume.

T1  - President Moon Jae-in at Midterm: What Affects Public Support for Moon Jae-in?
AN  - 2439231658
AB  - Despite the unsuccessful outcomes of his policies on economic growth and North Korea, Moon Jae-in at midterm has received relatively high levels of job approval ratings compared to his immediate predecessors. What made it possible for him to maintain these ratings? To analyze this puzzle, we employed the three commonly noted leadership qualities—effective communication, political skill, and organizational capacity—suggested by presidential study scholars. We found that Moon Jae-in’s leadership qualities are not the compelling reason for his relatively high approval ratings. Instead, there are three alternative reasons for Moon Jae-in’s relatively high approval ratings: (a) better handling of the media; (b) collapse of the conservatives; and (c) multiple summit meetings with Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un. The latter two reasons are contextual factors, which are our theoretical contribution to the literature.

T1  - The segregated gun as an indicator of racism and representations in film
AN  - 2427422574
AB  - Film emphasizes an ironic history of racism in gun control and ownership and a justification for seeking justice among the Black community, but film also perpetuates structural racism and bias, segregating Black from White, and failing to promote equality, solidarity, and progress. The gun is both a symbol of structural racism, and an expression through which critical attitudes and political statements can carry greater meaning and lead to positive action, empowerment, and desegregation. The symbolic meaning of guns in the hands of Blacks as violent, exceptional or some other stereotypical character trope is illustrated using three selected films including: Django Unchained, John Q., and Proud Mary. This paper is divided into three acts: Act I: The gun as symbol of structural racism in film; Act II: Stereotypical characters and their guns; Act III: Desegregation of the gun in film. These sections illustrate the meaning and representation of the gun as a theatrical object in film, and when in the hands of stereotypical character tropes, has perpetuated racist beliefs and attitudes that have not been adequately addressed in the film industry. To desegregate the gun in film, filmmakers need to critically examine the overt and hidden film texts and how the gun, and the characters wielding it, are perceived among audiences.

T1  - Snowballing or wilting? What affects public support for varying models of basic income?
AN  - 2592964484
AB  - Recently, the idea of a universal basic income has received unprecedented attention from policymakers, the media and the wider public. This has inspired a plethora of surveys that seek to measure the extent of public support for the policy, many of which suggest basic income is surprisingly popular. However, in a review of past surveys, with a focus on the UK and Finland, we find that overall levels of support for basic income can vary considerably. We highlight the importance of survey design and, by employing new survey data in each country, compare the levels and determinants of support for varied models of basic income. Our results point to the importance of the multi-dimensionality of basic income and the fragility of public support for the idea. The findings suggest that the ability of political actors to mobilise the public in favour of basic income will eventually depend on the precise model they wish to implement.

T1  - The triangular relationship between public concern for environmental issues, policy output, and media attention
AN  - 2452394888
AB  - We theoretically argue for and empirically examine, for the first time, a triangular relationship between concern among citizens about the environment, media attention to environmental issues, and policy output. Previous work has studied these relationships, but analyzed the respective links rather in isolation from each other. This research has significant implications for the understanding of environmental policymaking and, more generally, informs the debate on whether politicians respond to what voters want and under what circumstances this occurs.

T1  - Celebrity Advocacy and Women’s Rights in Nigeria
AN  - 2448821640
AB  - To bring development closer to the reality of “ordinary” people, popular personalities, working on behalf of themselves, family, or organizations (profit and non-profit) in Africa have consistently given visibility to social problems to influence public opinion for positive transformation. The involvement of celebrities in development-centered issues has evoked debates from scholars in the global north who thought that their act is an extension of neoliberalism that sought to transform complex social realities into a spectacle of performance and entertainment for public amusement. While scholars in Europe and North America have engaged the intersections of celebrity advocacy and development discourse, little attention has been given to this phenomenon by their counterparts in Africa. Drawing from primary sources (including films, video, audio, newspaper articles, autobiography) as well as secondary data in the fields of sociology, women’s and gender studies, media, and popular culture, this paper examines the interrelatedness of celebrity advocacy and social reforms in Nigeria. It shows that while celebrity advocacy promotes awareness and consciousness about women’s rights, it often does not lead to protection (enforcement and change) in the socio-economic and political status of women.

T1  - Atmospherics of War A Response
AN  - 2494379874
AB  - This brief response to Neel Ahuja’s “Animal Death as National Debility” focuses on his analysis of the intersections of speciesism, racism, and ableism in Syrian war narratives. Ahuja insightfully untangles a media-driven, over-determined portrayal of the Syrian uprisings that began in 2011, as well as the subsequent war that was framed as one of the world’s first “climate wars.” The appropriation of war terminology in the framing of “climate wars” is a liberalization of the violence of the Syrian uprisings and the many conduits of its brutal repression, a ventriloquizing of atmospherics of violence on which some types of causal trajectories surface or sublimate others.

T1  - How Do Partisans Consume News on Social Media? A Comparison of Self-Reports With Digital Trace Measures Among Twitter Users
AN  - 2474691529
AB  - There are growing concerns that social media exacerbates the selective exposure of audience members to content that supports their political views. However, despite the hype, the existing literature does not fully address the extent to which social media users selectively consume like-minded news stories, in part due to different methodologies. In an attempt to move toward a common framework, this study examined the partisan selective exposure of a representative sample of Twitter users by combining survey data with digital trace data. Specifically, the study linked survey responses (n = 558) from Twitter users with their media following and exposure to news via their friends. The study found that selectivity bias was present in all types of data, including self-reported media consumption (survey), media following (Twitter), and indirect exposure to media (Twitter). However, the study found some differences between self-reports and digital measures such that the overlaps in media diets between partisan groups were much larger based on the digital trace data than the self-reported data. In addition, the study observed an asymmetric pattern of selective exposure between conservatives and liberals in the digital trace data, but not in the self-reported data. The implications of these findings are discussed with reference to the contemporary news environment, hostile media effects, and normative assumptions of selective exposure.

T1  - All the Muslims Fit to Print: Racial Frames as Mechanisms of Muslim Ethnoracial Formation in the <i>New York Times</i> from 1992 to 2010
AN  - 2451348986
AB  - A generative turn in scholarship examines the institutional and political dimensions of Islamophobia, conceptualizing Muslim representations as a mechanism of ethnoracial formation in which the media is one such site of racialization. Moments of great political and cultural transformation can motivate and activate these racial projects, generating racialized representations that attach racial meaning to bodies. Much of the research on Muslim representations in news media centers on this very question: did the attacks of 9/11 usher in a new racial project? Previous studies offer competing hypotheses. Bridging social movement and communication theories with a theory of ethnoracial formation, the author develops an approach for evaluating racial framing processes through a comparison of diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames. The author applies this approach using computational text analysis techniques to examine latent shifts in the racial framing of Muslims in the New York Times in the decade before and after 9/11. The author finds evidence of increasingly racialized, but more complex, representations of Muslims in the decade after 9/11 in which diagnostic frames evolve from locating social problems in states and institutions to locating social problems in Muslim bodies. Prognostic frames shift from institutional reforms to those targeting group pathology. The author argues that excavating the latent mechanisms of racial projects helps us better understand the dynamic and ongoing processes of ethnoracial formation.

T1  - Distrust persists after subverting atheist stereotypes: GPIR
AN  - 2451091742
AB  - Antiatheist prejudice appears to be common. This prejudice may stem from distrust. However, the factors influencing distrust are not fully understood. The current research identified common stereotypes about atheists, tested the intuitiveness of those stereotypes, and determined whether distrust toward atheists depends more on the label “atheist” or the attributes atheists are thought to possess. Study 1 (N = 100) and Study 2 (N = 149) identified several attributes thought to be most characteristic of atheists and least characteristic of Christians (or vice versa). Study 3 (N = 219) demonstrated that atheists and Christians are intuitively associated with the respective traits identified in Studies 1 and 2. Study 4 (N = 274) and Study 5 (N = 259) used fake social media profiles to manipulate target religious identification (atheist, Christian, or unspecified) and attributes (stereotypically atheist or stereotypically Christian) to determine the effect on trust ratings. Overall, the results of these studies indicate that atheists and Christians are explicitly and implicitly associated with different attributes and that, even when atheists possess stereotypically Christian attributes, Christians trust atheists significantly less than other Christians. These findings suggest that antiatheist prejudice is relatively insensitive to individual differences of the target.

T1  - Opinions that matter: the hybridization of opinion and reputation measurement in social media listening software
AN  - 2447818736
AB  - Since the 2000s, numerous start-ups and agencies have argued for the necessity of analyzing social media data to ‘know what people think’, as they are deemed to provide access to spontaneous expression of thoughts, tastes, and representations. How do these actors, and the various types of knowledge and technology they draw upon, change the way we know and act upon people’s opinions? This article offers insight on these understudied actors, by describing the emergence in France of a market for measuring online opinion. It shows two distinct trajectories of innovation, and the key role played by the early clients of these companies and by the demand for tools for online reputation management in the shaping of these instruments, and the definition of epistemic value. Both approaches of online opinion break with the classical egalitarian conception of public opinion. They instead conceive opinion as a mediated and collective process in which not all opinions have an equal value.

T1  - US prisms and prejudice through mediating the Middle East: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2447816139
AB  - Mediating the Middle East engages social and political constructions that articulate sentiment within the United States, with consequences not only to foreign policies and relationships, but also to experiences of Arab and Muslim citizens. Engagement with media narratives is expected to become particularly relevant when people do not share a resonating identity or direct experience with the community being projected. I position this research as an entry into how we might understand the primacy of dominant media narratives in shaping norms that contribute to discriminatory practices. Through this analysis, I focus on the concerns of Arab and Muslim Americans, considering the consequences of negative media characterizations of Islam, of Arab communities, and of the Middle East. This study builds on a national survey of adult United States citizens (n = 1416), with a targeted proportion of Arab American residents. These attitudes toward fellow citizens as well as foreign countries are considered in relation to extent of engagement with popular culture, specifically action-adventure given its role in Hollywood narratives featuring the Middle East. Attitudes toward Arab and Muslim communities within the United States as well as in the Middle East are demonstrated to be related to this form of media engagement.

T1  - Exploring the Bottom-Up Reform of Sex Offender Registration in China: Carceral Feminism and Populist Authoritarianism
AN  - 2440540293
AB  - In 2017, the Minhang District of Shanghai introduced sex offender registration. This reform attracted positive reactions on social media. Local governments in Jiangsu, Guangdong and Chongqing quickly followed the precedent. In 2019, the central government announced that it will establish national sex offender registries by 2022, although it limited the scope of registration to paedophiles. This study explores how this bottom-up reform unfolded and what implications it has in theory and practice. Based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of 2261 posts on Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, this study reveals two major players in the current reform: the Chinese feminists who are pursuing a punitive agenda online (a phenomenon known as ‘carceral feminism’), and the local governments that are eager to win the public’s trust, although such trust is mainly reserved for the central authority in the Chinese political culture (a culture known as ‘populist authoritarianism’). Drawing on the findings, this study pushes the discussion about Chinese penal policy beyond the dichotomy of ‘penal professionalism’ and ‘penal populism’. It argues that while the influence of professionalism is evident in central-level policy making, local penal policies can be easily led by populist punitiveness. The latter deserves more academic attention. This study also takes a non-partisan approach to the feminist movements on Chinese social media. It reveals the class conflicts and regional inequality underlying the gender schism. The polarisation effect in online discussion is also highlighted, which alerts policy makers to the reliability of ‘public opinion’ online. (246 words).

T1  - What you See Is What you Get? Investigating how Survey Context Shapes the Association between Media Consumption and Attitudes about Crime
AN  - 2438129372
AB  - Research on the relationship between media consumption and perceptions of or feelings about crime often relies on survey data. This research, however, rarely if ever contextualizes the content of that media within the analyses. This study explored how media type, frequency of use, and content are related to measures of beliefs about crime. Using survey data from four different years, we tested the relationship between media consumption, perceptions of the crime rate, worry about crime, and anger about crime. We used regressions to investigate what types of media are associated with public opinions on crime, and to examine how these relationships differ across years. We then contextualized our findings by highlighting both local and national news stories about crime that occurred leading up to and during the time that each of these surveys was in the field. Results indicated that local news had the most consistent effect on the three outcomes across years, and other types of media were important when high-profile cases and political debates were in the news cycle. In order to tell a fuller story about the effects of media on beliefs about crime and justice, we argue that future research should consider mixed-methods approaches to place surveys into social context.

T1  - The media in the Spanish transition to democracy (1975–82)
AN  - 2479057979
AB  - The transformations in Spain from the 1960s onwards in relation to communication resulted in a new legislation that allowed a certain liberalization to try to legitimize the Franco regime. Despite the information repression, some media outlets (especially magazines) became channels for the dissemination of democratic ideas and spaces for debate. In addition, the lack of consolidation in the socialization of the values of the ‘18 of July’ in the first stages of the dictatorship led to a more successful technocratic socialization to favour the depoliticization and demobilization of Spanish society. The interpretations on how this communication pseudo-space was decisive, during the last years of the Franco regime, for the formation of public opinion in democratic Spain have not taken into account a significant factor that allows overcoming the opposition between the emergence of civil society and the persistence of some values from Francoism. This factor is the enormous disparity in culture and media consumption, with its reflection in education and, more generally, in economic inequality.

T1  - Confidence in political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID–19 in a highly polarized environment
AN  - 2476854782
AB  - The COVID-19 virus poses an unprecedented level of risk to the health and well-being of the entire global population. As of the writing of this article (June 2020), the United States has the largest number of confirmed cases with more than 2 million and there are over 120,000 deaths (Johns Hopkins University). This public health crisis has since led to cascading effects such as a rapidly rising unemployment rate, deteriorating mental health (Ammerman et al., 2020), and disturbed stock market (Baker et al., 2020) among others. By several accounts, the U.S. government's response to this pandemic is judged to be inadequate (Science, 2020). Because this coronavirus is novel, its full impact on the human population remains unknown. It represents a classic case of an unknown and dreadful risk that can generate heightened societal risk perceptions (Slovic, 1987). Under a great number of uncertainties surrounding this novel coronavirus, the American public has to rely on various authorities such as political leaders, governments, the media, and scientists for information about this disease. President Trump, to his credit, frequently communicates with the public about the evolving situation through the White House daily briefings. Key members of the coronavirus task force including its chair Vice President Mike Pence often appear on the side of the President. The public indeed shows a substantial level of confidence in officials at the Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC), and state and local elected officials (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The public evaluations for President Trump and the news media handling the coronavirus outbreak tend to be divided along a party-line (Pew Research Center, 2020 a). The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have become a politicized issue in this highly polarized political environment, along with a long list of issues such as immigration, abortions, and climate change. Confronted with the historical challenges posed by COVID-19, how the American public perceives such risks warrants close investigation. Our overarching question is how does confidence in political leaders shape American public risk perceptions of COVID-19? Numerous studies have shown the link between risk perception and risk mitigation behaviors (Huang et al., 2012; Shao et al., 2017a, 2017b). Heightened risk perceptions are conducive to the adoption of risk mitigation behaviors. In this study, we aim to examine how confidence in national political leaders, attitudes towards the media, along with socio-demographic characteristics and political predisposition influence American public risk perceptions of COVID-19. Further, we attempt to examine how confidence in national political leaders can slant risk perceptions of COVID-19 among different segments of the population, especially people with different political ideologies. We analyze a national sample of respondents to a survey conducted in early March, approximately two months after the first reported COVID-19 case in the U.S. on January 21. Results of this study can shed light on the formation of risk perceptions of this ongoing public health crisis. Furthermore, the results are believed to provide useful insights to policymakers.

T1  - Aggressive confrontation shapes perceptions and attitudes toward racist content online: GPIR
AN  - 2447808038
AB  - With more people using social media on a daily basis and the prevalence of racial discrimination online, it becomes imperative to understand what factors impact minority individuals’ perceptions of these transgressions in an online context. Confrontation to discrimination in the form of comments on social media may meaningfully shape perceptions of racism online. Across three studies, we examine how confrontation type (aggressive vs. passive) and confronter group membership (ingroup vs. outgroup) influence Asian Americans’ perceptions of online prejudice and attitudes towards the confronters. In Study 1, we find that aggressive confrontations alter perceptions of a racist online post to be more offensive as compared to passive confrontations. In Study 2, these findings extend to participants’ likelihood to report the content as offensive. Lastly, in Study 3, we find that aggressive confronters are evaluated more positively than passive confronters. These findings have important implications for understanding racial discrimination in an online context by demonstrating the impact of confrontation type on minority individuals’ perceptions and behaviors.

T1  - The normalization of the populist radical right in news interviews: a study of journalistic reporting on the Swedish democrats
AN  - 2435504656
AB  - Focusing on the salient case of news interviewing, this paper investigates the role of journalism in the normalization of radical right-wing politics and the discourses of nationalism and nativism. Normalization is related to transformations in the socio-political landscape, the discursive strategies of political actors, the professional norms of journalism, and the discursive positioning of political views in news reporting. Data include news interviews with the leaders of the Swedish right-wing populist party, the Swedish Democrats. A discourse- and conversation analytical approach is applied to analyze the discursive representations and positioning of political views in four different contexts of interviewing: routine news events, political scandals, live two-party interviews, and set piece interviews. The study shows an overall tendency to normalize and legitimize the political views and language of the radical right. Distinctive practices and mechanisms are identified. The study highlights the challenges of journalism, related to the normalizing implications of the restricted forms of impartiality applied in news journalism.

T1  - “Fake News Is Anything They Say!” — Conceptualization and Weaponization of Fake News among the American Public
AN  - 2435147123
AB  - This study examines the articulation of public opinion about so-called fake news using a national survey (N = 510) of U.S. adults conducted in 2018. We coded respondents’ open-ended answers about what is “fake news” and found that while some respondents adopted a politically neutral, descriptive definition, others provided a partisan, accusatory answer. Specifically, the weaponization of fake news was evident in the way respondents used the term to blame adversarial political and media targets. Perceptions of fake news prevalence, partisanship strength, and political interest were associated with a higher likelihood of providing a politicized and accusatory response about fake news. Accusations were polarized as a function of partisan identity and positively correlated with affective polarization. Results are discussed in light of the linguistic distinction of the term and what it means in the context of news media distrust and polarization.

T1  - De-capitalizing Mindfulness in Education
AN  - 2429445678
AB  - This paper aims to analyze mindfulness in education from a critical perspective. We first examine the historical underpinnings of human capital theory, which encourages educators to view students as efficient laborers in a neo-liberal society. Using the lens of Bourdieu’s capital theory, we further examine how mass media inadvertently distorts the definition of mindfulness by exploring the development of a specific mass media story and by identifying how mass media factors beyond headlines and titles reframe mindfulness. We argue that this type of reframing has created a public perception of students who practice mindfulness as not only successful in social relationships but also as valued laborers who expand economic growth. This analysis opens two doors of discourse. First, mindfulness in education should be de-capitalized and shifted toward a spiritual focus. Second, we ask educational writers and publishers to redirect mindfulness applications away from their original purpose.

T1  - TWO STEPS FORWARD, ONE STEP BACK
AN  - 2573887320
AB  - Drawing on original interview data, this article analyses the impact of social media on Indian Women Human Rights Defenders (WHRDs). It argues that social media can help WHRDs to expand their advocacy, but can also leave them open to online threats, which can translate into offline risks. It also argues that WHRDs face threats due to their gender, as well as other factors, meaning that it is vital to consider this topic in both a gender-sensitive and intersectional way. Overall, this article concludes that social media both helps and harms WHRDs.

T1  - Performing Artivism: Feminists, Lawyers, and Online Legal Mobilization in China
AN  - 2546608596
AB  - In authoritarian contexts where the state is the primary performer in the public sphere and legal mobilization is constrained and repressed, activists often seek to carve out a public space to confront the frontstage and backstage of the state’s performance in order to pursue collective action. Comparing the online legal mobilization of feminist and lawyer activists in China, this article investigates how performance arts are used by activists to challenge the authoritarian state in the age of social media. Performing “artivism” is to create conspicuous spectacles in the public eye for the purposes of exposing the state’s illegal or repressive backstage actions or promoting alternative values and norms different from the official ideology. By subversively disrupting the evidential boundaries set by the state, Chinese activists have been able to gain momentum and public support for their legal mobilization. However, it was precisely the success of their artivism that contributed to the government crackdowns on both feminists and lawyers in 2015.

T1  - The public salience of crime, 1960–2014: Age–period–cohort and time–series analyses
AN  - 2430634694
AB  - The public salience of crime has wide‐ranging political and social implications; it influences public trust in the government and citizens’ everyday routines and interactions, and it may affect policy responsiveness to punitive attitudes. Identifying the sources of crime salience is thus important. Two competing theoretical models exist: the objectivist model and the social constructionist model. According to the first, crime salience is a function of the crime rate. According to the second, crime salience is a function of media coverage and political rhetoric, and trends in crime salience differ across population subgroups as a result of differences in their responsiveness to elite initiatives. In both theories, period‐level effects predominate. Variation in crime salience, however, may also reflect age and cohort effects. Using data from 422,504 respondents interviewed between 1960 and 2014, we first examine the nature of crime salience using hierarchical age–period–cohort (HAPC) models and then analyze period‐level predictors using first differences. We find that 1) crime salience varies mostly at the period level; 2) crime salience trends are parallel (cointegrated) across demographic, socioeconomic, and partisan groups; and 3) crime salience trends within every population subgroup are most consistent with the constructionist model. The crime rate does not exert a significant effect in any subgroup.

T1  - Between Fears, Contacts and Family Dynamics: the Anti-Immigrant Attitudes in Italy
AN  - 2002369548
AB  - Empirical research on sources of prejudice and anti-immigrant hostility has grown considerably over the years, and the literature on the topic has become substantial firstly in classical receiving countries and in recent years also in Europe. This work analyses the anti-immigrant attitudes in Italy. The main results of this study are three. The first is the importance of individual characteristics in explaining anti-immigrant hostility: much of the variability in anti-immigrant hostility is due to individual characteristics, and in particular to the educational level achieved. Second, contacts have opposite effect on hostility: real contacts (i.e., real interpersonal contacts) decrease anti-immigrant hostility, while abstract contacts (i.e., contacts mediated by mass media) increase hostility towards migrants. Third, anti-immigrant hostility is lower among issues concerning family immigration dynamics.

T1  - Is faking news a side effect of hyperconnectivity?
AN  - 2283953302
AB  - This special issue of Sociologia e Politiche Sociali is devoted to a topic that has kept public opinion awake in the last few years: fake news. The term "fake news" has become part of everyday language and in principle it does not need much explanation (although, as we shall soon see, this obviousness is not at all obvious). The social issue of fake news, on the other hand, still needs an explanation, at least from a sociological standpoint. The only thing that we know for sure for now is that fake news give rise to much concern: practically all social fields, from politics to medicine, from mass media to education, from economy to religion, feel somehow threatened by the uncontrolled spread of false news. In its 2013 report, the World Economic Forum (2013, 25) stated that one of the global risks of a hyperconnected society is the massive disinformation that is spread through digital media. Unlike traditional mass media, such as the printed press, radio or television, digital media in fact favour "self-amplified information loops" which would have been unthinkable in the pre-Internet age. In its 2018 report, the World Economic Forum (2018, 48ff.) once again reaffirmed this concern, moving form the rather explicit assumption that unexpected political events such as the Brexit referendum and US presidential elections may have been somehow steered by fake news and disinformation. Two years before, the Oxford Dictionary chose "post-truth" as word of the year.

T1  - Does media coverage influence public attitudes towards welfare recipients? The impact of the 2011 English riots
AN  - 1795388644
AB  - Following the shooting of Mark Duggan by police on 4 August 2011, there were riots in many large cities in the UK. As the rioting was widely perceived to be perpetrated by the urban poor, links were quickly made with Britain's welfare policies. In this paper, we examine whether the riots, and the subsequent media coverage, influenced attitudes toward welfare recipients. Using the British Social Attitudes survey, we use multivariate difference-in-differences regression models to compare attitudes toward welfare recipients among those interviewed before (pre-intervention: i.e. prior to 6 August) and after (post-intervention: 10 August-10 September) the riots occurred (N=3,311). We use variation in exposure to the media coverage to test theories of media persuasion in the context of attitudes toward welfare recipients. Before the riots, there were no significant differences between newspaper readers and non-readers in their attitudes towards welfare recipients. However, after the riots, attitudes diverged. Newspaper readers became more likely than non-readers to believe that those on welfare did not really deserve help, that the unemployed could find a job if they wanted to and that those on the dole were being dishonest in claiming benefits. Although the divergence was clearest between right-leaning newspaper and non-newspaper readers, we do not a find statistically significant difference between right- and left-leaning newspapers. These results suggest that media coverage of the riots influenced attitudes towards welfare recipients; specifically, newspaper coverage of the riots increased the likelihood that readers of the print media expressed negative attitudes towards welfare recipients when compared with the rest of the population.

T1  - Does change in minority and women's representation on television matter?: a 30-year study of television portrayals and social tolerance
AN  - 2571055024
AB  - Increases in substantive portrayals of working women, racial groups, and sexual minorities on television are a common explanation for some of the observed increase in social tolerance over the last few decades. In this study, I first document change in these portrayals from 1970 to 2000. After doing so, I determine if higher levels of recurring portrayals are associated with greater levels of social tolerance for those who report watching larger amounts of television. If no association is found, this would validate claims of non-existent or minimal effects. The findings show that frequent television viewers generally have more negative attitudes as compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals of these groups are low. However, television viewers have similar or higher levels of social tolerance compared with non-viewers when recurring portrayals become frequent. This supports the argument that increasing televised portrayals of women and minorities on television can help increase social tolerance, but differences in the substance and quality of these portrayals likely condition this link.

T1  - The Media, Democracy, and Spectacle: Some Critical Reflections
AN  - 1787457310
AB  - In this essay, I document shifts in the political mediascape of the United States during the past fifteen years, focusing on the rise of partisan television networks and radio shows of the Left and the Right and the rise of alternative media and social networking that provided a wide diversity of opinion and critique of the dominant political and corporate order. I argue that this shift in the US mediascape helped elect Barack Obama, which in turn intensified contestation for and against Obama and the Democrats within contemporary US politics. I then indicate how Barack Obama used the media and media spectacle to successfully win the 2008 and 2012 US presidential elections. I conclude with a discussion of how new and alternative media can help to promote genuine democratic debate and help disseminate the full range of information and ideas necessary to have a robustly democratic social order.

T1  - Field Experimental Designs for the Study of Media Effects
AN  - 1531931350; 201424018
AB  - Field experimentation is a promising but seldom used method for studying the effects of media messages on political attitudes and behavior. The practical challenges of conducting media experiments in real-world settings often come down to securing cooperation from research partners, such as political campaigns. To do so, researchers must be prepared to adapt their experimental designs to satisfy the constraints imposed by research partners and the media environment in which they operate. This article provides an overview of some alternative field experimental designs that allow researchers to maintain the advantages of random assignment while addressing practical considerations. Examples are drawn from the growing field experimental literature examining the effects of television, radio, and online communication. Adapted from the source document.
