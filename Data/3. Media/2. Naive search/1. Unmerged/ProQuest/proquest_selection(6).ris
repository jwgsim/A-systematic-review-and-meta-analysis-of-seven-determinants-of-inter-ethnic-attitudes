T1  - Impacts on food policy from traditional and social media framing of moral outrage and cultural stereotypes
AN  - 2284863376
AB  - Food policy increasingly attempts to accommodate a wider and more diverse range of stakeholder interests. However, the emerging influence of different communities and networks of actors with localized concerns and interests around how food should be produced and traded, can challenge attempts to achieving more open, sustainable and globally-integrated food chains. This article analyses how cultural factors internal to a developed country can disrupt the export of food to a developing country. A framing analysis is applied to examine how activists using social media to interact with the traditional news media in Australia were able to inflame public opinion and provoke outrage to disrupt the policy agenda. The paper contains a case study analysis of the media controversy in 2011 around the slaughter of beef cattle in Indonesian abattoirs and the subsequent banning of live cattle exports to Indonesia by Australia. The analysis draws on the theory of binary cultural oppositions to examine how practices in relation to the slaughter of beef cattle in Indonesia were reframed, through extensive media coverage of moral outrage into a critique of the values and cultural practices of Indonesian society.

T1  - A Journey Researching Prejudice and Discrimination
AN  - 2404395244
AB  - This paper surveys 1 of the author's 3 lifetime research themes, namely the social psychology of prejudice and discrimination. We first review large-scale surveys documenting the prevalence of prejudice and discrimination suffered by minorities in Canada including Indigenous, African Canadians, Francophone minorities in EnglishCanada, and English-speaking communities in Quebec. There is growing evidence of the mental and physical health consequences of being victim of discrimination in Canada and elsewhere in the world. We review laboratory studies using the Minimal Group Paradigm showing that the mere categorisation of people as us versus them and ingroup identification is sufficient to trigger prejudice and discrimination. In line with Social Identity Theory, the degree of ingroup identification and the need to achieve a positive social identity help account for the classic ingroup favoritism effect obtained in Minimal Group Paradigm studies. Thus, both social identity needs (Social Identity Theory) and competition for scarce resources articulated within Realistic Conflict Theory combine to account for prejudice, discrimination, and intergroup antagonisms. Interventions to reduce prejudice and discrimination are discussed including intergroup contact and diversity training. As scientific consultant, the author helped develop the French Radio-Canada television documentary, La Leçon de Discrimination, which won best television educational program in the world and was successfully adapted as a prodiversity pedagogical tool in Canada and worldwide.

AB  - This article analyses media representations of Lashawn Chan (dog) and Stevens Chan Kum Fai (human), who are considered the first recorded service animal–human team in Malaysia. The article reflects on the pair’s public relationship as an intersectional, multi-framework that is relevant to both disability and animal justice. Following both critical animal and disability studies literature, we read media reports of Lashawn and Stevens’ public encounters. These stories frame the pair as spectacle, threat, and resource. They reveal the influences of cultural and social conventions that utilise guide dogs as advocacy tools, as well as public attitudes towards guide dogs and their users in Malaysian and western contexts. The authors advocate for alternative representations based on interspecies interdependence.

T1  - Migrant Crisis in European Multilingual Media: Identity Construction across Languages
AN  - 2429851680
AB  - International news articles published in various languages are usually tailored by the editors for their target readers in the corresponding language. On the one hand, the transformations made to the textual structure of news are intended to offer better accessibility to the information and make it more relevant to the readers in the target culture. On the other hand, the domestication of news provides compatibility with social attitudes, cultural background and shared knowledge of language users. Many such adjustments are made to the structures related to national and cultural identities and their construction. This paper will consider rhetorical and linguistic devices of discursive identity construction in the media coverage of events related to the EU migration crisis in four European languages (English, French, German and Spanish), as well as analyze their potential role in framing public opinion towards the migrant crisis.

T1  - Closeted love? Borders of (mediated) belonging in ‘minority radio broadcasting’
AN  - 2407556788
AB  - Ethnic minority communities have been utilizing various forms of media for the struggle for rights and recognition for ethnic minorities and migrants, aiming to subvert mainstream discourses, and engage in creative tactics and strategies to struggle for equal rights, opportunities, supportive public opinion and inclusive policy-making/policy change. Whilst social media has become the major platform for ethnic minorities to express these struggles, there has been growing concerns on the role of (radio) broadcasting as a better/more effective channel for ethnic ‘activism’. This article aims to unravel the divergent narrativity and politics of ‘minority recognition’ in the broadcasting space: How have the technological and institutional features of public service broadcasting enabled minority mediated belonging. At the same time, has this also hampered their chances of being heard? Through sample surveys, textual analysis as well as focused interviews, the article hopes to articulate the nuanced strategic and diverse ‘regimes’ of minority recognition by way of discussing the role of broadcasting as a space of (mediated) belonging. I also hope to contribute to the debates about the intricate bordering and politics of affective listening, in the case of public service broadcasting, and particularly in an ethnoscape such as Hong Kong

T1  - The Impact of Negative Parasocial and Vicarious Contact with Refugees in the Media on Attitudes toward Refugees
AN  - 2353409278
AB  - Contact with members of outgroups is an important factor for ingroup members’ attitudes toward these groups. Ingroup members can also come into contact with outgroups in the media. This media contact can take different forms: parasocial contact, when the audience simply observes outgroups; or vicarious contact, when ingroup audience members witness fellow ingroup members interacting with outgroups. However, extant research does not test whether these two forms of media contact differ in their effects on outgroup attitudes. In addition, we lack empirical evidence on the negative media contact effects and the role of predispositions, such as previous personal contact with outgroups. In two experiments, we test the differential effects of negative parasocial and vicarious contact on audience members who differ in their previous personal contact with refugees. The results show that negative parasocial and vicarious contact increase negative outgroup attitudes (Studies 1 & 2). While study 1 shows that negative vicarious contact results in more negative attitudes toward refugees, especially for people with no or little contact, a replication study does not corroborate this finding. Overall, negative parasocial and vicarious contact with refugees increase prejudice toward refugees. Personal contact does not inoculate individuals against this mediated contact effect.

T1  - 99 Reasons and He Ain’t One: A Content Analysis of Domestic Homicide News Coverage
AN  - 2334663682
AB  - Domestic violence is a widespread issue, with victims suffering emotional and physical harm and severe cases resulting in homicide. Media presentation of these extreme instances may affect public opinion and related policies. The current study considered the portrayal of domestic homicides in Canadian print news, using articles published in the Vancouver Sun between 2004 and 2015. A content analysis shows domestic homicides were portrayed as isolated incidents and perpetuated the notions of victim blaming and offender excusing, rather than as connected to a pattern of domestic violence. This portrayal may affect how domestic violence and homicides are perceived and addressed.

T1  - Journalists’ Use of Social Media to Infer Public Opinion: The Citizens’ Perspective
AN  - 2334173886
AB  - Journalists increasingly use social media data to infer and report public opinion by quoting social media posts, identifying trending topics, and reporting general sentiment. In contrast to traditional approaches of inferring public opinion, citizens are often unaware of how their publicly available social media data are being used and how public opinion is constructed using social media analytics. In this exploratory study based on a census-weighted online survey of Canadian adults (N = 1,500), we examine citizens’ perceptions of journalistic use of social media data. We demonstrate that (1) people find it more appropriate for journalists to use aggregate social media data rather than personally identifiable data, (2) people who use more social media are more likely to positively perceive journalistic use of social media data to infer public opinion, and (3) the frequency of political posting is positively related to acceptance of this emerging journalistic practice, which suggests some citizens want to be heard publicly on social media while others do not. We provide recommendations for journalists on the ethical use of social media data and social media platforms on opt-in functionality.

Using a novel dataset of images accompanying immigration news stories in three major news magazines from 2000–2010, we examine the extent to which press coverage helped set the stage for this sort of racialised and gendered association. We find overwhelming support for the ‘bad hombres’ hypothesis, demonstrating that in comparison to the true demographics of immigrants in the U.S., press portrayals significantly over-represent Latino men and under-represent all other immigrant groups. Our results are particularly important in light of research demonstrating that individuals’ political attitudes are influenced by the perceived ‘target group,’ or beneficiary, of a given policy, as well as scholarship demonstrating the media’s role in fostering a sense of ‘Latino threat.’

T1  - How Cross-Cutting News Exposure Relates to Candidate Issue Stance Knowledge, Political Polarization, and Participation: The Moderating Role of Political Sophistication
AN  - 2431020251
AB  - This article seeks to improve our understanding of the role of cross-cutting news exposure in a democratic process—that is, whether and how exposure to counter-attitudinal news information is associated with citizens’ political issue knowledge, attitudinal polarization, and engagement in political activities. The results provide 2 contrasting roles of exposure to dissonant media outlets. On the one hand, results offer some evidence that dissonant media use contributes to gaining issue knowledge and inspiring citizen participation. On the other hand, some findings suggest that it reinforces, rather than attenuates, citizens’ attitudinal polarization. Thus, the findings from this study indicate mixed effects of exposure to counter-attitudinal news information.

T1  - Crowd-sourcing justice: tracking a decade's news coverage of cyber vigilantism throughout the Greater China region
AN  - 2311936010
AB  - Examining how a newly emerged communication practice has been presented in press reports over time could help delineate the evolvement that the public perception of the practice has undergone. This study analyses how press coverage in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan framed the practice of cyber vigilantism - defined as a mediated search whereby people use digital media to look for and publicize private information about some individuals - over a decade span. We found that despite its controversies, the practice has been greeted with great enthusiasm since 2006. The public responses tended to become conservative in recent years. The news coverage in China provided more rigorous discussion about cyber vigilantism and contained a greater mix of optimistic and critical responses than that in Taiwan and Hong Kong. Implications of these findings are discussed in details.

T1  - It Takes a Village: A Social Network Approach to NGOs’ International Public Engagement: PROD
AN  - 2298076871
AB  - Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), like most strategic communicators, are challenged with breaking through the saturated international media environment as they attempt to influence public opinion. Yet, before strategic communicators can build an agenda, they must get attention from the public. The current study examined how NGOs’ network positions in the public Twitter discussion of the global refugee crisis influenced the public engagement NGOs received during two news events. Drawing from network theory and research, we posed two parallel sets of hypotheses. First, we predicted that NGOs with characteristics of “star” network structures will be well-situated in the network to garner attention. Second, we hypothesized that the “village” around an NGO also contributes to capturing attention. The results from our regressions offer evidence to support both hypotheses.

T1  - Cyber-Routines, Political Attitudes, and Exposure to Violence-Advocating Online Extremism
AN  - 2447241820
AB  - The Internet’s relatively unfettered transmission of information risks exposing individuals to extremist content. Using online survey data (N = 768) of American youth and young adults, we examine factors that bring individuals into contact with online material advocating violence. Combining aspects of social structure-social learning theory with insights from routine activity theory, we find that exposure to violence-advocating materials is positively correlated with online behaviors, including the use of social media platforms and the virtual spaces individuals frequent. Target antagonism is also correlated with exposure to violence-advocating materials, but guardianship and online and offline associations are not. Finally, feelings of dissatisfaction with major social institutions and economic disengagement are associated with exposure to violent materials online.

T1  - Soft power, culture and modernity: Responses to Bollywood films in Thailand and the Philippines: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2244986043
AB  - India's official embrace of the soft power concept and the popular equation of Bollywood films with India's international image are discussed here with reference to their contemporary convergence. This article seeks to make the case that the underlying claims of the soft power doctrine necessitate an empirical test at the level of grassroots reception. Further, this article also seeks to shift the emphasis from ‘impressing the West’ towards interrogating the dynamics of India's cultural diplomacy in other Asian states. With these aims in mind, this article presents two qualitative case studies from Chiang Mai, Thailand and Metro Manila in the Philippines. The responses collected indicate the inherent complexities of Inter-Asian dialogues on culture and modernity as well as the importance of the local media environment in determining perceptions of contemporary India. Ultimately, the capacity of popular culture to create a positive impression and to counter existing prejudices and misconceptions is supported in a series of reception studies. At the same time, the ‘moral superiority’ and historical legacies that are assumed to underpin India's cultural prestige in the region are challenged by the content and tone of these responses from the general public. In the contemporary setting of Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN), it becomes clear that the mediation of Indian culture operates within an increasingly transnational media environment and a competitive modernity that informs comparative perspectives between Asian cultures.

T1  - Tainted Love: How Stigmatization of a Political Party in News Media Reduces Its Electoral Support
AN  - 2430088371
AB  - In contemporary democracies, a political party typically needs good press to attract voters. A glum scenario for a party would be that news media systematically stigmatize it. To what extent does stigmatization lower its electoral support? This article examines voters’ reactions to news media coverage of the Dutch party PVV. Using a media content analysis linked to a 2014 panel survey of a sample representative of the Dutch electorate, we find that, among voters who held anti-immigrant attitudes, exposure to stigmatization lowered these voters’ perceived legitimacy of the PVV. This, in turn, decreased their propensity to vote for that party. This suggests that stigmatization can be a strong tool in the hands of those who intend to damage a party.

T1  - Welfare imaginaries at the interregnum
AN  - 2270408954
AB  - The construction of a welfare imaginary to be animated and circulated via media, formal and informal discussion and public debate is explored. The welfare imaginary was initially ambitious and far-reaching, drawing on ideas of social providence and mass services and it included a wide range of services. Social attitudes towards the welfare state have shifted considerably following the economic downturn in Great Britain which has been accompanied by a hardening of public opinion towards the welfare state and towards people claiming welfare benefits. Media representations of welfare have been central in this reshaping of public attitudes.

T1  - Politics, power, and performativity in the newsroom: an ethnography of television journalism in Turkey
AN  - 2250554161
AB  - How do political divisions within the newsroom shape negotiations around news production? This article addresses this question by examining how Turkish journalists, in their discourse and practices, represent Kurds and Arabs when interpreting and discussing current events related to the Kurdish question and the Arab Spring. The study draws upon a year of ethnographic fieldwork, and interviews conducted in 2011 and 2012, in the newsrooms of two mainstream national television channels in Turkey. It reveals how journalists with opposing political beliefs perform their representational practices by continuously modifying them according to the opinions of managerial boards. In negotiations on the portrayal of Kurds and Arabs in news reports, journalists mask or modify ‘undesired’ aspects of their individual interpretations to fit them into a dominant news frame. However, they can also challenge that frame. Based upon the observation of such negotiations, this article advances a novel definition of journalistic performance as a purposeful, strategic, and staged form of symbolic communication: an essential tool for navigating ideological conflicts in the power structure of the newsroom.

T1  - Combined Forces: Thinking and/or Feeling? How News Consumption Affects Anti-Muslim Attitudes through Perceptions and Emotions about the Economy
AN  - 2207926729
AB  - This study develops a model that contributes to our understanding of the complex relationship between economic motivations and anti-Muslim attitudes by analyzing the underexplored role of news consumption. Using a large-scale Dutch panel dataset (n = 2694), we test a structural equation model theoretically grounded in group conflict theory, in which the relationship between news consumption and anti-Muslim attitudes is mediated by perceptions and emotions about the economy. Findings offer sound empirical support for the hypothesized model: news consumption increases pessimistic economic perceptions and negative emotions about the economy, which in turn strengthens anti-Muslim attitudes. The mechanism, however, largely depends on the type of news outlet and genre: watching television seems more decisive than reading newspapers; moreover, especially exposure to soft and popular news formats plays a dominant role.

T1  - Bringing Propaganda Back into News Media Studies
AN  - 2207061070
AB  - With the ascendance of liberal democracy, propaganda activities have vastly increased. The main aim of propaganda has been to protect state-corporate power from the threat of public understanding and participation. Because of its societal importance for public opinion formation, the news media constitutes an obvious channel for the dissemination of propaganda. However, contemporary communication, media and journalism studies have mostly neglected to critically assess the news media’s role in producing and distributing propaganda. In fact, despite of the news media’s integration into the state-corporate nexus, the term propaganda is rarely used in academic treatises on the news media. Furthermore, only a small number of scholars have engaged in elaborating a systematic understanding of the manifold propaganda techniques that are currently applied in liberal democracies. To fill these research gaps, this article maps out various concepts of propaganda and relates them to the process and content of the news media. On the basis of theoretical and empirical studies, the article demonstrates how different forms of propaganda can manifest in news media content. Based on an integration with, as well as a development of, existing literature, the essay aims to build a tool box that can be applied and refined in future studies in order to detect propaganda in news media texts.

T1  - Digital Propaganda: The Tyranny of Ignorance
AN  - 2207060933
AB  - The existence of propaganda is inexorably bound to the nature of communication and communications technology. Mass communication by citizens in the digital age has been heralded as a means to counter elite propaganda; however, it also provides a forum for misinformation, aggression and hostility. The extremist group Britain First has used Facebook as a way to propagate hostility towards Muslims, immigrants and social security claimants in the form of memes, leading to a backlash from sites antithetical to their message. This article provides a memetic analysis, which addresses persuasion, organisation, political echo chambers and self-correcting online narratives; arguing that propaganda can be best understood as an evolving set of techniques and mechanisms which facilitate the propagation of ideas and actions. This allows the concept to be adapted to fit a changing political and technological landscape and to encompass both propaganda and counter-propaganda in the context of horizontal communications networks.

T1  - Framing the Issue of Asylum Seekers and Refugees for Tougher Refugee Policy—a Study of the Media’s Portrayal in Post-colonial Hong Kong
AN  - 2109029684
AB  - Policy-makers often refer to media reports and public opinion polls when advocating immigration policies. A good example of this is provided by Hong Kong, an international financial hub that prides itself on its multiculturalism and pluralism, but whose government officials and pro-establishment legislators have been calling for tougher measures because of a plethora of negative news reports on immigrants. This study examines how print media frames the issue of asylum seekers and refugees, with the findings indicating that the majority of local Chinese news articles portray asylum seekers negatively as “fake refugees” and “criminals.” The study also examines newspapers’ framing of the causes of requests for asylum and their recommendations for dealing with the “problem”: (1) setting up detention camps, (2) enforcing stricter border control, and (3) withdrawing from the UNCAT. It argues that the negative framing provides justifications for anti-refugee policy-makers to suggest tougher policy solutions to the issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Policy implications are discussed which may affect Hong Kong’s position as a first-class global city.

T1  - How and why disgust responses underlie prejudice: Evidence from the field
AN  - 2225864596
AB  - Thank you very much for this invitation and introduction. It is an honor being here and addressing you. The topic of this talk is how and why disgust responses underlie prejudice. Prejudice can be many things. People can be prejudiced against people who are of another sex or another sexual orientation, for example. Today, however, I focus on a particular type of prejudice: prejudice toward people from another ethnic or racial group. My aim is to convincingly argue that we can understand variation in such prejudice by considering the challenges that our ancestors faced over evolutionary history. In particular, I will focus on a perhaps surprising type of challenge, namely, the challenges stemming from diseases and pathogens and the evolved disgust responses that these challenges have selected for. In contemporary politics, how we should — and should not — react to people from other groups constitutes one of the most hotly debated issues. Europe, for example, is in the middle of what is being called an immigration or refugee crisis, facing streams of refugees as a result of the war in Syria. Most dramatically, the summer of 2015 saw large numbers of refugees arriving on the shores of Europe by boat and then walking across the continent on foot by highway. Of course, immigration and refugees are not just European issues; they are also issues in the United States. A focal point of the 2016 U.S. presidential election was whether or not to build a wall to keep out Mexican immigrants. As a political scientist, the most interesting observation about the issue of immigration is what different reactions it elicits in different people. Some people react to refugees and immigration by opening their arms. In the summer of 2015, public demonstrations were held in Europe, with people holding signs saying “Refugees are welcome.” At the central railway station in Copenhagen, people were seen holding signs saying “Welcome to Denmark. We love refugees” and “Welcome, the food is for you,” while handing out food to the newcomers. But that is not the only type of reaction that we have seen. There have been opposite reactions, too. One picture illustrating those reactions made it into the international news. It was a picture of a Hungarian journalist trying to push over a refugee girl who was running across the border into Hungary. Another picture made the Danish news. In this picture, a man was standing on top of a highway bridge, spitting on the refugees who walked underneath. Importantly, the reactions that we observe here are not just very different. Their intensities are also strong and clearly emotion based, independent of whether the reaction is to open one’s arms or to react aggressively. How can we explain this variation? How can we explain the fact that some people react in one way and some people react in quite another way? If we look to the standard accounts within political science, this variation is often explained with reference to factors such as income: people who are worse off in economic terms might be more reluctant to let in immigrants. Political scientists also explain variation by making reference to education: people who have lower levels of education might have fewer multicultural values and therefore might be more reluctant to value open borders. A third factor that political scientists point to is ideology: people who are left leaning might be more open to refugees and immigrants than people on the right. All these factors are important. Still, in order to understand the intensity of, in particular, prejudiced reactions, we have found it fruitful to look at another type of factor. Together with my colleagues Lene Aarøe from Aarhus University and Kevin Arceneaux from Temple University, I have delved into how individual differences in disgust sensitivity are a major cause of variation in reactions to immigrants.

T1  - Everyday practices and the (un)making of ‘Fortress Europe’: Introduction to the special issue
AN  - 2205315222
AB  - The borders of Europe are erected and guarded through cultural practices as much as through border control and security technologies. Cultural Studies have been crucial in revealing how everyday, particularly media-oriented practices, make and unmake this ‘Fortress’. Yet, until now, the focus has been mostly on how migrants use or are represented through media discourses and technologies. This introduction essay argues that the signifier ‘Fortress Europe’—and its central premise of restraining mobility for some in order to enable freedom for others—also gains meaning in and through socio-cultural practices that we may not (as) immediately associate with the physical crossing of European borders. Particular practices that are discussed in this introduction and examined in the seven original articles of the special issue are: public opinion research, the public mobilization of emotions, negotiating identity in an ‘ancestral homeland’, the consumption of (sports) media, the production of a radio talk show and film archives, as well as the activist use of social media. Broadening scholarly attention to these kinds of sociocultural practices provides an important addition to understanding how power operates across social spheres and discursive orders. In addition, their identification also offers valuable opportunities to understand how and why some practices are particularly pertinent or effective in cementing or destabilizing Fortress Europe. This line of inquiry is visible throughout this special issue, despite the diversity of theoretical frameworks and empirical sites used in the contributing articles.

T1  - Media Discussion on the Naturalization Policy for Syrians in Turkey
AN  - 2191314743
AB  - This study focuses on the public opinion on the naturalization policy for Syrians in Turkey. It analyses news media coverage in the religious, far‐right newspaper (Yeni Akit), a centre‐right newspaper (Hürriyet), a social democrat newspaper (Cumhuriyet), and a socialist‐left news portal (Solportal). The research question is: What are the metaphors, arguments, and omissions produced by media of different ideologies about the possible citizenship of Syrians in Turkey? The results show that metaphors and arguments differ according to ideological stance, suggesting that the current political polarization in Turkey affects the public's acceptance of Syrians and challenges Turkey's established migration policy. Each ideological stance accepts Syrians on a selective basis, implying that universal naturalization of Syrians is not welcome; instead, there seems to be consensus favouring naturalization according to socio‐economic criteria. These results indicate a need for a change in migration policy, especially concerning disadvantaged Syrians.

T1  - The media whiteness of Social Security and Medicare
AN  - 2571083659
AB  - The mass media often represent black Americans in negative, stereotypical, and inaccurate ways. Scholars know much less about how the media characterize white citizens and the implications of these depictions for public opinion and public policy. In this research, we examine the whiteness of two popular social welfare programs—Social Security and Medicare. We argue that at least part of the popularity of these policies stems from their construction as programs serving white Americans. The media whiteness of these programs creates a positive depiction since many citizens perceive whites as hard-working, intelligent, and deserving of benefits. To examine the portrayal of Social Security and Medicare, we analyze media coverage of these programs in five news magazines between 2007 and 2017. We demonstrate that news magazines portray these well-liked social programs by overwhelmingly highlighting white beneficiaries. Further, the media often depict these white recipients in a sympathetic and positive manner. This is in sharp contrast to media coverage of poor people that disproportionately, inaccurately, and unsympathetically focuses on black citizens.

T1  - The politics of think tanks in social media: FAES, YouTube and free-market ideology
AN  - 2216787523
AB  - Communication and the media stand out among the means think tanks employ to shape public opinion, influence political cultures and spread ideologies. More specifically, both traditional and new media stand out as resources for the advocacy performed by right-leaning think tanks. While the use of traditional media has been well studied, little research has focused on think tanks’ online message content. This article focuses on the social media communication of one of the main think tanks in Spain: FAES. The YouTube videos of this research institution are content analysed in light of (1) free-market ideology and (2) the specific philosophical tenets of two American think tanks: the conservative Heritage Foundation and the libertarian Cato Institute. Results indicate that free-market ideology is communicated throughout FAES’s videos. However, neither Heritage-type conservatism nor Cato-type libertarianism are conveyed. Our study shows that an economic right-wing discourse is finding a new outlet on social media, and sheds light on how FAES’s use of the web relates to the political context.

T1  - Do the Ladies Run This Mutha? The Relationship between Political Rap and Black Feminist Attitudes
AN  - 2174121234
AB  - Music has been thought of as an art form that expresses ideas and sentiments of the artist. This article examines the relationship between political and non-political rap and Black feminist attitudes. This study includes data from original experiments conducted at Benedict College; a historically Black college in Columbia, SC, where Black males and females were exposed to various genres of music and their support of Black feminist attitudes were measured. Blacks exposed to political rap display increased support of Black feminist attitudes compared to those exposed to non-political rap and the control group, subjects who were not exposed to any form of music. Our research finds that those exposed to non-political rap have less affinity for Black feminist attitudes than those in any other group. This research is important to political science because it furthers our knowledge about public opinion and political attitudes. Specifically, this article demonstrates that non-traditional media forms also have an impact on political attitudes. Specifically, exposure to political rap has a significantly positive impact on the agreement with Black feminist attitudes when compared to exposure to non-political rap. Therefore, not all subgenres of rap music are consistently harmful to Black feminist attitudes and attitudes toward women.

T1  - The irony of Islamization: sexuality, piety and power on Malaysian screens: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2173821639
AB  - This article examines the wider social and political contexts for film reception in Malaysia, focusing on the ways that religious themes interact with social hierarchies around gender, class and ethnicity. Despite the prevailing phenomenon of state-sponsored Islamization in Malaysia, didactic Islamic-themed films produced in Malaysia are relatively unpopular among local audiences. At the same time, Malay-language television drama series and commercial films that feature overt physical intimacy between heterosexual couples have garnered huge public support, even when seemingly at odds with Islamic teachings. This article argues that audiences' broad preferences for films with more sexual content do not necessarily indicate wavering commitments to Islam. Rather, the turn away from didactic films is shaped by local articulations of Islam in relation to specifically Malaysian sensibilities, cultural identities and ethical norms. Furthermore, the ways in which sexual films and dramas frame physically intimate scenes through hierarchies of ethnicity, class and gender make them acceptable and attractive, despite their ostensible transgressions of religious norms.

T1  - Imagined Politics: How Different Media Platforms Transport Citizens Into Political Narratives
AN  - 2162932551
AB  - This article examines political transportation—the construction of mental models that represent a political world and result in the absorption and positioning of oneself within the constructed world. Specifically, we propose that when citizens become immersed in the political narrative crafted by a politician, they become more likely to see the political world as personally relevant and, subsequently, become more committed to supporting that candidate. Further, the degree of political immersion should depend upon which media platform a campaign message is delivered through. These expectations were tested using an experiment where partisans were exposed to a campaign message delivered in the form of a television ad, a political e-mail, or a series of tweets. Results demonstrate that Twitter was the least likely to lead to political immersion. Further, results provide support for our theoretical model, where there is an indirect effect of campaign messages on political attitudes and behavior through immersion and perceived personal relevance. Taken together, this study demonstrates the utility of applying the concept of narrative transportation to politics.

T1  - The Cultural Impacts of Social Movements
AN  - 2287467853
AB  - The most important impacts of social movements are often cultural, but the sheer variety of potential cultural impacts-from shifts in public opinion to new portrayals of a group on television to the metrics guiding funding in a federal agency-presents unique challenges to scholars. Rather than treating culture as a social sphere separate from politics and the economy, we conceptualize it as the ideas, values, and assumptions underpinning policies and practices in all spheres. We review recent research on movements' impacts on public opinion and everyday behavior; the media and popular culture; nonpolitical institutions such as science, medicine, and education; and politics. We focus on cultural impacts that have mattered for movements' constituencies and address why movements have had those impacts. We conclude with an agenda for future research, seeking greater connection between the literatures on movements and the literatures on the institutions that matter to movements.

T1  - Social representation of palliative care in the Spanish printed media: A qualitative analysis
AN  - 2171190824
AB  - Background 
Lack of social awareness is a major barrier to the development of palliative care. Mass media influences public opinion, and frequently deal with palliative care contributing to its image and public understanding.
 Aim 
To analyse how palliative care is portrayed in Spanish newspapers, as well as the contribution made by the press to its social representation.
 Design 
Based on criteria of scope and editorial plurality, four print newspapers were selected. Using the newspaper archive MyNews (www.mynews.es), articles published between 2009 and 2014 containing the words “palliative care” or “palliative medicine” were identified. Sociological discourse analysis was performed on the identified texts on two levels: a) contextual analysis, focusing on the message as a statement; b) interpretative analysis, considering the discourse as a social product.
 Results 
We examined 262 articles. Politician and healthcare professionals were the main representatives transmitting messages on palliative care. The discourses identified were characterised by: strong ideological and moral content focusing on social debate, strong ties linking palliative care and death and, to a lesser degree, as a healthcare service. The messages transmitted by representatives with direct experience in palliative care (professionals, patients and families) contributed the most to building a positive image of this healthcare practice. Overall, media reflect different interests in framing public understanding about palliative care.
 Conclusion 
The knowledge generated about how palliative care is reflected in the printed media may help to understand better one of the main barriers to its development not only in Spain, but also in other contexts.

T1  - Who is in the picture? The gender composition of images of Congress in party caucus Twitter feeds and online media
AN  - 2571083585
AB  - Visual portrayals of politics can affect public opinion. However, little work has investigated visual portrayals of Congress and their impact on perceptions of group representation. Though women are underrepresented in Congress, the political parties, driven by electoral incentives, might try to present themselves as more diverse than they really are. Is this true for gender, and do these efforts trickle down to images in media coverage? We examine images of Members of Congress (MoCs) from congressional party caucus Twitter feeds and images in online mass media to assess whether the gender composition within the images accurately portrays institutional and party compositions. We test a theory as to why women MoCs may be overrepresented in images tweeted by the political party caucuses, paying special attention to why the two parties’ incentives differ and how incentives increase when communications focus on women’s issues, especially for Democrats who “own” women’s issues. Our analyses of tweeted images show that both party caucuses overrepresent women MoCs, particularly in communication about women’s issues. In contrast, online mass media images accurately represent the percentage of women in general, though mass media overrepresent women MoCs from both parties in images accompanying stories about women’s issues.

T1  - Social exclusion of life in the written media of the disabilities: the importance of media literacy and education
AN  - 2157776921
AB  - Disability is not only a health problem faced by disabled people and their families; it is necessary to consider it as a situation closely related to social aspects and society. Disability is a social phenomenon that concerns the disabled, the family, the immediate surroundings, and the community to which they belong. Disabled individuals, like every human being, want to share their social surroundings and their experiences of briefly living their emotions, thoughts, dreams. However, even for non-disabled individuals, communication, which can be difficult under certain conditions, can become even more difficult for disabled people. Because the psycho-social structure, values, attitudes, perceptions of life, and thoughts of the individuals in society are different. Therefore, disabled individual who is evaluated as a pitiful and poor person by the influence of prejudices in the social perception process can be exposed to the negative attitudes of the society and be excluded. It is not an “obstacle” on the basis of the “disability” your disability faces; the society that prefers the difference created by the obstacle lies in the “obstructive attitudes” developed against the obstruction. Written media have been shown and proven as the reason for this difference in our work. Our work will be demonstrated by an in-depth interview methodology of approaching the subject of five disabled people with the highest number of disabled people in the TRNC. Negative perceptions of the disability within the society are not only something that the written media can correct, but are also closely connected with the consciousness of the associations’ authorities and their shaping of their strategies accordingly. We tried to emphasize the media importance of literacy and media literacy education in this area. The media literacy training program will reduce the negative representations created by the media and their negative consequences because there will be conscious media consumers. At this point, the social exclusion that the people living in the society in the presence of the media representatives of the disability will be reduced the most.

AB  - Media reports can have a significant and lasting impact on public perceptions about crime and criminals. Jonathan, Jarrod, and Jamie Bacon gained notoriety in Vancouver through substantial media coverage for their involvement in gang-related shootings and criminal activity. The present study examines how the media have portrayed the Bacon brothers and their importance in the region’s gang scene. We examine all articles published in the area’s largest newspaper, the Vancouver Sun, mentioning the Bacon family between 2008 and 2015 (N = 401). Specifically, we explore the media’s depiction of the Bacons through developing a thematic content analysis, with themes tested in a keyword analysis using a corpora comparison with a set of reference articles. We argue that the Bacon brothers’ family relationship, tumultuous gang alliances, and alleged involvement in Vancouver’s worst gang-related shooting led to the media overreporting and sensationalizing their criminal activity and prominence in the local gang landscape. In addition, we contend that the popular theme of crime families provided the media with a narrative that proved useful in a context where the police and the courts were simultaneously trying to adapt to the emerging reality of violent gang conflict.

T1  - Foreign Voices, Party Cues, and U.S. Public Opinion about Military Action
AN  - 2432396378
AB  - In this research note, we report the results of a survey-experiment about possible U.S. air strikes on Iranian nuclear installations that was constructed to expand our understanding of the influence of foreign voices on domestic public opinion. Improving on previous study designs, subjects were presented with combinations of messages from the U.N. Security Council as well as Republican and Democratic party elites. We find that people will sometimes resist signals from party leaders in favor of messages from a foreign actor, even when presented with a domestic bipartisan elite consensus in favor of military action. Our experimental results confirm and extend existing empirical evidence on the influence of foreign voices: Messages from these actors can indeed move U.S. public opinion in opposition to messages from party leaders. Our findings suggest that when news media outlets consistently incorporate messages from foreign elites, mass public opinion on foreign policy will be less likely to reflect the positions of Republican and Democratic leaders. Our study focuses on the United States, but its results are relevant for analogous effects in other countries. While the basic processes of foreign elite influence on domestic public opinion that we describe may hold in other industrialized democracies, cross-national variation in party competition and news media systems is likely to significantly condition these effects. Still, by generating more precise evidence for effects on U.S. public opinion, we illuminate an important influence for burgeoning international political information and communication flows. Future research would do well to examine similar processes in other nations.

T1  - Child Sexual Abuse News: A Systematic Review of Content Analysis Studies
AN  - 2113699735
AB  - Public knowledge and attitudes toward child sexual abuse are shaped through media depictions and coverage. Since the media are the main source of information about child sexual abuse, studies of child sexual abuse news can help us understand how news is created, how child sexual abuse is presented to the public, and what is the possible impact of such presentation and coverage on the audience. A systematic review of content analysis research is conducted using predefined criteria in order to identify quality studies, main findings, research gaps and to develop recommendations for future studies. International databases were systematically searched using keywords in September 2017. A total of 24 original quantitative content analysis studies published in the English language were included in the review and evaluated according to research methodology. The framework of child sexual abuse news media studies is developed and main findings are highlighted: (1) presentation and coverage of child sexual abuse (n = 7); (2) prevalence of coverage of CSA cases reported to the authorities (n = 2); (3) presentation and coverage of child abuse and sexual crimes where child sexual abuse is only a subtopic (n = 9); (4) presentation and coverage of specific child sexual abuse cases or issues (n = 6). Although studies represent valuable contribution, most did not meet content analysis design and reporting standards or both (e.g., calculating intercoder reliability), which seriously compromises validity and replicability requirements. Recommendation for future studies and most common errors in conducting content analysis are emphasized.

T1  - Entertainment-education effectively reduces prejudice: GPIR
AN  - 2109035266
AB  - We show that entertainment-education reduces prejudice and does so more effectively than several established prejudice reduction methods. In Experiment 1, participants exposed to an educational television sitcom with diverse, yet relatable Arab/Muslim characters had lower scores on implicit and explicit measures of prejudice than participants exposed to a control sitcom featuring an all White cast. The prejudice reduction effect persisted 4 weeks after exposure. In Experiment 2, viewing of a 4-minute music video that portrayed Arabs/Muslims as relatable and likable resulted in a larger reduction in prejudice against Arabs/Muslims than two established prejudice reduction methods (imagined contact exercise and group malleability article), which produced no improvements. In both experiments, increased identification with target group members was associated with greater prejudice reduction. Entertainment-education, in addition to being scalable, is likely to be one the most effective methods for improving intergroup relations and promoting diversity.

AN  - 2043766864
AB  - Research on media influence on attitudes and perceptions regarding intimate partner violence (IPV), a prominent predictor of IPV, is limited. Using a convenience sample of 2057 Chinese undergraduate students, this survey explored influences of media exposure on attitudes and perceptions of IPV the first time in literature. Significant differences (p < .05) of perceptions of IPV were found between respondents who reported developing cognitions of IPV from books, magazines, or newspapers and those who didn't, with the former having better perceptions than the latter. Positive associations were also found between print-based media access and perceptions and negative attitudes concerning IPV.

T1  - The 'illegal' and the skilled: effects of media portrayals on perceptions of immigrants in Britain
AN  - 2076977966
AB  - Public perceptions often diverge widely from reality on the size and make-up of immigrant populations, with likely consequences for public opinion about immigration. Prior research has not established whether the media has any causal role in the construction of these perceptions. This paper examines whether and how actually occurring media portrayals of immigrants in Britain affect perceptions of immigrants among members of the British public. We begin by conducting a large-scale quantitative study of the British national press. We then report on an original survey experiment that tests for causal impact of news frames derived from the media study. Specifically, we focus on three depictions of immigrants: as 'illegal', Eastern European, or highly skilled. Results show that even subtle media interventions can shift public perceptions of immigration, in this case towards more realistic understandings of the overall size and make-up of the immigrant population in Britain. We suggest empirical, theoretical, and methodological implications for the study of media effects on public opinion towards immigration.

T1  - Friend or foe: the media's power to inform and shape societal attitudes towards people with acquired brain injury
AN  - 2059554419
AB  - Media representations play an integral role in modern society, informing the public about a range of issues affecting their communities. Using qualitative content analysis, this article reports on the study of a sample of Australian media coverage, spanning 30 years, covering issues associated with acquired brain injury (ABI) and related cognitive disabilities. The analysis explores how the media both portray and actively shape public perceptions about people living with ABI, the lived experience of the condition, and its broader social implications. The authors identify a range of themes arising in the sample that communicate specific ideas about ABI, disability, and deviance. Importantly, they identify how these themes are able to either construct or reinforce dominant understandings of disability and deviance through both their content and structure.

T1  - Audience Contradictions in the Negotiation of Controversial Cultural Media Content
AN  - 2059070003
AB  - This paper analyses how people negotiate representations of other cultures in the media, in particular those traits that can be considered controversial in the sense of generating strong opinions and opposing stances. A news story about an Egyptian television channel run by Egyptian women journalists wearing the niqab (Maria TV) was used to stimulate debate in four focus groups. Although most of the participants initially criticized the approach adopted by the television channel, they also expressed opinions on journalists in niqab that agreed with the representation proposed by the channel. The article shows that even though audiences may seem capable of criticizing media biases, they do not recognize their own internalized prejudices and, ultimately, accept the discourse proposed by media.

T1  - ‘It just seemed like your normal domestic violence’: ethnic stereotypes in print media coverage of child abuse in New Zealand
AN  - 2050279304
AB  - Child abuse in New Zealand is a matter of ongoing concern for the government, public officials, health practitioners and wider society, with most information on the issue coming from mass media, which have played an influential role in forming public opinion. This study investigates the coverage of serious child abuse between November 2007 and November 2009 in three largest New Zealand newspapers: The New Zealand Herald, The Dominion Post and The Press. The analysis of 205 articles shows that three-quarters of the data described severe physical abuse and/or death, and one-quarter described sexual abuse. More than half of all media pieces (56%) represented reporting of ‘crime stories’, such as police and court reports, in addition to statistical data, recommendations and critique (44%). Two cases of Nia Glassie and the Kahui twins’ deaths were sensationalised by the media and were described or mentioned in 63 articles altogether. The dominant construction of child abuse as a ‘Māori issue’ was achieved through individual framing, focused on the personalities of the perpetrators and their inferred innate characteristics, such as being prone to violence and dysfunctional by nature, which were further generalised to Māori society as a whole.

T1  - Friend or foe: the media's power to inform and shape societal attitudes towards people with acquired brain injury
AN  - 2049854771
AB  - Media representations play an integral role in modern society, informing the public about a range of issues affecting their communities. Using qualitative content analysis, this article reports on the study of a sample of Australian media coverage, spanning 30 years, covering issues associated with acquired brain injury (ABI) and related cognitive disabilities. The analysis explores how the media both portray and actively shape public perceptions about people living with ABI, the lived experience of the condition, and its broader social implications. The authors identify a range of themes arising in the sample that communicate specific ideas about ABI, disability, and deviance. Importantly, they identify how these themes are able to either construct or reinforce dominant understandings of disability and deviance through both their content and structure.

T1  - The Communication and Interpretation of the One Belt and One Road by Chinese and Vietnamese Media in the Perspective of Frame Analysis - A Case Study of China Radio International CRI and Voice of Vietnam VOV in Comparison
AN  - 2057260239
AB  - Based on Vietnamese version of Online News Network China Radio International (CRI) and Voice of Vietnam VOV news as the research object, this study uses framing analysis to compare and analyze the two media's reports on the "One Belt and One Road" initiative (OBOR). The study finds that the subject and content of China CRI mainly focus on benefits and cooperation opportunities coming from the "One Belt and One Road" initiative, and avoid controversial topics. On the contrary, since the territorial sovereignty in the two countries' bilateral relation has not reached a consensus yet, plus the power and influence of China has been continuously increasing in recent years, result in the Vietnamese media tends to pay more attention to the controversial topics, and often uses the territorial dispute as a groundwork so as to lead to relevant content of the "One Belt and One Road" initiative. At the same time, it also cites the third-party reports of foreign media to indirectly make China's image negative and raise questions about the initiative.

T1  - Introduction: ethical concerns in sport governance
AN  - 2015009006
AB  - Sport governance no longer stirs public opinion only when scandals surface; it has become a persistent concern for a number of stakeholders. A combination of the inexorable presence of the media, people’s scepticism of those who run their favourite sports, and vagaries of the moral economy of global sport capitalism since the late twentieth century has made governance a newsworthy, momentous and meaningful aspect of elite sports. The media has been attentive to the financial irregularities, the struggles for recognition, and the political and exploitative aspects of sport governance that have come to light rather frequently since the beginning of the twenty-first century. It has played a critical role in shaping sport governance too, especially after the advent of televised sport, sponsorship and marketing. Television forms the economic backbone of modern sport, and digital platforms are set to revolutionize sport coverage. Secondly, sport followers, who double as consumers of media content, understand the challenges of governing what has transformed in the twentieth century from local leisure cultures to highly capitalized industries with a global reach. Depending on their level of interest, they track governance of local clubs, national teams, international federations and similar entities. They are usually aware of the structures of power and ownership, policy-making at various levels, and violation of accountability. Finally, sport administrators, who are drawn from state representatives and the commercial elite operating in both national and transnational contexts, are obliged to run the show, maximize profit and connect with supporters. With the exception of the Middle Eastern monarchies and a few other authoritarian states, sport administrators often subject themselves to self-regulatory measures in order to be legitimized as custodians of the game. Ethical practice is probably one of the most important catechism they encounter at a quotidian level, as transparency and incorruptibility are widely considered necessary attributes of sport governance. The media and sport followers are no exception to the rule of ethics as stakeholders of governance.

T1  - Toxic Talk: How Online Incivility Can Undermine Perceptions of Media
AN  - 2430088579
AB  - Scholars are increasingly concerned with the potential for uncivil discourse to enhance political polarization in society (Mutz, 2006; Stryker, 2011). Political elites and partisans boost levels of incivility in news media (Muddiman, 2013), and people perceive higher levels of incivility in politics when individuals rather than issues are attacked (Stryker, Conway, & Danielson, 2014). The concerns over incivility extend to the online information environment, where nasty comments can harm healthy back-and-forth dialogue central to democracy that often happens in spaces such as newspapers (Coe, Kenski, & Rains, 2014; Meltzer, 2015). Early research shows that incivility in online comments can be a polarizing factor in how people perceive issues in media, particularly for individuals who hold stronger opinions before seeing the comments (Anderson, Brossard, Scheufele, Xenos, & Ladwig, 2014). In particular, incivility has been found to affect people’s perceptions of the content covered in news articles, a phenomenon dubbed the “nasty effect” (Anderson et al., 2014). It can also increase the perception that individuals in society hold polarized attitudes (Hwang, Kim, & Huh, 2014). Yet, we still do not fully understand how incivility in comments affects perceptions of the news stories themselves or the effect it can have on lines of political polarity in society. Here, we explore the effects of uncivil comments proximate to a blog post containing hard news content on individuals’ perceptions of media. We examine these effects across two controversial scientific issues—nuclear energy and nanotechnology—on perceptions of bias of the news blog post. We also examine how political ideologies are related to how people interpret incivility in online comments as it relates to perceptions of bias. In doing so, this study contributes to understanding of the polarizing nature of incivility. While this is a common concern in the literature, few have empirically tested whether online incivility heightens existing divisions in society. We find that perceptions of bias are greatest after seeing online incivility among politically conservative ideologues, providing evidence for the polarity of incivility in online comments.

T1  - “Life Isn't Some Cartoon Musical”: Neoliberal Identity Politics in <i>Zootopia</i> and <i>Orange Is the New Black</i>
AN  - 2023533129
AB  - Neoliberal identity politics in "Zootopia" and "Orange Is the New Black" are discussed. Two popular texts exemplify the contradictory logic of neoliberal popular media and the coexisting types of media‐industrial production: Disney's Zootopia (2016) and Netflix's Orange Is the New Black (2013–). Both strongly foreground “progressive” attitudes toward identity politics in their representational strategies of race and gender. On one hand, the reception of Zootopia (2016), a traditionally “mainstream” media text, has clearly been shaped by gestures of progressive representational politics which clearly added to their status among the most desirable audience groups. Orange Is the New Black, on the other hand, provides a striking example of popular “niche” media, which circulates as a cultural text within a much more limited audience, and which also appears to embrace a more radical politics.

T1  - More than a Media Moment: The Influence of Televised Storylines on Viewers’ Attitudes toward Transgender People and Policies
AN  - 2015610332
AB  - Numerous studies have demonstrated the power of entertainment narratives to influence attitudes and behaviors; fewer have examined the effects of TV portrayals on attitudes toward marginalized groups. The present study is among the first to explore how entertainment narratives depicting transgender individuals influence viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people and related policies. The study examines the impact of exposure to a TV storyline on Royal Pains (USA Network) and cumulative effects of viewing other TV series featuring transgender individuals. An online survey of 488 U.S. viewers of Royal Pains was conducted (391 had seen the relevant episode). ANCOVAs revealed exposure to both the Royal Pains’ storyline and other storylines portraying transgender individuals were associated with more supportive attitudes toward transgender people and policies. Mediation models revealed that for viewers of the Royal Pains’ storyline, the relationships between political ideology and attitudes toward transgender people and policies were mediated by identification with the main characters and the emotion of hope. Disgust mediated viewers’ attitudes toward transgender people, but not policies. Post hoc analyses revealed that exposure to transgender narratives reduced the influence of viewers’ political ideology on their attitudes. The attitudes of more conservative viewers became increasingly positive as they saw more media portrayals of transgender individuals. These findings highlight the potential for entertainment narratives to influence attitudes toward marginalized groups, and they demonstrate the importance of emotion in the context of divisive topics. Social, political, and public health implications are discussed.

T1  - Reexamining the Nineteenth-Century Presidency and Partisan Press: The Case of President Grant and the Whiskey Ring Scandal
AN  - 2003005404
AB  - Studies of the institutional development of the presidency and popular leadership by presidents over time lead us to contrary expectations as to how a nineteenth-century president would react to a major political scandal. Scholarship on newspapers of the late 1800s is also unclear on how a quasipartisan media, with some outlets moving toward independence, would cover a White House scandal. I find that a close analysis of the case of President Ulysses S. Grant and the Whiskey Ring scandal forces us to reconsider what we assume to be firmly modern developments in both presidential studies and media history. Though a supposedly “premodern” president, Grant still mounted a concerted effort to mitigate the damage of the scandal. Further, although the president could get his version of events across in prominent newspapers, Republican newspaper coverage was hardly reliable. Newspapers also connected politicians’ character and psychology to mistakes made in office and made presidential strategies to shape public perception clear to their audiences-emphases on political gamesmanship considered hallmarks of the modern media environment.

T1  - Reexamining the Nineteenth-Century Presidency and Partisan Press: The Case of President Grant and the Whiskey Ring Scandal
AN  - 1986099037
AB  - Studies of the institutional development of the presidency and popular leadership by presidents over time lead us to contrary expectations as to how a nineteenth-century president would react to a major political scandal. Scholarship on newspapers of the late 1800s is also unclear on how a quasipartisan media, with some outlets moving toward independence, would cover a White House scandal. I find that a close analysis of the case of President Ulysses S. Grant and the Whiskey Ring scandal forces us to reconsider what we assume to be firmly modern developments in both presidential studies and media history. Though a supposedly "premodern" president, Grant still mounted a concerted effort to mitigate the damage of the scandal. Further, although the president could get his version of events across in prominent newspapers, Republican newspaper coverage was hardly reliable. Newspapers also connected politicians' character and psychology to mistakes made in office and made presidential strategies to shape public perception clear to their audiences--emphases on political gamesmanship considered hallmarks of the modern media environment.

T1  - How mass media attract political elites’ attention
AN  - 1983185482
AB  - Political agenda‐setting research has shown that policy makers are responsive vis‐à‐vis media priorities. However, the mechanisms behind this effect have remained understudied so far. In particular, agenda‐setting scholars have difficulties determining to what extent politicians react to media coverage purely because of the information it contains (information effect), and to what extent the effect is driven not by what the media say but by the fact that certain information is in the media (media channel effect), which is valued for its own sake – for instance, because media coverage is considered to be a reflection of public opinion. By means of a survey‐embedded experiment with Belgian, Canadian and Israeli political elites (N = 410), this study tests whether the mere fact that an issue is covered by the news media causes politicians to pay attention to this issue. It shows that a piece of information gets more attention from politicians when it comes via the media rather than an identical piece of information coming via a personal e‐mail. This effect occurs largely across the board: it is not dependent on individual politician characteristics.

T1  - A Different Lens? How Ethnic Minority Media Cover Crime
AN  - 1993977990
AB  - There is a growing body of literature on the nexus of media, race, and crime, which reveals that crime is exaggerated in mainstream media and that these same venues tend to racialize crime and criminalize race. The impact of this is that inaccurate public perceptions about the frequency, seriousness, and demographic distribution of crime are reinforced. Interestingly, however, there have been no focused efforts to explore the ways in which crime is featured within the media targeting specific racial and ethnic communities. We know little about whether such outlets reproduce these patterns. This pilot study is intended to initiate an examination of the representation of crime news in Canada's ethnic media, exploring the patterns of crime reporting in such outlets and comparing the ways in which such news is presented to different audiences. We conducted a content analysis of two English-language newspapers in the Greater Toronto Area, which nonetheless serve specific racial and ethnic communities. Quantitative (e.g., frequency) and qualitative (e.g., themes) findings from the study offer insights into crime reporting patterns, as well as the nature of crime coverage in the studied newspapers.

T1  - The consequences of colonialism in Latvia during a mass migration period in Europe (2015/2016)
AN  - 1994429405
AB  - The collective memory of the colonial past still attempts to determine the relationship between the different ethnic groups in Latvia and also affects the identity problems of such groups. These effects are visible today in the new arena of public space, i.e. in relation to refugees. The flow of refugees into Europe in autumn 2015 was unexpected for many people. Local media reports that the large number of refugees and migrants are making the migration process uncontrollable, has signalled that there is an accidental and intentional crisis cluster here. Public opinion polls also confirmed the nervous state of the Latvian population crisis and dislike for refugee reception demanded by the management of the European Union. This research was conducted in order to determine whether such reaction of the society is rooted in xenophobia or has other reasons. Two groups of people were surveyed. One of them shows that post-colonial thinking is still present, if supported by post-colonially oriented mass media. The second group without post-colonial experience gave the opposite response. The research used local media content analysis for the purpose of determining how the leading newspapers interpret refugee crisis related developments to their readers and studied the spectrum of media used by both surveyed groups regarding the refugee issue.

T1  - A tale of two independence movements: how do citizens encounter issues of international law and democratic theory?
AN  - 2697556047
AB  - Foreign policy events, including secessionism and independence movements, become objectified for most citizens through media coverage. Accordingly, I look at the coverage of Kosovo's and Scotland's bids for independence in the two top national newspapers, The New York Times and The Washington Post. Scholarship in international law, democratic theory, and comparative politics might have valuable insights on independence processes, but it is the media frames inspired by these strands of theoretical literature that shape public opinion and/or reflect policy-makers’ preferences (and biases) in the foreign policy arena. I find that print media can engage in theoretically sophisticated coverage of secessionist movements, which often echoes scholarly insights derived from the relevant academic literature. The two European case studies show consistent application of tropes and frames that one would find in the academic publications on the subject. Yet these cases also illustrate profound differences in media framing not reducible to objective legal and political differences between the two events. US foreign policy considerations also appear to play a role in explaining variance in media frames.

T1  - Where are the women? Evaluating visibility of Nigerian female politicians in news media space
AN  - 1991980933
AB  - This study examines the spatial representation of Nigerian women politicians in the news media of Africa's most populous country. Through a content analysis of newspaper coverage of four high-profile women politicians during the 2015 electoral cycle, the study investigates the visibility of the women in three national newspapers. The analysis shows that women do not only occupy limited space in the news media but are also marginalised in political news despite decades of advocacy for gender equality. Although women have become more active politically since the end of military dictatorship in 1999, their participation and engagement in politics is not reflected in media coverage. The study argues that the degree of visibility of women in political news entrenches marginalisation and reinforces assumptions that 'only men do politics.' From this standpoint, the study illustrates how newspapers reinforce patriarchal understanding of politics and consequently highlights the manifest and latent obstacles that women encounter in the political arena. It comes to the conclusion that the relative absence of women in media spaces is emblematic of public perception of their political status.

T1  - From a threatening “Muslim migrant” back to the conspiring “West:” race, religion, and nationhood on Russian television during Putin's third presidency
AN  - 2697558571
AB  - This article analyzes official discourse of the nation during Vladimir Putin's third presidency, as reflected in Russian television coverage of Islam and migration. It argues that the replacement of earlier deliberately ambiguous definitions of Russian nationhood with clearly framed exclusive visions reflects the change in the regime's legitimation strategy from one based on economic performance to one based on its security record. In this context, the systematic promotion of Russian ethnonationalism for the purpose of achieving the regime's general stability began not at the time of Crimea's annexation, as it is often assumed, but at the time of Putin's reelection amidst public protests in 2012. The goal of representing the authorities as attentive to public grievances in a society where opinion polls register high levels of xenophobia has prompted state-controlled broadcasters to use ethnoracial definitions of the nation that they had previously avoided. The media campaigns analyzed here also reflect abrupt changes in the precise identity of Russia's main Others. Such instrumentally adopted sharp discursive swings are unlikely to constitute an appropriate tool for societal consensus management and for the achievement of political stability in the long term.

T1  - A Cross-National Analysis of the Causes and Consequences of Economic News
AN  - 1933858618
AB  - Objective 
Work on economic news argues that U.S. coverage focuses primarily on changes rather than levels of future economic conditions; it also both affects and reflects public economic sentiment. Given that economic perceptions are related to policy preferences and government support, this is of consequence for politics. This article explores the generalizability of these findings. 
Methods 
Using nearly 100,000 stories over 30 years in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada, we compare media tone, public opinion, and economic conditions. 
Result 
Analyses demonstrate that media tone and public opinion follow future economic change in all three countries. Media and opinion are also related, but the effect mostly runs from the public to the media, not the other way around. 
Conclusion 
These results confirm the generalizability of prior findings, and the importance of considering more than a simple unidirectional link between media coverage and public economic sentiment.

We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N = 1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

T1  - Justice Concerns Can Feed Nationalistic Concerns and Impede Solidarity in the Euro Crisis: How Victim Sensitivity Translates into Political Attitudes
AN  - 1877051943
AB  - We investigated how victim sensitivity and news media exposure conjointly contribute to the formation of political attitudes in the context of the euro crisis. Study 1 (N = 208) showed that observer-sensitive individuals were more likely and victim-sensitive individuals were less likely to support solidarity with countries in need of financial support. These correlations were mediated by affective components of political attitudes, namely nationalistic concerns, resentment about and empathic concerns with debtor countries. In Study 2 (N = 51), using a pre-post within-subjects design, we showed that framing the euro crisis in an 'exploitation frame" (compared to a 'solidarity frame') in news media reports was more likely to trigger nationalistic concerns and, consequently, decrease support of solidarity in victim-sensitive individuals compared to their less victim-sensitive counterparts. These results are in line with the SeMI model and previous findings that victim sensitivity is linked to fear of being exploited in intergroup relations.

T1  - 'The Germans are back': Euroscepticism and anti-Germanism in crisis-stricken Greece
AN  - 1862143686
AB  - The Eurocrisis has generated a deep and ongoing politicization of the EU within and across national public spheres, fuelling age-old and new political and social conflicts, which in turn shape public perceptions of crisis and the legitimacy of 'crisis government'. Focusing on Greece, an EU member state at the epicentre of the crisis, this paper examines how the European polity was contested in the first five years (2009-2013) of the 'Eurocrisis'. During this period, anti-German stereotypes resurfaced in the Greek public sphere in parallel with increasingly mainstream Euroscepticism. Nevertheless, analysis of news and social media content from this period shows that beneath this new-found scepticism towards the EU and Germany's role in it lie two much broader narratives: that of the power struggle between the people and the political elites; and that of an epic clash between diametrically different political ideologies.

T1  - The Framing of Public Knowledge Controversies in the Media: A Comparative Analysis of the Portrayal of Badger Vaccination in the English National, Regional and Farming Press
AN  - 1855027825
AB  - Science has a powerful role in society. It can fuel innovation, shape policy and influence public opinion. However, science can also be highly controversial and subject to substantial disagreement and debate. Such debates are often evident in the media which regularly reports on areas of disagreement and debate. This article draws on the case-study of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), which has become a highly politicised issue in recent years, to explore media representation of public knowledge controversies. The disease has received substantial policy and media attention, particularly in relation to badgers and their role in its spread. This article focuses on the ways in which the various debates associated with bTB and its control are presented in the press, with a specific emphasis on badger vaccination. An in-depth discourse analysis compares regional, national and farming press, and identifies a number of complex dualisms against which the debate is framed. These dualisms help to explain the unclear policy direction and constant divisions between those who do and do not support badger vaccination, and the continued status of bTB control as a public knowledge controversy.

T1  - Stereotypes Associated With Age-related Conditions and Assistive Device Use in Canadian Media
AN  - 1844211743
AB  - Purpose of the Study: Newspapers are an important source of information. The discourses within the media can influence public attitudes and support or discourage stereotypical portrayals of older individuals. This study critically examined discourses within a Canadian newspaper in terms of stereotypical depictions of age-related health conditions and assistive technology devices (ATDs). Design and Methods: Four years (2009-2013) of Globe and Mail articles were searched for terms relevant to the research question. A total of 65 articles were retained, and a critical discourse analysis (CDA) of the texts was conducted. The articles were coded for stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions and ATDs, consequences of the stereotyping, and context (overall setting or background) of the discourse. Results: The primary code list included 4 contexts, 13 stereotypes, and 9 consequences of stereotyping. CDA revealed discourses relating to (a) maintaining autonomy in a stereotypical world, (b) ATDs as obstacles in employment, (c) barriers to help seeking for age-related conditions, and (d) people in power setting the stage for discrimination. Implications: Our findings indicate that discourses in the Canadian media include stereotypes associated with age-related health conditions. Further, depictions of health conditions and ATDs may exacerbate existing stereotypes about older individuals, limit the options available to them, lead to a reduction in help seeking, and lower ATD use. Education about the realities of age-related health changes and ATDs is needed in order to diminish stereotypes and encourage ATD uptake and use.

T1  - Effects of Competing Narratives on Public Perceptions of Opioid Pain Reliever Addiction during Pregnancy
AN  - 1821759699
AB  - Opioid pain reliever addiction has increased among women of reproductive age over the last fifteen years. News media and public attention have focused on the implications of this trend for infants exposed to opioids prenatally, with state policy responses varying in the extent to which they are punitive or public health oriented. We fielded a six-group randomized experiment among a nationally representative sample of US adults to test the effects of narratives portraying a woman with opioid pain reliever addiction during pregnancy on beliefs about people addicted to opioid pain relievers, perceptions of treatment effectiveness, policy attitudes, and emotional responses. Portraying a high socioeconomic status (SES) woman in the narrative lowered perceptions of individual blame for addiction and reduced public support for punitive policies. Depicting the barriers to treatment faced by a low SES woman lowered support for punitive policies and increased support for expanded insurance coverage for treatment. The extent to which narratives portraying successfully treated addiction affected public attitudes depended on the SES of the woman portrayed. These findings can inform the development of communication strategies to reduce stigma toward this population, reduce support for punitive policies, and increase support for more public health-oriented approaches to addressing this problem.

T1  - Trial by media: The framing of Oscar Pistorius as the media spectacle
AN  - 1848467796
AB  - The coverage of the Oscar Pistorius bail application proceedings is examined using the notions of ‘trial by media’ and ‘the media spectacle’. A sample of 54 issues was taken from the Cape Argus and quantitatively and qualitatively analysed. The research substantiated the hypothesis that Pistorius was subjected to a trial by the media, in which he was convicted in the court of public opinion. Furthermore, the coverage of the legal proceedings by the Cape Argus elevated the status of the case to that of ‘the megaspectacle’, which emphasized the importance of Pistorius, while demoting the importance of Reeva Steenkamp. ‘The megaspectacle’ also highlighted the societal struggles that South African citizens face, including poor gun control, domestic violence, subordination of women, as well as racism.

T1  - Don't judge a living book by its cover: effectiveness of the living library intervention in reducing prejudice toward Roma and LGBT people
AN  - 1817003843
AB  - In Hungary, prejudices toward Roma and the LGBT community are highly salient and explicit in public opinion, the media, and in the political discourse. The present study examined the effectiveness of the Living Library prejudice reduction intervention--in which participants as "Readers" have engaging contact with living "Books" who are trained volunteers from the Roma and LGBT communities. In a pre-post intervention study with high school students (N=105), results suggest that the Living Library intervention reduced participants' scores on multiple measures of prejudice. The Living Library intervention appeared to be effective among both those participants whose friends endorsed prejudice or more tolerant attitudes toward Roma and LGBT people. In sum, Living Library appears to be a useful method for reducing prejudice in contexts which are characterized by strong negative attitudes toward these different groups.

A 'retweet count' on, say Twitter or weibo, can be taken as a measure of user influence. The assumption is that when B retweets A's message, B empathizes with A and wishes to disseminate the message more widely. But this assumption has hardly been tested and preliminary evidence suggests practices for retweeting on Twitter vary. Nor can retweeting practices on Twitter be assumed to apply on weibo. This paper makes the first effort to understand the practice of reposting on China's weibo, focusing on the content of reposts in comparison to that of the original messages. A quantitative comparison is made of the frame [Entman, R. M. (1993). Framing: Toward clarification of a fractured paradigm. Journal of Communication, 43(4), 51-58; Gamson, W. A., & Modigliani, A. (1989). Media discourse and public opinion on nuclear power: A constructionist approach. American Journal of Sociology, 95, 1-37] of the source post of 21 cases, and their reposts. The posts and reposts all refer to the issue of officials being exposed for corruption on Sina Weibo. The study finds sound evidence of networked framing, in which reposters revised frames of the source posters while disseminating them. Although over half of the reposts merely republished the source post without added content, what emerged were new communicative functions, case definitions, and a diagnosis of the consequences of exposing the cases. However, different types of user accounts drew different reposting frames, which points to a consistent paradigm between the source accounts and the reposters. The results are important for understanding the mechanisms behind the formation of public opinion on weibo.

T1  - Combining CDA and topic modeling: Analyzing discursive connections between Islamophobia and anti-feminism on an online forum
AN  - 1800514584
AB  - In this article we present an analysis of the discursive connections between Islamophobia and anti-feminism on a large Internet forum. We argue that the incipient shift from traditional media toward user-driven social media brings with it new media dynamics, relocating the (re)production of societal discourses and power structures and thus bringing about new ways in which discursive power is exercised. This clearly motivates the need to critically engage this field. Our research is based on the analysis of a corpus consisting of over 50 million posts, collected from the forum using custom web crawlers. In order to approach this vast material of unstructured text, we suggest a novel methodological synergy combining critical discourse analysis (CDA) and topic modeling -- a type of statistical model for the automated categorization of large quantities of texts developed in computer science. By rendering an overview or 'content map' of the corpus, topic modeling provides an enriching complement to CDA, aiding discovery and adding analytical rigor.

T1  - Volunteering as Protest: Against State Failure or the State Itself?
AN  - 2532483320
AB  - Although the Czech Republic (CR) is not a favorite destination nor even a transit country for migrants through Europe, the refugee crisis has materialized into a strict state policy of rejection. The CR rejects proposals for European solutions and detains and imprisons immigrants, most of whom are inadvertently arrived there. This preliminary refusal strategy is peculiar to both the political and media spheres (and public opinion) and is described in the opening sections of this work. However, the CR, is also a country in which the tally of immigrants is less than the number of Czechs citizens traveling beyond their national borders to help refugees congregating along the “Balkan Route”, where they frequently outnumber volunteers from other countries. This paper goes on to describe the development of these grassroots Czech volunteer organizations and activities in 2015. From the beginning it was characterized by spontaneity and a lack of hierarchy, with the Internet and social media playing a vital role during mobilization and organization. The methodological section defines how this sample was analyzed and the manner in which it was dealt. Section five summarizes the most important findings of the case study: (1) the results of a questionnaire survey among volunteers, (2) the results of a qualitative content analysis of their communication in social networks. Besides basic mapping steps (features of volunteer’s participation), the analysis attempts to capture motivations for volunteer’s participation. Comparison with selected motivation typologies emphasizes the protective (later the normative) motivation, on which the hypotheses are based regarding the dispute about the national identity of volunteering as an ideological, and therefore foreseeable, dispute.

T1  - Does public criticism Erode trust in the police? The case of Jari Aarnio in the Finnish news media and its effects on the public's attitudes towards the police
AN  - 1781815612
AB  - A significant part of the general public's observations and image concerning the police comes through the mass media. It has been assumed that one factor affecting the level of trust is the way the media handles the police. This article describes the media uproar that arose in Finland in November 2013 about police misconduct, and its effects on the public trust in the police. Two hypotheses were tested in the study: (a) negative publicity always decreases trust, and so, too, in this case; and (b) a change in trust is affected by the public's independent interpretation of the publicity battle, in which case criticism might also increase trust. The study materials comprise the news coverage concerning the uproar and four opinion surveys collected after it occurred. The first survey was conducted immediately after the press conference of the case in week 48/2013 and the other ones in three-week intervals. The results show that following the uproar, compared to the earlier results of the European Social Survey, trust in the police did not decrease-on the contrary, it increased slightly. Our results suggest that in this case a large part of the audience has taken, to use the term of Stuart Hall, the oppositional position when interpreting negative news about the police.

T1  - Social Media Analyses for Social Measurement
AN  - 1766806886
AB  - Demonstrations that analyses of social media content can align with measurement from sample surveys have raised the question of whether survey research can be supplemented or even replaced with less costly and burdensome data mining of already-existing or "found" social media content. But just how trustworthy such measurement can be -- say, to replace official statistics -- is unknown. Survey researchers and data scientists approach key questions from starting assumptions and analytic traditions that differ on, for example, the need for representative samples drawn from frames that fully cover the population. New conversations between these scholarly communities are needed to understand the potential points of alignment and non-alignment. Across these approaches, there are major differences in (a) how participants (survey respondents and social media posters) understand the activity they are engaged in; (b) the nature of the data produced by survey responses and social media posts, and the inferences that are legitimate given the data; and (c) practical and ethical considerations surrounding the use of the data. Estimates are likely to align to differing degrees depending on the research topic and the populations under consideration, the particular features of the surveys and social media sites involved, and the analytic techniques for extracting opinions and experiences from social media. Traditional population coverage may not be required for social media content to effectively predict social phenomena to the extent that social media content distills or summarizes broader conversations that are also measured by surveys.

T1  - When the media meet: Problems and promises of EU-China dialogue in the journalistic sphere: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 1781818143
AB  - This paper argues that lack of interpersonal interaction between media professionals in Europe and China partly accounts for continued misperceptions and gaps in understanding between both the nations. Investing into people-to-people dialogue is essential for journalists to overcome prejudice and to improve mutual knowledge. Days during which journalists are immersed into another country's culture and media scene have great potential to induce changes in perceptions, both at the individual and societal level. This can be attributed to the built-in multiplier effect of media publications reaching wide audiences. Drawing on the "Europe-China Media Exchange " set up, developed by the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, the article presents achievements (but also lessons) learnt from interpersonal exchange programs developed for European and Chinese journalists.

T1  - Public Perceptions of the Media Coverage of Irregular Immigration: Comparative Insights From France, the United States, and Norway: PROD
AN  - 1681928748
AB  - Irregular immigration has become a globally important topic. While there have been some studies on public opinion toward irregular immigration, virtually no studies have examined how audiences evaluate the media coverage of this issue. There is also a lack of comparative research. The aims of this article are to provide survey data on public opinion toward irregular immigration in the United States, France, and Norway as well as a comparative analysis of public perceptions of the news coverage. Findings suggest that irregular immigration remains a highly salient issue in public opinion in all three countries. Furthermore, public opinion is generally critical and skeptic toward irregular immigration and immigrants, and differences between countries regarding the coverage of the issue in national mainstream media do not necessarily seem to be mirrored in public opinion. The survey data also suggest that citizens in all three countries tend to believe that the negative aspects of irregular immigration such as crimes or border control receive too little coverage whereas perspectives more positive to irregular immigration receive too much. Implications for further comparative research on public opinion and media coverage are discussed.

T1  - The Dynamics of Immigration Coverage in Comparative Perspective: PROD
AN  - 1681928719
AB  - This comment focuses both on issues related to comparative analysis of media systems, and to issues related to immigration, specifically. It explores the implication of findings on the prevalence of human interest framing in immigration coverage for comparative analysis, suggesting that it may be too simplistic to assume that commercialization is always associated with human interest framing, particularly in coverage of marginalized populations. It also explores the complexity of public opinion on immigration, and issues about how to understand the role of media over time in the evolution of public opinion.

T1  - The-Truth-About-Islam.Com: Ordinary Theories of Racism and Cyber Islamophobia
AN  - 1748865192; 201600771
AB  - This essay contends that the digital debates over Islamophobia show a curious resemblance to pre-existing American folk theories of racism. The outcry surrounding the reality show All-American Muslim is the case study, but the argument applies to a broader development of cultural racism and Islamophobia in American society. Starting from a discussion of the politics of racialization and 'post-civil rights' racism in the USA, the article outlines the mediation of racial politics through reality television and online commenting in relation to Islamophobia. Finally, appropriating the work of Eduardo Bonilla-Silva and Jane Hill on the underlying theories of American racism, I examine two seemingly opposing discourses entailed in the AAM controversy, and demonstrate that the entire online outcry has closely followed the old paradigms through which Americans talk about racism.

T1  - Media Effects on Support for European Integration in Old and New EU Member States
AN  - 1728663359; 201534899
AB  - The study measures the strength of media effects on attitudes to EU integration. Media exposure is the independent variable; support for European integration is the dependent variable; socio-economic conditions and cognitive-cultural variables are contextual variables. The analysis covers 27 EU member states at the time of 2009 EP election. Both micro-level variables and country-level effects were taken into consideration in hierarchical linear models. Data from the PIREDEU study was used. Analyses document weak influence of media exposure on attitudes. The overall positive effect is mostly concentrated in stable democracies with well-developed media systems. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Gender on the Brain: A Case Study of Science Communication in the New Media Environment
AN  - 1618141126
AB  - Neuroscience research on sex difference is currently a controversial field, frequently accused of purveying a ‘neurosexism’ that functions to naturalise gender inequalities. However, there has been little empirical investigation of how information about neurobiological sex difference is interpreted within wider society. This paper presents a case study that tracks the journey of one high-profile study of neurobiological sex differences from its scientific publication through various layers of the public domain. A content analysis was performed to ascertain how the study was represented in five domains of communication: the original scientific article, a press release, the traditional news media, online reader comments and blog entries. Analysis suggested that scientific research on sex difference offers an opportunity to rehearse abiding cultural understandings of gender. In both scientific and popular contexts, traditional gender stereotypes were projected onto the novel scientific information, which was harnessed to demonstrate the factual truth and normative legitimacy of these beliefs. Though strains of misogyny were evident within the readers’ comments, most discussion of the study took pains to portray the sexes’ unique abilities as equal and ‘complementary’. However, this content often resembled a form of benevolent sexism, in which praise of women’s social-emotional skills compensated for their relegation from more esteemed trait-domains, such as rationality and productivity. The paper suggests that embedding these stereotype patterns in neuroscience may intensify their rhetorical potency by lending them the epistemic authority of science. It argues that the neuroscience of sex difference does not merely reflect, but can actively shape the gender norms of contemporary society.

T1  - Senses of humor, media use, and opinions about the treatment of marginalized groups
AN  - 1680150730; 201514204
AB  - This research examines public opinions toward marginalized groups, applying the notion of multiple 'senses of humor' as a filter in the process of opinion formation while controlling for the relative impact of media exposure on such opinions. A sample of 288 students at a large urban university responded to an online survey measuring a variety of public opinions, media use (including traditional, news, and interactive) variables, four senses of humor (disparagement, dark/arousal, incongruity, and social currency), and social locators, including political orientation. Results confirm that, in addition to social locators, senses of humor provide a viable set of predictors of public opinion about marginalized groups, clearly surpassing media use. Further, the senses of humor are found to be linked to political orientation, raising issues of the commonalities and origins of these critical filters of sociopolitical attitudes.

T1  - Notes on a (sex crime) scandal: The impact of media coverage of sexual abuse in the Catholic Church on public opinion
AN  - 1559007272; 201434097
AB  - Purpose Public opinion scholarship has identified the media as a driving force behind decidedly negative public sentiment about crime and justice. We draw on this media cultivation framework to examine whether the highly publicized sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church impacted public opinion. Methods: Using data from a 2010 CBS/New York Times national poll we investigate how exposure to news coverage detailing the abuse affected levels of public confidence in the Church's ability to protect children. Results: Contrasting with prior research, we uncovered a positive impact of media exposure. Catholics with greater media consumption about the scandal were significantly more confident in the Church's ability to prevent sexual abuse. In addition, indicating a 'boomerang' effect of coverage, Catholics who felt the media coverage unfairly targeted the Church held more optimistic views. Supporting the substitution thesis, religiosity mediated these effects among this group. This positive impact was not just limited to Catholics, however. Non-Catholics who perceived the media coverage to be biased felt more positively about the Church's ability to address sex crime in the future. Conclusion: Media consumption of the sexual abuse scandal does not exert a negative influence on public confidence in the Church. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - News With an Attitude: Assessing the Mechanisms Underlying the Effects of Opinionated News
AN  - 1718064874; 201531378
AB  - Opinionated news targets communities of like minded viewers, relies on dramaturgical storytelling techniques, and shares characteristics with political satire. Accordingly, opinionated news should be understood as a specific form of political entertainment. We have investigated the mechanisms underlying the effects of opinionated news on political attitudes using an experimental design that employed manipulated television news items. Findings confirm that opinionated news positively affects policy attitudes via its presumed influence on others and subsequent perceptions of the opinion climate. However, opinionated news also negatively affects attitudes via hostile media perceptions and evoked anger, especially for people with incongruent political preferences. Due to these opposing processes, we found no total effect of opinionated news on policy attitudes. Conditions are discussed under which either the positive or the negative indirect effect is likely to dominate. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Neutral Media? Evidence of Media Bias and its Economic Impact
AN  - 1531932426; 201423886
AB  - Three major surveys of professional journalists, in 1976, 1986, and 1996, suggest that the vast majority consider themselves to be neutral, objective, and balanced observers, whose role is merely to provide information. But how neutral is the media, in terms of its orientation and effects on the behavior of the markets? In this paper, we unite a number of literatures to suggest that by choosing what event to report, how much and how frequent to report an event, and by choosing what descriptive tone to adopt in their coverage, the media has a non-neutral impact on the economy. We report evidence to suggest that: (1) the media helps set the public agenda, by promoting certain events and causes, for better or for worse; (2) the media influence the public's perception of risk, by disproportionately sensationalizing risk and by emphasizing probable negative consequences over probably positive ones; (3) the media influences elections and their outcomes; (4) the media influences the public's perception of the manager, the reputation of the firm, and the goods that the firm produces; (5) the media shapes consumer sentiment and the consumers' willingness to spend; and (6) the media shapes business sentiment and influences both firm- and market-level behavior. In doing so, we demonstrate conclusively that the media is not neutral: the media alters the public's perception of reality. In other words, we suggest not only that the media reports the news, but also shapes the world in which we live. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Outrageous political opinion and political anxiety in the US
AN  - 1541997076; 201427283
AB  - In a time marked by declining audiences for nightly news broadcasts and dwindling newspaper readership, the audience size for outrage-based political opinion-media (e.g., The Rush Limbaugh Show, The O'Reilly Factor, The Ed Show) has grown dramatically. Existing research has shown that people gravitate toward media sources that support their pre-existing beliefs, but explanations for this tendency dwell upon psychological processes and perceptions of information quality. We find such explanations unsatisfying for this unique genre, and we apply a more sociological lens. Using in-depth interviews with fans and qualitative analyses of television and talk radio transcripts-this research shows how anxieties churned up by public political dialog and people's related tendency to avoid political talk with those outside their most trusted inner circles help to create powerful connections between charismatic political talk show hosts and their fans. Shifting the focus from the information desired by fans to experiences they value, and from psychological to social needs, we show that outrage-based political opinion programs create safe political spaces for fans. We end by suggesting how shifts in the broader political climate have left conservative audiences hungrier for such content. [Copyright Elsevier B.V.]

T1  - The association between media exposure of interracial relationships and attitudes toward interracial relationships
AN  - 1433108267
AB  - From an extended contact hypothesis (ECH) framework, mass-media portrayals of interracial relationships may encourage positive attitudes toward such relationships. Caucasian participants (N=218) indicated examples of media portrayals of Black-White interracial relationships, attitudes toward Blacks, attitudes toward interracial relationships, degree of identification with Whites, and the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. Supporting our hypotheses, extended contact with Black-White relationships via media portrayals was associated with more positive attitudes toward Blacks and interracial relationships. These relationships were mediated by the degree to which Blacks are included in self-representations. This study furthers understanding of ECH by including representations of dyadic relationships and suggests an avenue for the creation of interventions for improving attitudes toward interracial relationships.

T1  - Reliving history: Using priming to assess the effects of world events on public opinion
AN  - 1417521862; 201332727
AB  - We present an experimental method to assess the impact of world events on political attitudes. Building on cognitive priming research, we expose experimental groups to reminders of historical events and a control group to neutral pictures and captions. Attitudes of interest are assessed afterward. Differences between experimental and control groups indicate the current impact of thoughts of the event. Study 1 assessed how Muslims' political attitudes in Malaysia, Cameroon, and Israel are affected by the violent Iranian government crackdown following the 2009 presidential election and by President Obama's outreach to Islam (T. Holzman, June 4, 2009, Obama seeks "New Beginning" with Muslim world. Washington, DC, National Public Radio). Study 2 assessed whether primes of Arab Spring uprisings (the wave of prodemocratic demonstrations and protests that occurred across the Arab World in early 2011) increased support for democracy among Tunisian Muslims. Both studies demonstrated effects of these events, supporting the utility of this method. This method can complement existing approaches in public-opinion research, shed light on psychopolitical dynamics set in motion by historical events, and provide useful information to policymakers.

T1  - Commentary: Television, Business Entertainment, and Civic Culture
AN  - 1322719214; 201311585
AB  - This short commentary piece arises from completing an Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC)-funded research project into the relationship between representations of business on factual television in the United Kingdom and the public's perception and understanding of entrepreneurship. What we would like to do here is reflect on some of the implications of this work with specific regard to the research agenda around the media and civic culture. We remain convinced that even in the digital age, popular television remains a central entry point into debates about the relationship between broader civic and political culture.

T1  - Media Framing of Terrorism: Implications for Public Opinion, Civil Liberties, and Counterterrorism Policies
AN  - 1151969013
AB  - This study presents experimental findings on the impact of media framing of the 2005 London bombings. A total of 371 American participants were exposed to one of two frames to test their effect on public attitudes towards civil liberties and Muslims, and support for counterterrorism policies. Results show that the "domestic homegrown" frame produces greater increases in fear than the "international" frame. This leads to greater support for restricting civil liberties of Muslims and, under certain circumstances, general feelings of negativity toward Muslims. The study also finds support for the hydraulic effect of framing in that the domestic homegrown frame suppresses party identification in attitude formation. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - The interaction between mass media and the internet in non-democratic states: The case of China
AN  - 1125219794; 201241242
AB  - The internet is widely seen to have facilitated social movement organizations (SMOs) by providing them with alternative media. In the western context, some authors suggest that additionally SMOs use the internet tactically as a tool to gain access to traditional news media. This usage is seen to reaffirm and reinforce the centrality of print and electronic news media. This article shifts the focus to China and examines the interaction between the internet and the traditional mass media in the unfolding of three internet incidents. It reveals that via the expression of public opinion on the internet ordinary people are able to collectively shape and even direct conventional news agendas. In China, where the role of the media is to 'direct' public opinion rather than to reflect it, this suggests that the interaction between the two forms of communication serves to challenge state control over the traditional media.

T1  - 'Beards, scarves, halal meat, terrorists, forced marriage': television industries and the production of 'race'
AN  - 1125219216; 201241230
AB  - This article considers the persistence of stereotypical representations of 'race' that appear in television in the West. According to a particular policy discourse, improving the on-screen representation of non-white groups is a matter of increasing the number of black and Asian folk working in the broadcasting industries -- particularly at the senior management level. However, this article argues that the constant production of hegemonic images of 'race' cannot be tackled via recruitment measures alone. Adopting a 'cultural industries' approach to television production, the article uses an ethnographic study of British Asians working in the UK broadcasting industry to examine the conditions of production through which minority representations are created. By paying closer attention to the experience of cultural work, the article reveals how it is the increasingly commercialized cultures of production in television, constituted by the industry's shift towards deregulation and neoliberal market models, that steers the work of Asian filmmakers and executives themselves into producing problematic, reductive representations of 'race'.

T1  - Comparing the Effects of Newspaper, TV News, and the Internet News on the Evaluation of a Major Political Candidate: Latent Growth Modeling with Longitudinal Panel Data from the 2007 Presidential Campaign in South Korea
AN  - 1037875689; 201231959
AB  - The present article argues that the reasons of the theoretical predicaments regarding the relationship between news media and public opinions are: (a) news media might not be a single entity-the different types of news media (newspaper, TV news, and the Internet news) might have different effects on political behaviors; and (b) while effects of media on political behaviors should be probed through longitudinal data, most studies so far have exclusively relied on cross-sectional single wave data. Through the latent growth modeling with a set of longitudinal data, the present study revealed that TV news use (the increase rates as well as the amount of use) had positive influences on the evaluation of the candidate's morality. In contrast, the Internet news use (the increase rates as well as the amount of use) showed negative effects. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Cool Minds in Heated Debates? Migration-related Attitudes in Germany Before and After a Natural Intervention
AN  - 1322714744; 201314100
AB  - Data from the Transatlantic Trends: Immigration survey was used to investigate whether the debate surrounding Thilo Sarrazin's immigration-skeptical Deutschland schafft sich ab (Germany abolishes itself) had any impact on migration-related attitudes in Germany. The book was published in August 2010 and fieldwork took place during the evolving debate, providing a unique opportunity to study the impact of a major media event on public attitudes. Descriptive findings on the aggregate level show no substantial change in migration-related attitudes in the months after publication. More detailed findings reveal a significant increase in skepticism only for respondents with low levels of education, whose assessment of Muslim migrants' integration became more negative during the debate. There are two possible reasons for the lack of more substantial attitudinal change. Firstly, the debate was highly polarized and lacked the consonant national media coverage that is an important precondition for media effects on public opinion. Secondly, there were no additional "external shocks" prior to the book's release, such as a high levels of immigration, that could have made the public more susceptible to criticism of the impact of migration. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The Relevance of People's Attitudes Towards Freedom of Expression in a Changing Media Environment
AN  - 1315598833; 201308316
AB  - The article outlines arguments for the relevance of people's attitudes towards freedom of expression: It is a fundamental principle of democracy that if a virtue does not receive support from the population, it will not be anchored in law and its foundation is endangered in the medium term. People's support for free speech is becoming even more influential because authoritative control of internet communication is faced with difficulties. Furthermore, with the development of social media users gain new opportunities to publicly express their opinions attaching even more importance to normative self-regulation. As a matter of fact, these increased opportunities of self-regulation may either enhance or decrease the exercise of expression rights. Thus, citizen's endorsement of free expression is a valuable indicator of the status of freedom of expression in a country. To approach to the subject empirically, the paper systematizes findings on people's attitudes towards free speech: Most people believe in freedom of expression in the abstract. Willingness to apply the right to opposing groups, however, is lower. Perceived threats, confidence in democratic principles, mode of communication, and personality variables influence tolerance of expressions. Finally, a research agenda is put forward to examine appreciation of free expression, its antecedence, and implications. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rebuilding or Intruding? Media Coverage and Public Opinion on Latino Immigration in Post-Katrina Louisiana
AN  - 1283639664; 201304253
AB  - Objectives: Few studies fully integrate the interactive effects of political, geographic, and media contexts into studies of public opinion on immigration. We rectify this by utilizing the post-Katrina Latino immigrant migration to Louisiana as an opportunity for study of these relationships. Methods: We utilize survey data and content analysis of news coverage to examine the influence of news exposure on attitudes toward immigrants and immigration. Results: Exposure to immigration news influences the relative importance of immigration to other issues, self-reported personal contact with Spanish-speaking populations, and perceptions of the legal status of immigrant populations. Conclusions: Local news coverage of immigration increases awareness and concern about immigration and heightened news exposure increases perceptions about personal interactions with Spanish-speaking populations. Additionally, local news coverage of immigration influences the importance of key characteristics of immigrant populations, particularly whether immigrants are here illegally. Tone of coverage, as opposed to amount, exerts the more consistent effect on immigration-related attitudes. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The role of media in the process of socialization to American politics among international students
AN  - 902083175; 201122707
AB  - Mass media have been considered a powerful agent of political socialization, affecting political attitudes and behaviors of voters and non-voters. This study employed a survey of international students in the US to investigate the effects of print, television and online news on political socialization during the 2008 US presidential race. Results indicated that newspaper and television news use significantly predicted internal political efficacy and intentions to participate in American politics. Media 'nationality', motivation to apply for permanent residence and duration of stay in the US were explored for possible moderation of media effects on political socialization. The findings are discussed within the framework of media effects on political socialization in host and home countries. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Public Opinion on the Use of Consumer Racial Profiling to Identify Shoplifters: An Exploratory Study
AN  - 887498260; 201119136
AB  - Based on a recent state-level poll of Pennsylvania residents (N = 852), this paper extended previous public opinion research on consumer racial profiling (CRP) by exploring whether the views of Pennsylvanians on CRP were influenced by ethical concerns, the belief that the practice was discriminatory, and the perceived effectiveness of the practice. Support was found that views regarding the perception that CRP was discriminatory increased the likelihood that respondents felt CRP occurs. Similarly, those respondents who perceived that CRP was effective were also more likely to believe that it occurs. Ethical considerations reduced the likelihood of support for CRP while perceived effectiveness increased the support for CRP. The authors argue that scholars should work through the media and civil rights organizations to publicize the empirical research that clearly shows that CRP does exist and that it is not effective.

T1  - News use and political socialization among young Jordanians
AN  - 1018356712; 201213409
AB  - This study examined the relationship between young Jordanians' (N = 321) news use and their feelings toward the Jordanian and US governments. Consumption of traditional news delivery formats (such as print newspapers, radio broadcasts and interpersonal sources) was measured, as was reliance on new media formats such as blogs, text messaging and podcasting. Political socialization measures were indices of political trust and appraisals of the US government. Results suggest that young Jordanians in the sample rely mostly on TV news, newspapers and interpersonal contacts for current events information, and that TV news use and reliance on interpersonal sources were associated with negative views of the US government.

T1  - Islamophobia and Sexism: Muslim Women in the Western Mass Media
AN  - 852899749; 201104725
AB  - This paper reflects on the role of mass media in the social reproduction of one form of racism: Islamophobia. Firstly, the article focus on the dominant representations of "Muslim women" in the western media in general and in Spanish media in particular, in order to highlight the specific characteristics of the image of the female Muslim "other" and, likewise, in order to analyse from a gender perspective, the symbolic mechanisms legitimising certain Islamophobic thoughts and practices. To this end, the author gathers the results of many researches which prove how dominant representations transmitted in the hegemonic media discourse in Spain reinforce today many stereotypes about Muslim women in general and migrant Muslim women particularly. In the second part, the article looks specifically at the treatment of l'affaire du voile ("the veil affair") by the French media. Through the analysis of the origin and social implications of this law and its media treatment, the author tries to demonstrate how the defence of "women's rights" was instrumentalised in the public debate and how claims identifying the racist aspects of the law were ignored by the majority of media and politicians, in spite of the fact that this law affected mainly the Muslim community -- thus fuelling division and discrimination. In short, these issues reflect specially on the mechanics behind the "interlinking" of sexism and racism, from a material standpoint and, above all, from a discursive and symbolic point of view.

T1  - Think about Him This Way: Priming, News Media, and South Koreans' Evaluation of the President
AN  - 764423543; 201065588
AB  - This study examines the effect of news priming, which refers to the media's influence on the standards by which the public evaluates political figures. Linking survey data to an analysis of issue coverage, we look into whether television news in South Korea affects the way citizens evaluate the president. Our findings provided support for the priming hypothesis. There was a close correspondence between prominent issues in the news and important dimensions of presidential evaluation among the respondents. We also found that priming effects were largely a function of recent, rather than cumulative, news coverage. Finally, findings indicated that people with different levels of news exposure were responding to the media within different time frames. Adapted from the source document.
