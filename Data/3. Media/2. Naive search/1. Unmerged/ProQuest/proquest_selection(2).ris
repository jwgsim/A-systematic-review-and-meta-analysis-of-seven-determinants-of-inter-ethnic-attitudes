T1  - Measuring Religious Non-Affiliation in China: A Comparison of Major National Surveys in China
AN  - 2649452528
AB  - Measuring the rate of religious non-affiliation is a difficult task in China, one of the least religious countries in the world, and elsewhere. This study evaluates the trend of religious non-affiliation in China using 22 surveys spanning three decades. We found that two surveys asking beliefs in a mix of gods and religions yielded dramatically lower estimates of non-affiliation compared to the others that measured affiliation explicitly. Among the latter, using a filter question (a yes/no question for religious affiliation) increased the reports of non-affiliation but allowing multiple choices and putting “no religion” toward the end of the lists of response options moderately decreased the reports of non-affiliation. After accounting for question design and demographic differences across the surveys, the decline in religious non-affiliation is reduced and becomes not significant during more recent years.

T1  - Discourse, Difference, and Divergence: Exploring Media Representations and Online Public Sentiments toward Marginalized Urban Communities in Jamaica during the COVID-19 Pandemic
AN  - 2679830273
AB  - Despite lacking the resources to adequately adhere to public health protocols, urban residents belonging to impoverished communities in Kingston, Jamaica were prominently featured in local news reports that highlighted their breaches of social distancing. These reports generated an overwhelmingly prejudiced online social discourse, characterized by derogatory and dehumanizing remarks. This research aims to explore the ways media representations of calls for social distancing have unearthed latent social cleavages and contributed to the othering of Kingston’s poor. A thematic analysis was used to understand the nature of the public response to these news reports. The comments were manually coded, and emergent themes were classified based on the sentiments expressed. The comments generated evoked class, place, race, and political tensions, potentially perpetuating the public perception of vulnerable groups as the ‘threatening other’. These comments possibly represent deeper problems associated with the social divergence of Jamaican society. The lack of sensitivity exhibited shows a general disregard for the stark social realities commonly experienced by subaltern groups. These findings suggest media coverage promoting public safety, while important, may inadvertently lead to heightened social tensions and perpetuate social stigmas against marginalized groups, potentially stirring social divergence and countering efforts toward inclusiveness and integration.

T1  - Social Media Expression, Political Extremity, and Reduced Network Interaction: An Imagined Audience Approach
AN  - 2651990206
AB  - The recent rise of political extremity and radicalization has presented unique challenges to contemporary politics, governance, and social cohesion in many societies in the world. In this study, we propose an imagined audience approach to understand how social media’s expanded expression capabilities are related to users’ political extremity and reduced network interaction. We demonstrate the usefulness of our imagined audience framework using a multi-country survey data set. Results from the United States, South Korea, and Japan reveal that expressive use of social media is associated with more extreme political attitudes and heightened intolerance, but the effect is contingent on whom the expresser has in mind as their audience. In particular, expressing one’s political self has a depolarizing effect for those expecting low audience reinforcement. We test the boundary conditions of our model in a more restricted information environment with a Chinese sample. We conclude by discussing the significance of our imagined audience approach and its relevance to today’s technology-mediated self-presentation.

T1  - The "All-Seeing Community": Charleston's Eastside, Video Surveillance, and the Listening Task
AN  - 2648273189
AB  - On Charleston's Eastside, the belief in video surveillance as a tool to "deter crime" was widely shared by the local church community, law enforcement, and social media groups, after a significant increase in gun violence in 2019. By concentrating on the public discourses surrounding the concomitantly rapid increase in gun violence and video surveillance, this paper analyzes the ways in which these communications-through their language, images, and filmic documentation-have shaped and informed public perceptions of CCTV in Charleston's Eastside. The presented discourses around the public perception of video surveillance and the analysis thereof offer an opportunity to explore the cultural assumptions as well as the underlying racial, gender-based, and socioeconomic power dynamics experienced in Charleston's Eastside community. Through the analysis's broad scope, this paper argues for a shift in public perceptions of video surveillance. As an integral part of the Eastside's surveillance infrastructure, video surveillance in the hands of a community of "all-seers" displays, at first, unspoken strategies for preserving racialized surveillance hierarchies that are deeply embedded in the history of Charleston. However, through the countemarratives presented in Idrissou Mora-Kpai's documentary America Street (2019), those power dynamics are ultimately diffused and questioned, resulting in a reevaluation of video surveillance through the lens of social justice movements, whose effects extend beyond Charleston's city borders.

T1  - You are what you read: media, identity, and community in the 2020 Belarusian uprising
AN  - 2647063930
AB  - The movement that mobilized to oppose Alyaksandr Lukashenka in August 2020 was notable for its ability to bridge divisions of social class, geography, age, and identity. Almost uniquely among post-Soviet revolutionary movements, the Belarusians who rose up were not divided from those who did not along clearly discernible socio-demographic, ethnic, linguistic, or regional lines. They were, however, separated by one very stark barrier: the one separating the country’s two distinct media systems, one controlled by the state, and one independent. Drawing on an original survey conducted in September 2020, just as the protest movement was reaching its peak, this article finds that respondents’ choice of news media was the strongest and most consistent predictor of their political opinions. Media, then, appear to have served not merely as aggregators of and conduits for social processes generated elsewhere, but as the producers of social and political force in their own right.

T1  - Is It Terrorism?: Public Perceptions, Media, and Labeling the Las Vegas Shooting
AN  - 2626052864
AB  - When a mass casualty event occurs, why do some people label it terrorism while others do not? People are more likely to consider an attack to be terrorism when the perpetrator is Muslim, yet it is unclear what other factors influence perceptions of mass violence. Using data collected from a national sample of U.S. adults shortly after the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, we examine how media consumption and social identity influence views of the attack. Media consumption and individual-level factors—Islamophobia, political ideology, and other participant demographics—influence how people view the attack and how confident people are in their assessments.

T1  - The slanted beam: A critical discourse analysis of anti-Islam and anti-Muslim discourse in China
AN  - 2619151371
AB  - Adopting the Critical Discourse Analysis perspective, this study investigates the ideology reflected by the anti-Islam and anti-Muslim discourse in China, the power dynamics revealed by such discourse and how social media discourse differs from and utilises the government discourse. Four ways to disguise the anti-Muslims, anti-Islam prejudice are investigated: appealing to patriotism to demand cultural assimilation; claiming to defend secularism; framing Islam as incompatible with mainstream culture; appealing to consumer rights to reject halal food. Non-Muslims and assimilated Muslims (especially the elites) are found to have the prerogative to dictate who belong to the ingroup, what dietary restrictions are legitimate and whom to blame when undesirable situations arise, while Muslim non-elites are at the receiving end of such dictates. This study also argues that social media discourse expresses antagonism of higher intensity than the government discourse does, and may misappropriate the official narratives to express the interlocutor’s hatred towards Muslims.

T1  - Policing in an era of sousveillance: a randomised controlled trial examining the influence of video footage on perceptions of legitimacy
AN  - 2617109840
AB  - Controversial incidents of police-citizen interactions, coupled with advancements in internet media technology has created a new dynamic of how public perceptions of the police might be influenced. This paper reports results of an experiment examining how videos of police-citizen interactions found on social media platforms might influence civilian perceptions of legitimacy and procedural justice. Using 173 randomly assigned participants and a pre/post-test design, we compare perceptual effects of positive, negative, and neutral depictions of police-citizen interactions. Results indicate all media had an effect on perceptions of legitimacy, with negative content yielding the largest effects, significantly diminishing global perceptions of legitimacy, whereas positive content significantly improved perceptions of legitimacy. Our findings suggest that while public videos of police-citizen interactions found online can contribute substantially to increasing distrust in the police, they may also demonstrate how policing agencies might use similar platforms to improve public perceptions of their legitimacy.

T1  - Trial and error: hate speech prosecution and its (unintended) effects on democratic support
AN  - 2616790576
AB  - Due to its controversial nature, hate speech prosecution of anti-immigration politicians is likely to affect citizens’ democratic support. Using a web experiment in which participants are exposed to a manipulated television news story about hate speech prosecution, we test these potential effects in the Dutch context. We demonstrate that effects on democratic support are driven by (dis)agreement with ideas expressed by the prosecuted politician in his alleged hate speech rather than by identification with his party. While a decision to not prosecute a politician does not seem to affect democratic support, a decision to prosecute a politician for hate speech decreases democratic support among citizens with anti-immigration attitudes, and increases democratic support among citizens with pro-immigration attitudes. Decisions to prosecute politicians for hate speech thus have important effects not just on supporters of the politician’s party, but also on other groups in society.

T1  - Emerging Attitudes Regarding Decriminalization: Predictors of Pro-Drug Decriminalization Attitudes in Canada
AN  - 2607248802
AB  - Canada and the United States have recently evaluated the decriminalization of drugs as multiple provinces and states put motions forward to consider drug decriminalization legislation. The influence of factors such as demographics, substance use, perceived substance use risk, and personality have not been widely studied in predicting attitudes toward drug decriminalization. A total of 504 participants were drawn from university (n = 269, 53.37%) and community samples (n = 235, 46.63%) through online social media groups and posts (i.e., Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, etc). Analyses indicated that male gender, single or non-married relationship status, living outside of Atlantic Canada, higher problematic alcohol use scores, lower Extraversion, higher Open-mindedness, and lower perceived risk of using substances emerged as significant predictors of support for drug decriminalization. These findings have important implications as public attitudes toward a substance influence drug policy.

T1  - Explaining the American crisis of policing: Media, malfeasance, and racial prejudice
AN  - 2637499058
AB  - ObjectiveTo include the factor of police malfeasance in the crisis of confidence in American police. Further, to explain the role of race, media, and contextual factors on individual perception of police performance. We argue that while the BLM movement was amplified by the deaths of Black people at the hands of police, it originates from the reality that police are continuously engaged in nefarious activities that wear down communities of color extensively.MethodsUsing the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post‐Election Survey (CMPS) and data on media reported police malfeasance in 2016 collected from the CATO institute, we explore the relationship between police malfeasance, race, and evaluations of police performance. We create two sets of logit regressions, one for all CMPS respondents and second, disaggregated by race to show the effects of media reported police malfeasance on respondent’s evaluations of police performance.ResultsIn the pooled model, we find a positive and significant correlation between poor police performance evaluations and incidences of police malfeasance. Further, substantive increases in the probability of rating police performance as poor are correlated with all respondents when disaggregated by race. We find a significant correlation among Black and White respondents, who are more likely to rate police performance as poor.ConclusionConventional narratives around the Black Lives Matter movement seem to show that deaths at the hands of local law enforcement “created” the BLM movement. We argue that the current delegitimating of police in terms of public support is related directly to police behavior themselves. Police malfeasance increases the likelihood of negative performance evaluations, thus undermining community trust in the police.

T1  - Conspiratorial thinking, selective exposure to conservative media, and response to COVID-19 in the US
AN  - 2628813551
AB  - Rationale Previous research has shown that during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic in the US, users of conservative media were more likely to accept conspiracy theories about the pandemic and less likely to accept pandemic mitigation measures such as mask-wearing and vaccination. Objective To test the hypothesis that during the first year of the pandemic, viewers who were prone to conspiratorial thinking engaged in selective exposure to conservative media which served to enhance pandemic-related conspiracy beliefs. Methods A national 3-wave longitudinal survey of 883 US respondents running from March to November 2020 assessed media-use habits, belief in COVID-related conspiracies, conspiratorial thinking, mask-wearing, intention to accept a COVID vaccine, and trust in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Growth curve models were used to analyze changes in conspiracy beliefs and associated public health outcomes. Results Users of conservative media were disproportionately likely to engage in conspiratorial thinking, to vote for President Trump, and to be ideologically conservative. They were also less likely to use mainstream news sources and displayed increasing belief in pandemic conspiracies. Increases in conspiracy beliefs were associated with reduced support for pandemic prevention. Although users of conservative media supported vaccination and trusted the CDC at the outset of the study, continued exposure to conservative media reduced support for both. Increasing use of mainstream print was associated with less endorsement of pandemic conspiracy beliefs. Viewers of mainstream television news did not exhibit change in pandemic conspiracy beliefs over time. Conclusion Conservative media in the US have attracted users prone to conspiratorial thinking and conservative political views who are also less exposed to mainstream news. The selective use of these media enhances belief in conspiracies that pose challenges to the country's ability to control a public health crisis such as the COVID pandemic.

T1  - Do I support that it's good or oppose that it's bad? The effect of support-oppose framing on attitude sharing
AN  - 2622623992
AB  - The rise of social media has led to unprecedented opportunities for individuals to share, or express, their attitudes on social and political issues. What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing-support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals' typical impression-management goals are relaxed.

T1  - Who Not What: The Logic of China's Information Control Strategy
AN  - 2618787705
AB  - In this paper, we examine how the Chinese state controls social media. While social media companies are responsible for censoring their platforms, they also selectively report certain users to the government. This article focuses on understanding the logic behind media platforms’ decisions to report users or content to the government. We find that content is less relevant than commonly thought. Information control efforts often focus on who is posting rather than on what they are posting. The state permits open discussion and debate on social media while controlling and managing influential social forces that may challenge the party-state's hegemonic position. We build on Schurmann's “ideology and organization,” emphasizing the Party's goals of embedding itself in all social structures and limiting the ability of non-Party individuals, networks or groups to carve out a separate space for leadership and social status. In the virtual public sphere, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) continues to apply these principles to co-opt, repress and limit the reach of influential non-Party “thought leaders.” We find evidence to support this logic through qualitative and quantitative analysis of leaked censorship documents from a social media company and government documents on information control.

T1  - Varieties of Populist Attitudes and Their Link to Islamophobia in Switzerland
AN  - 2617958026
AB  - The aim of this article is to show whether distinct varieties of populist attitudes emerge within a society, and how they relate to citizens’ Islamophobic attitudes. The study is based on a representative survey conducted in Switzerland in 2019. We used latent class analysis and multinomial regression analyses to identify latent subgroups, yielding five classes of populist attitudes: direct democracy devotees, individuals with populist tendencies, moderate populists, radical anti-elite populists, and radical-universal populists. Compared with the direct democracy devotees class, members of the moderate and the radical-universal populists classes are significantly more likely to hold anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant attitudes and to be politically right-wing, while radical anti-elite populists are not associated with either anti-Muslim attitudes or a right-wing ideology.

T1  - Normalizing misogyny: hate speech and verbal abuse of female politicians on Japanese Twitter
AN  - 2607088370
AB  - Social media platforms such as Twitter have gained tremendous political importance in recent years. Moreover, being considered as platforms for organizing grass root political movements or political participation in general, this positive view has given way to more critical perspectives on the negative sides of social media, such as attempts of algorithmically manipulating public opinion or the outcome of elections and racist or sexist hate speech. For the case of Japan, despite particularly xenophobic hate speech on bulletin boards such as “2channel” (ni-channeru) or Twitter has been extensively studied from various angles, misogynic forms of verbal abuse towards females on social media, female politicians in particular, have received much lesser attention in existing research. In this article we present results from an explorative analysis of instances of misogynist or sexist hate speech and abusive language against female politicians on Twitter, applying computational corpus-linguistic tools and methods, supplemented by a qualitative in-depth study of verbal abuse of four prominent female politicians, namely Renhō, Tsujimoto Kiyomi, Yamao Shiori, and Koike Yuriko, thereby fruitfully combining quantitative-statistical and qualitative-hermeneutic approaches.

T1  - Public perception of nanotechnology: A contrast between developed and developing countries
AN  - 2617692235
AB  - Nanotechnology is an emerging technology that has many proven applications and holds potential in many sectors. At the same time, the general public's lack of awareness about nanotechnology might polarize risk perception about this technology. Public discourse and upstream engagement are necessary for policymaking and responsible development of any emerging technology. While emerging countries have now joined the discussion on the public perception of emerging technologies just like the developed countries, yet there has been no review comparing the nanotechnology perception among developing and developed nations. This article presents a systematic review of factors influencing public perception and their attitude towards nanotechnology in developed and developing countries based on research papers published during 2001–2020. We have provided an in-depth comparative account of developed and developing countries in terms of factors affecting public perception of nanotechnology, namely –risk-benefit, knowledge, trust in science, religiosity, and demographics. In addition, we have also provided a contrast on how media representation of nanotechnology (newspaper coverage and social media) varies in developing countries compared to developed nations.

T1  - A review of social media-based public opinion analyses: Challenges and recommendations
AN  - 2617691754
AB  - Compared with survey polls, social media can yield a better and more comprehensive understanding of public perceptions of special topics in a more scientific manner. However, despite this advantage, there seem to be limited investigations into the challenges in social media-based public opinion analysis. This study offers an understanding of the challenges in this field and some corresponding recommendations. Through a systematic literature review, we identify 54 papers to analyze and discuss issues related to data collection, data quality, and data mining. This paper summarizes a framework for social media-based public opinion analysis as well as the commonly employed data mining methodologies. We found that collecting public opinion data from Facebook and Weibo is difficult because of their restricted application programming interface and measures against Web Crawler. How to effectively and conveniently delete invalid data and how to design data mining methods for social media data, especially for those in Chinese, are still two main challenges in social media-based public opinion analysis. We claim that using multiple data sources, optimizing keyword settings, enhancing interdisciplinary cooperation, and paying more attention to the functional role of social media can benefit the development of social media-based public opinion analysis. This study also highlights the potential risks of releasing the personal information of the public in the use of social media data in research.

T1  - The social construction of the patient-physician relationship in the clinical encounter: Media frames on shared decision making in Germany
AN  - 2617215033
AB  - The literature on healthcare management has noted that shared decision-making (SDM) - a practice of organizing joint decisions between healthcare professionals and patients - should improve healthcare outcomes through patient engagement and autonomy, fostering patient-centeredness. While SDM projects are implemented across Europe and the US, the diffusion of the practice remains partial, and its' conceptualization scattered. Healthcare management literature explores SDM on the underlying assumption that its limited diffusion results from an information problem, implying objective criteria and rational behavior. The purpose of this research is to study the social construction of SDM within the clinical setting and the underlying rationales using the case of one of the largest healthcare markets worldwide – Germany. To capture the complexity of SDM, a frame analysis is conducted on its medial representations. News media is both influential in shaping public opinion, as well as in generating public discourse. This analysis enables one to elaborate different facets of the construct of SDM, to capture inherent patterns of facilitating and obstructing aspects and to explore consequences for the diffusion of SDM. Three facilitating and three obstructive frames on the implementation of SDM were identified. The polarities of these frames range from the questioning of one's decision-making authority to the perception of individual competence and decision-making agency. Moreover, this study reflects on how physicians' and patients' role for SDM is conceived.

T1  - The Opinion-Mobilizing Effect of Social Protest against Police Violence: Evidence from the 2020 George Floyd Protests
AN  - 2607243876
AB  - Does social protest following the police killing of unarmed Black civilians have a widespread “opinion-mobilizing” effect against the police? Or, does the racialized nature of these events polarize mass opinion based on standing racial and political orientations? To answer these questions, we use a large dataset comprised of weekly cross sections of the American public and employ a regression discontinuity in time (RDiT) approach leveraging the random timing of the police killing of George Floyd and ensuing nationwide protests. We find that the Floyd protests swiftly decreased favorability toward the police and increased perceived anti-Black discrimination among low-prejudice and politically liberal Americans. However, attitudes among high-prejudice and politically conservative Americans either remained unchanged or evinced only small and ephemeral shifts. Our evidence suggests that the Floyd protests served to further racialize and politicize attitudes within the domain of race and law enforcement in the U.S.

T1  - Orientalism in a globalised world: Said in the twenty-first century
AN  - 2604245464
AB  - From its publication in 1978, Edward Said’s magnum opus Orientalism has generated fierce and unrelenting debates regarding its epistemology and scope, and the interpretive validity of its Western cultural representations of the self and other. Since then, however, the world has become increasingly governed by different sets of assumptions, ideologies, relations of production and reproduction, and matrixes of power relations. This article considers whether orientalism has kept its hold on Western public opinion, media presentations, political elites, and sections of the scholarly community’s mode of thinking in the current neo-liberal, globalised, digitalised and securitised world. It also considers whether its mutation has shifted to engender a paradigmatic change and argues that alongside the old-style orientalism, a more sophisticated, subtle, and up-to-date perspective has appeared. Although its emphases, concerns and methodologies might represent a certain departure from old orientalist dogmas, its objective seems to remain largely intact.

T1  - Representations of disabled children and young people in Irish newspapers
AN  - 2593361413
AB  - Disabled children experience many barriers to inclusion in society. Such barriers include public attitudes, knowledge, and perceptions towards disability. There is a specific gap in the literature examining the representation of disabled children in mass media, especially within an Irish context. Previous research primarily focuses on representations of disabled adults. Eighty-nine Irish broadsheet newspaper articles from a 12-month period were analysed using qualitative content analysis and critical discourse analysis. Although disabled children featured within the discourse, the child’s voice was predominantly absent. Reports regarding the lived experience predominantly came from the third person, providing a non-authentic voice of disability in childhood. Articles highlighted some of the challenges faced by children e.g. difficulty in accessing educational placement. Opportunities for disabled children to share their experiences using their preferred communication means offer valuable insights into their lives. Media professionals should be supported in facilitating children to have their voice heard.Points of interestTwo methods were used to examine how disabled children were represented in three Irish newspapers and what types of words were used to represent themAlthough disabled children are featured within Irish newspaper articles, parents and people who work with disabled children tended to speak on their behalfSometimes disabled children were labelled using impairment first terminologyIrish newspapers highlight some of the challenges faced by disabled children e.g. accessing appropriate schools and social outletsHealthcare professionals have a role in advocating for and supporting disabled children to actively participate and have their voices and stories heard in the mediaHealthcare professionals have a role in educating media professionals to support communication with disabled children so as to deliver a first-person account of living with a disability

T1  - Xenophobia in the Time of a Pandemic: Social Media Use, Stereotypes, and Prejudice against Immigrants during the COVID-19 Crisis
AN  - 2631532354
AB  - This study examines the relationship between social media use, disease risk perception, social and political trust, and out-group stereotyping and prejudice during a social upheaval. Analyses of primary data collected during the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore found that disease risk perception is positively related to stereotyping and prejudice against Chinese immigrants. Individuals who used social media for news were more likely to stereotype and express prejudice. However, those who engaged in frequent heterogenous discussions, and had more extensive social networks, were less likely to stereotype and express prejudice. Higher social and political trust was also associated with lower stereotyping and prejudice. Finally, moderation effects of network characteristics on the relationship between risk perception, social trust, and prejudice were observed.

T1  - Mind The Gap! The Role of Political Identity and Attitudes in the Emergence of Belief Gaps
AN  - 2631532080
AB  - To more fully understand the belief gap hypothesis, this study examines the effect of political identity, education, and partisan media consumption on the formation of attitudes and false beliefs. Using a two-wave, nationally representative online survey of the U.S., we assess people’s attitudes and beliefs toward climate change, on the one hand, and Syrian refugees, on the other. Building on previous studies, we demonstrate that the effect of one’s political identity on attitudes and false beliefs is contingent upon education, which appears to widen the belief gap in consort with political identity.

T1  - The dark side of the farce: racism in early cinema, 1894–1915
AN  - 2567817159
AB  - In its title sequences, the Keystone Comedy Studio referred to its films as a “farce comedy.” Farces are supposed to evoke laughter. Yet, from the very first images projected, dark racist images were prevalent and these representations contain violent imagery directed toward African American men, women and children. These images represent a time capsule of what I call the dark side of the farce. Because of the popularity and prevalence of certain types of films, it is conceivable that these films reflect consumer tastes unique to the time period in which they were produced. And while books, newspapers and periodicals are valuable resources for reconstructing past opinions, these sources may only have reached a limited audience. On the other hand, at its inception the motion picture was viewed by a diverse audience that included immigrants, the working poor, women and children. Hence, while films are not in any sense commensurate with polling, they are one tool that helps us to understand how people at the turn of the twentieth century perceived issues of race. Millions of Americans attended the movies daily. What they saw were the kinds of movies that were produced and these productions provide one valuable insight regarding public attitudes toward race. In this article, I examine films made between 1894 and 1915 as a reflection of the public attitudes of the time. I focus on comedy films because this was the only genre that existed literally from the projection of the first motion pictures to the middle of the twentieth-century’s second decade. I end the analysis with 1915 because after that year feature films became more dominant in theaters, while virtually all of the films discussed in this article are short subjects, ranging from 30 seconds to approximately 15 minutes.

T1  - Are Non-U.S. Citizens Color-Blind? The Racialization of Violent Crimes
AN  - 2562783433
AB  - The present study aims to investigate whether U.S. citizenship status influences the racialization of offenders engaged in homicide, sexual violence, and terrorism. The role of social media exposure and interracial contact are explored as additional proximal factors that may explain racialization across citizenship status. The cross-sectional online survey consisted of 729 participants enrolled at a culturally diverse northeastern university. Results suggest that non-U.S. citizens have a more color-blind perspective and are less likely to racialize crime when associating a particular race/ethnicity with violent crimes. Surprisingly, social media exposure and interracial contact were not significant contributors to racialization. Suggestions for future research and policy implications are discussed.

T1  - Hearts and Hahas of the Public: Exploring How Protest Frames and Sentiment Influence Emotional Emoji Engagement with Facebook News Posts
AN  - 2599270860
AB  - The protest paradigm, which describes the unequitable reciprocity of the media-social movement relationship, creates a double-bind for social movements. Mainstream news media in the United States emphasize emotion, drama, and irrationality while excluding the grievances, agendas, and substance behind a protest, contributing to negative narratives that can hinder public support for a movement. This analysis of Facebook news posts of protests by mainstream U.S. news organizations contributes to our understanding of how social media’s engagement affordances work in cohort with journalists’ use of emotional appeals to legitimize some protests and delegitimize others. Results show posts encourage the mobilization of some protests more than others, and media frames and emotional linguistic devices might contribute to a spectrum of delegitimizing framing effects. Legitimizing features significantly decrease emotional reactions from audiences, leading to more neutral but potentially less engaging audience reception and response. Findings advance our understanding protest paradigm framing outcomes.

T1  - Public attitudes toward pandemic triage: Evidence from conjoint survey experiments in Switzerland
AN  - 2586552129
AB  - The question of how to implement medical triages has become highly salient during the COVID-19 pandemic and continues to be actively discussed. It is important to know how members of the general public think about this issue. For one, knowledge about the public's standpoint can help resolve important questions where ethical considerations are by themselves not sufficient, for instance whether the patient's age should matter. It can also help identify if more communication with the public about medical ethics is needed. We study how members of the Swiss public would allocate intensive medical care among COVID-19 patients using data from two original conjoint survey experiments conducted in Switzerland in the context of the first and second pandemic waves in 2020 (N = 1457 & N = 1450). We find that our participants would not base triage decisions on the patient's age. However, they do give much importance to the patient's behavior prior and during illness, discriminate against non-nationals, and assign only a relatively small and inconsistent role to medical considerations. Our findings suggest that there is a need for more communication with the public about the ethics of medical triage.

T1  - Digital media and identity construction: Exploring the discourse of Pakistani vloggers
AN  - 2582710809
AB  - Negative framing of the image of Muslims, especially after 9/11, has caused numerous Muslim communities to become apprehensive about the way their identity is presented in the mass media. One such community being affected by negative representations based on Islamophobia and other gender‐related stereotypes is Pakistan. As a result, these misunderstandings are being addressed through the construction of alternative and contrasting online identities by Pakistani vloggers through digital media. This paper excavates the diversified constructions of vloggers’ online identities using two theoretical approaches to explaining identity construction: micro‐hegemonies and the investment model. Nineteen Pakistani vloggers were purposively selected for the study, who were observed over a period of two years using online observations, interviews, and email conversations, adopting a digital ethnographic approach. The investigation found that the vloggers choose to portray their religious practices, Pakistani identity, and local culture and norms while simultaneously utilizing Western norms to indicate their modernity. Moreover, they regularly emphasize that they are normal, regular human beings. Hence, the paper contributes to understanding how Pakistanis present a complex, hybrid identity which counters the dominant narratives in the media.

T1  - #AbolishNCR: A Qualitative Analysis of Social Media Narratives around the Insanity Defense
AN  - 2573206839
AB  - This article presents an analysis of social media posts by laypersons regarding a finding of Not Criminally Responsible on Account of Mental Disorder (NCRMD) for Matthew de Grood after a high-profile trial in 2016 in Canada. From trial to verdict, a total of 4,991 tweets relating to the case were harvested from Twitter. Qualitative content analysis of 365 tweets by laypersons revealed three themes – largely equating the insanity defense to a legal loophole: (1) The case exemplified a misappropriation of the legal defense (e.g., due to privilege, due to the seriousness of the offence); (2) The perception existed that the NCRMD defence is a miscarriage of justice; (3) Many comments reflected a search for answers and justice. These embodied the ABCs of NCRMD: advocating, blaming, and clarifying. A need for public education about the forensic psychiatric system is evident; misconceptions about the insanity defence appeared pervasive. Further research could focus on the efficacy of knowledge translation over new media channels, such as Twitter.Alternate abstract:
Cet article présente une analyse de billets publiés sur les médias sociaux par des non-spécialistes au sujet de la déclaration de non-responsabilité criminelle pour cause de troubles mentaux (NRCTM) de Matthew de Grood après un procèstrès médiatisé en 2016, au Canada. Du procès au verdict, un total de 4991 gazouillis portant sur le dossier a été recueilli sur Twitter. Une analyse qualitative de contenu de 365 gazouillis écrits par des non-spécialistes a dévoilé trois thèmes – lesquels mettent au même niveau la défense fondée sur les troubles mentaux et un vide juridique : (1) La cause était un exemple de l’abus de la défense légale (p. ex. à cause de privilèges, à cause du caractère sérieux du crime) ; (2) Une perception que la défense NRCTM était un déni de justice ; (3) De nombreux commentaires démontraient une quête de réponses et de justice : Les fondements de la NRCTM : plaider, accuser et clarifier. Le besoin d’un enseignement public au sujet du système de psychiatrie légale est évident ; des idées fausses au sujet de la défense fondée sur les troubles mentauxsemblaient répandues. Plus de recherche pourrait mettre l’accent sur l’efficacité du transfert des connaissances sur les nouveaux canaux médiatiques, comme Twitter.

T1  - Who should apologise: Expressing criticism of public figures on Chinese social media in times of COVID-19
AN  - 2570319466
AB  - Previous studies on public opinion expression in communication, political science and discourse analysis are restricted to a censorship-/counter-censorship frame and focus their analysis on events with political agendas. This study explores netizens’ discursive practice by focusing the analysis on netizens’ language use in context per se, rather than from a censorship/counter-censorship viewpoint. It adopts a discursive pragmatic approach to examine a ‘mundane’ trending topic regarding a dispute between two public figures rather than ‘major’ events with acute social and political agendas. This study present evidence that Weibo users criticise public figures through indirect discursive strategies, including parody of name, constructed dialogues and rhetorical questions. It also highlights two prominent sentiments in Weibo public spheres during the COVID-19 pandemic – cyber nationalism and binary opposition between China and the rest of the world. The online backlash against Fang demonstrates how easily netizens can change their views towards a certain event.

T1  - Constructing the refugee: Comparison between newspaper coverage of the Syrian refugee crisis in Canada and the UK
AN  - 2554577941
AB  - The media play a key role in informing public opinion during refugee crises. Representations of refugees in the media shape public understanding of what a ‘refugee’ is and policy decisions over who to include or to exclude. Although extensive literature has examined representations of refugees in news media, few systematic comparative investigations look at discourses across types of immigration countries. In this article, the author compares news coverage of the Syrian refugee crisis in Canada and the UK, to consider how media discourse is affected by a nation’s historical relationship with and current policies of immigration. The author follows existing literature in arguing that the dominant discourses in the newspapers racialize refugees through a ‘victim–pariah’ couplet, and further argues that this shared model of racialized representation serves the particular nation-building projects and asylum regimes in the two countries. In addition, a comparison between coverage in newspapers that represent divergent political orientations shows that news stories that attempt to ‘give voice’ to refugees are more prevalent in the more left-leaning newspapers in both countries. Nonetheless, these attempts to ‘re-humanize’ refugees do not invalidate the Orientalist image of refugees as passive victims without agency and history.

T1  - Effects of digital use on trust in political institutions among ethnic minority and hegemonic group – A case study
AN  - 2575534529
AB  - The current study was based on data from a nationwide Annual Social Survey to investigate the correlation between types of Internet usage (seeking information, e-government use, e-mail, social media and peer-to-peer Internet telephony) and trust in political institutions in Israel's Jewish majority and Arab minority. Trust in government, parliament, and political parties was found to be significantly higher among Jews than Arabs. Our findings show that first level digital divide reflected in Internet use vs non-use does not correlate with political trust. Among Internet users we found different patterns of association between digital uses and trust in political institutions, which may presumably be explained by different group status. E-government use and social media use were positively correlated with political trust only among Jews. Seeking information and e-mail use were negatively associated with trust in political institutions only among Arabs. Peer-to-peer Internet telephony was negatively correlated with trust in government among both groups. Our important finding is that in spite of the processes of digitization, the effects of digital use on political trust are still relatively marginal. In both groups, the primary predictor of political trust is attitudes toward the functioning of different public institutions.

T1  - Media Portrayals of Immigration and Refugees in Hard and Fake News and Their Impact on Consumer Attitudes
AN  - 2560493324
AB  - This study examined the effect of media portrayals of immigrants and refugees on participants’ attitudes using an experimental design. Participants included 196 male and female college students who were primed with either negative or positive media portrayals of immigrants and refugees from either hard or fake news sources, or no media portrayals. Participants then answered questions regarding immigrants, immigration policy, and Islamophobia. We hypothesized that there would be differences in participants attitudes based on experimental condition and that information presented from fake news would have a stronger effect on consumers than information presented via hard news. Factors related to participant susceptibility to media portrayals were also examined and included participant race, biological sex, social class, and political and religious affiliation. Significant differences were found based on experimental condition for viewing immigration as an economic, cultural diversity, and humanitarian benefit, as well as cognitive Islamophobia. As predicted, the effect of media portrayals, whether positive or negative, in video clips had a stronger effect on participants if the video clips originated from a fake news source. Additionally, biological sex, race, social class, and political affiliation were found to relate to participant susceptibility to media portrayals from both hard and fake news sources.

T1  - Decentralizing electoral campaigns? New-old parties, grassroots and digital activism
AN  - 2553408293
AB  - Recent studies suggest that new parties display new patterns of digital mobilization. We shed light on this debate: do new party supporters engage in online political activities to a greater extent during electoral campaigns? Do they share political images or quotes on social media, participate in political forums, or exchange political messages with their friends more often than supporters of traditional parties? No. Drawing on a post-electoral survey dataset in Spain, we find that offline extra-institutional political activities are key predictors of the level of online political engagement. Even in the context of a polarized electoral campaign and the emergence of new electoral forces such as Podemos, extra-institutional political participation drives digital activism to the detriment of institutional variables, such as turnout or partisan preferences. Thus, all parties depend on extra-institutional activists to boost their online campaigns. Since grassroots activists increasingly influence the communicative strategy of all political parties, we interpret this process within a long-term digital-based post-material transformation of the political culture, with major implications for partisan organization, mobilization, and polarization in many democracies. We contend that the overrepresentation of grassroots activists in producing and disseminating political content in social media may have favored an increase of the visibility and public support of political outsiders in several countries.

T1  - ‘Role model’ or ‘facilitator’? Exploring male teachers’ and male trainees’ perceptions of the term ‘role model’ in England
AN  - 2551431221
AB  - The call for more males to work with children in their formative years remains prevalent in education discourse across the globe. Assertions that these men will positively address boys’ poor behaviour and underachievement, as well as serving as father figures and role models for boys, continue to fuel international policy making and shape media reporting and public opinion. This paper interrogates findings from original research which set out to explore the perceptions of white male primary school educators in England (both teaching and training) in relation to the term ‘role model’. The results, drawn from a rigorous analysis of in-depth focus group interviews, highlight intriguing similarities and differences in professional thinking and suggest the need for a re-imaging of the term. The research has large-scale implications in terms of suggesting important revisions to ‘more-men’ policy making, for work-based professional training and development, and in informing societal discourse.

T1  - Representation of Intimate Partner Violence Against Women in Swedish News Media: A Discourse Analysis
AN  - 2545944965
AB  - Despite being rated as some of the world’s most gender equal countries, Sweden and neighboring Nordic nations show high rates of intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW). As the news media contribute to the shaping of public attitudes, this article pursues a two-step discourse analysis of how IPVAW was represented in seven Swedish newspapers during 2018. Although an individualistic discourse on IPVAW was found to be most prevalent, articles where perpetrators were presented as non-Swedish more frequently contained a structural framing of IPVAW. This confirms previously noted tendencies toward individualization and othering of IPVAW in Sweden.

T1  - Learning about Politics from Mass Media and Social Media: Moderating Roles of Press Freedom and Public Service Broadcasting in 11 Countries
AN  - 2572567850
AB  - To examine whether mass media and social media relate to political knowledge, the study draws upon an original survey of adults from 11 countries, the 2014 CESifo DICE Report on public service broadcasting, and the 2015 Press Freedom Index by Freedom House. Findings reveal that news use via television, newspapers, online news sites, and social media is positively associated with political knowledge. Furthermore, press freedom and strong public broadcasting strengthen the association between news use (via both mass and social media) and political knowledge. The findings suggest that the media system plays a crucial role in creating a political learning environment even in this social media age.

T1  - Do I support that it's good or oppose that it's bad? The effect of support-oppose framing on attitude sharing
AN  - 2570235420
AB  - The rise of social media has led to unprecedented opportunities for individuals to share, or express, their attitudes on social and political issues. What factors affect whether individuals choose to share? This research identifies a novel determinant of attitude sharing-support-oppose framing, defined as whether individuals think of their own attitude in terms of what they support or what they oppose. Support-oppose framing is distinct from attitude valence, as the same attitude can be framed in terms of support (e.g., I support that this policy is bad) or opposition (e.g., I oppose that this policy is good). Seven experiments, two correlational studies, and one field study provide evidence for a support-oppose framing effect, whereby individuals are more likely to share attitudes framed in terms of positions they support rather than positions they oppose. This effect occurs via two pathways. In the first, support-framed attitudes are viewed as more value expressive, which facilitates greater attitude sharing. In the second, support-framed attitudes are believed to promote more positive impressions, which also leads to greater sharing. This effect is attenuated when individuals' typical impression-management goals are relaxed.

T1  - Russian Strategic Communications toward Japan: A More Benign Model of Influence?
AN  - 2557065669
AB  - Russia has been accused of weaponizing information to exert influence over the political systems and publics of countries in Europe and North America. However, is Moscow engaged in comparable activities in Japan? Given Japan's status as the United States' main ally in East Asia and the history of Soviet influence operations in the country, Japan is a logic target. Yet, to date, no detailed study has been conducted into Russia's use of information tools toward Japan. To fill this gap, in this article I examine Russia's contemporary strategic communications toward Japan in five areas: public diplomacy, Japanese mainstream media, Japanese social media, Russian state media in the Japanese language, and Russia's use of Japanese agents of influence. I also assess the extent to which these activities pose a threat to Japanese security by comparing Russia's activities via both a benign and malign model of strategic communications. This also facilitates comparisons with Russia's actions in other countries. Having identified contrasts in the approach taken by Russia toward Japan and Western states, the article concludes by discussing explanations for these differences.

T1  - Public opinion on Twitter? How vote choice and arguments on Twitter comply with patterns in survey data, evidence from the 2016 Ukraine referendum in the Netherlands
AN  - 2542136940
AB  - Extensive research has been done on how social media have changed democratic society, politics, and public opinion. Social media are often regarded as a mirror of the public that, during political events, provides journalists and academics with a clear image of what position the public has on political issues and which sub-issues it uses to back it up. Yet, there is strong empirical evidence that active Twitter users differ in terms of background characteristics from the electorate, and that the most influential users possess specific traits. However, this does not necessarily mean that the opinions expressed on Twitter cannot reflect public opinion. This study aims to compare sub-issues used on Twitter to polled public opinion data in the context of the 2016 so-called Ukraine referendum’ in the Netherlands. Our main findings indicate that there is a remarkable resemblance between the two domains in terms of sub-issues used and prominence of these sub-issues. Yet, this is mostly the case when not taking duplicates or retweets into account. Overall, the Twitter debate showed to be less nuanced than the polled public opinion data, as fewer sub-issues appeared.

T1  - ‘Swamped by Muslims’ and facing an ‘African gang’ problem: racialized and religious media representations in Australia: Journal of Media & Cultural Studies
AN  - 2574124522
AB  - Despite the implementation of multicultural policies since the 1970s, anxiety over cultural and religious ‘others’ continue to challenge Australia’s diversifying national identity. Problematic media representations of racial and religious minorities persist in Australia and continue to shape public perceptions and political discourses on issues of migration and intercultural relations. This paper examines how Muslims and Africans are contemporary scapegoats of Australian anxieties. These fears continue to be present in racialized rhetoric and attacks on Chinese Australians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Applying discourse analysis on two recent case studies as illustrative examples – the 2018 Bourke Street attack and the so-called ‘African gangs’ – this paper argues that despite substantial research and critique, mainstream media continue to rely on familiar and problematic tropes for framing racial and religious minorities that dehumanize them based on essentialized characteristics of crime, violence and anti-social behaviour. These characteristics tend to be exploited for political gain, with Muslims and Africans portrayed as a disruption to social cohesion and national security. A critique of the role of media and political discourses is presented, as they remain critical instruments in the pursuit of a new ethics of openness, respect and mutual understanding, which are fundamental to living well with difference.

T1  - Racial Capitalism, Islamophobia, and Austerity
AN  - 2547613467
AB  - Explorations of Islamophobia or anti-Muslim racism predominantly focus on issues of security policy and media representations, set against the backdrop of the global “War on Terror.” This scholarship explores the racialization of Muslim populations across different global contexts, including the UK, Europe, the United States, and China. However, Islamophobia has also been articulated through concerns about the economy, jobs, public services, and national debt in times of austerity. Narratives have emerged around Muslim families in the UK receiving “excessive” welfare benefits, preferential access to social housing, and pressuring public services through “breeding.” This article offers a new way of thinking about the links between Islamophobia and austerity through an engagement with the literature on racial capitalism. The article shows how constructions of Muslim populations as the “undeserving poor” are central to the intersectional racialized and gendered disentitlements of austerity. The analysis draws on the findings from twelve interviews and a six-person focus group with Muslim subjects based in London to illustrate the political economy of austerity Islamophobia.

T1  - Relationship between Drug Overdose Mortality and Coverage of Drug-Related Issues in US Television Political Campaign Advertising in the 2012 and 2016 Election Cycles
AN  - 2539922107
AB  - Context: Understanding the role of drug-related issues in political campaign advertising can provide insight on the salience of this issue and the priorities of candidates for elected office. This study sought to quantify the share of campaign advertising mentioning drugs in the 2012 and 2016 election cycles and to estimate the association between local drug overdose mortality and drug mentions in campaign advertising across US media markets.
Methods: The analysis used descriptive and spatial statistics to examine geographic variation in campaign advertising mentions of drugs across all 210 US media markets, and it used multivariable regression to assess area-level factors associated with that variation.
Findings: The share of campaign ads mentioning drugs grew from 0.5% in the 2012 election cycle to 1.6% in the 2016 cycle. In the 2016 cycle, ads airing in media markets with overdose mortality rates in the 95th percentile were more than three times as likely to mention drugs as ads airing in areas with overdose mortality rates in the 5th percentile.
Conclusions: A small proportion of campaign advertising mentioned drug-related issues. In the 2016 cycle, the issue was more prominent in advertising in areas hardest hit by the drug overdose crisis and in advertising for local races.

T1  - Who set the narrative? Assessing the influence of Chinese global media on news coverage of COVID-19 in 30 African countries
AN  - 2539481643
AB  - The size of China’s State-owned media’s operations in Africa has grown significantly since the early 2000s. Previous research on the impact of increased Sino-African mediated engagements has been inconclusive. Some researchers hold that public opinion toward China in African nations has been improving because of the increased media presence. Others argue that the impact is rather limited, particularly when it comes to affecting how African media cover China-related stories. This article contributes to this debate by exploring the extent to which news media in 30 African countries relied on Chinese news sources to cover China and the COVID-19 outbreak during the first-half of 2020. By computationally analyzing a corpus of 500,000 written news stories, this paper shows that, compared to other major global players (e.g. Reuters, AFP), content distributed by Chinese media (e.g. Xinhua, China Daily) is much less likely to be used by African news organizations, both in English and French speaking countries. The analysis also reveals a gap in the prevailing themes in Chinese and African media’s coverage of the pandemic. The implications of these findings for the sub-field of Sino-African media relations, and the study of global news flows are discussed.

T1  - ‘Peasants are peasants’: Prejudice against displaced villagers in newly-built urban neighbourhoods in China
AN  - 2526045791
AB  - This article explores contemporary prejudice against displaced villagers in urban China, drawing on a project on urban sprawl in Yinchuan where rural villages are absorbed into the urban area. The research demonstrates that media discourses about chaiqian baofahu and suzhi that stigmatise displaced villagers are being actively reproduced in everyday life in newly built urban neighbourhoods. Urbanites’ prejudice against displaced villagers can be viewed as, on the one hand, a result of the feelings of relative deprivation from unfavourable comparisons with displaced villagers, while on the other hand, a response to maintain a positive ingroup identity – in this case, an urban and ‘civilised’ way of life. The article then examines the effectiveness of contact as a means for reducing prejudice, and reveals that intergroup contact in urban neighbourhoods does not necessarily create mutual understanding and trust. The article highlights the structural causes of prejudice and concludes by arguing for social transformation to challenge and reduce prejudice.

T1  - Exploring social media usage in improving public perception on workplace violence against healthcare workers
AN  - 2555684683
AB  - Workplace violence against healthcare workers has been a major social problem in many countries. A misunderstanding between patients and physicians is the primary cause of violence . The recent rise of social media offered a new communication channel between the government and the public. This study aims to explore and examine the use of social media to improve public perception about the medical workplace violence by considering a recently issued policy in China. We collected 12,250 posts before, during and after the implementation of the policy from Weibo, which is similar to Twitter. Sentiment classification and topic clustering methods were used to analyze the data. One-way ANOVA was applied to assess the changes of public sentiments over time. Results showed that the proportion of posts with negative sentiment statistically significantly decreased after the release of the policy, indicating the effectiveness of social media in improving public perception about the medical workplace violence, to a large extent. Topic clustering results regarding the policy showed that most people supported the policy. However, some believe that punishment measures contained in the policy need to be strengthened and that more attention should be paid to the hospitals and medical staffs, as well as how to effectively protect the interests of patients. Based on these findings, we suggested government to effectively and scientifically use social media to address medical workplace violence from the perspective of the public and further consider its causes in terms of both patients and medical staffs, and building an expert witness system seems to be helpful. Measures for guaranteeing the safety of medical staffs should be built by comprehensively evaluating the potential risk. These results can help governments increase the engagement of their citizens.

T1  - Recontextualizing Constructive Journalism in Contemporary China: A Comparative and Intercultural Perspective
AN  - 2548740392
AB  - By adopting a scholarly perspective on comparative journalism and intercultural communication, the present study delineates the conceptual common ground in terms of defining constructive journalism (CJ) and lays out the theoretical foundation for further discussion of this practical recontextualization in China’s social and cultural contexts. The indigenous tradition of “public opinion surveillance” (POS) in China is traced out in comparison with the experiment of CJ and its derivatives like public/civic journalism in Western countries. In spite of different news philosophies and media eco-systems, promoting social reform and serving the people or the public constitute the common goals for both Chinese and Western journalists and media professionals. Notably, exploring the theoretical validity and practical applications of CJ and POS would provide a feasible entry point to the cross-cultural dialogue between the East and the West about news media innovation.

T1  - (De)humanization and (dis)trust: Representations of Muslims in the UK newspapers following the 7/7 London bombings
AN  - 2547612300
AB  - Dehumanization and distrust can have devastating consequences for intergroup relations. Until now, few studies have examined the ways in which both (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful discourse are presented in popular media. Recognizing the detrimental effects of terrorism on intergroup attitudes and the power of media in influencing social and political attitudes, the present research examined the frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements in newspaper coverage of the July 7, 2005, London bombings in the aftermath and at the 10-year anniversary of the attack. Drawing from theoretical work on dehumanization, it was expected that (de)humanizing content in media coverage about a stereotyped outgroup would be linked to (dis)trust of that group, and would also be linked to political orientation of the media source. Primary analyses were conducted using an existing manual coding framework for frequency of (de)humanizing and (dis)trustful statements. Results from the coding show that dehumanizing and distrusting discourse was more frequent than humanizing and trusting discourse. Whereas dehumanization was significantly correlated with distrust only in the right-wing source, humanization was significantly correlated with trust only in the left-wing source. The findings advance theoretical understandings of (de)humanization and humanization as they manifest in media discourse following a terrorist event, and how these relate to outgroup (dis)trust.

T1  - The Will of the People? Effects of Politicians’ Subjective Claims about Public Opinion on Perceived Public Opinion and Evaluative Judgments
AN  - 2529040309
AB  - Subjective claims about what the public thinks are the most common public opinion cue in the news media and are used especially by populist politicians as a communication strategy to appeal to voters. These references are not based on polling data and may even be in contrast to them. Yet, there is little research on how effective this communication strategy actually is. In the present study, we looked at the effects of politicians’ subjective claims to public opinion on the evaluation of the politicians and on people’s perception of public opinion. In addition, we tested whether this communication strategy resonates especially well with people holding populist attitudes. In a 2 × 4 experiment, we were able to show that the use of subjective claims strongly shaped public opinion perceptions but did not necessarily improve the evaluation of the politician. The effects occurred regardless of people’s populist attitudes.

T1  - Extra! Extra! The Importance of Victim–Offender Relationship in Homicide Newsworthiness
AN  - 2516728872
AB  - Domestic violence is a widespread issue, with victims suffering emotional and physical harm and severe cases resulting in homicide. Media presentation of extreme instances of domestic homicide may affect public opinion and related public policies. This study examines the presentation of homicide in print news media in the context of victim–offender relationship (domestic vs. non-domestic) using measures of article prominence. The sample includes articles published in the Vancouver Sun over a 12-year period (2004-2015) that reported on a homicide in British Columbia, Canada, with nature of the victim–offender relationship specified (n = 3,877). Results show that domestic-related homicides are reported less prominently than are non-domestic homicides, including being shorter in length, less likely to be placed on the front page, and less likely to include an image. Results are discussed in light of media impact on public opinion and the influence on public efforts to address and prevent the consequences of domestic violence.

T1  - Racism and Xenophobia in a Pandemic: Interactions of Online and Offline Worlds
AN  - 2515779025
AB  - History suggests that disease outbreaks have often been accompanied by a rise in xenophobic or racist sentiment.1,2 Such attempts at "othering" reflect misguided efforts to assign social meaning and responsibility to disease, even though illnesses do not recognize socially constructed categories such as race.3 Although systems exist to closely monitor and report on COVID-19 infection and death rates, we currently lack the capacity to monitor racism in response to the pandemic.

T1  - Leaders or “Guides” of Public Opinion? The Media Role of Chinese Foreign Policy Experts
AN  - 2511846496
AB  - This article explores the growing role of think tank experts in Chinese media coverage on international issues and determines the degree to which voices in this spectrum diverge from each other as well as the official line espoused by China’s central media organs. It combines a large-sample sentiment analysis of commentaries published by three major institutes that have developed significant public profiles with an in-depth discussion of selected pieces written by especially prolific experts. Based on the results, I argue that Chinese expert commenters sometimes enrich media coverage and show a substantial variety in opinions among them, but prevailing political constraints, skewed incentives, and a slanted media environment keep them from realizing their full potential as public intellectuals. This limits their usefulness both for improving policy outcomes and for managing public expectations about China’s rise.

T1  - The other other. Representations and rhetorical estrangement of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian print media, 1970 – 2016
AN  - 2556882683
AB  - This is a qualitative text-analytic study of the discursive representations of anti-immigration positions in Scandinavian press 1970–2016. Our study shows how immigration critics textually are estranged and constituted as an other throughout the period. We examine how three main categories of immigration critics are estranged: extremists, populist politicians, and critical citizens. Within these categories, we find manifest estrangement through demonizing and ridiculing. We call this category of rhetorical work for conspicuous estrangement. However, we also find more subtle hints of illegitimacy or alienation in the portrayals. We call this category of rhetorical work of marginalization for inconspicuous estrangement. While other studies have argued that such forms of soft oppression may prepare the ground for forms of hard oppression and increased marginalizing, our study demonstrates that representations instead move toward legitimation, indicating a normalization of populist politics and anti-immigration attitudes in Scandinavia. Our findings thus support research arguing that a mainstreaming of the radical right has occurred.

T1  - Legislative Behavior, Mass Media, and Foreign Policy Making: The Case of Paraguay
AN  - 2549298755
AB  - Does national media news coverage afect the behavior of legislators when deciding foreign policy matters? This article aims to disentangle the relationship between the media and legislative behavior in foreign policy, using Paraguay as a case study. We analyze the level of public debate on international afairs, measured by the frequency of news in the newspaper ABC Color in the six months before the roll-call votes on the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay. The literature on Latin American studies fnds a lack of parliamentary interest in foreign afairs due to low voter attention to this subject, and therefore a low impact on reelections. We fnd the relationship between parliamentary polarization and public interest in a bill to be mediated by mass media. After estimating a Tobit model, we observe a signifcant and positive relationship between the news coverage a law receives and the degree of polarization among parliamentarians. Thus, our empirical evidence contradicts the idea that there is a lack of electoral interest in foreign policy. We confrm this fnding through qualitative data gathered from in-depth interviews.Alternate abstract:Qué impacto tiene la cobertura de noticias en los medios nacionales de comunicación sobre el comportamiento de los legisladores al tomar decisiones sobre asuntos de política exterior? Este artículo tiene como objetivo analizar la relación entre los medios de comunicación y el comportamiento legislativo en política exterior, utilizando a Paraguay como caso de estudio. Para ello, se analiza cómo el nivel de debate público sobre asuntos internacionales, medido por la frecuencia de noticias publicadas en el diario ABC Color durante un período de seis meses antes de las votaciones nominales en la Cámara de Diputados de Paraguay, afecta el grado de consenso entre los legisladores. La literatura sobre estudios latinoamericanos encuentra una falta de interés parlamentario en los asuntos internacionales debido a la poca atención de los votantes sobre este tema, teniendo entonces bajo impacto en las reelecciones. Encontramos que esta relación está mediada por los medios de comunicación. Después de estimar un modelo Tobit, observamos una relación signifcativa y positiva entre el número de noticias que recibe una ley y el grado de polarización entre los parlamentarios. Nuestra evidencia empírica contradice la idea de que hay una falta de interés electoral en la política exterior. Confrmamos este hallazgo a través de datos cualitativos recogidos mediante entrevistas en profundidad.

T1  - Islamophobia as Cultural Racism: The Case of Islamic Attire in Turkey
AN  - 2543873257
AB  - Grasping the various aspects of Islamophobia in Muslim societies requires much finer methods in order to decipher the intentions of the actors in distinctive life situations varying from the media to education. This article engages in a debate as to whether Islamophobia is a new type of racism, i.e., cultural, geographical, phenotypical, or Xeno-racism, and the relatively recent type that has emerged in neo-liberal states: anti-Muslim racism. In a Muslim-majority society, the 'culture' of members is fairly homogenous, so Islamophobia takes another cue, focusing on external markers, like the headscarf or beard. While anti-Muslim racism is sometimes exercised along more subtle lines of cultural difference in Muslim societies, it prevails through old-fashioned, phenotypical racism. The representation or rather misrepresentation of Islam and/or Muslims in the media can be understood as the prevailing source of antagonism between the secular and the traditionalist segments of Turkish society; indeed, Turkish media representation produces and reproduces a racialization of the majority, predominately by rendering Islam invisible, or by depicting Muslims in ways that denigrate their clothing, manners, style, and way of living across various mass media forms.

T1  - To Credit or to Blame? The Asymmetric Impact of Government Responsibility in Economic News
AN  - 2518670874
AB  - This article studies the asymmetric effects of credit and blame attributions in economic news on government evaluations. We rely on a dataset combining a manual content analysis of Dutch economic news (print, television, online; N = 5,630) with a three-wave panel survey (N = 3,240) that was fielded in 2015. Results show that people who are exposed to news in which the government is blamed for the economy tend to adopt this frame by assigning responsibility to the government for the economic crisis. In addition, exposure to blame attributions leads to more negative government evaluations. This effect is partly mediated through the attribution of crisis responsibility. Credit attributions in the news do not have any effect on public opinion.

Drawing from cognitive appraisal and affective intelligence theory, this study investigated the affective foundation of political opinion expression on social media (POESM) using two-wave panel data. The results indicate that enthusiasm and anger stimulated POESM but only for individuals with a minimum threshold motivation to use SM for political purposes. Among the politically motivated, anxiety increased POESM for individuals with low political knowledge but lessened POESM for ones with high political knowledge. Thus, emotional states can be powerful drivers of POESM. In contexts with low levels of POESM, emotions may stimulate online discussion as well as contribute to the further emotionalization of political debates.

T1  - The Poetry of Suheir Hammad: Transnational Interventions in the Age of Islamophobia and Digital Media
AN  - 2501512327
AB  - Given the negative and limited representations of Muslims and Palestinians, and the central role that women play in this spectrum of dominant representations, this article takes interest in the possibilities of circulating dissent and alternative portrayals through digital media. Taking interest in the poetry of Palestinian-American poet Suheir Hammad, which vibrantly emerged in the digital public sphere in the immediate aftermath of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, this analysis focuses on Hammad's digital interventions to challenge Islamophobia and other forms of discursive and material domination. Based on a textual analysis of Hammad's poetry, this article is also informed by a semi-structured interview conducted with the artist, as well as other information available in the public domain. This analysis reveals that digital media play an important role in increasing Hammad's ability to circulate her art to a wider audience. Building bridges across multiple communities and positions of marginality transnationally, Hammad's work attempts to challenge dominant Islamophobic and gendered discourses about identity. However, similarly to other "minority" artists, "talking back" (hooks 1989) to dominant discourses requires a performativity of identity, and is at the same time anchored to the motivation to unsettle essentialist understandings of identity. Through her writings and poetry performances archived online, Hammad highlights the complexity of identity and reveals both how racialization is socially constructed and the racial ambiguity of Islamophobia. While acknowledging the discursive formation of identity, Hammad's work also underscores the real, material consequences of discourses of fear and hate in order to regain some agency and symbolic power.

T1  - Introduction: Transnational Feminism in a Time of Digital Islamophobia
AN  - 2501512116
AB  - In the nearly two decades following the events of 9/11, Western mainstream media have become obsessed with Islam, often sensationalizing Muslims as inherently violent, barbaric, and as undesirable Others. In the current technological era, the number of users who have taken to digital media and social networking sites (SNS) to express their anger, hatred, and even to make death threats towards Muslims has been increasing dramatically. Since before and after taking office, Donald Trump has done much to further exacerbate and justify the flames of these hateful pursuits, exemplifying the heightened state of anti-Muslim sentiment in the current digital landscape, in North America and beyond. In this interdisciplinary special issue of Islamophobia Studies Journal, we aim to a) document and make visible in the face of "fake news" and misinformation the various instances of ongoing and virulent Islamophobia and their different transnational itineraries and impacts, but also, and perhaps even more importantly, b) to document how such instances of hate and ignorance can be combatted through various modes of resistance. Specifically, this collection gathers scholarly conversations that come together at the intersection of transnational feminisms and digital Islamophobia in order to better understand how the confluences of race, gender, and religion become transmuted through digital platforms and racist, nationalist, and other violent and lethal Islamophobic ideologies.

T1  - From Online Political Posting to <i>Mansplaining</i>: The Gender Gap and Social Media in Political Discussion
AN  - 2490494048
AB  - The gender dynamics of political discussion are important. These dynamics shape who shares their political views and how they share their views and reactions to these views. Using representative survey data from the United States and the UK, we investigate how social media platforms shape the gender dynamics of political posting. We find that on Facebook, gender does not predict political posting, whereas on Twitter, the gender gap is more pronounced. We also examine the concept of “mansplaining”—a term used to describe a patronizing form of communication directed at women by men. Firstly, we find that posting about political issues to Twitter is more likely to result in being an explainee but also being an explainer of political issues. Furthermore, posting to Twitter increases the likelihood of men reporting having been accused of mansplaining and women reporting having experienced it. In general, more than half of the women say they have experienced mansplaining, especially those who are younger, well educated, and left-leaning. We argue that the possibility of being mansplained affects who is willing to post their opinions online, and as such, caution should be exercised when using digital trace data to represent public opinion.

T1  - Media portrayals of Muslims: a comparative sentiment analysis of American newspapers, 1996–2015
AN  - 2571102579
AB  - Are Muslims portrayed more negatively than other religious groups? If so, what factors are associated with this negativity? We apply computer-assisted, lexicon-based coding to over 850,000 articles that mention Muslims, Hindus, Jews, or Catholics in 17 national and regional US newspapers over the 20-year period of 1996–2015 and compare them to a representative baseline of articles. We show that the average tone of articles about Muslims is considerably more negative than both this baseline and compared to articles about the other groups. The negative tone is most strongly associated with stories about extremism and events in foreign settings. However, even controlling for a wide range of factors does not eliminate the negativity in stories mentioning Muslims. We discuss the implications of these findings for media objectivity and for public attitudes and policy preferences with respect to Muslims and other social groups.

T1  - Of droughts and fleeting rains: Drought, agriculture and media discourse in Australia<sup>†</sup>
AN  - 2553686652
AB  - Drought is a normal part of the variable Australian climate, occurring on average every thirteen years since 1870. Changes in agricultural policy since the 1980s have attempted to shift more of the drought risk from the state to the producer. During drought, however, governments feel political pressure to support the industry financially. The iconography of rural hardship and representation of drought as crisis in media discourse are key factors in forcing government intervention and ensuring public support. We analysed the content of eighty news articles during six months of the drought which began in 2018. In line with previous research, we found that drought was represented primarily through its effects on the agricultural industry. Implicit disaster narratives persisted, but in contrast to past studies, a recognition of drought as normal was more salient than drought as exceptional. Agrarian narratives emphasising the exceptional cultural value of the agricultural industry persisted and were presented as justification for continued government support. Scientifically informed discourses, recognising the effects of climate change on future drought risk and acknowledging the role of the agricultural industry in current and historical environmental degradation, were scarce or absent.

T1  - From Suits to Royals: The politics of Meghan Markle's racial ambiguity
AN  - 2521113470
AB  - Meghan Markle's ascension into the Royal family and subsequent exit caused a media flurry at the same time as sparking conversations about race, royalty, and representation. Markle's public persona as biracial locates her at the nexus of racial and class politics. We analyze her self-definition and presentation in contrast to her reception by media outlets and the public and present the biracial identity as both transgressive and limited. We question the concepts of race and royalty as fixed categories and explore how biracial identity offers a possibility for an ambiguous middleground. In this article, we consider how Markle's biraciality is contextualized within contemporary portrayals of black and multiracial individuals in the media. We analyze popular media representations of Markle to reveal the significance of the discursive debate over her public identity. We argue that Markle's biraciality is a demonstration of her agency in shaping the public perception of her racial identity that challenges biological constructions of race. At the same time, her inability to transcend racial classification reveals the limitations of an individual's ability to control and define their public persona.

T1  - Cross-border reproductive care: Opinions and attitudes of society towards surrogate pregnancy
AN  - 2494827275
AB  - Surrogate pregnancy (SP) has acquired a prominent public profile through the bioethical, legal and media debates this cross-border reproductive practice has raised worldwide. The different social agents involved in the phenomenon frequently appeal to public opinion looking for legitimation and endorsement of their ethical and political positions on the matter. However, opinion polls occupy a marginal place in research about SP. The article presents the findings of the scoping review of 31 scientific articles (1985–2017) analysing public opinion regarding SP in 13 countries. The aim is to single out the main subtopics covered by the studies in order to identify research gaps as well as describe and analyse SP as a socio-cultural construct and ‘social problem’ which is currently situated in a complex multidimensional arena made of conflicting narratives and attitudes that divide international public opinion along each one of the identified subtopics. Additionally, the article presents the results of the survey Opinion and Attitudes of the Spanish Population towards Adoption, Fostering and Gestational Surrogacy (2018), the first conducted in Spain with a representative national sample.

T1  - Media use, fear of terrorism, and attitudes towards immigrants and refugees: Young people and adults compared: International Journal for Mass Communication studies
AN  - 2491565892
AB  - In Flanders, citizens hold rather negative attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. This could be due to the news media, which depict newcomers in a rather negative way. The purpose of this study is to analyze whether there are separate media worlds at work in Flemish young people and adults and whether this results in different attitudes towards immigrants and refugees. To do so, we questioned 1,759 people aged 13 to 65 by means of an online questionnaire. Results indicate that overall news consumption increases with age, and that young people mainly use social media for their news consumption while adults still rely on traditional media. Interestingly, young adults are the most welcoming group towards immigrants and refugees. Although news media consumption seems to be related to fear of terrorism and attitudes towards newcomers to some extent, socio-demographic factors play an important role in the development of fear and negative attitudes towards newcomers.

T1  - Reactions by émigré Polish leaders and intellectuals in the United States to the television series <i>Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss</i> (1978)
AN  - 2568242196
AB  - Matyjaszek’s article discusses a set of reactions by Polish émigré cultural and political activists in the United States to the screening of the NBC television series Holocaust: The Story of the Family Weiss on 16–19 April 1978. It offers an analysis of the emergence of Holocaust history as a source of collective identity and memory in western societies, and as a part of popular culture. The end of the 1970s witnessed a series of cultural and political events as well as the publication of scholarly texts that put images of the mass murder of the European Jews at the centre of North American and global debates on identity and history as well as their political uses. In his analysis of reactions by Polish intellectuals and community leaders, Matyjaszek examines the cultural position of members of the post-war Central-Eastern European intelligentsia in the United States, both in relation to their own reference group’s painful and violent history, and to their position within the North American society of the time. In a critical evaluation of contemporary uses of the concepts of ‘bystander’ and ‘survivor’ with regard to the Holocaust, he focuses on a set of documents stored in the private archive of Jan Nowak-Jeziorański (Ossoliński Institute, Wrocław, Poland), as well as on published documents and correspondence.

T1  - Battles and breakthroughs: representations of dementia in the British press
AN  - 2481473608
AB  - Media coverage of dementia can influence public and professional attitudes towards the syndrome, shaping societal knowledge of dementia and impacting how people with dementia are cared for. This paper reports on a study of news articles about dementia published in the British press in the years 2012–2017. The analysis combines the tools of corpus linguistics, a methodology for quantitatively surveying a vast amount of electronic linguistic data, with the qualitative perspectives of Critical Discourse Analysis, which seeks to uncover dominant discourses and ideologies. The most salient discourse that emerged from this analysis was the portrayal of dementia in biomedical terms, with a particular focus on the pathological processes of dementia, and pharmaceutical treatments and research. Keywords relating to this discourse are interrogated in detail, illuminating the linguistic strategies through which the pathology of dementia and people with dementia are depicted. This study highlights the challenges that this type of reporting presents to people living with dementia and their families, and points to the relevance of a discursive approach to understanding societal perceptions of dementia.

T1  - PHENOMENOLOGY OF COMMUNICATIONS: TOWARD A CULTURE OF GRACE
AN  - 2599127751
AB  - This essay explores the intersection of communication and culture. It proposes that a new interdisciplinary field of inquiry-a phenomenology of communications-implicates culture in that all communication helps shape and reflects a society's cultural assumptions and aspirations. In an era of social media and electronic communication, the impact on culture has accelerated. Both positive and negative aspects of social media reverberate in American popular culture that Christopher Lasch described as a culture of narcissism and David Brooks calls a culture of the "Big Me." The essay revisits a documentary about Mike Tyson's life and career that exemplifies what it means to be an American, renewing a culture that aspires to redeem the American dream of a more perfect union beyond preference and prejudice. It shows also why American culture needs to be transformed from a narcissistic, self-referential, tribal perspective of identity politics and false tolerance toward a culture that respects individual autonomy and privacy, reconnects rights and responsibilities, and encourages true diversity, inspired by transcendent norms and ideals worthy of a creature created in the image and likeness of God.

T1  - MEDIA FRAMING ON MUSLIMS AND ISLAM IN CHRISTCHURCH MOSQUE ATTACK: A CONTENT ANALYSIS OF THE PRESS AND NEW YORK TIMES ONLINE NEWS
AN  - 2563492558
AB  - For decades, and particularly since September 11 attacks, media framing of Muslims as terrorists was persistent. Considerable studies showed that Western media framed Islam and Muslims as the major terrorism posing threat to Western society. Islam is depicted as a monolithic and homogenized religion whereas Muslims are uncivilized and inhuman religious maniacs. News coverage on terrorism, which involved Muslims as the perpetrator, heightened the fear culture for Muslims and Islam, eventuate the rise of "Islamophobia". The media portrayed perpetrators of Muslims as terrorists who clashed the Western civilization and threatened public security as a whole. However, the recent Christchurch mosque attack that happened on 15 March 2019 in New Zealand, killed more than 50 Muslims by a local extremist, turned Muslims into terrorism victims. Despite abundant studies criticising Islamophobic representations of Muslims in Western media, there is scant literature examining the coverage of terrorism act where perpetrators are non- Muslims and victims are Muslims. Therefore, it is interesting to scrutinize how Islam and Muslims were framed in two influential online news sites, The Press and New York Times, where Muslims appeared to be the victims of the attack. By using framing analysis as the theoretical framework, this study examined the news themes covered in portraying Muslim victims and Islam for the incident. The finding determined how media framing of Muslim victims and Islam in the Christchurch mosque attack transformed the media event into international mourning in a climate of counter-Islamophobia.

T1  - Portrayal of Immigrants in Danish Media—A Qualitative Content Analysis
AN  - 2544532760
AB  - Media coverage can affect audiences’ perceptions of immigrants, and can play a role in determining the content of public policy agendas, the formation of prejudices, and the prevalence of negative stereotyping. This study investigated the way in which immigrants are represented in the Danish media, which terms are used, what issues related to immigrants and immigration are discussed and how they are described, and whose voices are heard. The data consisted of media articles published in the two most widely read Danish newspapers in 2019. Inductive qualitative content analysis was conducted. The portrayal of immigrants was generally negative. Overall, immigrants were portrayed as economic, cultural and security threats to the country. The most salient immigrant groups mentioned in the media were non-Westerners, Muslims, and people ‘on tolerated stay’. Integration, xenophobia and racial discrimination were the three immigrant-related issues most frequently presented by the media. The media gave voice mainly to politicians and immigrant women. The material showed that Danes have a strong affinity for ‘Danishness’, which the papers explained as a major barrier to the integration and acceptance of immigrants in Denmark.

T1  - THE CONSTRUCTION, DECONSTRUCTION, AND RECONSTRUCTION OF CRIME NEWS: A CASE STUDY OF MALAYSIAN NEWSPAPERS
AN  - 2519891625
AB  - Mass media has become an important agent of socialization by reproducing dominant and other social norms, beliefs, discourses, ideologies, and values. Although the media can be considered as an educator, most of the transmission of norms, beliefs, ideologies, discourses, and values occur in an unconscious manner. In essence, the media will select and process facts for the public. Because they do this so systematically, they can affect the way their audience is influenced by the delivered information. Thus, the portrayal of crime in the news media has played a crucial role in creating public awareness and planting seeds of concern regarding crimes in Malaysia. How crime is presented in the media and how the media capitalizes on crime news can affect how society perceives crime. The presentation of crime news in the media is the result of a complex process of news gathering and news production. Hence, it is crucial to understand how crime news is produced and presented, and the impact this type of news has on society. It will in turn help to shape public opinion and public policy, which could consequently become a national concern. This paper presents an analysis of the hidden messages that the media is forwarding to society and the priorities given in constructing crime news in the local media. This study has analyzed news texts to understand how different types of crimes are covered and reported. An analysis of news narratives is also presented to understand how crimes are constructed and portrayed by the Malaysian media.

T1  - News repertoires and information behavior in Austria—What is the role of social inequality?
AN  - 2486862603
AB  - The changes in the global mediascape have had a tremendous impact on societal news flows. Using data from the Social Survey Austria 2018 and a quantitative application of the media repertoire approach, the article illustrates how information behavior and news seeking relate to social status, political orientation and sociodemographics. The results confirm that the developments in Austria—often referred to as a representative of a traditional media landscape—are mostly in line with international trends, as new media have been added to the media repertoires of approximately two-thirds of the sample. Effects tied to social inequality generally match previous assumptions: Higher educational achievements and income lead to more diversified news repertoires. Additionally, the overall structure of the data indicates that the online-only users are still a small minority, consisting of younger individuals who are less likely to work and more likely to vote for left-wing parties.

T1  - Social media and moral panics: Assessing the effects of technological change on societal reaction
AN  - 2457917598
AB  - Answering calls for deeper consideration of the relationship between moral panics and emergent media systems, this exploratory article assesses the effects of social media – web-based venues that enable and encourage the production and exchange of user-generated content. Contra claims of their empowering and deflationary consequences, it finds that, on balance, recent technological transformations unleash and intensify collective alarm. Whether generating fear about social change, sharpening social distance, or offering new opportunities for vilifying outsiders, distorting communications, manipulating public opinion, and mobilizing embittered individuals, digital platforms and communications constitute significant targets, facilitators, and instruments of panic production. The conceptual implications of these findings are considered.

T1  - Which Identity Frames Boost Support for and Mobilization in the #BlackLivesMatter Movement? An Experimental Test
AN  - 2448363281
AB  - The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement has organized hundreds of disruptive protests in American cities since 2013 (Garza 2014; Harris 2015; Taylor 2016). The movement has garnered considerable attention from the U.S. media and is well recognized by the U.S. public (Horowitz and Livingston 2016; Neal 2017). Social movement scholars suggest that such robust mobilizations are typically predicated on clear social movement frames (Benford and Snow 2000; Snow et al. 1986). Tillery (2019b) has identified several distinct message frames within the social media communications of BLM activists. In this paper, we use a survey experiment to test the effect of three of these frames—Black Nationalist, Feminist, and LGBTQ+ Rights—on the mobilization of African Americans. We find that exposure to these frames generates differential effects on respondents’ willingness to support, trust, canvass, and write representatives about the Black Lives Matter movement. These findings raise new questions about the deployment of intersectional messaging strategies within movements for racial justice.

T1  - How Are Young Russians Different from the Older Generations? Results of Sociological Monitoring
AN  - 2489308388
AB  - This article focuses on the more notable differences between the attitudes of young Russians and representatives of older generations in such areas as digitalization, television viewing, attitudes toward the West, tolerance of LGBT people, attitudes toward independence and willingness to do business, involvement in civic and protest activities. On closer examination, not all differences between young people and representatives of older age groups are unconditional and irreversible-many of them will most likely change as today's young people grow up, as well as under the pressure of the economic and political situation in the country. The article draws on the materials of regular public opinion polls by the Levada Center, as well as three dozen focus groups that the author and his colleagues conducted in 2018-2019 in Moscow and several other Russian cities.

T1  - The Political Economy of Hate Industry: Islamophobia in the Western Public Sphere
AN  - 2477274045
AB  - Minority communities across the globe are increasingly being targeted for vilification and demonization which consequently result in their marginalization and persecution, among other forms of physical, psychological, structural and cultural violence. These may be on account of race, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disabilities or other demographic indicators-a phenomenon which summatively came to be known as hate speech/ crime. When such violence ballooned beyond bearable level against the black community in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, it triggered counteroffensive under the veneer of "white devil," insighting the production of "How Hate Begets Hate" and Bigger Thomases of that world. In recent times, nowhere is such hate more pronounced than the one directed at the Muslim communities living in various countries of the West. Their framing as irrational, incompatible and security threat to the West has resulted in a number of stringent legislation/ policies targeting them, beside organized violence by individuals and a propaganda industry feeding on this. This rising Islamophobia, as the study found, is a byproduct of historical experiences, fuelled contemporarily by the economic and political interests of individuals and organizations. Using qualitative content analysis and political economy as methodological and theoretical frameworks respectively, this study identifies the key players in heightening antiMuslim sentiment in the West, as well as their motivations and strategy of public deception. It also explores the phases and causes of tension in West-Muslim relations, the role of media and the solution to this, among other things.

T1  - Portrayals of Jihad: A Cause of Islamophobia
AN  - 2477273984
AB  - When the first Muslims arrived in America in the 16th century, Americans were faced with something that was unknown to them: Islam. At the time, many Americans were afraid that Islam would impose its own values and ideals, thereby threatening their Protestant Christian tradition. For this reason, Islamophobia has been in America as long as Islam has been in America; it is not a new phenomenon. This fear of Islam penetrating a nation built on Protestant Christian values is still present today, but why? There are many causes of Islamophobia, but a popular explanation that every American who watches the news probably knows is jihad. Jihad has come to be perceived as "holy war" in American media and by many Americans. It sounds like a petrifying notion, but it does not carry the definitions and implications that many Americans, especially Islamophobes, claim it does. Jihad is highly misrepresented in America, thereby distorting Americans' understanding of Islam as a religion. Furthermore, the misrepresentation of jihad in American media and by Islamophobes as well as cherry-picked verses in the Qur'an and ahādīth (sayings and actions of Muhammad-the founder of Islam) contribute greatly to the construction of Islamophobia. Furthermore, these misrepresentations of jihad are used to define Islam as a whole and spread Islamophobia.

T1  - IMPACT OF SOCIAL FACTORS ON FORMATION OF BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT FOR SMES
AN  - 2476175186
AB  - The objective of this article was to identify the important social factors influencing the quality of business environment for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), to quantify their intensity, and compare the differences between Czech Republic (CR) and Slovak Republic (SR). In this context, empirical research was conducted on SMEs in Czech Republic and Slovakia. Within this research, data from 312 SMEs in CR and 329 SMEs in Slovakia were obtained. For data processing, chi-squared test and Z-score were used. The research results brought interesting findings. Entrepreneurs in both countries have negatively assessed the attitude of politicians, public opinion, and media to their business activities. They see the positive impact of family environment on business activities. They particularly appreciate the support and help they get from the family. It follows that family environment is motivating but not with the expected intensity. A surprising fact is that entrepreneurs do not agree than in general, entrepreneurs possess more money and better social status. Entrepreneurship is associated with better professional growth, interesting work opportunities, and full use of own skills. The research has confirmed the existence of significant differences in evaluating the defined factors in both countries.

T1  - Bottom-up nationalism and discrimination on social media: An analysis of the citizenship debate about refugees in Turkey
AN  - 2450151652
AB  - This study analyzes social media representations of refugees in Turkey and discusses their role in shaping public opinion. The influx of millions of Syrian refugees in Turkey has created heated debates about their presence and future in the country. One of these debates was triggered by President Erdoğan’s statement that Turkey would issue citizenship rights to Syrians in July 2016. Due to a lack of critical voices about refugee issues in Turkey’s mass media sphere, social media has become a key platform for citizens to voice their opinions. Through a discourse analysis of tweets about the issue of refugees’ citizenship, I will map different perceptions of refugees in Turkey. I argue that despite contesting discourses about Syrians, the debate on social media reinforces nationalism and an ethnocentric understanding of citizenship in Turkey. As the number of refugees and migrants increases rapidly worldwide, they become the new ‘others’ of national imagined communities. Social media becomes a key communication space where the nation is discursively constructed in a bottom-up manner through manifestations of ‘us’ and ‘them’. The analysis shows that social media contributes to trivialization and normalization of discrimination and hatred against Syrian refugees through disseminating overt discourses of ‘Othering’. Social media also enables more covert forms of discrimination through ‘rationalized’ arguments that are used to justify discrimination through the basis of false/non-verified information. Thus, Twitter becomes a space for critical, bottom-up, yet nationalistic and discriminatory statements about refugees.

T1  - Political correctness and the alt-right: The development of extreme political attitudes
AN  - 2449154186
AB  - Recent studies have documented a shift from moderate political attitudes to more extreme attitudes at the ends of the political spectrum. This can be seen in Political Correctness (PC) on the left, and white identitarian (WI) attitudes on the ‘Alt-Right’ (AR). While highly covered in mainstream media, limited academic research has investigated their possible antecedents and psychological correlates. The current study investigated the prevalence and psychological predictors of these attitudes. Utilising a quota-based sample of 512 U.S. participants, we found that extreme political attitudes were associated with various personality traits, social media use, and upbringing. PC attitudes were associated with agreeableness, black-white thinking, social-media use, and perceived overprotective parenting. WI attitudes were associated with low agreeableness and openness, and high black-white thinking. Our results show that extreme left and right attitudes are separated by individual differences, and that authoritarianism can be seen on both the left and the right.

T1  - Bridging the communal gap: The politics of “Hindu–Muslim” Salman Bhaijaan
AN  - 2449123585
AB  - Of the three Khans that dominate Bombay cinema, Salman Khan enjoys fan popularity amongst Muslims in India. This adoration and identification for Khan is surprising particularly because he has been publicly decried as a Muslim since his implicit support of prime minister Narendra Modi. And yet, his films often get released on the Muslim festival of Eid to tremendous box office success.This article analyzes the intersection of fandom and stardom of Salman Khan to discuss how his stardom is a product of negotiations between the public discussions of his religious identity, interviews that seek to convey his star image as authentic, and the cinematic construction of the star as articulated through his roles. An analysis of media coverage of his films across newspapers that cross nations (India and Pakistan), languages (English, Hindi, and Urdu), and urban-rural divides, I examine the paratextual construction of him as a bhaijaan/brother that then impacts interpretation of his films within local, national, and global imaginaries. I argue that the implicit positioning of Salman Khan across the Hindu-Muslim divide becomes explicit through his roles in Ek tha Tiger (2012), Bajrangi Bhaijaan (2015), and even Sultan (2016). This article proposes that the discourse around what I call his “bhaijaanification” serves as an interruption to the fundamentalist trends within India and Bombay cinema that have become worse as a result of large-scale transnational Islamophobia since 2001, and indicates the extent of stardom’s auteurist function where it influences meanings that go beyond the cinematic and into the political.

T1  - Making health news: Examining how health influencers drive coverage of maternal and child healthcare issues in Nigerian newspapers
AN  - 2448946908
AB  - Nigeria is a developing country with varied developmental challenges. It has one of the worst maternal and child healthcare (MCH) indices, globally. The media, as a vital element within the society, has the potential to contribute to improving MCH through appropriate framing and communication of MCH issues. Achieving media inclusion poses a challenge as media contents are often products of varied power relations. Extant studies have established that health is often not primed in Nigerian newspapers where politics and business hold sway. News media contents are also influenced by varied factors which exists both within and outside of news media organisations. Premised on sociology of news as critical perspective, this study examines power relations in newspaper representation of MCH issues in Nigeria. Combining content analysis of MCH-related stories in newspapers with in-depth interview of newspaper health editors, it explores factors and underlying reasons driving coverage of MCH. It finds that government, local and international aid agencies, and civil societies often influence coverage of MCH issues. These groups drive media representation of MCH through established journalistic routine and reporter-source relations, often favouring priming of official news sources and powerful elements within the society, as a necessity for maximising limited news media resources. This paper identifies various forms in which these groups manipulates media representation of MCH, urging the media to be more proactive in driving agenda for improved MCH for the citizenry, and not accede to satisfying peculiar interests over public interest.

T1  - Ten Years of Messaging about the Affordable Care Act in Advertising and News Media: Lessons for Policy and Politics
AN  - 2448094838
AB  - Messaging about the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has seemingly produced a variety of outcomes: millions of Americans gained access to health insurance, yet much of the US public remains confused about major components of the law, and there remain stark and persistent political divides in support of the law. Our analysis of the volume and content of ACA-related media (including both ads and news) helps explain these phenomena, with three conclusions. First, the information environment around the ACA has been complex and competitive, with messaging originating from diverse sponsors with multiple objectives. Second, partisan cues in news and political ads are abundant, likely contributing to the crystallized politically polarized opinion about the law. Third, partisan discussions of the ACA in political ads have shifted in volume, direction, and tone over the decade, presenting divergent views regarding which party is accountable for the law's successes (or failures). We offer evidence for each of these conclusions from longitudinal analyses of the volume and content of ACA messaging, also referencing studies that have linked these messages to attitudes and behavior. We conclude with implications for health communication, political science, and the future outlook for health reform.

T1  - Regimes of temporality: China, Tibet and the politics of time in the post-2008 era
AN  - 2447818623
AB  - While the politics of time are an important dimension of Chinese state discourse about Tibet, it remains insufficiently explored in theoretical and practical terms. This article examines the written and visual discourses of Tibetan temporality across Chinese state media in the post-2008 era. It analyses how these media discourses attempt to construct a ‘regime of temporality’ in order to manage public opinion about Tibet and consolidate Chinese rule over the region. While the expansion of online technologies has allowed the state to consolidate its discourses about Tibet’s place within the People’s Republic of China (PRC), they have also provided Tibetans a limited but valuable space to challenge these official representations through counter readings of Tibet’s past, present and future. In doing so, this article contributes new insights on the production of state power over Tibet, online media practices in China, and the disruptive potential of social media as sites of Tibetan counter discourses.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Male rape in context: measures of intolerance and support for male rape myths (MRMs)
AN  - 2439261944
AB  - Research on myths about male rape victims and offenders indicates that men and heterosexual individuals tend to believe myths about male rape (MRMs), as do individuals with negative attitudes toward gay men. Many who support male rape myths assume that both male victims of rape and offenders are usually gay, or that straight men cannot be raped. Studies on MRM have portrayed male rape in an ‘everyday life’ context, but myths about male rape are likely shaped by its portrayal in film, television and popular culture. For example, respondents may attribute more blame to victims who are incarcerated as opposed to a victim raped by a stranger near their home. In this study, we assess support for myths about male rape victims and whether the context of the situation and various indicators of intolerance play a role in their beliefs. Specifically, we present four fictional scenarios of male rape to respondents: prison, in the military, during a conflict situation, and on a college campus. We find that respondents are less likely to support MRMs in the context of the military, and that race and gender also explain support for MRMs. Measures of intolerance are positively related to support for MRMs, with sexism having the strongest relationship with support.

T1  - The Influence of Presumed Fake News Influence: Examining Public Support for Corporate Corrective Response, Media Literacy Interventions, and Governmental Regulation
AN  - 2435147103
AB  - In today’s society with polarized opinions, fake news has significantly affected people’s trust in online news. Informed by the third-person effect (TPE) and influence of presumed influence (IPI) theories, this study examined atheoretical model to understand the antecedents and consequences of the presumed effects of fake news on others (PFNE3). Data were collected from 661 respondents through survey research based on fake news about acompany shared on Facebook. Results showed the significant impacts of self-efficacy, social undesirability, and consumer involvement on PFNE3. Furthermore, PFNE3 positively predicted public support for corporate corrective actions, media literacy interventions, and governmental regulation. Findings demonstrated the mediating role of PFNE3 in the model. Theoretical and practical implications were discussed.

T1  - When Pundits Weigh In: Do Expert and Partisan Critiques in News Reports Shape Ordinary Individuals’ Interpretations of Polls?
AN  - 2435147086
AB  - Journalists rely on polls as they cover public opinion. In order to provide perspectives within the news stories, journalists frequently quote pundits – expert and partisan – who evaluate the methodological quality and implications of the numbers. While partisan pundits might attack unfavorable polls as biased and even fake, experts typically provide rational assessments of methodological quality; news readers may also encounter critiques of the reliability of polls in general in op-eds. How do Americans evaluate polls when they come accompanied with such commentaries? Building on evidence that individuals perceive polls in biased ways, this study examines whether and how individuals react to pundit commentary and whether such commentary can increase or decrease partisan bias in evaluations. In a nationally representative survey experiment fielded during the 2016 U.S. presidential election, we exposed 2,078 individuals to news stories about polls that included various expert or partisan comments. Although commentaries shifted perceptions of the polls, they did little to mitigate or amplify news readers’ biases. We conclude that poll commentary is not an effective tool for mitigating bias. Implications for public perceptions, corrective attempts against biased processing of statistical information in news reports, and journalistic coverage at large are discussed.

T1  - Resistance to the dehumanisation of asylum seekers in Australia’s mediated public sphere: an audience perspective
AN  - 2434432681
AB  - Media narratives that dehumanise asylum seekers have tremendous power to shape and reinforce public support for policies that jeopardise the well-being of some of the world’s most vulnerable people. Research suggests that such dehumanisation is exacerbated by the limited opportunities these groups have to contribute to media coverage about their experiences. In response, scholars have advocated for more inclusion of asylum seekers’ voices in news coverage; however, little is known about how Australian media audiences are engaging with this issue. This article discusses research utilising Critical Discourse Analysis alongside a cultural studies Audience Reception framework to examine the perspectives of 24 Western Australians concerning news discourses about asylum seekers. Resistance to dehumanising constructions was a recurring theme, with many participants arguing for greater inclusion of asylum seekers voices’ in news depictions of their plight. These findings suggest that some audiences are challenging and resisting dehumanising discourses about asylum seekers and in some cases, demonstrating awareness of Australian media’s evident exclusion of their voices. Examined through Judith Butler’s social ethics lens, we consider these findings in the light of positions that advocate for the provision of voice as a means to a more ethical and inclusive Australian media.

T1  - Towards an Integration of Models of Discrimination of Immigrants: from Ultimate (Functional) to Proximate (Sociofunctional) Explanations
AN  - 2229809169
AB  - We integrated models of discrimination of immigrants by combining established approaches to prejudice and discrimination towards immigrants (proximate explanations) using assumptions of Evolutionary-Coalitional Theory (ultimate explanations). Based on this perspective, right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), social dominance orientation (SDO), and multicultural ideology (MCI) were considered as sociofunctional motives for attitudes towards immigrants. We examined relationships between individual differences in beliefs about the social world (dangerous worldview and competitive worldview) as more distal antecedents, and RWA, SDO, and MCI as more proximal antecedents, and the endorsement of discrimination of immigrants in the socioeconomic domain by Russian majority group members as the outcome. Data were collected among 576 participants from 33 regions in Russia, using online social media. MCI predicted endorsement of discrimination of immigrants by Russian majority group members better than did RWA and SDO. SDO predicted only economic aspects of the endorsement of discrimination. The results are discussed within the Russian context, with its ethnically diverse composition of the population and high migration rates.

T1  - The China-Pakistan economic corridor: The Pakistani media attitudes perspective
AN  - 2462673891
AB  - The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a flagship project of the Belt and Road Initiative. How Pakistani media coverage shapes the CPEC is related to public attitudes towards the project and may even affect the success or failure of the initiative in Pakistan. This paper examines Pakistani media coverage on the CPEC by constructing and analyzing semantic networks of the news from the top three English media from 2015 to 2018. We detect the sentimental polarity of news coverage on the CPEC, focusing on the words used in the news and determining how the media frames the CPEC in Pakistan. Then, we construct semantic networks of the negative, neutral and positive documents. Network analysis is used to determine the characteristics of the different sentiment networks, which words hold significant positions, and how the negative central concepts are associated with describing the apprehension towards and obstacles related to the CPEC. The results show that most coverage exhibits a positive attitude towards the CPEC. Negative sentiment towards the CPEC is illustrated through more diverse messaging, demonstrating greater cohesiveness than the larger, less-connected positive network. The identified negative central topics are India, security, region, parties, issues, Afghanistan, Kashmir, debt, loans, situation, disputes, cost, opposition and peace, which are framed around apprehension and skepticism regarding the CPEC and the stability of the environment of its construction. In contrast, the most significant words in the positive network are progress, important, support, benefit, prosperity, enhance, improve, and boost, highlighting the potential economic returns and political guarantees. Semantic network analysis of the sentiments expressed in the Pakistani media regarding the CPEC can improve our understanding of Pakistani attitudes towards the CPEC. Our research combines quantitative and qualitative evidence to study media coverage in Pakistan, which can provide insights regarding the communications used to improve confidence in the CPEC and can also improve our understanding of the Belt and Road Initiative.

T1  - News Media Trends in the Framing of Immigration and Crime, 1990–2013
AN  - 2446721183
AB  - Few social problems engender as much public and political debate as the alleged link between immigration and crime. Contrary to the findings of much empirical literature, the majority of the public believe that immigration increases crime and that the foreign born are especially prone to offending. Among many factors, the way prominent news media describe the immigration-crime link may help explain the disconnectedness of scholarship and public opinion over the past several decades. Using a unique database of over 2,200 news stories drawn from among the highest circulation national papers for 1990 through 2013, the current study employs time-series trend analyses to examine the prevalence of different media frames used to explain the immigration-crime link and whether those frames have changed systematically over time. Our results reveal that most immigration-crime news stories describe immigrants as especially crime-prone or as increasing aggregate crime rates. Moreover, this framing has increased in prevalence over time, as have narratives inaccurately describing undocumented immigration as a crime itself, while framing immigrants as victims of crime has declined significantly over the 1990–2013 period. These changes occurred systematically in only some newspapers. We discuss implications for research, policy, and the public engagement of scientific evidence.

T1  - Lost in translation? theorizing public influence on policymaking via the 2018 net neutrality repeal
AN  - 2434001302
AB  - This article examines the role of the public in media policymaking through the lens of the 2018 U.S. net neutrality repeal. I begin by outlining a framework for conceptualizing public influence on policymaking. First, I identify constraints on the potential public impact on the policymaking process. Second, I theorize opportunities for policy reform. Third, I invoke the concept of “translation,” a discursive practice by policy actors that amplifies public opinion in the policy arena, as the mechanism by which the public can influence policy outcomes. Finally, drawing on news accounts, government documents related to the repeal, and participant observation, I apply this framework to the case study of the repeal proceedings to explore the interaction between the translation processes and constraints on public participation. The case demonstrates that translation is a fragile process, subject to co-optation, and reliant on the very structures that constrain it. By revealing how power operates through the policymaking process, the study traces the limits of public influence on communications policymaking against the oppositional public-making work of translation.

T1  - Devils from our past: liberal Islamophobia in Austria as historicist racism
AN  - 2309191004
AB  - This paper examines discourses of liberal Islamophobia in Austria, analysing interviews with journalists from national newspapers, magazines and TV station. Using a theoretical framework that combines a Gramscian analysis with methods of discourse analysis, it identifies "temporalization" as an effective discursive mechanism in the construction of the Muslim "Other" as a "folk devil". It argues that liberal Islamophobia works as a historicist racism, which allows differently positioned subjects to invest into, and reproduce, a mythical space of representation where the Muslim "Other" figures as a "devil from our past", embodying everything Austrian society has supposedly done away with in the years of political reform after 1968.

T1  - Islamophobia in the East of the European Union: an introduction
AN  - 2139169966
AB  - There is some truth in the common view that hostility to Muslims and Islam is more prominent on the eastern flank of the European Union (EU). Yet this East–West difference appears to be diminishing, as governments in Austria and Italy follow Donald Trump’s America by turning Islamophobia into a political platform. On the whole, East–West differences in Islamophobia are often seen as greater than they really are. In terms of content, the discourse of Islamophobia is practically identical to that in the East of the EU and the West, as well as in North America and other parts of the world. Charges of terrorism, immigrant crime, the oppression of women and homosexuals, and/or a desire to invade and ‘Islamize’ Europe and change its Christian character are directed at Muslims as a whole on both sides of the former Iron Curtain. What is different is not so much in the character or degree of anti-Muslim prejudice as such. Rather, it is in the extent to which its political expression is entrenched in national consensus, and to which it is able to undermine resistance by the judiciary, the media and human rights organizations. Islamophobia is discussed in this issue not as the latest incarnation of an ‘East European’ cultural inclination towards racial prejudice, but as an example and a warning about a process that is also happening, though it may not have advanced quite as far (yet?), in most of the West. The most promising avenue of research into the specifically East Central European situation is to study how the fear and rejection of Muslim migrants has been employed in negotiating a new place for the formerly socialist eastern members of the EU. Several authors in this special issue suggest that Islamophobia serves here as a misguided means to raise the region from its current status within the EU as a semi-peripheral, semi-colonial appendage.

T1  - The Scary World of Online News? Internet News Exposure and Public Attitudes Toward Crime and Justice
AN  - 1787236885
AB  - Objectives
 A substantial body of literature indicates that certain forms of media consumption may increase anxiety about crime and support for social controls. However, few studies have examined whether Internet news consumption is positively associated with such attitudes. The void is significant given the public's increasing use of online news sources. This study addresses this research gap.
Methods
We draw on data from four national surveys conducted between 2007 and 2013, which collectively include interviews with more than 13,000 Americans. Using OLS and logistic regression, we assess the relationships between exposure to traditional and online media and perceptions of victimization risk, support for punitive crime policies, and views about police powers.
Results
Consistent with prior work, we find positive relationships between exposure to traditional forms of media--television news and crime programming--and anxiety about victimization and support for harsh crime policies. In contrast, Internet news exposure is generally not associated with anxieties about crime or support for getting tough on criminals. However, there is evidence of an interactive relationship between political ideology and Internet news exposure.
Conclusions
The results provide little support for cultivation theory in the context of Internet news consumption. We discuss the import of our findings, and suggest new lines of research to explore the correlates and the effects of exposure to online news sources.

T1  - Online Islamophobia and the politics of fear: manufacturing the green scare
AN  - 2100413818
AB  - Negative attitudes and explicit racism against Muslims are increasingly visible in public discourse throughout Europe. Right-wing populist parties have strengthened their positions by focusing on the 'Islamic threat' to the West. Concurrently, the Internet has facilitated a space where racist attitudes towards Muslims are easily disseminated into the public debate, fuelling animosity against European Muslims. This paper explores part of the online Islamophobic network and scrutinizes the discursive strategies deployed by three 'prominent' online actors. By combining social network analysis and critical discourse analysis, the study shows that Islamophobic web pages constitute a dynamic network with ties to different political and geographical milieus. They create a seemingly mainstream political position by framing racist standpoints as a defence of Western values and freedom of speech. The study also shows that Islamophobic discourse is strengthened by xenophobic currents within mass media, and by the legitimization of intellectuals and political actors.

T1  - Anti-American Sentiment as a Media Effect? Arab Media, Political Identity, and Public Opinion in the Middle East
AN  - 919904453; 201202179
AB  - Many have attributed anti-American sentiment within Arab countries to a highly negative information environment propagated by transnational Arab satellite TV news channels such as Al-Jazeera. However, theoretical models and empirical evidence evaluating the linkages between media exposure and opinion about the United States remains scant. Drawing on theories of media effects, identity, and public opinion, this article develops a theoretical framework explicating how the influence of transnational Arab TV on opinion formation is contingent on competing political identities within the region. Employing 5 years of survey data collected across six Arab countries, we empirically test several propositions about the relationship between Arab TV exposure and public opinion about the United States generated by our theoretical framework. Our results demonstrate significant associations between transnational Arab TV exposure and anti-American sentiment, but also show these associations vary substantially by channel and political identification. The theoretical and policy implications of the study are discussed. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright holder.]
