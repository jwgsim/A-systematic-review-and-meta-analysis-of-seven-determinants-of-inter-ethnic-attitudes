T1  - Threats and Norms: Multicultural Policies and Natives’ Attitudes Towards Immigrants
AN  - 2675832559
AB  - Do multicultural policies affect natives’ attitudes toward immigrants? I investigate whether cross-country differences and within-country changes in multicultural policies are associated with natives’ negative attitudes toward immigrants and to whom the effects are noticeable. The results of multilevel longitudinal analysis indicate that neither cross-country differences nor within-country changes in multicultural policies are directly relevant to natives’ negative attitudes toward immigrants. However, cross-country differences in multicultural policies are negatively associated with the gap in negative attitudes between natives on the political right and left, while within-country changes in multicultural policies are positively associated with negative attitudes among socioeconomically vulnerable people.

T1  - Who has different-race friends, and does it depend on context? Openness (to other), but not agreeableness, predicts lower racial homophily in friendship networks
AN  - 2659696212
AB  - People form relationships with people from their own racial groups, a phenomenon called racial homophily, which reduces interracial contact and exacerbates inequality and prejudice. Although viewed as arising from environmental factors, we argue that racial homophily also involves individual choice and, thus, personality factors. We address three major issues. First, are interpersonal concerns (Agreeableness) and intergroup concerns (Openness) differentially relevant to cross-race friendships? Second, are current conceptions of Openness sufficient, or do we need lower-level facets more attuned to intergroup concerns? Third, can we specify the interplay between personality and contextual factors in different settings? Across four studies (total N = 1,820), Agreeableness failed to predict more cross-race friendships, in both self- and peer reports, suggesting that interpersonal kindness was not sufficient to overcome racial homophily. In contrast, Openness and Openness to Other (O2, a new social facet of Openness) consistently predicted cross-race friendship. However, the O2 facet had the stronger and only unique effect, suggesting it is the "active ingredient." High-O2 individuals had an almost equal 1:1 ratio of same-to-different-race network members, whereas low-O2 individuals had 4:1 same-race. These results held for both college students and middle-aged adults, both friends and new acquaintances in the network, and both networks established before and at a diverse university. Finally, when moving to a more diverse environment, high-O2 individuals seemed to take advantage of the new environmental affordances, adding more different-race members to their networks. Overall, these studies advance understanding of person–environment transactions, showing how personality traits matter to the structure of people's social networks.

T1  - Prejudice toward Christians and atheists among members of nonreligious groups: Attitudes, behaviors, and mechanisms: GPIR
AN  - 2621964268
AB  - Much research demonstrates that people high in religiosity tend to be prejudiced against value-threatening groups. Therefore, some researchers have suggested that people who are not religious may be less prejudiced. Are nonreligious people characterized by general tolerance? If not, what are the bases of their prejudices? This research investigated prejudice toward Christians and atheists among people who identify as nonreligious (atheist, agnostic, and spiritual-but-not-religious), documented this prejudice in the form of exclusion behaviors (Study 1) and self-report of affect and social distance (Studies 2–3), and explored potential mechanisms of nonreligious prejudice toward Christians: individual differences in belief style and biases against Christians (Studies 2–3). Results showed the nonreligious are not generally tolerant and that differences among these groups in belief superiority, feelings of distrust, and fear of contamination by unpalatable ideas all explained differences in prejudice toward Christians. These findings help provide a more comprehensive picture of religious intergroup prejudice.

T1  - Ethnic categorisation, identity and perceptions of life among Swedish Samis
AN  - 2614690170
AB  - To what extent do Swedish Samis identify their ethnicity as Sami, Swedish, or both? How do they meet various criteria for being allowed to register as voters to the Sami Parliament? What factors predict ethnicities? These questions are studied in randomised samples from the electoral roll for the Sami Parliament. Applying Berry’s model of acculturation, four types are constructed—separated, assimilated, integrated, and marginalised. The findings show that the integrated represent the great majority of Samis. The two groups who tend to choose one of the identities—Sami or Swedish—represent less than one third when combined and are about equal in size. Those marginalised with weak ethnic identities represent 2%. Although all meet the self-identification criterion of being Sami, few meet each of some ‘objective’ criteria, e.g. being involved in reindeer herding, having Sami as the home language or having parents or grandparents with Sami as the home language. The main predictors of a stronger Sami identity are cultural symbolic behaviours and heredity. The main negative predictor of a stronger Swedish identity among Samis is the use of cultural symbolic behaviours, and the main positive predictor is a positive estimate on the Swedish public opinion’s interest in Samis. The findings are discussed in relation to Sami debates on indigeneity.

T1  - Challenges to identity integration amongst sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men
AN  - 2618223727
AB  - Since the Stonewall uprisings, there has been greater social acceptance of homosexuality within Western contexts. Nevertheless, those who are at the intersection of more than one minority identity continue to face prejudice and discrimination, including homophobia and racism. Though there has been increasing work regarding the experiences of sexual minority people of colour (POC), a lacuna remains regarding the experiences of sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men and the integration of sexual minority and religious identities, particularly within a context of increased societal acceptance towards sexual minorities and societal Islamophobia. In this study, 38 sexual minority British Muslim South Asian men were recruited via snowball sampling and interviewed. Data were examined via reflexive thematic analysis. Five themes were identified: degrees of “outness”, hegemonic Whiteness and the LGBTQ+ community, internalisation of White hegemony, distancing from the sexual minority religio‐cultural ingroup, and attempting to reconcile potential identity conflict between sexual orientation identity and religious and cultural identities. Respondents' experiences highlighted substantial social exclusion due to intersectional disadvantage as well as a lack of intra‐community social support, suggesting substantial isolation, psychological implications and a general eschewing of identity affiliation based on sexual attraction. This has implications on services predicated on identity affiliation which may potentially exclude the needs of hidden and intersectionally disadvantaged populations.

T1  - Making America Safe Again: Public Support for Policies to Reduce Terrorism
AN  - 2574999274
AB  - A number of homeland security measures have been implemented or proposed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. While public opinion polls suggest that some of these measures (e.g., universal security checks) have received widespread support, security policies advanced by President Donald Trump that target Muslims and other immigrant groups are more controversial. These polices have conflated immigration with terrorism and have generated anti–immigrant sentiment in some segments of the American public. In this paper, we utilize national survey data to examine the social sources of public support for national security measures, with a focus on policies that emphasize border control, universal security, reduced civil liberties, discriminatory surveillance, and exclusion. We also determine the extent to which support for policies specific to the Trump administration is driven by Trump’s voter base – White, male, older, southern, Christian, and conservative and assess the influence of anti–immigrant attitudes. Our analyses reveal that the American public favors security measures that are applied universally, and characteristics of Trump’s voter base further predict policy support. Our findings also suggest that support of discriminatory security policies is largely explained by the perception that immigrants are dangerous. We discuss the implications of the anti–immigrant and anti-Muslim rhetoric that has stemmed from Trump’s presidential campaign and subsequent administration for national security policies.

T1  - Detecting changes between two strangers: Insight from a classic change blindness paradigm: GPIR
AN  - 2573357334
AB  - The current study aims to investigate what factors influence whether adults detect a change between social partners in a brief interaction. In two experiments, we examined whether locale diversity, a stranger’s marginalized minority status (e.g., minority race, minority religious affiliation), and race congruence (e.g., own or other race) influenced the likelihood of being differentiated. Using a change blindness paradigm, an experimenter approached pedestrians asking for directions, then surreptitiously changed places with a confederate. After the switch, we measured whether pedestrians noticed if the person had changed. In Experiment 1, noticing rates were significantly lower for confederates belonging to a minority race compared to White confederates, but only in the more homogenous location and not in the highly diverse location. In Experiment 2, pedestrians were least likely to detect a change when confederates belonged to a religious minority and a racial minority. We discuss the important implications for prejudicial behaviour and eyewitness identification, as well as the utility of performing psychological research outside of the lab.

T1  - Attitudes Toward LGBT Marriage and Legal Protections Post-Obergefell
AN  - 2513092665
AB  - BackgroundOver the last 40 years, there has been a cultural shift in attitudes toward same-sex marriage in the USA. While there has been a great deal of focus on attitudes toward same-sex marriage, there is less research on attitudes toward LGBT discrimination and legal protections against discrimination, especially post-Obergefell.MethodsThis study uses data from the American Values Survey conducted in November 2015 and state-level data on LGBTQ equality to examine attitudes toward same-sex marriage and LGBT protections post-Obergefell.ResultsAttitudes are generally supportive of LGBT rights though a substantial minority (about 40%) of American adults favor the rights of small businesses to discriminate against LGBT individuals. Those who hold more favorable opinions of Trump are significantly less likely to favor same-sex marriage and LGBT protections against discrimination and more likely to favor exceptions for small business owners than those with unfavorable opinions of Trump. Those living in states that have higher LGBTQ equality rankings are significantly more favorable toward same-sex marriage and legal protections.ConclusionsWhile we have seen extraordinary change with Obergefell and piecemeal change with state laws around LGBT protections, it is important to be cognizant of the political and social landscape when trying to understand current US public opinions toward same-sex marriage and LGBT protections.

T1  - Race, police, and the pandemic: considering the role of race in public health policing
AN  - 2492799969
AB  - As cities and states implement social distancing guidelines to mitigate the effects of COVID-19, one concern is that the social construction of race, and the privileges inherent to those constructions, influence how and when to enforce social distancing. In this theoretical paper, we discuss why Black people may be at a greater risk for police intervention when not abiding by public health guidelines. We also describe the importance of considering how Whiteness, in addition to anti-Blackness, may influence how and when public health guidelines are enforced. Finally, we consider how disparate public health policing related to COVID-19 is situated in a broader historical and global context.

T1  - Group evaluations as self‐group distancing: Ingroup typicality moderates evaluative intergroup bias in stigmatized groups
AN  - 2464643536
AB  - Outgroup favoritism among members of stigmatized groups can be seen as a form of self‐group distancing. We examined how intergroup evaluations in stigmatized groups vary as a function of ingroup typicality. In Studies 1 and 2, Black participants (N = 125,915; N = 766) more strongly preferred light‐skinned or White relative to dark‐skinned or Black individuals the lighter their own skin tone. In Study 3, overweight participants (N = 147,540) more strongly preferred normal‐weight relative to overweight individuals the lower their own body weight. In Study 4, participants with disabilities (N = 35,058) more strongly preferred non‐disabled relative to disabled individuals the less visible they judged their own disability. Relationships between ingroup typicality and intergroup evaluations were at least partially mediated by ingroup identification (Studies 2 and 3). A meta‐analysis across studies yielded an average effect size of r = .12. Furthermore, higher ingroup typicality was related to both ingroup and outgroup evaluations. We discuss ingroup typicality as an individual constraint to self‐group distancing among stigmatized group members and its relation to intergroup evaluations.

T1  - Intraminority solidarity: The role of critical consciousness
AN  - 2464641425
AB  - A central question in the growing field of intraminority relations is how best to promote solidarity among marginalized groups. The current article reviews existing social psychological theories of intraminority relations, with a focus on barriers to, and facilitators of, intraminority solidarity. In particular, we explore the roles of competition and identity threats in eroding solidarity, and examine how similarity perceptions, a common identity of stigma, and structural and historical attributions generate solidarity. We then suggest that critical consciousness, a theory of sociopolitical development prominent in the developmental and community psychology literatures, can integrate disparate findings and extend our understanding of solidarity among marginalized groups. Borrowing from the critical consciousness literature, we outline new theoretical predictions for fostering intraminority solidarity. This exploration furthers existing theoretical work on intraminority solidarity and intergroup relations more broadly.

T1  - How television news disguises its racist representations: The case of Romanian <i>Antena 1</i> reporting on the Roma
AN  - 2429520602
AB  - Research shows that news media around the world tend to represent ethnic minorities in ways which nurture distorted views and invite negative attitudes. Scholars have also emphasised that, in contemporary societies, a political climate has emerged which has made overt racism unacceptable and social taboos leading to racist statements are increasingly being managed and disguised in order to avoid direct accusations. In this paper we use Multimodal Critical Discourse Analysis (MCDA) to carry out an in-depth analysis of a Romanian television news report—selected from a larger corpus—which addressed the situation of the Roma migrants in Norway. We show how this medium, with editing techniques, voice-overs, sound effects and captions, has its own subtleties for communicating racism in ways that are less obvious at a casual viewing. The case we analyse reports on a Norwegian/EU project to build a factory in Romania, so that Roma migrants can return home to work rather than live and beg on the streets of Oslo.

T1  - Fake News Is Real: The Significance and Sources of Disbelief in Mainstream Media in Trump’s America
AN  - 2441436794
AB  - Are appeals to discredit mainstream media reporting of political news in the guise of “fake news” merely a diversion from more fundamental threats to democratic politics and policymaking? Or is the emerging belief in “fake news” itself a looming threat? Using data from the Voter Study Group’s panel survey, we examine the relationship between disbelief in mainstream media and a wide range of social attitudes and policy preferences. We find that in December 2016, just after Trump’s election, belief in fake news wields an outsized influence, independent of partisanship, ideology, media consumption, and other established foundations of public opinion. The effects of fake news beliefs are especially pronounced on key elements of Trump’s rhetoric as candidate and as president—hostility toward immigrants, racial and religious minorities, gender equality, perceptions of America’s “greatness,” and even support for democratic norms and institutions itself. We also find some evidence that by January 2019, the belief in fake news has become even more focally associated with Trump. These findings portend the possibility of an emerging exclusionary, populist variant of American conservatism, of which disbelief in media institutions is a key component.

T1  - What children want to know about in‐ and out‐groups, and how knowledge affects their intergroup attitudes
AN  - 2388834772
AB  - One of the key factors contributing to the development of negative attitudes toward out‐groups is lack of knowledge about them. The present study investigated what type of information 3‐ to 4‐ and 5‐ to 6‐ year‐old Jewish Israeli children (N = 82) are interested in acquiring about unfamiliar in‐ and out‐group individuals, and how providing children with the requested information affects their intergroup attitudes. Children were shown pictures of individuals from three groups—an in‐group (“Jews”), a “conflict” out‐group (“Arabs”), and a “neutral” out‐group (“Scots”)—and were asked what they would like to know about them. The experimenter responded by either answering all of children's questions, half of the questions, or none. Children's attitudes toward the groups were also assessed. It was found that children asked the most questions in regard to conflict out‐group individuals. Moreover, the older age group asked more questions regarding the psychological characteristics, and fewer questions regarding the social identity, of the conflict out‐group than of the other two groups. Finally, full provision of information improved attitudes toward the groups, especially among 3‐ to 4‐year olds, and especially regarding the conflict out‐group. These findings have implications for understanding the sources of intergroup biases, and for developing interventions to reduce them.

T1  - Media of Contempt: Social Media Consumption Predicts Normative Acceptance of Anti-Muslim Hate Speech and Islamoprejudice
AN  - 2444990891
AB  - The new era of information technology brings new opportunities but also poses new threats. In our paper, we examine whether a shift from traditional print and broadcasting to new online media results in the increased normalization of hate speech towards minorities, and whether this change can subsequently increase prejudice towards minorities. Our research uses data from a representative two-wave longitudinal survey of Polish adults. In wave 1 (N = 1060), data on respondents' primary sources of information about the world (TV, newspapers, radio, online, social media, blogs) was collected. Wave 2 (N = 628), conducted six months later, included measures of perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech and Islamophobia. We found that respondents who were frequent social media users expressed higher levels of Islamoprejudice and perceived higher normativity of antiMuslim hate speech than the respondents who got their news from traditional mass media. We also found that an increase in perceived normativity of anti-Muslim hate speech can act as one of the mechanisms through which use of social media is linked to higher Islamoprejudice.

T1  - Do Latinos still support immigrant rights activism? Examining Latino attitudes a decade after the 2006 protest wave
AN  - 2377706263
AB  - The historic and primarily Latino 2006 immigrant rights protest wave occurred in response to proposed federal anti-immigrant legislation (H.R. 4437). Research on the unprecedented series of demonstrations suggests that the draconian and racialized nature of the bill helps explain why it incited large-scale collective action. Utilising a new survey with a considerable oversample of Latino respondents, the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey (CMPS), this paper investigates the role that collective identities, racialisation, and social networks play in Latino support for contemporary immigrant rights activism. To do so, we incorporate measures such as linked fate, perceptions of anti-immigrant sentiments, knowing undocumented people, and concerns about immigration enforcement policies. The results of our analysis indicate that some of the same factors that influenced Latino engagement in the 2006 mobilisations, such as identity and racialisation, concerns over enforcement, and social networks, continue to impact Latino support for contentious politics on behalf of the foreign-born. We also find evidence that political party and past protest activity, play a significant role in explaining levels of support for activism. Our results have important implications for understanding how anti-immigrant policies and racialized nativism influence Latino support for contentious politics.

T1  - One of Us: On the Role of Accent and Race in Real-Time In-Group Categorization
AN  - 2325825968
AB  - In the present research, we investigated the combined role of accent (native vs. nonnative) and race (European native or White vs. nonnative or Black) in real-time in-group categorization among Italian participants. We found that targets presenting mixed cues (i.e., Black persons with a native accent and White persons with a nonnative accent) led to the simultaneous and parallel activation of in-group and out-group representation in the early stage of person perception, showing that both accent and appearance were initially processed. However, later in the process, when accent and appearance did not match, the first played a major role in the participants’ construal of the target as “one of us.” Finally, we examined the role of social identification, beliefs on the importance of language and race, prejudice, social dominance, and contacts with first-generation Italians in the categorization process. Theoretical and applied implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Plural Belongings: Mothering Co-resident Children Post-migration in the USA
AN  - 2266690833
AB  - Immigrant mothers to the USA skillfully negotiate a sense of belonging that is local, global and in-between, as members of multiple spaces for themselves and their children. However, popular conceptions of migrant mothers paint them as traditionalists at best, expected to be grateful for their new ‘here’. This research is based on a small qualitative study of middle-class migrant mothers from multiple parts of the world living in North America. It exposes the differential impact of race and ethnicity on the mothers’ experiences, despite the relative socioeconomic privilege in the backgrounds and life trajectories of the women and their families. The mothers build flexible concepts of home that transcend single countries, raise children who have multiple homes and ideas of identity and strategize to confront prejudices and build ties to their new communities. By focusing on questions enmeshed with women’s mothering acts, we gain insights into notions of identity and belonging. As the mothers in this study negotiate the double transition into motherhood and into a new sociocultural experience, this article explores how they make intentional choices to negotiate, renegotiate and work around migration in ways that are reflective of their senses of self pre- and post-migration. In understanding migrant mothers’ experiences, we also see how policy makers may meet migrant’s needs and by extension, the needs of communities in a world shaped by internationalisms.

T1  - How the interplay of imagined contact and first‐person narratives improves attitudes toward stigmatized immigrants: A conditional process model
AN  - 2185683864
AB  - This article assesses the mechanisms whereby first‐person narratives featuring stigmatized immigrants improve outgroup attitudes and encourage intergroup contact among prejudiced individuals. We rely on a 2 (imagined contact vs. control) × 2 (similar vs. dissimilar message protagonist) experiment on a systematic sample of native British adults. Results show that encouraging imagined contact prior to reading a short testimonial featuring an immigrant protagonist who is similar to the recipients in terms of social identity enhances identification with the protagonist, thereby improving outgroup attitudes and encouraging intergroup contact, and especially strongly among those who are prejudiced toward immigrants (i.e., high on modern racism). Theoretical and practical implications of the findings for the work on imagined contact, narrative persuasion, and identification, as well as for public communication campaigns, are discussed.

T1  - Empowerment and threat in response to mass protest shape public support for a social movement and social change: A panel study in the context of the Bersih movement in Malaysia
AN  - 2185683578
AB  - One path to social change is through sustained collective action. Although such actions often explicitly target the public audience to raise support for a movement's cause, we know little about how the public psychologically responds to protests. To examine this question, a sample of Malaysians was surveyed before and immediately after the occurrence of mass street protests in Malaysia (N = 422) using a two‐wave longitudinal design. Analyses revealed that (beyond pre‐existing levels of movement identity and support for social change) experiencing empowerment in response to the protests promoted a supportive movement identity and more support for social change after the protests, whereas experiencing threat in response to the protests promoted an oppositional movement identity and less support for social change after the protests. This research suggests that the psychological impact of ongoing protests on the public can determine subsequent public support for the movement and its goals.

T1  - Marked inside and out: an exploration of perceived stigma of the tattooed in the workplace
TT  - Marked inside and out
AN  - 2177147237
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to gain better understanding of the attitudes toward those with tattoo(s) – by both those with and without tattoos – within the workplace. Specifically, this paper works to gain better understanding of attitudes toward those within specific employment and workplace groups.Design/methodology/approachThis study utilized a self-administered Likert scaled original survey through a combined random and snowball sampling method. Results were analyzed using quantitative statistical analysis based on responses to attitudinal questions and demographic factors.FindingsThe results of this study indicate that negative attitudes toward tattoos are diminishing, and that there is an ever shrinking gap in negative attitudes between those with and those without tattoos.Research limitations/implicationsWhile intended to be an exploratory exercise, this study may have been limited by the participant base. Even with a high number of responses, the random and snowball sampling of the participants may have resulted in clusters of data which may not be transferable across the population. Future studies should seek more closed collection of the data within specific organizations or controlled participant groups.Originality/valueThis study makes a new contribution to the literature as it is one of the first studies to specifically ask those with tattoos how they feel about others with tattoos. It is also one of the first academic articles, rather than journalistic, which explores attitudes toward tattoos within specific organizations.

T1  - Moral(ity and) Economy: Work, Workfare, and Fairness in Provincial Hungary
AN  - 2108776074
AB  - The relationship between morality and economy has been muddied in the course of disciplinary specialization. While dominant paradigms in economics abstract from the moral dimension, recent approaches to morality and ethics in anthropology neglect the material economy. E. P. Thompson’s “moral economy” has been an influential bridging concept in recent decades, but recent inflationary usage has highlighted shortcomings. Following an overview of the disciplinary debates, the moral dimension of economic life is illustrated in this paper with reference to work as a value between the late 19th and early 21st centuries in Hungary. Contemporary workfare is explored with local examples. It is shown how discourses of work and fairness are being extended into new ethical registers to justify negative attitudes towards a new category of migrants.Alternate abstract:La relation entre la moralité et l’économie a été perdue au gré de la spécialisation disciplinaire. Alors que les paradigmes dominants en économie font généralement abstraction de la dimension morale, les approches récentes de la morale et de l’éthique en anthropologie négligent l’économie matérielle. Le concept intermédiaire d’« économie morale » proposé par E.P. Thompson a été influent au cours des dernières décennies, mais l’inflation récente de ses usages a mis en évidence d’importantes lacunes. Après un tour d’horizon des débats disciplinaires, la dimension morale de la vie économique est saisie dans cet article à partir du cas du travail comme valeur en Hongrie, entre la fin du xixe et le début du xxe siècle. Le modèle contemporain du « workfare » est exploré à partir d’exemples locaux. Il est montré comment les discours sur le travail et l’équité sont étendus à de nouveaux registres éthiques pour justifier des attitudes négatives envers les migrants.Alternate abstract:Die fortschreitende Spezialisierung der Disziplinen hat die Beziehung zwischen Moral und Wirtschaft ausgeblendet. Während die dominierenden, wirtschaftlichen Paradigmen die moralische Dimension außer acht lassen, vernachlässigen jüngste Ansätze der Moral und der Ethik in der Anthropologie die materielle Wirtschaft. Das dazwischen liegende Modell der “moralischen Wirtschaft” von E.P. Thompson hat in den letzten Jahrzehnten einen großen Einfluss ausgeübt, wenngleich jüngste Anwendungen seine Lückenhaftigkeit verdeutlicht haben. Der Zusammenfassung der Fachdebatten folgt eine Analyse der moralischen Dimension des Wirtschaftslebens, verdeutlicht in Sachen Arbeit als Wert am Beispiel Ungarns vom Ende des 19. bis zum Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts. Das zeitgenössische Modell des “workfare” wird mittels örtlicher Beispiele untersucht. Es wird aufgezeigt, wie Reden über Arbeit und Gerechtigkeit auf neue ethische Register ausgeweitet werden, um negative Verhaltungsweisen gegenüber Migranten zu rechtfertigen.

T1  - The world is a scary place: Individual differences in belief in a dangerous world predict specific intergroup prejudices: GPIR
AN  - 2043540633
AB  - Research suggests that people chronically concerned with safety, as measured by the Belief in a Dangerous World (BDW) Scale, are prone to intergroup prejudice and likely to endorse negative stereotypes under conditions eliciting concern for safety. Using a sociofunctional, threat-based approach to prejudice, the current research tested whether people with high BDW report increased prejudice specifically toward groups stereotypically associated with safety-related threats compared to groups associated with unrelated threats. Studies 1 and 2 found that higher BDW predicts increased negativity, safety-related concern, and fear toward groups stereotypically associated with threats to safety (e.g., illegal immigrants and Muslims) compared to groups thought to pose unrelated threats (e.g., gay men and obese people). Study 3 activated concern for safety using a news story detailing increased crime (vs. a control story), finding an interaction between safety concern activation, target group, and BDW, such that situational threat concern elicited greater prejudice toward Mexican Americans, but not toward Asian Americans, from those participants with higher BDW. These studies suggest that individual differences in concern for safety predict specific prejudices (e.g., fear and social distancing) toward distinct groups rather than general outgroup negativity.

T1  - The experience of discrimination among newly arrived Poles in Ireland and the Netherlands
AN  - 2017950339
AB  - This paper examines discrimination and early integration among Polish migrants in Ireland and the Netherlands using a new immigrants' panel survey. Drawing on insights from research on intergroup relations, stereotyping, ethnic competition and Bail's notion of the salience of racial and cultural boundaries, the paper develops hypotheses about the role of experience in and exposure to the host country, of gender and of country context in migrants' experience of discrimination. The key finding is higher discrimination among Poles in the Netherlands and a greater increase in discrimination over time, suggesting that perceptions of ethnic competition, negative public debate and ensuing stereotypes about East European migrants are contributing to a more negative experience for Polish migrants in the Netherlands as compared to Ireland.

T1  - Perceptions of instability and choice across sexual orientation groups: GPIR
AN  - 1989314623
AB  - Some have described gay and lesbian people as making a “lifestyle choice” while others assert that bisexuality is not a stable or valid identity. This paper examines the possibility that perceived instability and perceived choice, and their associations with prejudice, differ depending on both the sexual orientation of the participant and the target group. Participants varying in sexual orientation were randomly assigned to evaluate heterosexual, bisexual, or homosexual targets. Results indicated that negative evaluation of the various target groups was more closely associated with perceived instability than it was with perceived choice. This relationship was moderated by both participant and target sexual orientation; for example, it was weaker for bisexual targets, whose sexual orientations were rated as unstable even among nonbisexual participants who evaluated them positively. A more nuanced understanding of the beliefs underlying prejudice against sexual minorities can be developed by considering targets and participants of many sexual orientations.

T1  - Immigration politics and group consciousness for newcomers to Southern US politics
AN  - 2571083584
AB  - This paper examines the role of immigration politics and group consciousness in Hispanic and Asian American vote preferences in a Southern US statewide election. Using a single public opinion data set that allows for a unique, comparative study of both Latino and Asian American likely voters, I explore the development of group consciousness through immigration politics and ethnic media and test the effects of group-conscious voting (motivation to vote to support one’s ethnic community) on support for Democrats. Through this two-part multivariate analysis I identify immigration politics as central to the development of group consciousness for Latinos but not for Asian Americans, while ethnic media predict group-conscious voting for both highly heterogeneous groups. While group-conscious voting is a strong predictor of both Hispanic and Asian American support for a Democratic candidate in a statewide race, only Latinos link immigration salience to Democratic support. This research contributes to the literature on minority politics in the New South.

T1  - Linguistic barriers and bridges: constructing social capital in ethnically diverse low-skill workplaces
AN  - 1978441247
AB  - The influence of language on social capital in low-skill and ethnically diverse workplaces has thus far received very limited attention within the sociology of work. As the ethnically diverse workplace is an important social space for the construction of social relations bridging different social groups, the sociology of work needs to develop a better understanding of the way in which linguistic diversity influences the formation of social capital (i.e. resources such as the trust and reciprocity inherent in social relations in such workplaces). Drawing on theories about intergroup contact and intercultural communication, this article analyses interviews with 31 employees from two highly ethnically diverse Danish workplaces. The article shows how linguistic barriers such as different levels of majority language competence and their consequent misunderstandings breed mistrust and hostility, while communication related to collaboration and 'small talk' may provide linguistic bridges to social capital formation.

T1  - Competence matters! Understanding biculturalism in ethnically diverse adolescents
AN  - 1945133902
AB  - The importance of bicultural competence in negotiating diversity was explored longitudinally with 227 bicultural British female adolescents. Bicultural competence predicted social-psychological adaptation and intergroup attitudes. It also mediated the effects of ethnic identity and perceived similarity on acculturation preferences. Implications for research on adolescents growing up with diversity are considered.

T1  - Proximal Minority Stress, Psychosocial Resources, and Health in Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1940950051
AB  - Although minority stress processes of internalized stigma and anticipated discrimination are related to poor mental and physical health, limited research has explored mechanisms through which they become related. Uncovering mechanisms could provide additional points of intervention to improve sexual minority health. Using data from 218 sexual minorities (gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals) who participated in an online study, we examined the indirect explanatory role of reduced psychosocial resources (social support, self-compassion, self-esteem) in the link between proximal minority stress (concealment, internalized stigma, anticipated discrimination) and health outcomes (psychological distress, self-reported health). Results revealed proximal minority stress processes were indirectly associated with self-reported health through reduced social support, and indirectly associated with psychological distress through reduced self-compassion and self-esteem. Findings highlight the compromised psychosocial resources that explain how minority stressors become linked with health. Interventions aimed at improving resources may be avenues for improving sexual minority health.

T1  - Factional conflict in groups: How majorities and minorities relate to one another: GPIR
AN  - 1932685702
AB  - Disagreement between numerically larger (majority) and smaller (minority) factions in groups is both common and consequential. For these reasons, there is a long tradition of social psychological interest in the causes and consequences of such disagreement. Early work focused on minority members' movement toward the majority (majority influence) and majority members' (negative) perceptions and evaluations of those who refused to move. Later work focused on similarities and differences between majority influence and its mirror opposite, minority influence, and on majority members' (sometimes relatively positive) perceptions and evaluations of minority members. This paper summarizes current knowledge on these topics and suggests promising avenues for future research.

T1  - The Bibimbap Migration Theory? Challenges of Korea's Multicultural Mix and Social Integration Development
AN  - 1924202822
AB  - Migration was never a brand new phenomenon in South Korea, but its migration pattern has been redirected, migrant size has been amplified, and migrant ethnicity has been diversified in recent years. Korea is undergoing dramatic changes in its demographic composition with an increasing presence of foreigners since the 1990s. Traditionally known for its cultural uniqueness and ethnic homogeneousness, the ongoing inflow of foreigners has presented new challenges, as to who the Koreans are and how the modern Korean society should be defined. Some Koreans even raise concern over migration inflow as a threat to its nationhood purity. This research examines the shifting trend of immigration in Korea with a focus on the new social development of multiculturalism, while assessing the level of social integration and multicultural discourses of the public. In addition to those widely discussed marriage immigrants and foreign labor workers in the existing literature, the recent surge of professional expats, foreign teachers, and international students is becoming evident in Korea's multicultural mix. Moreover, there is still a lack of literature on foreign migrants in Korea, including the US military service personnel, the foreign professional sports players, non-North Korean international refugees, and the latest, permanent residency immigrants through property investment in Korea. Despite the noted increasing inflow of a variety of immigrant residents, who are constantly shaping the new faces of Korea, the acceptance of ethnic diversity and cultural integration has yet to secure its solid place in the Korean society for multiculturalism to be truly embraced and flourished.

T1  - Travelling Spirits, Localizing Roots: Transnationalisms, Home and Generation among Portuguese-Canadians in British Columbia
AN  - 1924202131
AB  - The objective of this article is to address the relation between transnationalism and intergenerational transformations of the notions of home and belonging. While doing an ethnographic research in Vancouver, British Columbia, it was possible to pinpoint the existence of two discourses about Portuguese-Canadian ethnicity. The first one, centered on the Holy Ghost festivals, (re)produces an idea of 'azoreanness', albeit fragmented along the islands of origin, and is linked to specific social networks that go from Vancouver to the Azores. It is essentially fostered by the migrants that arrived in the region after the 1950s and to whom the festas are a constant reminder of the emotional, symbolic and social ties with these Atlantic Islands. The second discourse is fostered by the children of these migrants, which moved away from the Holy Ghost festas and the Portuguese Catholic Parish, and is centered on a notion of portugueseness. This enactment of a national identity has to be interpreted in the context of Canadian multicultural politics and specific diasporic politics developed by the Portuguese authorities in the region. Simultaneously, this second discourse is also part and parcel of an intergenerational social mobility process. Based on this ethnographic case study, this article has two main arguments: on one hand, I want to show how home and homeland are fields of struggle for hegemonic representation in the public domain and and on the other hand how such debates have to be interpreted in relation to local and transnational political contexts and subjectivities.

T1  - Racial-ethnic Identity Pairings and Mental Health of Second-generation Asian Adolescents
AN  - 1914680944
AB  - Second-generation adolescents experience identity conflict when trying to adapt to the United States. This identity conflict may be compounded for Asians, who experience racialization of their ethnicity. This intensity of identity conflict and racialization of ethnicity is reflected in different pairings of racial and ethnic identities (e.g., Hyphenated-Nationality, Hyphenated-Asian). We examine how these identity pairings are associated with mental health. Analysis used a sample of 1,308 second-generation Asian adolescents (aged 15-19) from the Children of Immigrants Longitudinal Study Wave 2 (1995-1996). Although not all associations were significant, low levels of identity conflict tended to be associated with lower levels of depression and more problem behaviors. Perhaps these identity pairings help reduce depression by lowering identity conflict while increasing peer conflicts. The analysis also showed that among adolescents with the same type of ethnic identity, mental health varied across racial identity, highlighting the importance of examining identity pairings.

T1  - Implementing media literacy training for social work programs at HBCUs: A literary analysis of barriers and opportunities
AN  - 1900934280
AB  - The image of the social work profession in the media is problematic for many reasons. Social work and its practitioners are often depicted as incompetent, ineffective, and unnecessary. Despite the necessity of the services provided to the public by social workers, public opinion of the profession remains low. To reverse the current trend, social work programs, particularly those at historically Black colleges and universities, can begin to provide media literacy training and media awareness within the curriculum to assist future social workers in stemming the tide of negative coverage and portrayals of the profession in the media. Using the media diffusion of information theory as an overview, this literary analysis provides a historical view of the profession and highlights current trends in social work practice, education, and media training.

T1  - The Lost Context of 'American Racism'
AN  - 1879500284
AB  - A view that has been advanced by the American Left and that has become common among those whose understanding is formed by its outlook is that American society has historically been deeply racist - so much so that the society in general and its leaders are morally repugnant. In this article, the author notes that this view commits two related fallacies: a "material fallacy" of "truncated perspective" and one of "lost context." In effect, he says, these fallacies turn reality on its head, blackening the image of a society that, however imperfectly, was one of the leading carriers of the Enlightenment and, with the British, of the global campaign against slavery. Coming into being at a time when slavery was still seen throughout the world as both normal and morally acceptable, the American colonies at first accepted - and later found themselves saddled with - a massive slave presence. The article observes that this became a "bone in the throat" with which the society has struggled in a variety of ways since the country's founding. The author concludes by observing how in recent years the consensus in favor of racial equality has seamlessly morphed into a drive for a multiculturalist transformation of American society.

T1  - Group Empathy in Response to Nonverbal Racial/Ethnic Cues: PROD
AN  - 1851014220
AB  - In this study, we argue that nonverbal racial/ethnic cues can activate one's empathy toward disadvantaged out-groups, particularly when such cues resonate with one's own in-group cultural experiences with discrimination. To explain this phenomenon, we propose Group Empathy Theory and test our expectations via a national survey experiment on undocumented immigration. We find trait-level group empathy is strongly linked with empathic reactions to vignettes depicting immigrant detainees in distress, which in turn affect immigration policy attitudes. We also find African Americans and Latinos are considerably more likely than Anglos to exhibit empathy for disadvantaged groups other than their own and oppose deportation policies aimed at undocumented immigrants.

T1  - A Longitudinal Study of Cultural Adaptation among Mexican and Dominican Immigrant Women
AN  - 1830616423
AB  - The present longitudinal study examined cultural adaptation (i.e., acculturation and enculturation) and its correlates in a sample of 189 Mexican and Dominican immigrant women. Acculturation and enculturation were measured within the domains of language competence, identity, and cultural knowledge at two time points over a 1-year period. Across groups and domains, cultural adaptation was generally stable over time; only American cultural knowledge showed change and only for MA women. Several correlates of cultural adaptation were identified. For Mexican women, living in poverty and in immigrant-dense neighborhoods was associated with lower acculturation. For Dominican women, age at immigration was the most robust correlate and was associated with more acculturation and less enculturation, though poverty and neighborhood characteristics emerged as significant for Dominican women too. Findings are consistent with the notion of cultural adaptation as a complex construct that is influenced by cultural context as well as individual immigrant characteristics.

T1  - Self-Expansion and Intergroup Contact: Expectancies and Motives to Self-Expand Lead to Greater Interest in Outgroup Contact and More Positive Intergroup Relations
AN  - 1817460974
AB  - Sixty years of research on intergroup contact demonstrates that positive interactions across group boundaries can improve intergroup attitudes and can contribute to forging tolerant, integrated, multicultural societies. However, to fully realize the benefits of growing diversity around the globe, individuals need to exploit opportunities for intergroup contact that are available to them. Yet, it is relatively unknown why people might deliberately engage in cross-group interactions and how individuals' expectations and motives prepare them to develop positive interpersonal relationships with outgroup members. In this article, we begin to address these research gaps. We discuss the self-expansion model and present new evidence that is consistent with this model. Two studies, one correlational in a cross-cultural setting and the other experimental, show the value of high self-expansion expectancies and motivation in promoting interest in and producing more and higher quality interactions across group boundaries. We discuss implications of these findings for policy and intervention.

T1  - Diverging Patterns of Union Transition Among Cohabitors by Race/Ethnicity and Education: Trends and Marital Intentions in the United States
AN  - 1817757373
AB  - The rise of cohabitation in family process among American young adults and declining rates of marriage among cohabitors are considered by some scholars as evidence for the importance of society-wide ideational shifts propelling recent changes in family. With data on two cohabiting cohorts from the NSFG 1995 and 2006-2010, the current study finds that marriage rates among cohabitors have declined steeply among those with no college degree, resulting in growing educational disparities over time. Moreover, there are no differences in marital intentions by education (or race/ethnicity) among recent cohabitors. We discuss how findings of this study speak to the changes in the dynamics of social stratification system in the United States and suggest that institutional and material constraints are at least as important as ideational accounts in understanding family change and family behavior of contemporary young adults.

T1  - A Psychometric Review of Measures Assessing Discrimination Against Sexual Minorities
AN  - 1807594877
AB  - Discrimination against sexual minorities is widespread and has deleterious consequences on victims' psychological and physical wellbeing. However, a review of the psychometric properties of instruments measuring lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) discrimination has not been conducted. The results of this review, which involved evaluating 162 articles, reveal that most have suboptimal psychometric properties. Specifically, myriad scales possess questionable content validity as (1) items are not created in collaboration with sexual minorities; (2) measures possess a small number of items and, thus, may not sufficiently represent the domain of interest; and (3) scales are "adapted" from measures designed to examine race- and gender-based discrimination. Additional limitations include (1) summed scores are computed, often in the absence of scale score reliability metrics; (2) summed scores operate from the questionable assumption that diverse forms of discrimination are necessarily interrelated; (3) the dimensionality of instruments presumed to consist of subscales is seldom tested; (4) tests of criterion-related validity are routinely omitted; and (5) formal tests of measures' construct validity are seldom provided, necessitating that one infer validity based on the results obtained. The absence of "gold standard" measures, the attendant difficulty in formulating a coherent picture of this body of research, and suggestions for psychometric improvements are noted.

T1  - Preference and prejudice: Does intermarriage erode negative ethno-racial attitudes between groups in Spain?
AN  - 1802366685
AB  - This paper challenges the idea - rooted in classic assimilation theory - that intermarriage clearly erodes social and ethno-racial boundaries and negative attitudes between groups. Drawing on narratives from 58 immigrants of seven different origin countries residing in Catalonia, Spain, who are in romantic partnerships with Spanish-born people, we focus on preferences and prejudices related to mixing. We find that the members of exogamous couples both suffer social discrimination regarding the crossing of ethnocultural borders, particularly from their respective family members - a rejection that is based on negative stereotypes and preconceptions linked to the partner's origin, phenotype or ethnocultural characteristics, such as religion, in intersection with gender. More significantly, we also find that ethno-racial prejudices (particularly when referring to marriage preferences for the respondents and their children) and discriminatory attitudes (towards one's own and other immigrant minority groups) also exist among intermarried couples themselves. In sum, we question the role of mixed unions as a diluter of differences and an accelerator of integration.

T1  - Contrasting Lay Theories of Polyculturalism and Multiculturalism: Associations With Essentialist Beliefs of Race in Six Asian Cultural Groups
AN  - 1799020453
AB  - Multiculturalism and polyculturalism are two lay theories of culture that have been associated with some similar intergroup attitudes and behaviors. But other than the studies of Rosenthal and Levy in the United States, there have been no studies that directly distinguish between these two lay theories. In this study, we use confirmatory factor analysis procedures to show that multiculturalism and polyculturalism represent two distinct latent constructs among our 1,730 participants in six Asian cultural groups (China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Macau, Malaysia, the Philippines). Moreover, we show that essentializing race is associated with endorsement of multiculturalism (but not polyculturalism) in five cultural groups (except Hong Kong). The results provide strong cross-cultural empirical evidence for the distinction between the two lay theories and, more importantly, point to aspects of the lay theory of multiculturalism that relate to why it is sometimes associated with stronger stereotyping and prejudice toward minority cultural groups.

T1  - The Formation of Transnational Identity among French Immigrants Employed in French-Speaking Companies in Israel
AN  - 1789877040
AB  - This study focuses on the formation of a transnational identity among immigrants from France who are employed in French-speaking companies in Israel (mostly call-centres). The preliminary qualitative analysis shows that this unique employment pattern contributes to the formation of their transnational identity, which is a combination of their francophone, Jewish and Israeli identity. The findings obtained from a larger-scale online survey indicated that French immigrants employed in French-speaking companies are more ethnically, socially and culturally segregated, and less fluent in Hebrew than French immigrants who are not employed in such companies. However, no significant differences were found between these two groups in their Israeli identity and sense of belonging to Israeli society. In general, the French immigrants feel at home in Israel, are satisfied with their life in Israel and plan to remain there. The implications of these findings for policymakers are discussed.

T1  - Race and mass murder in the United States: A social and behavioral analysis
AN  - 1789773563
AB  - In the popular discourse, it is commonly assumed that mass murderers and mass shooters are different from most criminals in the United States, because they are almost always white. The present study uses data on 308 mass murderers who attacked from 2006 to 2014 to evaluate this assumption, test for racial differences between mass murderers and all other murderers, and identify characteristics of mass murderers' behavior by race and ethnic group. Findings suggest that, overall, the racial composition of mass murderers is similar to that of other murderers, and thus may be largely explained by similar social forces, such as structural disadvantages and social inequalities. However, there are significant differences across racial and ethnic groups in attack subtype, victims killed, and attack resolution. In particular, the structural advantages and aggrieved entitlement experienced by whites may help explain their involvement in public mass shootings. Further research in both the United States and other countries may shed additional light on the behavior of mass murderers and the broader social forces that shape them.

T1  - A Matter of Psychological Safety: Commitment and Mental Health in Turkish Immigrant Employees in Germany
AN  - 1786179585
AB  - Immigration entails the risk of feeling disconnected in the receiving society, in both everyday life and the workplace. This may affect the way immigrant employees relate to their job and their workplace. In this article, we investigate the affective commitment of Turkish immigrant employees in Germany (TG) and their subsequent work engagement, mental health, and turnover intention. Specifically, we compared TG (n = 201) to both German employees in Germany (GG; n = 1,406) and Turkish employees in Turkey (TT; n = 362). Our results show that the effect of immigration background on mental health, work engagement, and turnover through affective commitment depends on the level of perceived psychological safety at the workplace, specifically in terms of an open and inclusive work climate. The results suggest that psychological safety is particularly helpful in enhancing immigrant employees' positive attitudes toward the workplace. Our study provides new insights on the well-being of immigrant employees, specifically TG, and the different needs of diverse workforces. Given our findings, future studies should explore more deeply the positive influences that psychological safety has on minority groups and their workplace attitudes.

T1  - A threat in the air? Perceptions of group discrimination in the first years after migration: Comparing Polish Migrants in Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and Ireland
AN  - 1790893785
AB  - Discrimination is a problem for both minority groups and the societies in which they live. Perceived group discrimination reflects the direct experiences of immigrants but is also an indicator of reception context and social cohesion in the host country. This paper examines perceptions of group discrimination among recently migrated Polish immigrants to four Western European countries, and specifically focuses on changes over time in these individual perceptions, using a new longitudinal survey of immigrants. Are there cross-national differences in (changes in) perceived group discrimination, and how is discrimination related to exposure to and experiences in the host country? By employing a panel design we find that perceived discrimination is higher among Polish migrants in the Netherlands in Wave 1 than in the other three countries; perceptions of discrimination also increase more there between waves of the survey, as well as in the UK. Perceptions of group discrimination are related to some aspects of exposure to the host country, but most strongly associated with negative experiences in the host country. Differences in country contexts - attitudinal climate and national discourses - seem to play a role in understanding perceived group discrimination among new Polish immigrants in Western Europe.

T1  - Young, Black, and (Still) in the Red: Parental Wealth, Race, and Student Loan Debt
AN  - 1771600649
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Wealth Taking out student loans to assist with the costs of postsecondary schooling in the US has become the norm in recent decades. The debt burden young adults acquire during the higher education process, however, is increasingly stratified with black young adults holding greater debt burden than whites. Using data from the NLSY 1997 cohort, we examine racial differences in student loan debt acquisition and parental net wealth as a predictor contributing to this growing divide. We have four main results. First, confirming prior research, black young adults have substantially more debt than their white counterparts. Second, we find that this difference is partially explained by differences in wealth, family background, postsecondary educational differences, and family contributions to college. Third, young adults' net worth explain a portion of the black-white disparity in debt, suggesting that both differences in accumulation of debt and ability to repay debt in young adulthood explain racial disparities in debt. Fourth, the black-white disparity in debt is greatest at the highest levels of parents' net worth. Our findings show that while social and economic experiences can help explain racial disparities in debt, the situation is more precarious for black youth, who are not protected by their parents' wealth. This suggests that the increasing costs of higher education and corresponding rise in student loan debt are creating a new form of stratification for recent cohorts of young adults, and that student loan debt may be a new mechanism by which racial economic disparities are inherited across generations.

T1  - Socioeconomic Adaptation of Post-1991 Eastern European Immigrants in the USA
AN  - 1760244876
AB  - Very little is known about new Eastern European immigrants in the USA, despite the rapid growth of this immigrant population. In particular, their socioeconomic adaptation to American life has not been systematically studied. Extending previous research on post-1965 immigration to the USA, this study examines the socioeconomic adaptation of post-1991 Eastern European immigrants by focusing on their educational attainment, occupational status, and income. We test our hypotheses using data from the pooled 2006-2010 American Community Surveys and ordinary least squares regression and logistic regression. The results show that new Eastern European immigrants tend to be highly educated and professional, but their income is surprisingly low. The results of regression models indicate that the individual characteristics of immigrants largely explain their socioeconomic adaptation. In addition, such conditions in the countries of origin as gross domestic product and political and personal freedom also influence their socioeconomic performance to some extent. The implications of findings are discussed.

T1  - From International Migration to Transnational Diaspora: Theorizing "Double Diaspora" from the Experience of Chinese Canadians in Beijing
AN  - 1760244695
AB  - This study theorizes double diaspora based on the experiences of Chinese Canadians in Beijing who had previously immigrated to Canada from China and later returned. The study reveals that Chinese Canadians are increasingly internationally mobile as a result of globalization, modern communications and transportation. Their transnational migration experiences can be classified as "double diaspora"--a hybrid experience that transcends boundaries of ethnicity and nationalism. The double diaspora is characterized by a number of dualities as both Chinese and Canadian, living in Chinese and Canadian diaspora, simultaneously diasporas and returnees, playing a double role as cultural and economic brokers between Canada and China. The double diaspora views the diaspora sojourn as neither unidirectional nor final, but rather as multiple and circular. It rejects the primordial notion of diaspora and theorizes diaspora as heterogeneous and conflictual forms of sociality. This study provides an alternative framework in understanding transnational migration and representing multiple ways of affiliations and belonging.

T1  - Realizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences? Exploring the Mismatches Between What People Want, Where They Search, and Where They Live
AN  - 1757627296
AB  - The housing search process is an overlooked mechanism in the scholarly research that seeks to understand the causes of persistent racial residential segregation in the United States. Past research has explored in detail the preferences people hold in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of their neighborhoods, and more recently some have also examined the correspondence between racial and ethnic neighborhood preferences and current neighborhood racial/ethnic composition. But an intermediate stage--the racial/ethnic composition of where people search--has not been investigated. We analyze a subsample (n = 382) from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study to demonstrate the value of systematically studying the matches--or mismatches--between preferences, search locations, and neighborhood outcomes. We find that for whites, not only their current neighborhoods but also the neighborhoods in which they search for housing have larger percentages of whites than they say they prefer. In contrast, blacks--and to a lesser extent Latinos--search in neighborhoods that correspond to their preferences, but reside in neighborhoods with a larger percentage own group. Logistic regression analyses reveal that mismatches are associated with both a lack of information and inadequate finances, but also may be due to socially desirable responding for whites in particular. Our results provide suggestive evidence of the importance of unpacking the search process more generally and draw attention to what are likely to be productive new future data collection efforts as well as an area potentially ripe for policy interventions.

T1  - Liberals and Pseudoliberals: Psychological Profiles
AN  - 1885893477
AB  - The article recognizes that liberalism is unpopular in contemporary Russia. The author believes that what is really unpopular is not true liberalism but its pseudoliberal "mutation." The main differences between the liberals and pseudoliberals are the interpretation of freedom, the attitude toward patriotism and morality, the basic ideologems, the style of thinking, way of life, the correlation between principles and interests, etc. The author formulates the main tasks that need to be tackled to restore a positive attitude toward liberalism in our country and predicts that the confrontation between true and pseudoliberalism may in the coming years become a major arena of ideological battles.

T1  - Language Rights and Multilingualism in Vojvodina
AN  - 1855325275
AB  - Stricken by civil wars in the 1990s, Serbia, a newly formed nation state with immature democratic institutions, has faced challenges stemming from the changed ethnic composition of the country. It has had to create complex language policies that take into account the legitimate demands of old, traditional national minorities, the undefined status of new national minorities born out of the Yugoslav secession, and the needs of foreigners. It also had to find an adequate legal-political position for its multilingual, multicultural autonomous province, Vojvodina. Because these challenges are actual still today, the article examines whether the Serbian legislator has succeeded in the preservation of the traditional, and promotion of the newly evolved multilingualism, especially in its multicultural northern province, and how the constitutional status of the Autonomous Province of Vojvodina affects the enforcement of the language rights of its ethnically very heterogeneous population.

T1  - Geographies of race and ethnicity 1
AN  - 1730461845
AB  - In this report I compare two forms of racism: white privilege and white supremacy. I examine how they are distinct and can be seen in the environmental racism arena. I argue that within US geographic scholarship white privilege has become so widespread that more aggressive forms of racism, such as white supremacy, are often overlooked. It is essential that we understand the precise dynamics that produce environmental injustice so that we can accurately target the responsible parties via strategic social movements and campaigns. Using the case of Exide Technologies in Vernon, California, I argue that the hazards generated by its longstanding regulatory noncompliance are a form of white supremacy.

T1  - Recovering Heritage and Homeland: Ethnic Revival Among Fourth-Generation Japanese Americans
AN  - 1725013760
AB  - In recent years, fourth-generation Japanese American youth have been attempting to recover their ethnic heritage and reconnect with their ancestral homeland. This ethnic revival is a response to their continued racialization as "Japanese," which has caused them to become concerned about their overassimilation to American society in an era of multiculturalism where cultural heritage and homeland have come to be positively valued. As a result, they are studying Japanese, majoring in Asian studies, living in Japan as college exchange students, and participating in Japanese taiko drum ensembles in local ethnic communities. Although this return to ethnic roots is a more serious commitment than the symbolic ethnicity observed among white ethnics in the past, it indicates that ethnicity remains involuntary for racial minorities, even after four generations. The case of later-generation Japanese Americans demonstrates that cultural assimilation does not preclude the continuation and active production of ethnic difference.

T1  - The spectre of Japan: The influence of foreign relations on race relations theory, 1905-24
AN  - 1784145653
AB  - Race relations became the dominant paradigm by the time the official report on the 1919 Chicago riot, The Negro in Chicago, was published. It expressed a new appreciation of the danger to Whites of conflict based on colour. Before 1905 most observers assumed the inferiority of Blacks and saw race conflict as the fault of African Americans. But a new possibility arose when the fate of African Americans was linked to the rising power of Japan, occurring after the defeat of Russia by Japan in 1904-5. Race conflict, in this new model, was a form of conflict between nations. Race relations pioneer Robert E. Park, in his 1913 article, 'Racial Assimilation in Secondary Groups', noted that 'under conditions . . . of individual liberty and individual competition, characteristic of modern civilization, depressed racial groups tend to assume the form of nationalities. A nationality, in this narrower sense, may be defined as the racial group which has attained self-consciousness, no matter whether it has at the same time gained political independence or not.' Yuill's paper will explore the thesis that a liberal perspective based on developments in contemporary international relations slowly changed the way race was regarded in the United States. From 1905 onwards, a new liberal paradigm sought to manage race conflict. It was this-rather than labour-based racial antipathies or commitment to racial equality-that shaped US race relations in the twentieth century.

T1  - THE INTERSECTION OF RACE, GENDER, AND CLASS IN ROUTINE ACTIVITIES: A PROPOSED CRIMINOLOGICAL MODEL OF VICTIMIZATION AND OFFENDING
AN  - 1842827813
AB  - Traditional criminological theories have been criticized for not considering and incorporating the demographic characteristics of race, gender, and class, which are robust predictors of criminal behavior and victimization, into their main tenets. The proposed theoretical model incorporates the intersection of race, gender, and class with routine activity theory, an accepted theory of criminal offending and victimization. This integration will allow researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to better understand how oppressive factors impact one's routine activities, thereby influencing his/her opportunities and subsequently the likelihood of being involved in crime. Policy implications, including improving the individual and collective well-being of marginalized groups, are discussed.

T1  - Race and STEM Degree Attainment
AN  - 1735658489; 201537737
AB  - This paper reviews the key literature on racial disparities in entry and persistence to attain a STEM bachelor's degree. Overall, the literature provides quite consistent evidence that Black and Hispanic students are well represented in college major choices in STEM, which testifies to the interest of racial minorities in STEM fields. However, they are left behind during college, and many are left without a STEM degree or any degree whatsoever. We emphasize that although racial minority students may seem to be left behind during college in STEM fields, the problem dates further back to pre-college. We need to examine college and pre-college studies in an integrative manner, in order to achieve full understanding and come up with the right solution to the problem of racial disparity in STEM attainment.

T1  - Immobility and the re-imaginings of ethnic identity among Mongolian Kazakhs in the 21st century
AN  - 1761675026; 201602163
AB  - Accompanying the dissolution of the USSR and the formation of new nation states in the 1990s, nearly half of Mongolian Kazakhs migrated from their adopted home of Mongolia to the imagined homeland of Kazakhstan. By 2000, a sizable percentage returned to Mongolia. In explaining their decisions to stay in or to return to Mongolia, the Kazakhs we interviewed cite several culturally specific factors. Place identities, as expressed through cultural elements of religiosity, kinship ties, and language versatility, tie Mongolian Kazakhs strongly to western Mongolia while meta-narratives about diaspora and homeland prescribe identity with Kazakhstan. Utilizing life history interviews, participant observation, and questionnaire data we argue that Mongolian Kazakhs actively employ narratives of their cultural history to re-create and re-establish place identities in Mongolia and ultimately re-imagine Mongolian-Kazakh community and identity. These recreated place identities have emerged among Mongolian-Kazakhs who chose to remain immobile or return migrated from the 'homeland' of Kazakhstan. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - An appropriation of ashes: transient aesthetic markers and spiritual place-making as performances of alternative ethnic identities
AN  - 1700673390; 201525222
AB  - In this paper I consider the material ways in which individuals overlay an imaginary, ethnicized secondspace in the form of a spiritual realm onto their state-defined, lived firstspaces. Through the use of temporary roadside altars and shrines, I argue that this imaginary space is reified into transient aesthetic markers that subvert state-mandated, purpose-built structures and ethnic narratives, allowing for alternative versions of diasporic ethnic identities to be performed and consumed. Through the use of a case study of a suburban town centre in Singapore, I employ a mix of visual and sensorial observation methods and take the role of a hungry ghost during the seventh lunar month, exploring the material manifestations of ethnic imaginations.

T1  - Perceived institutional support among young indigenous and mestizo students from Chiapas (Mexico): a group vitality approach
AN  - 1667949205; 201510996
AB  - Ethnolinguistic Vitality Theory (EVT) asserts that status, demographic and institutional support (IS) factors make up the vitality of ethnolinguistic groups within intergroup relations. Specifically, IS factor refers to the extent to which a language group enjoys representation in the various institutions of a society, in particular, mass media, education, government services, industry, religion, culture and politics. However, some scholars suggest that EVT underestimates the strength of ethnic institutions. This article addresses the perceived IS among indigenous and mestizo students and perceived community support among indigenous students in Chiapas. The results show significant differences between indigenous perceived IS and community support. Based on this finding, we suggest that studies of ethnolinguistic vitality can be enriched by the use of new scales to measure ethnic groups' own institutions involved in fostering their native languages and traditions in contexts where the mainstream institutions do not give any formal or informal support.

T1  - MINORITY STATUS AND WORKERS LIBERAL AND CONSERVATIVE ATTITUDES TO THEIR UNION
AN  - 1757046560
AB  - In this study of attitudes among industrial workers at a plant in the US, the analysis reveals differences between white males on one side, and women and minorities on the other side. Specifically, the survey question targeted was in order to succeed, the union should work with outside groups such as civil rights and environmental groups. In efforts to ascertain this information, data was collected on a survey that was administered to a major industrial union of 1,020 workers in 2007. The results follow similar findings in other studies that white males specifically, and whites in general in the working class are diverging in social attitudes compared to their minority and female coworkers. Generally, women and minorities are consistently liberal, while white males in particular are consistently conservative. This has significant ramifications for organized labor, labor politics and wider gender relations.

T1  - Anxiety perseverance in intergroup interaction: When incidental explanations backfire
AN  - 1667951769; 201509663
AB  - Intergroup interactions are often anxiety provoking, and this can lead members of both majority and minority groups to avoid contact. Whereas negative consequences of experiencing intergroup anxiety are well documented, the role of perceived anxiety has received substantially less theoretical and empirical attention. We demonstrate in 3 experiments that the perception of anxiety in others can undermine intergroup interactions even when the anxiety can be attributed to a source that is unrelated to the interaction. Participants who learned that a cross-race partner's anxiety could be attributed to an upcoming evaluation (Study 1) or a stimulant (i.e., caffeine, Studies 2 and 3) expressed less interest in continuing an interaction (Studies 1 and 2), showed less self-disclosure (Study 2), and increased physical distance between themselves and their partner (Study 3) than did those given no source information and participants who interacted with a same-race partner. Moreover, compared to control participants, perceivers who were given an incidental explanation for their partner's anxiety perceived outgroup, but not ingroup, partners as more anxious (Studies 1 and 3) and showed heightened accessibility of anxiety words (Study 3), indicating that incidental source information enhanced accessibility of intergroup (but not intragroup) anxiety at early stages of information processing. Theoretical and practical implications for combating paradoxical effects of perceived anxiety in intergroup interactions are considered. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - 'We are in the same boat'. The dialogue between identification and dis-identification underlying individual and group positioning
AN  - 1748865103; 201600151
AB  - Kadianaki in this Special Issue offers an interesting conceptualization of the process whereby macro-societal drives organize the dynamic of inter-individual communication with a specific focus on power asymmetries among researcher and researched. The author bridges the notions of identity and power through the theory of social representations inviting scholars to consider the social and cultural context within which research encounters take place. Starting from the 'conceptual methodology' posited by Kadianaki, I suggest to go one step further towards a dialogical conceptualization of positionality discussing the key notion of positioning and the articulation between hegemonic, emancipated, and polemic social representations. In particular, the focus on the dynamic nature of consensus, underlying the production of social knowledge, entails to address a societal understanding of the complex dynamics of identification and dis-identification that feed the processes of self-construction and self-placing with both of them meant as a function of inter-group relations of power. Furthermore, some considerations are expanded with concern to the migration field of study. In particular, results from the study of Kadianaki stimulates reflections on the dynamics of resistance towards coercive self-categorization in search for a common identification that may reduce the power asymmetries among native and immigrant groups.

T1  - The difficulty of recognizing less obvious forms of group-based discrimination
AN  - 1700674370; 201524895
AB  - Research on perceptions of discrimination has focused on group-based differential treatment that is widely accepted as being illegitimate (e.g., based on race or gender). The present research investigates how individuals interpret less obvious forms of group-based exclusion based on age (Study 1) and vision correction status (Study 2). We propose that individuals will not question the legitimacy of such treatment, unless they are provided with explicit cues to do so. Participants who merely encountered exclusion (baseline control) did not differ from those who were directed to consider the legitimate reasons for this treatment, with respect to perceived legitimacy, felt anger, and collective action intentions. In contrast, individuals who were directed to consider the illegitimate reasons for the exclusion perceived it to be less legitimate, felt more anger, and reported higher collective action intentions. Participants' own status as potential victims or mere observers of the exclusion criterion did not influence their legitimacy perceptions or felt anger. Results suggest that when confronted with forms of group-based exclusion that are not commonly defined as discrimination, people do not perceive an injustice unless explicitly directed to seek it out.

T1  - No Silent Surrender: U.S. Supreme Court Hears Red River Water Rights Case
AN  - 1751968632
AB  - The United States Supreme Court judgment rendered in Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831) has been considered one of the ten worst decisions for Indian law (Echo Hawk, 2010). More recently, in 2013, the United States Supreme Court ruled on the water conflict presented in Tarrant Regional Water District, Petitioner v. Rudolf John Herrmann Et Al. No. 11-889 (2013) (SCOTUS, 2013). Documents for this case brought into question whether American Indian rights were being adequately presented (Burrage, 2013; Chapman, 1985; Greetham, 2008; Sotomayor, 2013; Verrilli, Jr., 2012). Historical analysis of events and documents reveal the depths of social inequality evident in the conflict between powerful federal and state agencies and marginalized groups. A case study, utilizing Ritzer's integrative theory of social analysis, asks whether the Red River Compact, the water allocation document between the states of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Louisiana, grants favorable benefits to one state over another. This case study helps identify whether American Indian water rights have been adequately considered.

T1  - Second-hand drinking may increase support for alcohol policies: New results from the 2010 National Alcohol Survey
AN  - 1692289386; 201522169
AB  - Introduction and Aims The harms of second-hand smoke motivated tobacco control legislation. Documenting the effects of harms from others' drinking might increase popular and political will for enacting alcohol policies. We investigated the individual-level relationship between having experienced such harms and favouring alcohol policy measures, adjusting for other influences. Design and Methods We used the landline sample (n = 6957) of the 2010 National Alcohol Survey, a computer-assisted telephone interview survey based on a random household sample in the USA. Multivariable regression models adjusted for personal characteristics, including drinking pattern (volume and heavy drinking), were used to investigate the ability of six harms from others' drinking to predict a three-item measure of favour for stronger alcohol policies. Results Adjusting for demographics and drinking pattern, number of harms from others' drinking predicted support for alcohol policies (P < 0.001). In a similar model, family- and aggression-related harms, riding with a drink driver and being concerned about another's drinking all significantly influenced favour for stronger alcohol policy. Discussion Although cross-sectional data cannot prove a causal influence or directionality, the association found is consistent with the hypothesis that experiencing harms from others' drinking (experienced by a majority) makes one more likely to favour alcohol policies. Other things equal, women, racial/ethnic minorities, lower-income individuals and lighter drinkers tend to be more supportive of alcohol controls and policies. Conclusions Studies that estimate the impact of harms from other drinkers on those victimised are important and now beginning. Next we need to learn how such information could affect decision makers and legislators. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic identity on display: West Indian youth and the creation of ethnic boundaries in high school
AN  - 1559006027; 201432010
AB  - The black immigrant population in New York City has grown exponentially since 1990, such that West Indians now compose the majority of the black population in several neighbourhoods. This article examines how this ethnic density manifests among youth in high school, and how it has influenced ethnic identity formation among second-generation West Indians. My findings are based on twenty-four interviews and eight months of participant observation in two Brooklyn high schools from 2003 to 2004. The results show that in both schools, Caribbean island identities have become a 'cool' commodity within peer groups. Further, although it was important to express pride in one's island identity, these young people often blurred their national origin boundaries by drawing on Jamaican popular culture as way of projecting a unified 'West Indian identity'. The research also uncovers evidence of a de-stigmatization of Haitianness as a way to incorporate them as cultural insiders into the larger Caribbean collective. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Ethnic identities in the future: the possible effects of mass immigration and genetic testing
AN  - 1551002033; 201429143
AB  - Two important trends may influence the identities of the later-generation descendants of European immigrants in the USA: high levels of ongoing immigration to the USA from all over the world, and the growth of genetic testing for ancestry and ethnic origins. I suggest that these trends may modify Gans's predictions of what will happen to later-generation ethnicity. Both trends might lead to the maintenance of some type of identity, even if it is very thin, or even unrelated to the European immigrants who originally came to the USA.

T1  - 'Stretching out the categories': Chinese/European narratives of mixedness, belonging and home in Singapore
AN  - 1531933806; 201423361
AB  - Racial categorization is important in everyday interactions and state organization in Singapore. Increasingly, the idea of 'mixed race' and new conceptions of mixedness are challenging such classification along racial lines. Although contemporary Singapore is extremely diverse, the underlying ideology of multiracialism remains grounded in distinctly racialized groups, leaving little space for more complex individual identities. This paper explores the identifications of individuals of mixed Chinese and European descent in the Singaporean context, looking at how complexity is lived within firmly racialized structures. Drawing on a series of 20 narrative interviews, this research examines the relationship between categorization and identity, focusing on the identities of individuals with multiple national, cultural and ethnic ties. The practical impacts of racial categorization shape many aspects of life in Singapore, and individuals of mixed descent illustrated a constant tension between official categorization and personal mixedness, seen in the frustrations experienced and strategies developed by individuals around race and belonging. Individuals negotiated their connections around race and nationality both in practical terms around language, social policies and culture, and personally in terms of symbolic feelings of connection.

T1  - Contact and Attitudes Toward International Students in Australia: Intergroup Anxiety and Intercultural Communication Emotions as Mediators
AN  - 1520336524; 201412259
AB  - The current study investigated the impact of intercultural contact between domestic and international students on attitudes toward international students, and potential mediators of this relationship. A total of 247 Australian-born domestic undergraduates completed a survey of the quantity and quality of their contact with international students, levels of intergroup anxiety (IA) and intercultural communication emotions (ICE), and their attitudes toward international students. Positive quality of intercultural contact, less IA, and more positive ICE were all related to more positive attitudes toward international students. In addition, ICE mediated the relationship between positive quality of contact and attitudes, and between IA and attitudes. Quality of contact exerted both direct and indirect effects (via IA and intercultural communications emotions) on intergroup attitudes. Results highlight the importance of addressing communication barriers and the emotions associated with these when promoting positive interactions between domestic and international students. Suggestions are made for a theoretical integration of intergroup and communication-based perspectives when considering attitudes toward linguistically diverse outgroups like international students.

T1  - Peer Group Rejection in Childhood: Effects of Rejection Ambiguity, Rejection Sensitivity, and Social Acumen
AN  - 1543801923
AB  - This study examined the reactions of 6 to 12 year old children (N = 144) to in-group members who accepted or rejected them, and assessed whether their reactions were influenced by their rejection sensitivity (RS) and social acumen (SA). After completing measures of RS and SA, children participated in an intergroup simulation in which they were accepted or unambiguously versus ambiguously rejected by their group. Findings indicated that whereas ambiguously rejected children understood that they had been rejected, they nevertheless retained greater in-group identification and more positive attitudes than the rejected children, although less than the accepted children. However, as with rejected participants, ambiguously rejected children still opted to change groups whereas accepted children did not. SA children liked the in-group less, whereas those with SA liked the in-group more. Discussion focused on children's selection of peer groups, as well as the effects of their rejection from them.              [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - To be respected and to respect: The challenge of mutual respect in intergroup relations
AN  - 1541997883; 201426822
AB  - Building on theorizing in social and political philosophy the article illuminates the phenomenology of respect and examines its role in intergroup relations. The particular focus is on members of the gay and lesbian community in Germany, their respect experiences, and how these experiences relate to their attitudes towards Muslims. We predicted and found that the experience of being respected in society primarily reflected perceived recognition of gays and lesbians as equal members of society. In addition, we predicted and found that perceived respect from the Muslim community was negatively related to anti-Muslim attitude among gays and lesbians. The same was true for perceived respect from society at large. More specifically, respondents who felt respected by the majority of society showed lower levels of anti-Muslim attitude and, in line with the dominant status of perceived equality recognition in the experience of being respected, this decrease was fully mediated via an increase in perceived equality recognition.

T1  - An Intergenerational Model of Spatial Assimilation in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia
AN  - 1531932742; 201423265
AB  - This study uses data from the 2011 Australian census to test a spatial assimilation model of intergenerational concentration and dispersion involving 40 ethnic groups in Sydney and Melbourne. Multivariate statistical techniques are used to examine how acculturation and socio-economic characteristics predict ethnic residential concentration, measured by the index of dissimilarity. Findings support the thesis that ethnic clustering and dispersion reflect immigrant cultural and socio-economic adjustment to Australian life. Ethnic residential concentration is explained by Australian nativity, immigrant duration of residence, English proficiency, educational qualifications and unemployment. Findings are supported by a threshold analysis, which identifies a declining tendency, from the first to later generations, to live in areas of high coethnic concentration. An examination of outlier groups finds that unexplained factors appear to be slowing the spatial assimilation process for a few groups, consistent with a pluralism scenario. A major contribution of this study is its analysis of multiple ethnic groups across three generations and three time-of-arrival immigrant cohorts. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1767328573; 201605964
AB  - This research uses standard survey items and vignettes from a recent web survey to examine the interaction of race/ethnicity, sex, and attitudes about science -- an elite domain in the US class system. The focus is on the science attitudes of young Asian Americans. Findings from standard survey questions show variation across Asian American ethnic groups on perceptions of science. They also reveal race and sex patterns involving a hierarchy of science attitudes with Asian American males at the top and White females at the bottom. Results from standard survey items and vignettes on similar issues show divergence. Asian American respondents often see more positive attitudes about science for the individual like them in the vignette than for self. Recommendations for policy are provided.

T1  - Political Theories of Low-Wage Work
AN  - 1551000434; 201428851
AB  - This article explores the concept of low-wage work in America as presented in the political science literature with the goal of developing a theoretical framework. Based on traditional political theory, contemporary political perspectives, and public opinion, a modern political conceptualization of low-wage work represents a balance between policies that promote work as virtuous and those that present it as a form of social control. This balance is informed by historical notions of work, contemporary issues of racism, the economic realities of single mothers, and public perceptions of welfare and income support measures, such as the federal Earned Income Tax Credit.

T1  - Ethnic identity in post-Soviet Belarus: ethnolinguistic survival as an argument in the political struggle
AN  - 1512220861; 201408760
AB  - This article discusses the Belarusian case of post-communist development and the role and status of Belarusian ethnicity in Belarus' nation-formation process. 'Nationalizing nationalism' (Brubaker), as realised by the Belarusian state through various social and cultural practices, is aimed at the creation of a Belarusian national entity without reference to the ethnocultural core of Belarusians. As a result of the nationalising practices of the Belarusian state, most Belarusians identify with their nation-state while displaying weak identification with ethnicity. At the same time, the recent dynamic of patterns of self-perception in Belarusian society can be interpreted as the beginning of a gradual 'heating' of the ethnocultural vitality of Belarusians, which is occurring under the impact of the agency of elites. Ethnolinguistic survival and vitality in this context can be viewed both as an argument in the struggle between different forces on the political arena and a factor contributing to victory in the rivalry between them. In this context, the phenomenon of 'ethnic temperature' can be analysed not only from the perspective of its impact on group vitality and survival, but also as a phenomenon dependent on various political, cultural and historical factors.

T1  - Reconsidering predictors of punitiveness in Australia: A test of four theories
AN  - 1559007437; 201434086
AB  - This study assesses and compares, in an Australian context, four explanations which have emerged to explain punitive attitudes. Each purports these attitudes have different origins: concerns over crime and a lack of trust in the state to deal with it ('crime-distrust' model); a desire to reinforce social cohesion or express discontent with society ('social discontent' model); an outlet for dissatisfaction over one's own life ('personal discontent' model); and a wish to suppress or express prejudice towards disliked racial minorities ('racial animus' model). The study finds support for each of the crime-distrust, social discontent and racial animus models (but not the personal discontent model). Despite rarely being considered in Australia, it also suggest that social discontent and racial animus may have as great, if not greater, an impact on punitiveness as concerns over crime and the state's response to it.

T1  - The Latino Assumption: A Research Note
AN  - 1364703420; 201323544
AB  - The Latino assumption refers to the presumption that individuals residing in the United States and its commonwealths who have descended from Latin American countries and Spain constitute a homogeneous panethnic social identity. Inappropriately studying individuals of Latin American and Spanish descent as a homogeneous group in leisure research may result in threats to internal validity, statistical conclusion, and external validity. This article examines these issues and the historical context of the Latino assumption. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - All about us, but never about us: The three-pronged potency of prejudice
AN  - 1417524742; 201331932
AB  - Three points that are implicit in Dixon et al.'s paradigm-challenging paper serve to make prejudice potent. First, prejudice reflects understandings of social identity -- the relationship of "us" to "them" -- that are shared within particular groups. Second, these understandings are actively promoted by leaders who represent and advance in-group identity. Third, prejudice is identified in out-groups, not in-groups.

T1  - Romaphobia Among Serbian Adolescents: The Role of National In-group Attitudes and Perceived Threat
AN  - 1283642562; 201303381
AB  - This study employed the integrated threat theory to examine Serbian adolescents' attitudes towards the Roma. The sample consisted of 687 secondary school students (mean age 17), of whom 53% were females. In a survey-based study, we assessed adolescents' national in-group attitudes (i.e., nationalism), their feelings toward the Roma, and their perception of economic and symbolic threat. Findings suggest that perceived threat to either real resources or worldviews of the dominant group was related to more negative attitudes towards the Roma minority. Further, Romaphobia was positively related to adolescents' nationalism and this relationship was partially mediated by perceived economic and symbolic threat. The theoretical and educational implications are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Abortion, Partial-Birth Abortion, and Adolescent Access to Abortion: An Overview for Social Workers
AN  - 1494299856; 201401862
AB  - Although the U.S Supreme Court Roe v. Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973, intense controversy over access, legality, and morality has persisted ever since that landmark decision. National opinion data collected from 1975 to 2007 show that a majority of Americans support a woman's right to an abortion, but this right is increasingly under attack, and recent proposed changes to abortion access are not in line with how most Americans feel. This paper considers public opinion trends in the sharply divided arenas of abortion, partial-birth abortion, and adolescents' rights to access abortion with a critical eye to social work practice. We explore several opportunities for social workers to advocate for clients, including legislative advocacy, reform through litigation, social action, and social policy analysis.

T1  - Anarchism and the Archaeology of Anarchic Societies: Resistance to Centralization in the Coast Salish Region of the Pacific Northwest Coast
AN  - 1266143650; 201300643
AB  - Throughout human history, people have lived in societies without formalized government. We argue that the theory of anarchism presents a productive framework for analyzing decentralized societies. Anarchism encompasses a broad array of interrelated principles for organizing societies without the centralization of authority. Moreover, its theory of history emphasizes an ongoing and active resistance to concentrations of power. We present an anarchist analysis of the development of social power, authority, and status within the Coast Salish region of the Northwest Coast. Coast Salish peoples exhibited complex displays of chiefly authority and class stratification but without centralized political organization. Ethnographically, their sociopolitical formation is unique in allowing a majority of "high-class" people and a minority of commoners and slaves, or what Wayne Suttles described as an "inverted-pear" society. We present the development of this sociopolitical structure through an analysis of cranial deformation from burial data and assess it in relation to periods of warfare. We determine that many aspects of Coast Salish culture include practices that resist concentrations of power. Our central point is that anarchism is useful for understanding decentralized (or anarchic) networks -- those that allow for complex intergroup relations while staving off the establishment of centralized political authority.

AN  - 1125225081; 201240920
AB  - This article examines how ethnicity is created, maintained, and perpetuated in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Research studies on ethnicity in the Israeli army have examined ethnicity while focusing on the macro, emphasizing the way the structure and the policy of the army, alongside its reciprocal relations with the greater society and the state, maintain and reproduce ethnicity. It focuses on the micro point of view, hitherto neglected, which emphasizes the soldiers' experience and interpretation. Using a case study of two Israeli infantry brigades, the article demonstrates how ethnicity is produced, maintained, and reproduced by individuals through practices, behavior, perceptions, and observations.

T1  - Name change and destigmatization among Middle Eastern immigrants in Sweden
AN  - 1037875354; 201231016
AB  - Research has shown that individuals in Sweden with foreign-sounding surnames who take on more Swedish-sounding or neutral surnames have a positive earnings progression compared to individuals who keep their foreign-sounding names. This article explores the strategies underlying these surname changes. I draw on forty-five interviews from a population of individuals with Middle Eastern backgrounds who changed surnames during the 1990s. Drawing on stigma and destigmatization theory, I argue that immigrant name change, a strategy typically associated with cultural assimilation, is a destigmatization strategy aiming for pragmatic assimilation. Through passing (as either Swedish or non-Middle Eastern), immigrants may keep the benefits of maintaining ethnic identity in their private life and the benefits of more easy public interactions outside the ethnic group. This study also illustrates how the institutional enabling of name change both creates and enables pragmatic assimilation. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - African and Black Caribbean origin cancer survivors: a qualitative study of the narratives of causes, coping and care experiences
AN  - 1520336209; 201419621
AB  - Objectives. Although there is evidence in the USA and UK to suggest that ethnic minority groups have an inferior experience of cancer care, few studies investigate ethnic disparities in satisfaction and care experiences among survivors. Patients' illness perceptions (lay explanations for illness) and coping styles (emotional and behavioural) are influenced by ethnicity-related cultural beliefs and expectations. Depressive illness or fears of recurrence of cancer may also lead to poorer recovery and function. This paper investigates whether ethnic influences explain different coping behaviours, care experiences and help-seeking behaviours. Design. Eight participants of African or Black Caribbean origin were recruited from a London support group for a series of qualitative in-depth interviews. The interviews were recorded and transcribed, and the transcripts analysed using a framework method of qualitative data analysis. The emergent themes were tested and documented to reflect the issues of importance to patients. Results. Lay explanations of causes of cancer were complex and diverse reflecting cultural influences and the impact of contact with health professionals. Generally, positive views about cancer care were found, especially at the secondary care level. Primary care attracted mixed views. In contrast to American studies, no acknowledgement of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity was reported. The need to be resilient and think positively were widely acknowledged as coping strategies. Some coped by avoiding contemplation of their condition or diagnosis. Religious beliefs and practices provided coping mechanisms for some, and a means to improve confidence and avoid distressing contemplation about their condition. Family, friends and charitable groups also provided emotional and practical support. Conclusions. Subjects were generally satisfied with their care; different coping styles included positive attitudes, minimisation of difficulties or more realistic consideration of the impact of cancer.

T1  - Risk And Consumer Debt Behaviors In China
AN  - 1438549899; 201340076
AB  - We investigated the risk and debt behaviors of adult consumers in China (N = 347), and explored the relationships among risk perception, risk preference, and consumer debt. The results of hierarchical regression analysis showed that risk perception, risk seeking, and risk aversion can predict consumer debt. Individuals perceiving high levels of risk were less likely to have positive attitudes toward debt behavior, whereas individuals with high risk-seeking preferences held positive attitudes toward debt behavior. Risk aversion was also found to be an ineffective predictor of debt behavior. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Unveiling The Web Of Race, Class, Language, And Gender Oppression: Challenges For Social Justice Educators
AN  - 1347781231; 201318854
AB  - There is often a tendency to focus on one form of oppression and pay less attention to, or leave others out, despite the fact that a vast body of research shows that all forms of oppression are interconnected. This paper aims to counter this tendency that has been circulated in the mainstream media as well as in institutions such as schools. Specifically, drawing on the scholarly work of feminist, socio-cultural, and critical race theorists, this paper critically examines the effects of intersectional oppression on people, particularly those who have been pushed to the margins because of their targeted social identities, and proposes alternative ways to combat these forms of oppression.

T1  - Ethnic and Panethnic Asian American Identities: Contradictory Perceptions of Cambodian Students in Urban Schools
AN  - 1081864794; 201235203
AB  - This article examined the various ethnic identities of Cambodian students, a group often perceived by the larger society through the lens of the model minority stereotype but often endure low expectations from teachers and counselors in their local high schools. Our findings suggested that a Cambodian identity was often considered a stigmatized label and students identified as Cambodian were essentialized into the discourse of urban low achieving and culturally deficient minority students. Cambodian students' identities in the less selective academic programs were often quite visible to teachers. This characterization was often coupled with a panethnic representation of Asian American students in selective programs who were considered motivated and supported by advantageous home and cultural values. In these contexts, teachers preferred to discuss Cambodian students in panethnic terms, ignoring students' ethnic backgrounds, described their Cambodian students as part of their "bright Asian students" group. Overall, this study extends other works on Asian American ethnicity and panethnicity by focusing on the conflicting identities that affect the schooling of Cambodian students. These analyses complicate further the static notion of Asian American students as model minorities by emphasizing the fluid, problematic, and contextually-based nature of the construct.

T1  - Protestant work ethic's relation to intergroup and policy attitudes: A meta-analytic review
AN  - 1018342780; 201212787
AB  - The Protestant work ethic (PWE), the belief that hard work leads to success, is prevalent in many cultures and has been related to negative attitudes toward disadvantaged groups (prejudice) and social policies targeting them. Given recent theorizing and findings suggesting that PWE is not necessarily associated with prejudice among all people or in all contexts, this meta-analysis examined the direction and strength of PWE's relation to prejudice (37 eligible studies) and policy attitudes (16 studies) among published and unpublished studies across 38 years. Results revealed not only significant positive relationships between PWE and both types of intergroup attitudes but also significant moderators of these relationships. There were significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both prejudice and policy attitudes among samples in Western countries (Canada, England, New Zealand, USA), and marginally significantly larger effect sizes for PWE's relationship with both types of attitudes the older the mean age of the sample (within Western countries). PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes also varied by the target group of the attitudes. Findings support a more nuanced view of PWE's relationship with intergroup attitudes, suggesting that PWE does not always promote greater prejudice; rather its consequences are culture and context bound.

T1  - Representing Race: Ongoing Uncertainties about Finnish American Racial Identity
AN  - 905072427
AB  - Kivisto and Leinonen discuss the ongoing uncertainties about Finnish American Racial Identity. On Sep 9, 1907, John Svan, a miner living and working in Eveleth MN, applied to become a naturalized citizen of the US. Svan was born in Noormarkku, Finland, in 1874, and he had immigrated to the US in 1900. He had applied for his first papers in 1904 and had every reason to assume that as the process proceeded, he would within a few years become a citizen of his new homeland. He--and, indeed, the larger Finnish community--did not anticipate a challenge to his application based on the racial identity of Finnish immigrants. Finns would have found themselves in a list of groups that had lost their own legal battles in the US courts to become naturalized citizens, groups that included the Chinese, Burmese, Koreans, Hawaiians, Arabs, and East Indians. The conclusion of the Svan case should be seen in light of the often contradictory and convoluted nature of racialist thought-both in the form of scientific racism and in public opinion.

T1  - Men and Their Father Figures: Exploring Racial and Ethnic Differences in Mental Health Outcomes
AN  - 1081862980; 201235396
AB  - Though gender, racial, and ethnic disparities in health in the United States are well documented, it is less clear how these factors intersect to produce patterns of mental health outcomes among men. This study examined the presence of father figures in the lives of African American, Caribbean black and non-Hispanic white American males until the age of 16; assessed the current socio-demographic factors of these men as adults; and explored whether these factors lead to variations in mental health outcomes. Regression models were used to examine the correlates of socio-demographic, psychosocial, and retrospective father figure measures for depressive symptoms and non-specific psychological distress among African American (n = 999), Caribbean black (n = 506), and non-Hispanic white men (n = 193) from the National Survey of American Life. Findings revealed racial and ethnic group differences by age, employment status, education, and household income on depressive symptoms (measured using the CES-D scale) and non-specific psychological distress (using the Kessler-6 scale). Findings suggested that being raised by a grandfather placed both African American and Caribbean black men at greater risk for depressive symptoms and non-specific psychological distress under certain socio-demographic conditions. This study is unique in that it considers the influence of father figures on the mental health outcomes of adult males across three racial and ethnic groups. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for future mental health research and practice with men of color. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Intergroup Conflict in Russia: Testing the Group Position Model
AN  - 1882867598
AB  - The group position model (Blumer 1958; Bobo and Tuan 2006) assumes that attempting to secure a privileged position for the ingroup is a main determinant of perceived intergroup conflict. This assumption is tested with survey data collected in 1999 and 2000 among eight titular groups in autonomous republics of the Russian Federation. The survey included an experiment that was aimed at disentangling the effects of perceived threat and the fear of outgroup encroachment (growing outgroup influence). The findings indicate that more conflict was perceived when the ingroup was larger (corresponding to stronger entitlement claims to privilege), especially among those who felt more threatened. This association was further strengthened among those whose fear of outgroup encroachment was made salient. This study shows the relevance of the group position model in understanding perceived intergroup conflict among national minority groups with a local privileged status.

T1  - Sons of the Soil, Migrants, and Civil War
AN  - 856403733; 201106869
AB  - In nearly a third of ethnic civil wars since 1945, the conflict develops between members of a regional ethnic group that considers itself to be the indigenous asons of the soila and recent migrants from other parts of the country. The migrants are typically members of the dominant ethnic group who migrate in search of land or government jobs, often supported by the state with economic incentives and development schemes. This paper elaborates on the concept of a sons-of-the-soil conflict; presents descriptive statistics and empirical patterns; identifies a typical escalation sequence; illustrates the several steps with an account of the Tamil-Sinhalese conflict along with other cases; discusses the obstacles to negotiated settlements; and concludes with a suggestion on the role of grievances in explaining civil war onsets.

T1  - Not Quite Color Blind: Ethnic and Gender Differences in Attitudes toward Older People among College Students
AN  - 1364699852; 201326861
AB  - Attitudes toward older people can influence how they are treated and their cognitive and physical health. The populations of the United States and many other countries have become more ethnically diverse, and are aging. Yet little research examines how ethnic diversity affects attitudes toward older people. Our study addresses this research gap. Using the Aging Semantic Differential, 592 university students expressed their attitudes toward older African-American, Hispanic, and White women and men. Repeated measures analysis of variance examined attitude differences by participant ethnicity and gender, and by the ethnicity and gender of evaluated individuals. Both African-American and White students had more positive attitudes toward older women and men of their own ethnic group. Participants had more positive attitudes toward older women than they did toward older men. Findings suggest in-group favoritism, and the usefulness of training those in service industries and public service to treat older individuals equitably. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - TOWARD A PROGRESSIVE DEMOCRATIC POLITICS OF RACE
AN  - 1010630342; 201210605
AB  - The two books that have occasioned this symposium represent efforts to research thoroughly, think rigorously, and argue honestly about complex and significant issues of race and ethnicity in America. There is much to be learned from them on many topics. I read them chiefly for insights about whether and how a defensibly democratic politics of egalitarian change can be achieved by, for, and with racial minorities in a country whose majorities, like most majorities, have long been reluctant to pursue policies that did not predominantly benefit themselves. I raise some challenges to the perspectives offered in these books, but only as an effort, kindred in aim if not achievement, to carry forward the work they have thus far so nobly advanced.

AN  - 818802956; 201072508
AB  - Data from a study of Russian young people show they are tolerant of different ethnic groups if they are acquaintances and friends. When considering marriage with someone from a different ethnic group, however, most respondents stated that ethnicity is an important negative factor in determining their choice. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Health Divide: Economic and Demographic Factors Associated with Self-Reported Health Among Older Malaysians
AN  - 1322718751; 201310762
AB  - Data from the 2004 Survey of Economic and Financial Aspects of Aging in Malaysia were analyzed to determine factors associated with self-reported health status among older Malaysians. Odds of self-reporting health as bad versus moderate or good were higher for respondents who were in lower income quintiles, who perceived their financial situation as bad, who were older and who were not married. Malay, Chinese, Indian, and Bumiputra ethnic groups had lower odds of perceiving their health to be bad as compared with those in other ethnic groups. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Perceived Climate in Physical Activity Settings
AN  - 758122012; 201056949
AB  - This study focused on the perceived climate for LGBT youth and other minority groups in physical activity settings. A large sample of undergraduates and a selected sample including student teachers/interns and a campus Pride group completed a school climate survey and rated the climate in three physical activity settings (physical education, organized sport, exercise). Overall, school climate survey results paralleled the results with national samples revealing high levels of homophobic remarks and low levels of intervention. Physical activity climate ratings were mid-range, but multivariate analysis of variation test (MANOVA) revealed clear differences with all settings rated more inclusive for racial/ethnic minorities and most exclusive for gays/lesbians and people with disabilities. The results are in line with national surveys and research suggesting sexual orientation and physical characteristics are often the basis for harassment and exclusion in sport and physical activity. The current results also indicate that future physical activity professionals recognize exclusion, suggesting they could benefit from programs that move beyond awareness to skills and strategies for creating more inclusive programs.

T1  - How social experience is related to children's intergroup attitudes
AN  - 743066892; 201043101
AB  - Intergroup attitudes were assessed in 7 and 10 years old European American and African American children from ethnically heterogeneous schools and in 7 and 10 years old European American children from ethnically homogeneous schools in order to test hypotheses about racial biases and judgments regarding cross-race peer interactions (N = 302). Using an Ambiguous Situations Task, the findings revealed that European American children attending homogeneous schools displayed racial bias in their interpretations of ambiguous situations as well as in their evaluations of cross-race friendship. Bias was not found, however, in the interpretations and evaluations of European American or African American children from heterogeneous schools. This study is the first to empirically demonstrate significant and direct relationships between intergroup contact in the school environment and children's intergroup biases as well as judgments about the potential for cross-race friendships.

T1  - Linking Integration and Residential Segregation
AN  - 60323905; 201011836
AB  - In the introduction to this special issue of JEMS, we question the strong link which is often made between the integration of minority ethnic groups and their residential segregation. In the literature on neighbourhood effects, the residential concentration of minorities is seen as a major obstacle to their integration, while the residential segregation literature emphasises the opposite causal direction, by focusing on the effect of integration on levels of (de-)segregation. The papers in this special issue, however, indicate that integration and segregation cannot be linked in a straightforward way. Policy discourses tend to depict residential segregation in a negative light, but the process of assimilation into the housing market is highly complex and differs between and within ethnic groups. The integration pathway not only depends on the characteristics of migrants themselves, but also on the reactions of the institutions and the population of the receiving society.
