T1  - An Investigation of the Relationship Between Cross-Race Friendships and Attraction
AN  - 2666836797
AB  - Four studies investigated the link between cross-race friendships and attraction. In Study 1, White Australian participants (N = 240) who reported friendships with racial outgroup members were more likely to report attraction to the members of the racial group their friends belonged to. Studies 2a (N = 300 White American participants) and 2b (N = 303 White British participants) showed that experiences of cross-race non-verbal intimacy, perceived cross-race reciprocity in attraction, positive perceived ingroup norms about dating cross-racially, and warmth toward the racial outgroup were particularly important in explaining the friendship–attraction link in majority samples. Study 3 (N = 292 Black British participants) showed that in addition to the mediators above, self-disclosure was key to explaining the friendship–attraction link for racial minority group members. These findings extend the contact literature by exploring the specificity and mediators of the link between contact and attraction in the context of race relations.

T1  - The vicarious effects of hate: inter-ethnic hate crime in the neighborhood and its consequences for exclusion and anticipated rejection
AN  - 2647922701
AB  - Hate crime victimization is harmful for victims and those who share the victim’s identity. It may also be harmful for the broader community. Yet, few studies focus on the ripple effects of hate. This paper examines how secondary exposure to hate crime in the neighborhood, through witnessing or hearing about hate crime, influences individual perceptions of ethnic minorities, which in turn can harm social relations. Findings reveal that those who witness hate crime express greater anger towards ethnic minorities. Those who rely on second-hand information about hate crime in the community are more likely to anticipate rejection on the basis of their ethnicity, hold negative attitudes towards ethnic migrants and intend to take actions to exclude new migrants from their communities when compared to those who do not have such information. These findings have implications for community cohesion in multi-ethnic neighborhoods.

T1  - Inequality and Misperceptions of Group Concerns Threaten the Integrity and Societal Impact of Science
AN  - 2660577556
AB  - Racial and ethnic minority and lower-income groups are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards and suffer worse health outcomes than other groups in the United States. Relative to whites and higher-income groups, racial-ethnic minority and lower-income Americans also frequently express greater concern about high-profile global environmental threats like climate change, but they are widely misperceived as being less concerned about these issues than white and higher-income Americans. We use new survey research to explore public perceptions of COVID-19—another global threat marked by substantial racial, ethnic, and class disparities—finding a distinct pattern of misperceptions regarding groups’ concerns. We then discuss how these misperceptions represent a unique form of social misinformation that may pose a threat to science and undermine the cooperation and trust needed to address collective problems.

T1  - Leisure attitude, stress-related growth, and quality of life during COVID-19-related social distancing
AN  - 2630532991
AB  - The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and related restrictive measures have impacted on leisure activities globally; South Korea is no exception. In this cross-sectional study we identified the need to increase leisure opportunities during social distancing and respond to changes in leisure activities post-COVID-19. The leisure attitude, stress-related growth, and quality of life of 260 participants were examined via an online survey. Data were analyzed through structural equation modeling. Results show that during social distancing, leisure attitude was positively associated with stress-related growth, leisure attitude was not significantly associated with quality of life, and stress-related growth was positively associated with quality of life. From a long-term perspective, as leisure activities can improve stress-related growth and quality of life, education and related discussions must continue to ensure that people hold a positive attitude toward leisure participation.

T1  - Is LGBT progress seen as an attack on Christians?: Examining Christian/sexual orientation zero-sum beliefs
AN  - 2622619429
AB  - As social policies have changed to grant more rights to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals, some Christians in the United States have suggested that LGBT rights impede Christians' religious freedom. Across five studies, we examined the causes and consequences of zero-sum beliefs (ZSBs) about Christians and LGBT individuals. We demonstrate that Christians' beliefs about conflict with sexual minorities are shaped by their understandings of Christian values, social change, interpretation of the Bible, and in response to religious institutions. In Study 1, heterosexual cisgender Christians endorsed ZSBs more than other groups. Christians reported perceiving that anti-LGBT bias has decreased over time while anti-Christian bias has correspondingly increased. In Study 2, Christians' zero-sum beliefs increased after they reflected on religious values, suggesting that intergroup conflict is seen as being a function of Christian beliefs. Study 3 confirmed the role of symbolic threat in driving ZSBs; perceived conflict was accentuated when Christians read about a changing cultural climate in which Christians' influence is waning. An intervention using Biblical scripture to encourage acceptance successfully lowered zero-sum beliefs for mainline but not fundamentalist Christians (Study 4). A final field study examined how ZSBs predict sexual prejudice in response to changing group norms. After a special conference in which the United Methodist Church voted to restrict LGBT people from marriage and serving as clergy, zero-sum beliefs became a stronger predictor of sexual prejudice (Study 5). We discuss the implications of Christian/LGBT ZSBs for religious freedom legislation, attitudes toward sexual minorities, and intergroup conflict more generally.

T1  - Shared disadvantage as a determinant of the relationship between White Americans’ socioeconomic status and racial/ethnic prejudice
AN  - 2623504364
AB  - The present studies examined the conditions under which low subjective socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with greater racial/ethnic prejudice among White Americans. Using theories of intergroup threat and inclusive victim consciousness, we predicted that describing racial/ethnic minorities as disadvantaged (vs. as competitive or in neutral terms) would increase empathy and reduce prejudice among White Americans who consider themselves low in SES. Study 1 provided correlational evidence that White Americans who perceived themselves as low‐SES (but not high‐SES) were less prejudiced against racial/ethnic minorities the more they perceived minorities as disadvantaged. In Study 2, portraying the target outgroup (Arab immigrants) as disadvantaged increased outgroup empathy, and in turn reduced prejudice, among participants induced to think of themselves as low‐SES. Study 3 conceptually replicated these results using a different outgroup (Mexican Americans) and a behavioral measure of prejudice. Implications for reducing prejudice among White Americans of different socioeconomic backgrounds are discussed.

T1  - Public stigma towards informal caregiving in Germany: a descriptive study
AN  - 2554900488
AB  - ObjectivesThis study aims to investigate the public stigma towards informal caregivers of individuals aged 65 years and older in the German population.MethodIn an Online-Survey 1038 participants (18 years and older and living in Germany) were sampled using a quota-system based on the German micro census data. To assess public stigma towards informal caregiving for individuals aged 65 years and older, three aspects of stigma were assessed: 1) emotional reactions (adapted Emotional Reaction to Mental Illness Scale), 2) behavioral reactions (adapted Social Distance Scale), and 3) cognitive reactions (newly developed List of Cognitions regarding informal caregiving). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted for the development and adaptation of the three instruments, and their composite reliability is provided.ResultsEmotional reactions in terms of devaluing feelings and feelings of misery were low, while appreciative feelings were neither low nor high. Reported social distance was low. Agreement with cognitions towards informal care in terms of devaluing and accusative cognitions was on average low, but high regarding appreciative cognitions.ConclusionThe results show that there is stigma towards informal caregiving for older individuals (65 years and older) in terms of emotional reactions, cognitions and social distance, although the magnitude of this stigma seems to be small. Knowledge regarding the occurrence and magnitude of stigma, as well as the processes that underlie this, is needed to prevent stigmatization and its negative outcomes, or at the very least, to enable the development of support for the affected individuals.

T1  - Too many immigrants: How does local diversity contribute to attitudes toward immigration?
AN  - 2524143114
AB  - This paper investigates the link between residential context, perceptions and attitudes toward immigrants by linking data from the British Election Study with Census statistics on composition of electoral constituencies in 2001 and 2011. I consider which type of local diversity is most salient for natives’ attitudes by combining information on ethnicity, religion and skills. Second, I look at whether base levels of and changes in local diversity affect anti-immigration attitudes in the same way. I find that immigration is more salient when defined by ethnic criteria, rather than criteria that combine ethnicity and religion or skills. Anti-immigrant attitudes are more likely to be expressed by natives who live in constituencies where there has been a large change in diversity between 2001 and 2011, but these responses depend on initial diversity levels. For non-whites and skilled ethnic minorities higher residential segregation is associated with more negative attitudes toward immigrants among natives.

T1  - Homeownership Intention among Igbo Ethnic Group in Ilorin
AN  - 2603456631
AB  - The extant literature has previously shown that attitude towards homeownership and pressure from reference groups may significantly affect individual's homeownership intention especially in many western societies. The authors assumed that Nigerian citizens might also have similar experience especially for non-indigenes living and working in states in geo-political zones outside their own ethnic areas. The study surveyed 300 members of Igbo ethnic group residents in Ilorin metropolis. Simple random sampling method was adopted and data was gathered through structured questionnaire. The authors questioned participants about their attitude and intention towards owning personal home in the city. They also asked participants to relate to questions about the perceived easiness to acquire properties for personal use in the city and about the social (families' and relatives') pressure on their homeownership intention. Analytical techniques include simple frequency and percentage distributions, pearson chi-square and independent t-test. Research findings show that while many sampled participants have positive attitude towards homeownership in Ilorin, length of stay in the city, level of education and the perceived control affect homeownership intention among the participants. A surprising result was that subjective norms appear to exert little or no influence on participants' homeownership intention. Hence, the finding demonstrates the interactive nature of social influence/personal norms dimension in homeownership through availability of and access to information and sources of homeownership funding.Alternate abstract:La littérature existante a déjà montré que l'attitude envers l'accession à la propriété et la pression des groupes de référence peuvent affecter de manière significative l'intention d'accession à la propriété d'un individu, en particulier dans de nombreuses sociétés occidentales. Les auteurs ont supposé que les citoyens nigérians pourraient également avoir une expérience similaire, en particulier pour les non-indigènes vivant et travaillant dans des États situés dans des zones géopolitiques en dehors de leurs propres zones ethniques. L'étude a interrogé 300 membres du groupe ethnique Igbo résidant dans la métropole d'Ilorin. Une méthode d'échantillonnage aléatoire simple a été adoptée et les données ont été recueillies au moyen d'un questionnaire structuré. Les auteurs ont interrogé les participants sur leur attitude et leur intention de posséder une maison personnelle dans la ville. Ils ont également demandé aux participants de se rapporter à des questions sur la facilité perçue d'acquérir des propriétés à usage personnel dans la ville et sur la pression sociale (familles et proches) sur leur intention d'accession à la propriété. Les techniques analytiques comprennent des distributions simples de fréquence et de pourcentage, le chi carré de Pearson et le test t indépendant. Les résultats de la recherche montrent que si de nombreux participants échantillonnés ont une attitude positive envers l'accession à la propriété à Ilorin, la durée du séjour dans la ville, le niveau d'éducation et le contrôle perçu affectent l'intention d'accession à la propriété chez les participants. Un résultat surprenant est que les normes subjectives semblent exercer peu ou pas d'influence sur l'intention des participants d'accéder à la propriété. Par conséquent, les résultats démontrent la nature interactive de la dimension influence sociale/normes personnelles dans l'accession à la propriété grâce à la disponibilité et à l'accès à l'information et aux sources de financement pour l'accession à la propriété.

T1  - Radical Self-Representation in a Hostile Setting: Discursive Strategies of the Russian Lesbian Feminist Movement
AN  - 2507921656
AB  - Today, internet provides opportunities for solidarization and collective action to initiative groups of social movements, including those of high degree of radicalism. For radical groups, language continues to be a crucial instrument through which social movements influence public attitudes. In this article, we analyze discursive strategies that the radical social movement (RSM) of Russian lesbian feminism uses to shape its image among the out-group and in-group publics. To identify the strategies of RSM self-representation, we employ semi-structured interviewing, qualitative content analysis, discourse analysis, and semantic network visualization. We find that, in a hostile anti-LGBT legal and discursive environment, self-representation of lesbian feminists is mostly linked to issues of aggression, violence, and systemic social, political, and legal constraints, unlike in the United States; it is also based on separation from the wider society and dehumanization of bearers of patriarchal views.

T1  - I (dis)like the way you (dis)like them: The role of extended contact on social distance and attitudes towards the ingroup
AN  - 2474519535
AB  - While extended intergroup contact has been commonly studied in the context of prejudice reduction, less is known about its implications for processes related to the ingroup. Through three correlational and one experimental studies (total N = 897) conducted in two different intergroup contexts (Turkey and United Kingdom), we investigated whether extended intergroup contact relates to social distance and attitudes towards ingroup members as a function of outgroup attitudes. We also investigated ingroup identification and perceived ingroup morality as potential mediators in these associations. Correlational studies demonstrated that especially when outgroup attitudes were more negative, participants’ positive (but not negative) extended contact was related to a more negative evaluation of the ingroup; whereas when outgroup attitudes were more positive, extended contact was associated with positive attitudes towards the ingroup. We found experimental evidence for the suggested relationships in relation to ingroup social distance. Findings are discussed in the light of vicarious dissonance theory and deprovincialization hypothesis.

T1  - Accuracy and bias in perceptions of racial attitudes: Implications for interracial relationships
AN  - 2485544220
AB  - The current research examined accuracy and bias in racial metaperceptions-perceptions of others' attitudes toward one's racial group-within the context of interracial relationships, as well as implications of these metaperceptions for the quality of interracial relationships. Two dyadic studies of interracial relationships involving Black and White participants suggest that racial metaperceptions were partly accurate, related to relationship partners' racial attitudes. In addition, 3 distinct biases in racial metaperceptions were identified, including assumed reciprocity (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their partners' racial group are reciprocated by those partners), projection (i.e., perceivers assuming their attitudes toward their own group are shared by partners), and confirmation bias (i.e., perceivers viewing partners' racial attitudes in ways that are consistent with their chronic expectations about being the target of prejudice). In turn, both accurate and biased racial metaperceptions appeared to have implications for the quality of interracial relationships, including relationship satisfaction, perceived regard, relationship commitment, and prosocial behavior. Implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - Racial Stratification and the Confederate Flag: Comparing Four Perspectives to Explain Flag Support
AN  - 2423651398
AB  - Recent events have brought attention to Confederate monuments positioned across the USA and polarized debates about their proper placement; however, prior research examining support for Confederate symbols is largely limited to white Americans. This study examines public support for the South Carolina Confederate flag using four perspectives of racial stratification—black/nonblack, combined race-ethnicity, ethnoracial pentagon, and nonwhite/white. Using data from two nationally representative surveys of noninstitutionalized US adults collected in 2000 and 2015 (n = 7638), we identify associations between theories of racial stratification and Confederate flag stances. Multiple model fit indices indicate that the combined race-ethnicity theory of racial stratification best mapped onto public support followed by the ethnoracial pentagon and black/nonblack perspectives. The nonwhite/white model exhibited the poorest fit. Findings from logistic regressions showed that whites had significantly higher odds of supporting the Confederate flag compared to blacks and Latinos. Additionally, blacks had lower odds of flag support than Latinos, Asian Americans, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders, and multiracial respondents. We argue that an overlooked aspect of Confederate monuments is their signified antiblackness demonstrated in this study by greater support for the flag among all nonblack racial-ethnic groups. Findings imply that prioritizing whites’ views in discussions of Confederate monuments offers an inadequate depiction of public opinion by race-ethnicity. Disaggregating views via the combined race-ethnicity measure highlights racial-ethnic variation in support of the South Carolina Confederate flag.

T1  - Beyond dislike: Blatant dehumanization predicts teacher discrimination: GPIR
AN  - 2407985297
AB  - School teachers have been shown to favor ethnic majority over minority students. However, it is unclear what psychological processes motivate ethnicity-based discrimination. Of the studies that have examined the psychological roots of teacher discrimination, most have focused on implicit or explicit prejudice. We propose an alternate predictor: dehumanization. Using a within-subject paradigm with a small-scale experiment (N = 29) and a larger scale replication (N = 161), we find that Hungarian preservice teachers consistently discriminate against Roma minority students by recommending that they be denied entry to higher track secondary schools, and preferentially placing them into lower track schools, relative to equally qualified ethnic majority Hungarian students, and that the severity of the ethnic tracking bias is predicted by dehumanization (but not prejudice). In fact, the relationship between dehumanization and discrimination holds (and may be significantly stronger) for teachers who express the lowest levels of prejudice towards the Roma.

T1  - Bringing together humanistic and intergroup perspectives to build a model of internalisation of normative social harmdoing
AN  - 2384449461
AB  - This article introduces a model of the internalisation of normative social harmdoing: the MINSOH. This model seeks to explain how group members internalise harmful social norms such that they personally endorse their groups' normative actions. To this aim, the MINSOH integrates two divergent yet complementary theoretical perspectives: self‐determination theory and the social identity approach. These perspectives differ in their basic assumptions about the possibility for harm to become internalised, yet when integrated, they provide a powerful account of how harmdoing can become internalised. The MINSOH proposes specific conditions under which harmful normative actions become accepted by group members. This article outlines multiple self‐determined motivations for harmdoing and discrete group processes that enable harmdoing to be internalised and autonomously enacted, and reviews factors that facilitate (i.e., strong/unique/comparative social identification; endorsement of ideological justifications) and block the internalisation process (presence of multiple identities/diverging norms; inclusive superordinate identity). Directions for future research are then discussed.

T1  - Spontaneous imagined contact and intergroup relations: Quality matters
AN  - 2341199376
AB  - While research on experimental interventions that aim to improve outgroup attitudes via contact imagery grows, it is important to examine if contact imagery that occurs in spontaneous, non‐experimentally controlled conditions drives attitudes, and in what direction. To answer this, we constructed and validated a spontaneous imagined intergroup contact scale (SIICS) that differentiates between frequency, quality and elaboration of the spontaneous imagery of outgroups. In three correlational studies (NPortugal = 305, NUnited Kingdom = 185, NItaly = 276), we tested the role of spontaneous imagined contact frequency, quality and elaboration in predicting attitudes and social distance (Studies 1–3) and intended behaviour (Study 3) toward immigrant groups. Results demonstrated that spontaneous imagined contact quality consistently predicted key outcome variables above and beyond the other two dimensions. Importantly, the effects were significant while controlling for other potent forms of direct and indirect contact. Implications of the findings for theory and practice are discussed.

T1  - One of us? How leaders can use subtle identity performances to build trust among ingroups and outgroups: GPIR
AN  - 2330294716
AB  - Leaders often face the dilemma of earning trust among different subgroups. How can leaders “reach across the aisle” to build trust among outgroup members without alienating their own ingroup in the process? We suggest one solution is for leaders to couple their efforts to appeal to the outgroup with subtle identity performances, behavioral cues that ingroup members understand as prototypical, but that are effectively invisible to outgroup members who are not familiar with ingroup symbols and norms. We conducted an experiment in which we manipulated the leader’s group membership (ingroup or outgroup) and favoritism (ingroup favoritism, outgroup favoritism, or outgroup favoritism with a subtle identity performance). Results show that leaders can maximize their perceived prototypicality, fairness, and trust among the ingroup and outgroup if outgroup favoritism is coupled with a subtle identity performance for the ingroup.

T1  - From Insult to Estrangement and Injury: The Violence of Racist Police Jokes: PROD
AN  - 2300927973
AB  - This article examines racially derogatory police jokes, what we call “racist blue humor,” as discourse that negatively targets and ridicules racial and ethnic minorities as inferior, dangerous, or as objects of symbolic and cultural violence. We argue that racist blue humor fosters the social acceptability of prejudice and discrimination among officers, normalizing a culture of dehumanization that legitimizes structural and direct violence. We analyze illustrative cases of racist blue humor in the light of critical race theory, humor studies, and other work in behavioral science to elaborate this violence and its potential for harm across multiple contexts. Racist blue humor engenders legal estrangement, diminishes protection and representation in law, and heightens exposure to police and other state violence. We conclude with considerations for research and policy, including order-maintenance policing of racist blue humor.

T1  - Are “they” out to get me? A social identity model of paranoia: GPIR
AN  - 2302362322
AB  - This research tests a social identity model of paranoia, building on work showing that identification with social groups is associated with less paranoid thinking. Studies 1 (N = 800) and 2 (N = 779) supported this model, showing that national group identification is associated with lower paranoia. Study 3 (N = 784) added to the literature by probing the mechanisms underlying these relationships, and found that it is through enhanced control and trust that identification is associated with better mental health. Studies 4 (N = 390) and 5 (N = 904) manipulated identification to provide evidence of causality. A minimeta analysis revealed a robust association between national identification and paranoia across the studies, although no association emerged between political identification and paranoia. The results point to the role that lack of social connections can play in underpinning paranoid thinking, and suggest that, as with other mental health issues, the problems caused by paranoia may have a social cure.

T1  - The dynamic emergence of minimal groups: GPIR
AN  - 2302360206
AB  - The minimal group paradigm has consistently shown that people will discriminate to favor their own group over an out-group, even when both groups are created arbitrarily by an experimenter. But will people actually form groups that are so arbitrary? And could something as trivial as a randomly assigned name tag color serve as a fault line during group formation? In this study, we use in vivo behavioral tracking (IBT) to precisely and unobtrusively track samples of participants as they assort repeatedly into groups. We find that participants do form groups on the basis of their randomly assigned name tag colors, but that name tag homophily emerges over time, becoming stronger in subsequent groups. Our results suggest that people are unconsciously or consciously biased toward group similarity, even when similarities are essentially meaningless. Our study has implications for theories of intergroup relations and social identity. It also demonstrates the utility of applying real-time tracking to study group formation.

T1  - “We Look (and Feel) Better Through System-Justifying Lenses”: System-Justifying Beliefs Attenuate the Well-Being Gap Between the Advantaged and Disadvantaged by Reducing Perceptions of Discrimination
AN  - 2267662292
AB  - Low-status groups report lower levels of well-being than do high-status groups. Although system justification theory posits that the endorsement of system-justifying beliefs should decrease this well-being gap, the underlying mechanisms responsible for this hypothesized palliative effect have evaded empirical scrutiny. We address this oversight by arguing that system-justifying beliefs confer palliative benefits upon low-status groups by decreasing perceptions of group-based discrimination. Using nationally representative data from New Zealand (N = 12,959), we demonstrate that ethnic minorities (Study 1a) and women (Study 1b) generally report lower levels of well-being than do New Zealand Europeans and men, respectively. Nevertheless, as hypothesized, these differences were mitigated by the endorsement of ethnic- and gender-specific system justification, respectively. Mediated moderation analyses further revealed that part of the palliative effects of system justification occurred via reductions in perceived group-based discrimination. The implications of these findings for intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - When nonactivists care: Group efficacy mediates the effect of social identification and perceived instability on the legitimacy of collective action: GPIR
AN  - 2229907808
AB  - In recent years, multiple social movements have emerged around the world. In addition, public surveys indicate the highest recorded levels of support for protest. In this context of acceptance of collective action, we examine the role of nonactivists in the perceived legitimacy of social movements, as this “passive” support can contribute to social change. Given that antecedents of legitimacy have been neglected in the literature, we carried out a survey (N = 605) among a general sample of the population in Chile to shed light on this issue. We found that social identification with movements and perceived instability predicted the perceived legitimacy of protests by social movements, and that both variables had only indirect effects through group efficacy. This suggests that perceiving social movements as able to achieve success can lead nonactivists to perceive their actions as legitimate, highlighting the importance to movements of being seen to be effective.

T1  - Effect of Threat and Social Identity on Reactions to Ingroup Criticism: Defensiveness, Openness, and a Remedy
AN  - 2202735192
AB  - Openness to criticism and dissenting opinions is enormously important to group decision-making. Past research has found that people are more persuaded by criticism of their group when it comes from fellow ingroup members rather than outgroup members. But this ingroup advantage is not boundless. Three experiments demonstrate that the ingroup advantage related to openness to criticism is erased when perceivers feel their group is under threat. The results further suggest that the psychological mechanism underlying defensive responses to criticism is attributional—Threat elicits greater suspicion of ingroup critics’ motives, which eliminates the ingroup critic’s advantage relative to outgroup critics. A final experiment tests an intervention designed to increase openness to criticism and finds that reminders of the importance of dissent and free speech emerge as an effective remedy to increase the persuasiveness of criticism despite high threat.

T1  - Challenging the urban–rural dichotomy in agri-food systems
AN  - 2121559596
AB  - The idea of a profound urban–rural divide has shaped analysis of the 2016 U.S. presidential election results. Here, through examples from agri-food systems, we consider the limitations of the urban–rural divide framework in light of the assumptions and intentions that underpin it. We explore the ideas and imaginaries that shape urban and rural categories, consider how material realities are and are not translated into U.S. rural development, farm, and nutrition policies, and examine the blending of rural and urban identities through processes of rural deagrarianization and urban reagrarianization. We do not argue that an urban–rural divide does not exist, as studies and public opinion polls illustrate both measured and perceived differences in many aspects of the lived experiences that shape our individual and collective actions. Ultimately, we suggest that the urban–rural divide concept obscures the diversity and dynamism of experiences each category encompasses. Additionally, it ignores the connections and commonalities that demand integrative solutions to challenges in agri-food systems, and draw attention to the power relations that shape resource access and use within and across urban and rural spaces.

T1  - Preference, opportunity, and choice: A multilevel analysis of diverse friendship formation: GPIR
AN  - 2174078026
AB  - Diverse friendships offer many benefits for individuals and for intergroup relations, yet similarity is a powerful predictor of attraction and relationship formation. The current study examined how beliefs about the value of diversity relate to friendship choices. Naturally occurring dyads (N = 552) were recruited from 10 college campus and community samples varying in size and racial heterogeneity. A questionnaire assessed dyad members’ beliefs about the value of diversity (valuing diversity), 10 social and political attitudes, and 4 social identity categories (race/ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, nationality). Multilevel models were estimated to examine dyad-level valuing diversity, community size, and community racial heterogeneity as predictors of diverse friendships. Valuing diversity was a significant predictor of diverse friendships; valuing diversity increased the likelihood that dyad members were diverse in race, religion, and sexual orientation but not in nationality or attitudes. The effect of valuing diversity varied according to community size and racial heterogeneity. Valuing diversity increased the likelihood of racially diverse friendships more in communities high compared to low in racial heterogeneity, and increased religiously diverse friendships more in smaller compared to larger communities. Valuing diversity was associated with greater attitude similarity in larger communities but was unrelated to attitude similarity in smaller communities.

T1  - Mapping Racial and Ethnic Studies in Canada: Retrospective and Prospective Views of Canadian Ethnic Studies Chairs
AN  - 2303166242
AB  - Canada has always been diverse with respect to 'race' and ethnicity. In 1901, only three decades after Confederation, the English and French comprised 57% and 31% of the Canadian population respectively (Coats 1931, 134). Thus, 12% of Canada's population were non-French and non-British with the majority being other Europeans such as German, Dutch, Scandinavian, Russian, and many others. However, quite significantly, 25% of the non-French and non-British were racialized minorities and these included First Nations, Chinese, Japanese, and Blacks. Thus, the claims and discourse of many publications in recent decades of "the changing face of Canada" are based on an imagined early Canada being white, and English and French (deux nations). The early scholarship on Canada's already established racial and ethnic diversity essentially had a static conceptualization of ethnicity (Burnet 1976) and this was exemplified in the work of Hughes (1943) and Porter (1965, 1975). Jean Burnet's critique fostered in a more dynamic notion of ethnicity and conceptualized it in terms of social relations. In a special issue of the journal Sociological Focus, which examined studies in Canada, Burnet (1976) examined, through this dynamic lens, the policy of multiculturalism within a bilingual framework. It should be noted that this special issue also featured many other prominent sociologists who examined topics related to immigration, race and ethnicity and these included Crysdale (1976), Clairmont and Wien (1976) and Richmond (1976). That same year Palmer (1976), who was one of the early editors of Canadian Ethnic Studies, provided a comparative analysis of immigration and ethnicity in Canada and the United States. By the late 1970s and early 1980s, college and university courses on 'race' and ethnicity were standard fare with many of the popular textbooks being used with titles such as: Identities: The Impact of Ethnicity on Canadian Society (Isajiw 1977); Minority Canadians: Ethnic Groups (Krauter and Davis 1978); The Canadian Ethnic Mosaic: A Quest for Identity (Driedger 1978); Ethnicity in Canada: Theoretical Perspectives (Anderson and Frideres 1981); and Racial Minorities in Multicultural Canada (Li and Bolaria 1983). After this the floodgates were opened and the substantive area of ethnic studies started to flourish in Canada with a generation of scholars, most of whom were American- and British-trained, coming to Canada to study 'race', ethnicity, and immigration and to train a new generation of Canadian students. At the same time, the journal Canadian Ethnic Studies/Études éthniques au Canada was born in 1968, followed very shortly by the establishment of the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association/ Société canadienne d'études éthniques. In the following decades of the '80s, '90s, and 2000s, the literature in these areas exploded as scholars wrote about immigration, different ethnic/racial groups and the dynamics of their experiences in Canadian society. Over the past several decades, there has been a continual literature that examines race and ethnicity in Canada from a more general and critical perspective, and recently these include the summarizing work of Henry and Tator (2010), Hier and Bolaria (2012), Satzewich and Liodakis (2013) and Fleras (2017). Last year, in the fall of 2018, the Canadian Ethnic Studies Association held its 25th conference in Banff, Alberta with the theme of Immigration, Ethnic Mobilities, and Diasporic Communities in a Transnational World.

T1  - To accept or not to accept: Level of moral concern impacts on tolerance of Muslim minority practices
AN  - 2162392140
AB  - Living with diversity requires that we sometimes accept outgroup practices that we personally disapprove of (i.e., tolerance). Using an experimental design, we examined Dutch majority group members’ tolerance of controversial practices with varying degrees of moral concern, performed by a culturally dissimilar (Muslims) or similar (orthodox Protestant) minority group. Furthermore, we examined whether arguments in favour or against (or a combination of both) the specific practice impacted tolerance. Results indicated that participants expressed less tolerance for provocative practices when it was associated with Muslims than orthodox Protestants, but not when such practices elicit high degrees of moral concern. This indicates that opposition towards specific practices is not just a question of dislike of Muslims, but can involve disapproval of specific practices. Argument framing did not have a consistent effect on the level of tolerance for the practices.

T1  - The Paradox of Rising Ethnic Prejudice in Times of Educational Expansion and Secularization in the Netherlands, 1985–2011
AN  - 2085602551
AB  - We aim to clarify a puzzling paradox: while shares of highly educated and non-religious individuals—who generally hold less prejudice—have increased in the Netherlands, levels of prejudice against ethnic minorities have yet risen over time. To solve the paradox, we use cross-sectional data from 1985 to 2011 in counterfactual analyses. In these analyses we simulate that levels of ethnic prejudice within categories of education, church membership, and church attendance are kept constant at the 1985 level and a new simulated trend in prejudice is estimated for the 1985–2011 period. Our findings show that changing levels of prejudice within categories of education are partly responsible for the trend. We conclude that the increasing share of highly educated individuals has not resulted in a decline of prejudice in the Netherlands over time, because all Dutch have become more prejudiced over the years and in particular the higher educated.

T1  - Race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals: Arab physicians and nurses in Israeli public healthcare organizations
AN  - 2012859218
AB  - Increasing workforce diversity was found to contribute to the narrowing of disparities in health. However, racism toward ethnic minority health professionals has not been adequately researched. In Israel, public healthcare organizations that serve a mixed Jewish-Arab population employ Arab minority healthcare professionals. Instances of prejudice and manifestations of racism toward them, which frequently surface in public discussion and the media, have unfortunately gained little scholarly attention. We used the intergroup contact approach and the theory of the social process of everyday racism as a theoretical framework. The objective of the research was to study race-based experiences of Israeli Arab healthcare professionals.Methodology: We used a qualitative research method that allows respondents to describe their views, experiences, beliefs and behavior in the way they think about them. During 2013 and 2014 we conducted in-depth interviews with a snowball sample of 10 Arab physicians and 13 Arab nurses who work in Israeli public hospitals. The study protocol was ethically approved.Findings: Interviewees noted institutional efforts to maintain egalitarianism and equality. However, at the micro-level, interviewees, mostly nurses, reported instances that ranged from refusal to accept treatment from an Arab nurse, through verbal abuse, to the use of physical violence against them. At the meso-level, interviewees, mostly physicians, reported experiences of institutional discrimination. At the macro-level, one physician reported policy-related discrimination in the context of the immigration of Russian Jewish physicians to Israel.Conclusions: We recommend combining the intergroup contact approach with the social process theory of racism to examine minorities' subjective perceptions, especially in conflictual and violent contexts; conducting broad-based quantitative research in Israeli healthcare organizations, which may have important implications for the specific strategies to be used; and emphasizing the importance of institutional support. By reconstructing race-based experiences of ethnic minority health professionals, health organizations can better manage racial situations and reduce their frequency.

T1  - Competing Norms of Free Expression and Political Tolerance
AN  - 2157692715
AB  - Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, the right to vote, and other democratic principles are examples of clear norms.

Because these norms are transmitted through political socialization and political discourse, participation and engagement in political affairs lead reliably to both greater exposure to the norms and an increased likelihood of accepting them (McClosky and Zaller 1984).

DATA AND MEASURES To test these expectations, we draw on repeated cross-sections of the General Social Survey, a nationally representative survey of the American public that is the best available index of change over time in public attitudes toward the free speech rights of various controversial political and social groups.

Since 1976, the GSS has regularly asked a battery of questions about the free expression rights for “admitted homosexuals,” atheists who are “against churches and religions,” communists, militarists who advocate suspending elections and letting the army rule, and racists who profess that blacks are “genetically inferior.”

Inter-item correlations range from 0.25 to 0.66 and are highest for items pertaining to the same type of speech and the same mode of expression.

[...]there is evidence that these items are all engaging a common underlying tolerance dimension or predisposition, and that individuals are not responding solely on the basis of whether they are sympathetic to the particular content of the speech (cf.

Trends in Tolerance by Ideological Self-identification and Education Figure 5 shows that the combined effects of education and ideology have produced a dramatic decline in tolerance of racism among well-educated liberals, reflecting the degree to which this group has turned against the expression of hate speech.

Since the mid-1970s, tolerance for racist speech increased about 0.05 on the 0 to 1.0 tolerance index among conservatives without a college degree, with most of the increase occurring prior to 1990.

T1  - Community-level prejudice and mortality among immigrant groups
AN  - 2070444352
AB  - This study assesses whether anti-immigrant prejudice at the community level is prospectively associated with mortality. We used 10 waves of data from the General Social Survey (GSS) that were linked to mortality data via the National Death Index (NDI) for the period between 1993 and 2014 (n = 13,242). The 2014 GSS-NDI dataset is a nationally representative sample reporting social characteristics and attitudes in the United States that was prospectively linked to mortality data. Community-level prejudice was measured with 5 questions regarding anti-immigrant sentiments across 123 communities, defined using primary sampling units. Cox proportional hazards models tested the association between anti-immigrant prejudice and mortality hazard, controlling for covariates at the individual and community levels. Findings showed that among “other race” respondents, those born in the US had higher risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice, whereas foreign-born “other race” respondents had lower risk of mortality in communities with greater anti-immigrant prejudice. Sensitivity analyses indicated that the “other race” category was comprised largely of Asians and Hispanics, and that these results were similar for both groups. In contrast, anti-immigrant prejudice was not associated with mortality for foreign-born immigrants who self-report as white or black. We provide various hypotheses for why US-born immigrant groups seem to suffer higher mortality risk, while foreign-born immigrant groups do not, when they live in communities with high levels of prejudice.

T1  - The Eyes of Law Enforcement in the New Panopticon: Police-Community Racial Asymmetry and the Use of Surveillance Technology
AN  - 2027472578
AB  - This study examines the relationship between police-community racial asymmetry and the use of surveillance technology by local law enforcement. The data come from a nationally representative survey of law enforcement agencies, with supplementary information provided by the Law Enforcement Management and Administrative Statistics Survey, the Census, and the Uniform Crime Reports. Results indicate that police departments that underrepresent African Americans in the community are more likely to use or plan to implement surveillance technology, controlling for a range of agency-and contextual-level factors. One potential explanation for these findings is that surveillance technology operates as a form of social control that is differentially applied to racial minorities to manage what is perceived to be a greater proclivity toward criminal behavior. The implications of these findings are discussed.

T1  - When we enjoy bad news about other groups: A social identity approach to out-group schadenfreude: GPIR
AN  - 1980709990
AB  - Two studies investigate schadenfreude (pleasure at the misfortune of others) as an emotional response to news about out-group misfortunes in a political and consumer context by analyzing reactions of voters for opposition parties to the downfall of a Dutch coalition government (Study 1), and of BlackBerry users to negative news reports about Apple's iPhone (Study 2). Consistent with social identity theory and intergroup emotion theory, both studies demonstrate that affective in-group identification increases schadenfreude reactions to news about an out-group's misfortune, provided that this misfortune occurs in a domain of interest to news recipients. Additional findings show that this interaction effect attenuates when a misfortune instead befalls the in-group (Study 1) and is still observed when controlling for affective dispositions towards the out-group (Study 2). Moreover, results suggest that schadenfreude reactions strengthen subsequent intentions to share news about the out-group's misfortune with others or to engage in negative word-of-mouth (Study 2).

T1  - Do attitudes expressed in surveys predict ethnic discrimination?
AN  - 1934032692
AB  - Survey data on people's reported attitudes towards ethnic minorities are sometimes used as a proxy for ethnic discrimination. However, there is weak empirical evidence of a link between reported attitudes and discrimination. In this article, we use survey data on people's attitudes towards ethnic minorities combined with a direct measure of ethnic discrimination from a field experiment in the Swedish housing market to re-examine this policy-relevant issue. We find clear evidence of a link between reported attitudes towards ethnic minorities and the extent of ethnic discrimination: in regions where attitudes are more negative, there is more discrimination, and vice versa. Thus, in contrast to most prior studies, our results suggest that reported attitudes may be a useful predictor of ethnic discrimination.

T1  - Opposition to Irish Travellers' halting sites in the Republic of Ireland: Realistic group conflict or symbolic politics?
AN  - 1920187801
AB  - Widely reviled by even well-educated citizens of the Republic of Ireland, Travellers rank at the very bottom of today's multiracial Irish society according to most any attitudinal measure. This research note uses multivariate ordinary least-squares regression of the 2007 Irish National Election Study to test two prominent explanations of such prejudice. Overall, data analysis confirms the theories of realistic group conflict and symbolic politics about equally. In particular, unemployment, occupation, and perceptions of crime support the first interpretation, while results for conservatism and multiculturalism lend credence to the second.

T1  - The fragility of "white Irish" as a minority ethnic identity in England
AN  - 1913883803
AB  - This paper is a methodological reflection on the experiences of a white Irish woman researching ethnicity in England. Ethnic identity is described as a performance between two social actors that requires the collusion of both parties in order to be socially accepted. The history and disputes around the white Irish ethnic group category in England are discussed. Through the use of fieldnotes and interview extracts, I discuss how I became aware that my ethnic identity was not always recognized by participants, and in some cases the distinction between white Irish and white British was denied. At the micro level, this affects my rapport with individual participants, while at the macro level it resonates with historical relationships between Ireland and England. I argue that such experiences can lead to an existential threat to a person's ethnic identity and therefore that the status of white Irish identity in England can be fragile.

T1  - Oppositional consciousness, cultural preservation, and everyday resistance on the Uyghur Internet
AN  - 1883583548
AB  - The Internet has potential as a tool for propagation of minority cultures and identities. As China is a multi-ethnic, multilingual society, people of varying cultural backgrounds and across the Chinese diaspora may be found participating in Chinese language sites. However, little attention has been paid to the separate online activity among any of China's 55 officially recognized ethnic minority groups, such as the Uyghurs, especially in their native languages. In this paper, we consider in what ways digital media such as interactive online community forums (UY: munbar) may be used by one ethnic group, Uyghurs, as a means of mobilizing their community to preserve their culture and support their community. As the majority ethnic group within a region of China noted as among China's most politically sensitive, Uyghur use of computer-mediated communication provides a rich source of study.

T1  - “A bitter diversion”: Afro-Cuban immigrants, race, and everyday-life resistance
AN  - 1891616262
AB  - This article offers insight into how race intervenes into the everyday lives of post-1980 Afro-Cuban immigrants living in Miami, Florida, and Los Angeles, California. Drawing from in-depth interviews, it explores their responses to being constantly questioned about their racial and ethnic identities by people of various backgrounds, including “white” Cubans and people of Mexican origin. While they perceive some inquiries to be simply the result of curiosity, they believe other questions denote a rejection of their multiplicity and their blackness. They counteract such “micro-level rejections” through the use of affective strategies, including humor and “negative” emotion. By focusing on such resistance strategies, the study highlights Afro-Cuban agency and affirms the emotional work they put forth as they confront the daily annoyances that come from being deemed an “other.” Furthermore, the article captures how Afro-Cubans challenge normative definitions of Cuban American identity and complicate questions about racial/ethnic identity and blackness.

T1  - Television News Content of Minority Groups as an Intergroup Context Indicator of Differences Between Target-Specific Prejudices
AN  - 1880496565
AB  - Although research has shown that different types of prejudice are highly correlated, the existence of prejudice hierarchies indicates that individuals differentiate between target groups. Here we examine the relationship between television news coverage and differences in attitudes toward minority groups. We rely on intergroup threat theory, tone, and framing theories to formulate our hypotheses and conduct a multimethod study: All prime-time television news items in Flanders (N = 1,487) reporting on five minority groups (lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender; Jews; Eastern Europeans; North Africans; Roma) were coded in terms of tone and framing and subsequently combined with individual-level survey data. Patterns in news coverage reflect differences in prejudice: Groups that are most negatively/positively evaluated by the public receive the most negative/positive coverage. Prejudice is especially high for minority groups associated with problems and criminal threat frames in the news. We conclude that news content is an important characteristic of the intergroup context reflecting differences in minority group appraisals in society.

T1  - Imagined Communities? Relations of Social Identities and Social Organisation among Afghan Diaspora Groups in Germany and the UK
AN  - 1922921578
AB  - This paper engages with the complexity of diaspora by focusing on the links between self-identification, external categorisation and emerging ties among Afghans in Britain and Germany. Based on a qualitative case study and drawing on relational sociology, it demonstrates that family ties, class backgrounds, ethnicity and political affiliations inform peoples' attitudes towards each other and foster dynamics of inclusion, exclusion and group formation. Beyond particularistic identity categories there is evidence of an imagined community, which manifests itself in an implicitly shared concern about Afghanistan and a self-identification as 'being Afghan'. Yet this imagined community is rarely reflected in diasporic networks of Afghan co-nationals. A relational approach helps to explain how social identity categories come to be selectively enacted. The findings presented in this paper underline the importance of studying the making and unmaking of diaspora as part of wider social, political and historical processes.

T1  - Do white voters support welfare policies targeted at ethnic minorities? Experimental evidence from Britain
AN  - 1855097104
AB  - Academics and policymakers have begun discussing ethnically focussed policies to offset the penalties ethnic minorities suffer due to discrimination, but little is known about how such policies would be received by the public. We employ new survey experiments fielded in Britain to examine public reactions to equal opportunity policies targeted at working class, black or Muslim Britons, and redistributive policies aiming to reduce inequality between the rich and the poor or between whites and ethnic minorities. We find widespread support for class- or income-targeted policies among white British respondents, but much lower support when identical policies are ethnically targeted. We find evidence for two mechanisms which help to explain this drop in support. Firstly, political and ideological values such as egalitarianism and support for an active state strongly predict support for class- and income-targeted policy, but have a much weaker effect on support for ethnically targeted policy. Secondly, hostility to immigrants has a strong negative effect on support for ethnically targeted policy, but no effect on support for class- and income-targeted policy. The combination of intense opposition from anti-immigrant voters and indifference from traditionally pro-welfare left wingers results in very little public support for explicitly ethnically targeted policy.

T1  - Intergroup status differences as challenge or threat: The role of legitimacy: GPIR
AN  - 1854785626
AB  - Based on social identity theory (Tajfel & Turner, 1979) we examined the motivational consequences of intergroup status differences as a function of the legitimacy of these differences. Motivational responses were conceptualized in terms of challenge and threat and operationalized by their cardiovascular markers, as described by the biopsychosocial model of challenge and threat (BPS-CT; Blascovich & Mendes, 2010). Participants (N = 104) were categorized in minimal groups. Group status and status legitimacy were manipulated in the context of an intergroup competition. High status elicited relatively more challenge (less threat) when status differences were legitimate than when they were illegitimate. Low status elicited relatively less threat (more challenge) when status differences were illegitimate than when they were legitimate. Cardiovascular reactivity in line with challenge mediated performance during the competition. Results are discussed in terms of the relationship between social status and stress, and the BPS-CT as novel and useful motivational framework for studying social identity processes.

T1  - Life satisfaction, ethnicity and neighbourhoods: Is there an effect of neighbourhood ethnic composition on life satisfaction?
AN  - 1832924422
AB  - Immigrants and ethnic minorities tend to have lower life satisfaction than majority populations. However, current understanding of the drivers of these gaps is limited. Using a rich, nationally representative data set with a large sample of ethnic minorities and matched neighbourhood characteristics, we test whether first and second generation minorities experience lower life satisfaction once accounting for compositional differences and whether, specifically, neighbourhood deprivation impacts their wellbeing. We further investigate whether a larger proportion of own ethnic group in the neighbourhood improves satisfaction. We find life satisfaction is lower among ethnic minorities, and especially for the second generation, even controlling for individual and area characteristics. Neighbourhood concentration of own ethnic group is, however, associated with higher life satisfaction for Black Africans and UK born Indians and Pakistanis. The effect for Black Africans may stem from selection into areas, but findings for Indians and Pakistanis are robust to sensitivity tests.

T1  - Ethnic minorities and brothers in arms: competition and homophily in the military
AN  - 1827655778
AB  - Although the solidarity of brothers in arms is an important feature of the military, when it comes to ethnic minorities there is a pivotal paradox. On the one hand the military aims at drawing boundaries between soldiers and civilians by blurring existing ethnic and racial divisions inside the military. On the other hand the military is a highly national institution which prides itself on conservative values. Can these contradictions work? And how soldiers understand them? This paper examines the construction of ethnic boundaries in inter-group relations by focusing on the tension between ethnic hierarchy and competition versus homophily - the preference for maintaining ties with persons who are similar. Through participant observation and in-depth interviews with Dutch soldiers before and during deployment in Bosnia and Kosovo I ask when each strategy is put into work and why.

T1  - Representations and Discourse about Religion and Chinese Descendants in 2012 Jakarta's Election
AN  - 1847466758
AB  - The aim of this paper is to analyze rhetorical rejections from Muslims, a majority group, who refused a non-Muslim Chinese candidate in the 2012 Jakarta gubernatorial election. The study focuses to explore (1) the social representations of the Chinese and how it was used to attack the Chinese candidate and (2) a construction process of a "new" social representation on how a religious teaching was constructed to have nothing to do with negative sentiments or hatred. The field study focused on analyzing the sequential events related to the sermon of a prominent Islamic figure, his denial of the hate contents in his sermon, and the support he received from his Muslim supporters. The results showed that when the Chinese are negatively represented, a Chinese is considered unfit to lead Jakarta as he may disgrace the nation. Moreover, it is found that when a rhetorical rejection toward a non-Muslim is supported by a religious teaching, such rejection is considered not related to negative sentiments.

T1  - Following the Crowd or Thinking Outside of the Box? Saliency and Issue Consistency*
AN  - 1813253518
AB  - Objective 
This article examines the distinction between group-based issue opinion formation (what we term "following the crowd") and idiosyncratic or nongroup-based formation (what we term "thinking outside of the box"). The argument put forth is that issue saliency can lead citizens to think about issues in nongroup-based terms. 
Method 
We use heteroskedastic regression to measure the degree to which group-based variables explain issue opinions. Using group variables (demographics, party identification, etc.) to estimate respondents' issue responses means that nongroup variation is soaked up by the error term. 
Results 
We find that citizens who view an issue as highly salient are more likely to "think outside the box," while citizens who view an issue as less salient are more likely to "follow the crowd" by defaulting to their group memberships and identifications. 
Conclusion 
Our results indicate that response variability (less consistency within groups) on issue opinions is not always the result of uncertain citizens, nonattitudes, or measurement error. In some situations, greater response variability can reflect a deliberative and policy-based form of opinion formation.

T1  - Encouraging majority support for immigrant access to health services: Multiple categorization and social identity complexity as antecedents of health equality: GPIR
AN  - 1800151487
AB  - Health disparities between groups remain even after accounting for established causes such as structural and economic factors. The present research tested, for the first time, whether multiple social categorization processes can explain enhanced support for immigrant health (measured by respondents' behavioral intention to support immigrants' vaccination against A H1N1 disease by cutting regional public funds). Moreover, the mediating role of individualization and the moderating role of social identity complexity were tested. Findings showed that multiple versus single categorization of immigrants lead to support their right to health and confirmed the moderated mediation hypothesis. The potential in developing this sort of social cognitive intervention to address health disparities is discussed. [web URL: http://gpi.sagepub.com/content/19/4/426.abstract]

T1  - Minority Identity Strategies Bound by Prejudice: Restricted Perspectives of People Categorized as Gypsies in Hungary
AN  - 1784567758
AB  - In this study, we explored the identity strategies of Hungarian Gypsies with different socialization backgrounds, including the degree of majority and minority identifications, the contents of Gypsy identity as well as coping with threatening social situations. Sampling was based on external social categorization: majority members were asked for contacts to Gypsy acquaintances. Questionnaire data were used to assess socialization background, group identification and preferred coping strategies at different levels, while contents of Gypsy identity were explored in an associative network. Results suggest that subjects make an exclusive choice between national and ethnic identities. While all subjects prefer ethnic identity, subjects with different socialization backgrounds follow different identity strategies. In sum, large-family subjects are emotionally attached to their ethnic group, avoid interaction with the majority and prefer the idea of a multicultural society. Small-family subjects are emotionally detached from their ethnic group and vote for a homogeneous society. Results are interpreted in terms of integration-related social policies. While these are aimed at the foundation of a recognized active minority, members of these new generations find the way of recognition in individual assimilation due to the threat of prejudice.

T1  - Native Friends and Host Country Identification among Adolescent Immigrants in Germany: The Role of Ethnic Boundaries: IMR
AN  - 1774536562
AB  - Many studies find that high shares of native friends are positively related to immigrant youths' identification with the host country. By examining various immigrant groups together, these studies imply that having native friends matters in the same way for the national identification in different immigrant groups. In contrast, we argue that the extent to which having native friends affects immigrants' national identification depends on both immigrant group characteristics and the receiving context, especially on ethnic boundaries and related group differences in perceived discrimination and the compatibility of ethnic and national identities. Analyses based on data from the National Educational Panel Study in Germany that are representative of 15-year-old adolescents in secondary schools indeed reveal pronounced group differences: While national identification of ethnic German repatriates as well as of adolescents of former Yugoslavian and Southern European origin is related to the share of native friends, as hypothesized, we do not find this association for immigrants of Turkish and Polish origin. Our finding underlines the importance of theoretically as well as empirically accounting for group differences.

T1  - Contact in context: does intergroup contact function (better) in high-threat contexts?
AN  - 1789874982
AB  - Are interpersonal contacts effective in reducing group threat and prejudice in all contexts? Studies have found that the contact effect is stronger in regions and countries where large immigrant populations contribute to high levels of contextual group threat This paper tests the robustness of the observed positive association between contextual-level group threat and contact effects by identifying three methodological reasons for why the association might be spurious: (1) a potential omitted variable bias; (2) a potential self-selection effect; and (3) a potential ceiling effect. Using the 2002 European Social Survey, we find that the positive association is indeed robust. We interpret this as evidence that contact effects are strongest in those European contexts where the need for improved intergroup relations between immigrants and natives is most dire.

T1  - Ethno-Class Distinctions and Reality (TV)
AN  - 1773421221
AB  - This article offers a cultural-sociological analysis of interpretations by viewers from different classes on the most popular reality show in Israel, namely, Big Brother. The findings of this study show dramatic differences in viewing practices according to class and ethnic distinctions of the viewers. Viewers from the upper socioeconomic class primarily addressed the way in which the subjects from the low socioeconomic class and marked ethnic groups appear in their eyes: that is, the processes affiliated with Othering. These ethno-class distinctions were translated into unique viewing practices: the identification of what are called, "cult moments" or "grotesque moments." These moments are depicted as ridiculing the "exaggerated" behavior of members of the low socioeconomic class and specific ethnic groups. Viewers from the low socioeconomic class offer more imminent (and less distant) perspectives on the Big Brother program. They relate to a broad spectrum of content that was broadcast in the program, identify with the participants from their group, criticize the judgments and the cultural hierarchies of marked group members, and describe how political anger accompanies their viewing of the reality program. The discussion section suggests the connection of these subjective interpretations and widespread cultural scenarios about class and ethnic identities.

T1  - Diverging Fortunes: Racial/Ethnic Inequality in Wealth Trajectories in Middle and Late Life
AN  - 1771600770
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Wealth The primary aim of this study is to examine whether racial/ethnic inequality in wealth dissipates or increases between middle and late life, and by how much. To address this aim, this study draws on critical race and life course perspectives as well as 10 waves of panel data from the Health and Retirement Study and growth curve models to understand racial/ethnic inequality in wealth trajectories among whites, blacks, and Mexican Americans (N = 8337). Findings show that, by midlife, significant inequalities in net worth emerge between whites and their black and Mexican American counterparts. On average, white households have amassed a net worth of $105k by midlife, compared to less than $5k and $39k among black and Mexican American families, respectively. Moreover, whites experience much more rapid rates of wealth accumulation during their 50s and 60s than their minority counterparts, resulting in increasing wealth disparities with age, consistent with a process of cumulative disadvantage. At the peak of their wealth trajectory (at age 66), whites have approximately $245k more than blacks and $219k more than Mexican Americans. A wide range of socioeconomic, behavioral, and health factors account for a portion, but not all, of racial/ethnic inequality in wealth, suggesting that unobserved factors such as parental wealth, segregation, and discrimination may play a role in the production and maintenance of wealth inequality.

T1  - Closing the Racial Wealth Gap: Establishing and Sustaining an Initiative
AN  - 1771600639
AB  - Issue Title: Special Issue on Race and Wealth By 2003, the savings and asset building field had achieved critical research and policy successes. However, some challenges it faced were the lack of a substantial presence of organizations of color in the field and the absence of experts of color at decision-making tables. Over the course of 11 years, a strategy was developed within the Ford Foundation to gain an understanding of the knowledge and perspective of communities of color about saving and wealth building and to then include this perspective within the asset building field. This article provides a social history of the work undertaken to create and sustain this initiative.

T1  - Ethnic disparities in utilisation of maternal health care services in Ghana: evidence from the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey
AN  - 1784140060
AB  - Objective. Disparities in utilisation of maternal health care remain a challenge to attainment of the maternal health-related Millennium Development Goals. The objective of this descriptive study was to examine disparities in utilisation of maternal health care among ethnic groups in Ghana.
Design. Data from the 2007 Ghana Maternal Health Survey were analysed for disparities in antenatal care (ANC) visit, utilisation of tetanus toxoid immunisation and iron tablets/syrup intake during pregnancy, place of delivery, skilled birth attendance, caesarean section (CS) and post-natal care (PNC) among different ethnic groups.
Results. Findings show that the proportion of women who received any form of skilled antenatal, delivery and PNC in the five years (2003-2007) preceding the survey was 96%, 55% and 55%, respectively. Despite the incremental progress Ghana made in improving access to skilled maternal health care services, large gradients of disparities exist. The ethnic difference in utilisation of institutional prenatal care was small; however, fewer births to women from majority ethnic groups such as the Akan (21%) took place at home compared with births to women from minority ethnic groups such as the Ewe (58.8%), Guan (42.7%), Grusi (53.4%), Mole-Dagbani (74.7%) and Gruma (58.8%). The rate of consultation of a skilled health care provider for delivery among the different ethnic groups also ranged from a low of 27% for births to Mole-Dagbani women to a high of 68.8% among births to Akan women.
Conclusion. Minority ethnic groups reported lower utilisation levels for most of the components of skilled maternity care in Ghana. However, ethnic disparities in utilisation of all the components of ANC in Ghana were less compared to delivery in health facilities, skilled attendance at birth, use of CS and PNC. Therefore, efforts to promote universal access to skilled maternity care not only should target those sub-populations with significantly low utilisation levels but also must focus on those components of maternal health care such as skilled attendance at delivery that demonstrate the greatest disparities. There is also the need to further explore who continues to remain excluded from receiving needed care, and how to encourage such women, especially minority women, to seek skilled care.

T1  - Obstacles to socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrant women
AN  - 2084926719
AB  - Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide an overview of obstacles to socioeconomic integration faced by highly-skilled immigrant women (HSIW) to Quebec, followed by a discussion of Quebec’s socio-political context and interculturalism, in an effort to better situate these obstacles. With these in mind, implications for diversity management are discussed. Design/methodology/approach – The paper is largely based on a review of the immigrant integration, interculturalism and diversity management literatures pertaining to the socioeconomic integration of highly-skilled immigrants. It focusses on the socioeconomic integration of HSIW in the Quebec context. Findings – The authors find that researchers should continue to examine aspects of the social and political contexts in which immigrant integration and diversity management take place when conducting studies in these areas. The authors also encourage continued research pertaining to specific groups, as these may bring to light-specific dynamics that can lead to exclusion. Practical implications – This paper includes implications for diversity management in organizations seeking to foster inclusive practices with regards to ethnic minorities and immigrants in general, and HSIW in particular. Originality/value – The paper sheds new light on immigrant integration and diversity management in Quebec by bridging the gap between three areas of study that are interconnected but seldom discussed together: socioeconomic integration of immigrants, interculturalism and diversity management in organizations.

T1  - Ethnic group variations in alcohol-related hospital admissions in England: does place matter?
AN  - 1784139967
AB  - Objectives. The health burden of alcohol use is socially and geographically patterned in many countries. Less is known about variations in this burden between ethnic groups and whether this differs across place of residence.
Methods. National cross-sectional study using hospital admission data in England. Alcohol-related admission rates, where an alcohol-related condition was either the primary diagnosis (considered as the reason for admission) or a comorbidity, were calculated using ethnic group specific rates for English regions.
Results. In 2010/11 there were a total of 264,870 alcohol-related admissions in England. Admission rates were higher in the North of England than elsewhere (e.g. for primary diagnosis 161 per 100,000 population in the North vs. 62 per 100,000 in the South). These patterns were not uniform across ethnic groups however. For example, admission rates for alcohol-related comorbidity were four times higher among White Irish in London compared with those in the South of England (306 to 76 per 100,000) and four times higher in Indians living in the Midlands compared with those in the South of England (128 to 29 per 100,000). These patterns were similar for admissions with a comorbid alcohol-related condition.
Conclusions. Geographical location may be an important determinant of within and between ethnic group variations in alcohol-related hospital admissions in England. While a number of factors were not examined here, this descriptive analysis suggests that this heterogeneity should be taken into account when planning interventions and services for the prevention and management of alcohol misuse.

T1  - Group Differences in Intermarriage with Whites between Asians, Blacks, and Hispanics: The Effects of Assimilation and Structural Constraints
AN  - 1748050453
AB  - This study examines the reasons for differences in the prevalence of intermarriage with Whites between racial minorities in 283 U.S. metropolitan areas. The analysis demonstrates that Asians have the highest and Blacks the lowest rate of intermarriage with Whites, with Hispanics falling in between. We tested two theories for these group differences. First, the structural explanation, which posits that differences in the relative size of each racial group in marriage markets affects their chances for intermarriage. Second, the assimilation explanation, which suggests that differences in social distance with Whites influences the propensity for intermarriage. The decomposition analysis shows that the cultural assimilation explanation is the primary reason for the Hispanic-Black gap in intermarriage. However, both explanations predict Black-Asian and Asian-Hispanic differences in intermarriage with Whites.

T1  - Contextualizing Intergroup Contact: Do Political Party Cues Enhance Contact Effects?
AN  - 1718067690; 201530639
AB  - This article examines intergroup contact effects in different political contexts. We expand on previous efforts of social psychologists by incorporating the messages of political parties as a contextual trigger of group membership awareness in contact situations. We argue that the focus among political parties on us-them categorizations heightens the awareness of group memberships. This focus in turn enhances the positive intergroup contact effect by stimulating majority members to perceive contacted persons as prototypical outgroup members. A multilevel analysis of 22 countries and almost 37,000 individuals confirms that the ability of intergroup contact to reduce antiforeigner sentiment increases when political parties focus intensively on immigration issues and cultural differences. Specifically, both workplace contact and interethnic friendship become more effective in reducing antiforeigner sentiment when intergroup relations are politicized. These findings demonstrate the need for widening the scope of the intergroup contact theory in order to cover macro-political conditions. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Voting Rights for Non-citizens: Treasure or Fool's Gold?
AN  - 1829550397
AB  - Proposals to extend the franchise to non-citizens have recently been defended on the basis of principles of democratic inclusion that challenge the sovereign authority of states to decide who may participate as a member in the democratic constituency. Here the requirement of extending the franchise to non-citizens is considered in the context of municipalities dominated by national minorities and in light of the claims of national minorities to self-rule. In these contexts, the settlement and enfranchisement of migrants sometimes dilute the strength and increase the costs of minority nationalist policies. The political dynamics created by extending voting rights to non-citizens where national minorities struggle for self-rule illuminate that moral arguments for extending voting rights to non-citizens can confuse two issues, the first being who has the right to participate in shaping the common projects of a democratic community and the second being whose interests should be considered in the course of decision making by that community. In these contexts, non-citizens have the right to have their interests considered and to have their rights taken seriously, but they may not have a strong claim to participate as voters in community decision making.

T1  - Group-based Compunction and Anger: Their Antecedents and Consequences in Relation to Colonial Conflicts
AN  - 1788010541
AB  - Group-based emotions can be experienced by group members for the past misdeeds of their ingroup towards an outgroup. This present study examines distinct antecedents and consequences of group-based compunction and anger in two countries with a history of colonization (Portugal, N = 280 and the Netherlands, N = 184). While previous research has focused mainly on ingroup-focused antecedents of group-based emotions, such as ingroup identification and perceptions of responsibility, this research also analyzed outgroup-focused variables, such as outgroup identification and meta-perceptions. Multiple group structural equation modeling showed that group-based compunction and group-based anger have similar antecedents (exonerating cognitions, collectivism, outgroup identification and meta-perceptions). Furthermore, the results showed that the two emotions have distinct but related consequences for the improvement of intergroup relations (compensation, subjective importance of discussing the past and forgiveness assignment).

T1  - Showing engagement or not: The influence of social identification and group deadlines on individual control strategies
AN  - 1700674479; 201524913
AB  - People often work together in groups that have to reach goals in a given time frame. Nonetheless, the impact of deadlines on group members' self-control has not been studied so far. Here this topic is addressed by integrating the action-phase model (Heckhausen, 1999), which postulates the use of different self-control strategies during individual-level goal pursuit, with the social identity approach. It was predicted and found in two studies that highly identified group members, in contrast to those who were only weakly identified, responded to a group's deadline phase (pre vs. post) by showing phase-appropriate patterns of engagement and disengagement. Study 1 measured identification and assessed intentions and behavioral indicators of self-control. Study 2 manipulated identification and assessed self-reports of intended self-control strategies. Overall, the findings corroborate the notion that the social self can serve as a basis for self-regulation. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Ltd., copyright holder.]

T1  - Relationship Between the Public's Belief in Recovery, Level of Mental Illness Stigma, and Previous Contact
AN  - 1680155091; 201514630
AB  - Disbelief exits that individuals who have a mental health condition are able to recover and fully function in life. This study analyzed 1,437 adults from the 2006 General Social Survey. Structural equation modeling (1) examined the relationship between respondents' level of prejudicial attitudes and social distance (i.e., stigma) toward individuals who have a mental health condition and their belief in the potential of recovery (2) tested whether previous contact with an individual who received treatment was a mediator. Findings indicated that the belief in recovery led to lower levels of social distance. Prejudicial attitudes were found to be a predictor of one's level of social distance. Previous contact was not a mediator however; males, minorities and those with less education were less likely to have had previous contact. Results indicated a need to emphasize the probability of recovering from a mental health condition when developing target-specific stigma reducing strategies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Embracing Humanity in the Face of Death: Why Do Existential Concerns Moderate Ingroup Humanization?
AN  - 1667952373; 201509347
AB  - People humanize their ingroup to address existential concerns about their mortality, but the reasons why they do so remain ambiguous. One explanation is that people humanize their ingroup to bolster their social identity in the face of their mortality. Alternatively, people might be motivated to see their ingroup as more uniquely human (UH) to distance themselves from their corporeal 'animal' nature. These explanations were tested in Australia, where social identity is tied less to UH and more to human nature (HN) which does not distinguish humans from animals. Australians attributed more HN traits to the ingroup when mortality was salient, while the attribution of UH traits remained unchanged. This indicates that the mortality-buffering function of ingroup humanization lies in reinforcing the humanness of our social identity, rather than just distancing ourselves from our animal nature. Implications for (de)humanization in intergroup relations are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Group and intergroup parameters of gang activities: An introduction and research agenda
AN  - 1700674378; 201524915
AB  - In introducing this Special Issue on gangs, we overview the thrust of its papers, demonstrating how they assist in plugging research gaps from the dearth of psychological attention to gangs. The papers therein raise important theoretical considerations of group process effects, social identity, and communication influences in gangs. Also included are empirical examinations of how attitudes to formal organized crime groups may nurture progang views, how social networks bridge gang divides, the dehumanization and social dominance association with gang membership, and how membership longevity associates with gang members' attitudes to their group. We conclude with theoretical prospects and empirical vistas for future work. For instance, vitality theory may help explain members' immersion in gangs, discursive strategies could explain how youth are enticed into gangs, and examinations of community and law enforcement attitudes to gangs may provide insight into how oppositional attitudes are fostered on both sides of the gang divide.

T1  - Mathematics Performance of Immigrant Students Across Different Racial Groups: An Indirect Examination of the Influence of Culture and Schooling
AN  - 1680152661; 201513912
AB  - Immigrant students are commonly assumed lower performers in US schools. Their inadequate English language skills and adaptation to the mainstream US school norms are often seen as obstacles to their successful school learning. However, whether and to what extent this assumption is sustainable for immigrant students' performances in mathematics is the question that has not been empirically explored. Proper answer to the question would help verify the popular assumption about the immigrant students and their learning in the mainstream US schools. Guided by the straight-line, segmented assimilation and cultural capital theories, this study examined this issue using US grades 4 and 8 datasets of Trend in International Mathematics and Science Study 2007 and 15-year-old dataset of Program for International Student Assessment 2009. It was found that there were substantial differences in the mathematics performances of students across different racial groups. Being immigrant students does not always mean they are lower performers than their mainstream peers. The immigrant students coming to the USA earlier did not always show worse mathematics performance over their immigrant peers who came to the USA later. These findings challenge the popular assumption that immigrant students' inadequate English language skills and adaptation to the mainstream US school norms are obstacles to their successful school learning and call for a deeper understanding about the academic performance of immigrant students in different content areas and at various stages of immigration across different racial groups.

AN  - 1660022402; 201505923
AB  - Since devolution many museums in Scotland have attempted to represent national identity in plural and inclusive terms - emphasising regional and historical differences within the nation and highlighting the contribution of so-called 'New Scots' to Scottish society. However, it remains to be seen whether attempts to deconstruct homogenous discourses of nationhood at the level of the state or institution are capable of radically altering individual understandings of national identity and belonging. Further empirical research is therefore needed into the way in which heritage is produced and negotiated in everyday social environments beyond the museum in order to understand what - if any - impact museums may have on challenging prejudice and producing inclusive definitions of national identity. Drawing on Mason's (2013) 'cosmopolitan museology' and Rounds' (2006) theory of 'identity work' in museums, this paper analyses the narratives of young people aged between 13 and 18 years old from six schools in Glasgow, Edinburgh, the Scottish Borders and the Western Isles. It argues that when negotiating national identity and cultural diversity, individuals adopt narrative strategies in order to accommodate new information without necessarily changing their own definitions of national heritage or attitudes towards minority groups. The implications of this finding for both museum practice in Scotland and the wider European context are considered. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - An eye for the I: Preferential attention to the eyes of ingroup members
AN  - 1542890242
AB  - Human faces, and more specifically the eyes, play a crucial role in social and nonverbal communication because they signal valuable information about others. It is therefore surprising that few studies have investigated the impact of intergroup contexts and motivations on attention to the eyes of ingroup and outgroup members. Four experiments investigated differences in eye gaze to racial and novel ingroups using eye tracker technology. Whereas Studies 1 and 3 demonstrated that White participants attended more to the eyes of White compared to Black targets, Study 2 showed a similar pattern of attention to the eyes of novel ingroup and outgroup faces. Studies 3 and 4 also provided new evidence that eye gaze is flexible and can be meaningfully influenced by current motivations. Specifically, instructions to individuate specific social categories increased attention to the eyes of target group members. Furthermore, the latter experiments demonstrated that preferential attention to the eyes of ingroup members predicted important intergroup biases such as recognition of ingroup over outgroup faces (i.e., the own-race bias; Study 3) and willingness to interact with outgroup members (Study 4). The implication of these findings for general theorizing on face perception, individuation processes, and intergroup relations are discussed.

T1  - Forming impressions of in-group and out-group members under self-esteem threat: The moderating role of the need for cognitive closure and prejudice
AN  - 1559007551; 201432136
AB  - This study aims to investigate whether and how participants' need for cognitive closure (NCC) and their level of the prejudice moderate the self-esteem threats' influence on their perception of in-group and out-group members. There is still an open debate concerning the relationship between in-group favoritism and out-group negativity, as well as concerning factors that may increase these two phenomena and their reciprocity. Participants (78 students) completed a questionnaire containing the scales of prejudice and NCC. Subsequently, after they watched a short movie clip showing an interaction between an in-group member behaving negatively and an out-group member behaving positively, participants were exposed to a self-esteem threat (vs. self-enhancement), and, finally, they were requested to evaluate these in-group and out-group members. Results, as hypothesized, show that self-esteem threats increase negative evaluations of the out-group members and decrease negative evaluations of the in-group members only among participants with a high need for closure and a high level of prejudice.

T1  - How normative and social identification processes predict self-determination to engage in derogatory behaviours against outgroup hockey fans
AN  - 1551002309; 201428782
AB  - Bringing together self-determination theory, intergroup theories based on the social identity approach, and normative approaches, three studies conducted among hockey fans tested if social norms and social identity predict greater self-determined motivation to engage in derogatory behaviours against an outgroup team and higher frequency of these behaviours. Higher self-determination was conceptualised as an indicator of internalisation. In Study 1, hockey fans who identified more strongly as fans of the Montreal Canadiens (N = 181) displayed a stronger positive association between the perceived norm in favour of outgroup derogation and self-determined motivation to engage in derogatory behaviours against fans of an outgroup team. This interaction also emerged on the frequency with which the derogatory behaviours were enacted. In Studies 2 and 3 (Ns = 105 and 116), this norm by social identity interaction was replicated on both the self-determination and the frequency outcomes for fans of a diversity of teams in the National Hockey League. In Study 3, these findings were observed over and above a manipulation that framed derogatory behaviours as being either harmful or beneficial. Results are discussed in light of motivational theories, normative approaches, and intergroup theories based on the social identity approach. . [Copyright John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.]

T1  - Up close and personal: Evidence that shared social identity is a basis for the 'special' relationship that binds followers to leaders
AN  - 1541998890; 201427293
AB  - The present research extends prior work by proposing that followers' social identification with a group can translate into their relational identification with leaders. Study 1 demonstrates experimentally that compared to low-identified followers, highly identified followers perceive themselves to share relational identity with a leader when that leader is representative of their ingroup (but not if that leader is representative of an outgroup). Followers' relational identification, in turn, influences not only their experience of a personal bond with the leader but also perceptions of leader charisma. Study 2 replicates these findings in the context of Presidential candidates in the 2012 US election and extends them by examining leader prototypicality as a further moderating factor. Findings suggest that followers' experience of a 'special' and 'personal' bond with leaders arises from their social bond within a group that binds them together and provides a framework for their mutual relationship.

T1  - Ethnic Minorities and Their Health Needs: Crisis of Perception and Behaviours
AN  - 1728661650; 201534266
AB  - There is considerable evidence to suggest that racial and ethnic disparities exist in the provision of emergency and wider healthcare. The importance of collecting patient ethnic data has received attention in literature across the world and eliminating ethnic and racial health equalities is one of the primary aims of healthcare providers internationally. The poor health status of certain racial and ethnic groups has been well documented. The improvement of racial and ethnic disparities in healthcare is at the forefront of many public health agendas. This article addresses important policy, practice, and cultural issues confronted by the pre-hospital emergency care setup. This aspect of care plays a unique role in the healthcare safety net in providing a service to a very diverse population, including members of ethnic and racial minorities. Competent decision making by the emergency care practitioners requires patient-specific information and the health provider's prior medical knowledge and clinical training. The article reviews the current ethnicity trends in the UK along with international evidence linking ethnicity and health inequalities. The study argues that serious difficulties will arise between the health provider and the patient if they come from different backgrounds and therefore experience difficulties in cross-cultural communication. This adversely impacts on the quality of diagnostic and clinical decision making for minority patients. The article offers few strategies to address health inequalities in emergency care and concludes by arguing that much more needs to be done to ensure that we are hearing the voices of more diverse groups, groups who are often excluded from engagement through barriers such as language or mobility difficulties.

T1  - Multicultural attitudes mediate the relation between personality and perceived ethnic outgroup distance in the Netherlands
AN  - 1559008029; 201432206
AB  - We focus in the current study on associations between personality, multicultural attitudes, and perceived ethnic outgroup distance in the Netherlands. Data were collected among four different ethnic groups (from low to high in terms of ethnic hierarchy): Turkish/Moroccan-Dutch, Antillean/Surinamese-Dutch, Mixed Western immigrants, and Dutch majority group members. We found support for a mediation model in which in all groups multicultural attitudes mediate the relation between personality traits, education level, and age as antecedents, and outgroup distance as outcome; age was the only antecedent that also had a direct effect on outcome. Education was positively related to multiculturalism in the groups high in the hierarchy and unrelated in the groups low in the hierarchy. The association between multicultural attitudes and outgroup distance was negative and stronger for the groups higher in the ethnic hierarchy; hierarchy was unrelated to outgroup distance. Groups higher in the hierarchy scored lower on multicultural attitudes. It was concluded that multicultural attitudes and outgroup distance are important for understanding intergroup dynamics in ethnically diverse societies. [Copyright Elsevier Ltd.]

T1  - Group Conflict and 'Confined' and 'Collaborative' Collective Efficacy: The Importance of a Normative Core between Immigrants and Natives in an English Town
AN  - 1559006449; 201431960
AB  - It has long been contended by both the 'old' and 'new' Chicago School that immigration fractures effective community controls, resulting in increased crime, conflict and social disorder. Building on the Chicago School approach, this article provides an extended model of the theory of collective efficacy, introducing two new concepts of 'confined' and 'collaborative' collective efficacy. This article is based on research carried out in an English town that experienced a mass and rapid in-migration of Polish nationals. The results of a survey of Polish migrants and native residents demonstrate how a perceived 'normative core' between diverse groups is the crucial ingredient for collaboration in social control efforts, and for dissipating instances of inter-group conflict.

T1  - The democratic engagement of Britain's ethnic minorities
AN  - 1531932329; 201423370
AB  - Democratic engagement is a multi-faceted phenomenon that embraces citizens' involvement with electoral politics, their participation in 'conventional' extra-parliamentary political activity, their satisfaction with democracy and trust in state institutions, and their rejection of the use of violence for political ends. Evidence from the 2010 BES and EMBES shows that there are important variations in patterns of democratic engagement across Britain's different ethnic-minority groups and across generations. Overall, ethnic-minority engagement is at a similar level to and moved by the same general factors that influence the political dispositions of whites. However, minority democratic engagement is also strongly affected by a set of distinctive ethnic-minority perceptions and experiences, associated particularly with discrimination and patterns of minority and majority cultural engagement. Second-generation minorities who grew up in Britain are less, rather than more, likely to be engaged. Adapted from the source document.

AN  - 1559007583; 201432200
AB  - The study examined the preconditions for multiculturalism in the New Zealand context as enumerated by Berry, Kalin, and Taylor (1977) and Berry and Kalin (1995). Using data from a New Zealand national probability sample (n = 5862), we assessed ethnic group differences in: ethnic equality positioning as an indicator of support for diversity; race-based rejection as a measure of prejudice and intolerance; affective ratings of warmth as an indicator of positive ethnic attitudes; patriotism as an indicator of attachment to New Zealand society; and perceptions of realistic threat and expectations of economic security as indicators of a confident identity. Consistent with the preconditions for achieving a multicultural society, expectations of race-based rejection were uncommon, intergroup feelings were generally warm, perceived threat was moderately low, expectations for future security were moderate and fairly comparable across groups, and all groups expressed high levels of patriotism. However, New Zealanders resisted a resource-specific multicultural ideology that involves race-based interventions to reduce social inequality. There was also evidence that the level of warmth towards Asian New Zealanders, the most recent and rapidly growing immigrant group, was lower than that towards other ethnic groups. The findings are discussed in relation to socio-political issues, including tensions between biculturalism and multiculturalism, and the obstacles to reducing social inequality across ethnic groups.

T1  - Can Numbers Lie? Race, Data Collection, and Black and Italian Infant and Maternal Health Care in Early Twentieth Century New York City
AN  - 1462012846
AB  - In 1899, W. E. B. Du Bois warned in The Philadelphia Negro, the first sociological study produced in the United States, that persons creating statistical studies must be aware that, left unchecked, inaccuracies fueled by individual biases may distort their work as much as errors arising from flawed methodologies and observations. Building upon this early caveat and contemporary admonitions from sociologists Tukufu Zuberi and Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, the author examines two 1924 pamphlets, Health Work for Mothers in a Colored Community and Protecting the Mother and Child. Both were compiled and published from data created by the New York Association for Improving the Condition of the Poor which, respectively, covered infant and maternal health demonstrations conducted among two neighborhood groupings of impoverished African American and British West Indian mothers and children, and Southern Italian mothers and children. When these pamphlets are compared against internal unpublished data, inconsistencies arise which may have resulted from then commonly held racially-gendered biases against blacks and Italians. In turn, these biases-coupled with the desire to publish efficacious outcomes-mav have led the AICP to change the initial focus of its health experiment with black mothers and children from respiratory diseases to syphilis; to explain failed morbidity and mortality outcomes among Southern Italian infants by attacking mothers for their cultural preference for midwives; and, in both cases, to publish statistical data more positively than that contained in source materials. In sum, Du Bois' exhortation stands as powerfully today as over a century ago: even well-meaning researchers should check personal biases at the door before creating, conducting, and publishing statistical studies of racialized minority groups. To do otherwise may result in flawed data supporting the very biases that they may aim to overcome. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Influence of value predispositions, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure on public attitudes toward homosexuals in Singapore
AN  - 1494300205; 201401873
AB  - This national survey tracks changes in Singaporeans' attitudes toward lesbians and gay men (ATLG) and examines value predispositions, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure as predictors of ATLG and acceptance of homosexuals. The study replicates and extends research done previously and addresses temporal shifts in values and views. Findings indicate that the relatively small positive change in ATLG from 2005 to 2010 was mainly due to values and demographic factors. The addition of several new predictive variables increased the variance explained for why people hold certain ATLG and their acceptance. Conformity to norms, intrinsic religiosity, Western orientation, interpersonal contact, and mediated exposure were significantly associated with both ATLG and acceptance of homosexuals. Perception of homosexuality as a choice was significantly associated with ATLG but not with acceptance of homosexuals. Asian orientation and extrinsic religiosity showed no significant association with either dependent variable. The findings are discussed in the context of a multicultural Asian society and future directions for research. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Rethinking empirical approaches to racial segregation
AN  - 1463008711; 201345814
AB  - Within empirical approaches to racial residential segregation, there has been a tendency to draw on the work of or influenced by Robert E. Park and his ecological hypothesis to explore social and spatial relations between members of different ethnic and racial groups, thus framing research within a race relations paradigm. This has promoted an analysis which naturalizes racial differences but which also sidelines structural considerations. In turn this approach has also fed into political discourses on segregation, at times supporting more reactionary positions. This paper seeks to address this debate by considering whether emphasis on minority ethnic concentration sidelines the more pertinent issue of concentration in deprived areas, suggesting that neighbourhood deprivation as a measure can be more easily aligned with structural conditions which have influenced the settlement and historical experience of many ethnic minority communities. Specifically, I consider the extent to which a measure of neighbourhood deprivation is more important than the ethnic composition of an area for thinking about the distribution of inequalities in unemployment (as one example of socio-economic inequality). Using multilevel logistic regression I find neighbourhood income deprivation to be more important than levels of co-ethnic concentration for explaining ethnic differences in unemployment. The findings imply that neighbourhood deprivation is significantly more important for considering inequalities in unemployment for ethnic minorities than the ethnic composition of an area.

T1  - Effects of ethnic enclosure of neighborhoods, workplace, and industrial sectors on earnings
AN  - 1463015053; 201345789
AB  - In this study, we extend prior work on how ethnic boundaries in specific contexts affect the earnings of racial and ethnic groups by simultaneously exploring how levels of ethnic enclosure, measured by co-ethnic concentration, of neighborhoods, workplaces, and industrial sectors, and their 'moderating' effects on the earnings of six major recent racial and ethnic immigrant groups in the eight largest Canadian cities. The consideration of ethnic boundaries in multiple contexts portrays a more realistic picture of the effect of ethnic boundaries on earnings. The study helps us to understand how ethnic enclosure in various contexts affects the economic attainments of groups with higher proportions of immigrants. The study is based on 2006 Canadian census data. The findings show that most members of the six included racial/ethnic minority groups live and work in environments with high levels of ethnic enclosure. Besides, in general, the earnings of employees are negatively related to co-ethnic concentration in neighborhood and workplace, while the relationship with industrial co-ethnic concentration is not consistent. The earnings of employers are negatively related to co-ethnic concentration in the workplace only. The moderating effects of various co-ethnic contexts on earnings are mostly positive for both employers and employees, although they are more likely to be significant among employees. In addition, the findings show variations among the six groups. [Copyright Elsevier Inc.]

T1  - Conformity and counter-conformity to anti-discrimination norms: the moderating effect of attitude toward foreigners and perceived in-group threat
AN  - 1433108479
AB  - Two studies examined the influence of an anti-discrimination norm on Swiss nationals' discrimination against foreigners as a function of initial attitude (pro-foreigner vs. anti-foreigner) and in-group threat (i.e., whether or not foreigners are perceived as taking nationals' jobs). Results showed that anti-foreigners decreased their level of discrimination (i.e., a conformity effect) when threat was low, but did not change (Study 1) or increased discrimination (i.e., a counter-conformity effect) when threat was high (Study 2). No significant effects were observed for pro-foreigners. It is argued that conformity to anti-discrimination norms increases as the individual-norm discrepancy increases, insofar as the social context provides legitimacy to this norm (i.e., low in-group threat conditions).

T1  - Group Conflict Theory in a Longitudinal Perspective: Analyzing the Dynamic Side of Ethnic Competition
AN  - 1364704659; 201323466
AB  - One of the most established approaches to explain attitudes toward immigration is group conflict theory. However, even though the theory was articulated in dynamic terms, previous research has almost exclusively tested it through cross-sectional analyses. The aim of this study is to disentangle the dynamic character of ethnic competition from more permanent determinants of ethnic threat. The findings show that a remarkable variation of concern over immigration, usually attributed to permanent positions of economic vulnerability, disappears when within-person variation is modeled. In line with a dynamic approach of ethnic competition, becoming unemployed or being laid off increases concern over immigration. This effect is independent of social class.

T1  - Honk if you like minorities: Vuvuzela attitudes predict outgroup liking
AN  - 1347783072; 201319945
AB  - The 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa generated extensive controversy over spectators' use of the African vuvuzela trumpet. We asked 123 White American participants about their opinions of vuvuzelas as well as their attitudes towards a variety of racial/ethnic minority groups including immigrants, African Americans, and Latinos. We found that the less participants liked vuvuzelas, the less positively they also tended to feel toward minority groups. Furthermore, respondents who liked vuvuzelas the least were also less generally open to change. These findings suggest that the vuvuzela controversy was about more than just a plastic trumpet -- it was also an episode of differential ingroup/outgroup perceptions and a lack of openness to new things.

T1  - The Basis of Shooter Biases: Beyond Cultural Stereotypes
AN  - 1125223916; 201243437
AB  - White police officers and undergraduate students mistakenly shoot unarmed Black suspects more than White suspects on computerized shoot/don't shoot tasks. This bias is typically attributed to cultural stereotypes of Black men. Yet, previous research has not examined whether such biases emerge even in the absence of cultural stereotypes. The current research investigates whether individual differences in chronic beliefs about interpersonal threat interact with target group membership to elicit shooter biases, even when group membership is unrelated to race or cultural stereotypes about danger. Across two studies, participants with strong beliefs about interpersonal threats were more likely to mistakenly shoot outgroup members than ingroup members; this was observed for unfamiliar, arbitrarily formed groups using a minimal group paradigm (Study 1) and racial groups not culturally stereotyped as dangerous (Asians; Study 2). Implications for the roles of both group membership and cultural stereotypes in shaping decisions to shoot are discussed.

T1  - "Prejudiced" behavior without prejudice? Beliefs about the malleability of prejudice affect interracial interactions
AN  - 1347782709; 201318685
AB  - Prejudiced behavior is typically seen as emanating from prejudiced attitudes. Eight studies showed that majority-group members' beliefs about prejudice can create seemingly "prejudiced" behaviors above and beyond prejudice measured explicitly (Study 1b) and implicitly (Study 2). Those who believed prejudice was relatively fixed, rather than malleable, were less interested in interracial interactions (Studies 1a-1d), race- or diversity-related activities (Study 1a), and activities to reduce their prejudice (Study 3). They were also more uncomfortable in interracial, but not same-race, interactions (Study 2). Study 4 manipulated beliefs about prejudice and found that a fixed belief, by heightening concerns about revealing prejudice to oneself and others, depressed interest in interracial interactions. Further, though Whites who were taught a fixed belief were more anxious and unfriendly in an interaction with a Black compared with a White individual, Whites who were taught a malleable belief were not (Study 5). Implications for reducing prejudice and improving intergroup relations are discussed. [Copyright The American Psychological Association.]

T1  - The Effect of Racial Group Consciousness on the Political Participation of African Americans and Black Ethnics in Miami-Dade County, Florida
AN  - 1221414268; 201243976
AB  - This research examines group consciousness among people of African descent in Miami-Dade County, Florida, and its possible impact on their political participation. Using an original survey of over one thousand respondents, the authors question whether African Americans and black ethnics (Africans, Afro-Caribbean Americans, Afro-Cuban Americans, and Haitians) possess a shared group consciousness and, if so, why. Second, does group consciousness or socioeconomic status most influence the political participation of our respondents? The authors find that these groups have a common consciousness because of their skin color, experiences with discrimination, common interests, similar ideological views, and leadership preferences. They also find that while group consciousness has more of an impact on African American political participation, socioeconomic status more heavily influences black ethnics. Last, factors such as age, gender, partisanship, religion, and second-generation citizenship also affect African American and/or black ethnic political participation.

T1  - Emotions in context: Anger causes ethnic bias but not gender bias in men but not women
AN  - 1221406626; 201243930
AB  - Emotions influence information processing because they are assumed to carry valuable information. We predict that induced anger will increase ethnic but not gender intergroup bias because anger is related to conflicts for resources, and ethnic groups typically compete for resources, whereas gender groups typically engage in relations of positive interdependence. Furthermore, we also predict that this increased ethnic intergroup bias should only be observed among men because men show more group-based reactions to intergroup conflict than women do. Two studies, with 65 and 120 participants, respectively, indeed show that anger induction increases ethnic but not gender intergroup bias and only for men. Intergroup bias was measured with an implicit measure. In Study 2, we additionally predict (and find) that fear induction does not change ethnic or gender intergroup bias because intergroup bias is a psychological preparation for collective action and fear is not associated with taking action against out-groups. We conclude that the effect of anger depends on its specific informational potential in a particular intergroup context. These results highlight that gender groups differ on a crucial point from ethnic groups and call for more attention to the effect of people's gender in intergroup relations research.

T1  - Recruitment and Representation of Ethnic Minorities under Proportional Representation: Evidence from Bulgaria
AN  - 1037875597; 201231170
AB  - This article explores the effects that electoral rules, party ideologies, and structural characteristics of minority communities have on party system responses to the need of accommodating the country's ethnic diversity. The article uses an original dataset on parliamentary representation in Bulgaria to analyze candidate selection practices of electorally successful political parties. The article's findings highlight the need to qualify the academic discussion of beneficial effects of proportional representation (PR) electoral rules for minority representation. The authors report the failures of demographically large ethnic groups to secure close-to-proportional representation under Bulgaria's choice of PR electoral system. The authors also identify costs in terms of reduced competitiveness and accountability that PR-facilitated electoral success of ethnic minority parties can impose on minority constituencies.

T1  - Validation of Social Connectedness in Mainstream Society and the Ethnic Community Scales
AN  - 1622294494; 201438453
AB  - This study examined the psychometric properties of the Social Connectedness in Mainstream Society (SCMN) and the Social Connectedness in the Ethnic Community (SCETH) Scales in two groups of ethnic minorities. We especially examined their theoretical/conceptual and empirical viability in relation to other established constructs of general social connectedness, acculturation, and enculturation. Analyses of two sets of survey data from 200 Mexican American students in California and 134 Asian international students in Minnesota supported (a) construct validity of the SCMN and the SCETH as related but distinct structures, (b) convergent and discriminant validity in relation to acculturation and enculturation, and (c) high reliability. The examination of incremental validity in predicting subjective well-being further supported their distinctive utility in addition to other established constructs of general social connectedness, acculturation, enculturation, ethnic identity, and other group orientation. Implications for future research and practice are discussed. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Sibling relationships in Dutch and immigrant families
AN  - 1037879162; 201231247
AB  - This study examines differences in sibling relationships among native Dutch and immigrant groups in the Netherlands. It uses a large national dataset to compare adult sibling relationships among Moroccan, Turkish, Caribbean and native Dutch groups, focusing on the varying importance of gender composition and age structure for the sibling relationship in the ethnic minority groups and the native Dutch families. Results show that, on average, ethnic minorities in the Netherlands have more involved sibling relationships in adulthood, with more contact, more emotional support, practical support (except Turks and Antilleans), a higher relationship quality, but also more conflict (among the Turks and Antilleans) compared to the Dutch. Gender constellation and hierarchical position were not of equal influence in all groups, although no clear patterns emerged. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Focus groups as a tool in the construction of questionnaires: the case of discriminatory attitudes
AN  - 898217708
AB  - The aim of the present article is twofold First, it tests and demonstrates the supplementary use of focus groups to construct quantitatively oriented survey on anti-minority sentiment. Second, it clarifies two major theoretical concepts-prejudice versus perceived threat-in the research on discriminatory attitudes towards minority populations. More specifically, by using data from focus group discussions on foreign workers in Israel, the study examines the use of such groups for measurement of prejudice and perceived threat within the social and cultural context of Israeli society. The analysis of focus group discussions provides adapted questionnaire scales for measuring prejudice and perceived threat. The findings support the premise that prejudice and perceived threat are two distinct theoretical concepts.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - The present article analyzes transitions to homeownership among immigrant groups and natives in West Germany over a 24-year period from 1984 to 2008. Using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (GSOEP), we find that everything else being equal, Turks, ex-Yugoslavians, Southern Europeans, and Eastern Europeans do not display any differences in transitions into homeownership. Immigrants from wealthy Western countries and native Germans possess similar and higher transitions into homeownership. Factors exhibiting a positive effect on transitions to homeownership include years since migration, marital status, age, income, and education. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Support for Europe among Europe's Ethnic, Religious, and Immigrant Minorities
AN  - 964189268; 201208162
AB  - The defeat of the Reform treaty in the June 2008 Irish referendum, after the French and Dutch rejections of the Constitutional Treaty in 2005, made public support for European integration a central concern among those interested in the fate of the project. We examine the attitudes of individuals who belong to minority groups within EU countries toward European integration, relying on the 2006 European Social Survey in 21 countries. We find that minority populations, defined in terms of language, self-identification, religion, and immigrant status, are nearly universally more likely to favor further integration of Europe. Minority group members have come to see the EU as a potential ally in promoting their rights and welfare. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - The relationship between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among young Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch
AN  - 919903140; 201201748
AB  - Background: This study examines the associations between perceived discrimination and depressive symptoms among Turkish-Dutch and Moroccan-Dutch adolescents and young adults living in the Netherlands. Methods: We analysed cross-sectional data from a sample of 199 Turkish-Dutch and 153 Moroccan-Dutch respondents, aged 15-24 years, using multiple logistic regression analyses. Discrimination was measured on group level and personal level. Depression was measured by the Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D). Results: Respondents that experienced perceived discrimination on a personal level were more likely than those that experienced no perceived discrimination to have depression (OR = 3.21, 95% CI = 1.59-6.47). This association was larger for the Moroccan-Dutch (OR = 5.32, 95% CI = 1.75-16.16) compared with the Turkish-Dutch (OR = 2.76, 95% CI = 1.03-7.40). Analysis of separate group level discrimination items, measuring different domains, revealed an association between discrimination on school and depression for the Moroccan-Dutch (OR = 2.80, 95% CI = 1.16-6.78). Conclusion: Personal level perceived discrimination is associated with depressive symptoms among young minority group members with a Turkish or Moroccan cultural background. This indicates that discrimination is an important factor that should be taken into account in developing public health policies. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Trends in the Suburbanization of Racial/Ethnic Groups in U.S. Metropolitan Areas, 1970 to 2000
AN  - 881465154; 201116475
AB  - This research examines recent trends in suburbanization for non-Latino Whites, Blacks, and Asians, and Latinos of all races. The authors find some association between group-level acculturation and socioeconomic status and 2000 suburbanization rates; however, these associations are largely attenuated by controls for suburban housing supply and do not explain much of the variation in changes in suburbanization rates from 1970 to 2000. Suburban housing supply is strongly associated with 2000 levels of suburbanization, yet these effects are largely attenuated by controlling for the suburban share of employment and affordable housing. Finally, the authors find large effects of change in suburban housing supply on change in group suburbanization rates; however, these effects are much weaker for Blacks relative to the other groups.

T1  - The Perceptions of Self and Others: Examining the Effect Identity Adoption has on Immigrant Attitudes toward Affirmative Action Policies in the United States
AN  - 870433603; 201114276
AB  - While there exist several studies devoted to evaluating the political attitudes of US citizens, very little has been done to distinguish between the political attitudes of immigrants and citizens of the same racial or ethnic group. Using data from the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality, 1992-94, this study evaluates the role identity adoption plays in highlighting the distinctions which exist between the political attitudes of immigrants and those of US citizens from the same racial/ethnic group. The results reveal that despite pronounced cultural distinctions between immigrants and US citizens, in many cases race and ethnicity are important unifiers on opinions regarding public policy issues, specifically that of affirmative action. This is an important finding because it suggests that there is some homogeneity of attitudes and public opinions for racial and ethnic groups, regardless of citizenship or immigrant background.

T1  - Driving While Non-White: Exploring Traffic Stops and Post-Stop Activities in North Carolina, 2005-2009
AN  - 1010632423; 201210552
AB  - Research has established that Blacks face disproportionate amounts of traffic stops, searches, and arrests by police compared to Whites. However, few studies have ventured past the Black-White dichotomy and considered how Hispanics or other minorities may face the same disparities, especially in places where the Hispanic population has dramatically increased in recent years. Using traffic stop and post-stop data compiled by the North Carolina Department of Justice from 2005 to 2009, this study explored whether Hispanics, Blacks, as well as other racial minorities experienced a higher likelihood of traffic stops, citations, searches, and arrests compared to Whites within sample of city, county, and state law enforcement agencies. We found that generally all racial and ethnic minority groups face higher rates of traffic stops than Whites by almost every law enforcement agency sampled. We also found that rates of post-stop activities including searches, citations, and arrests are higher for all racial and ethnic minority groups examined compared to Whites, especially for Hispanics. Hispanic and non-White disparities in traffic stops also cannot be explained away when controlling for population size, type of law enforcement agency, or the reason stated for the traffic stop (e.g., DWI, speeding, or investigation). More important, however, is that the rate of searches for racial and ethnic minorities did not necessarily match the rates of citations and arrests minorities receive, suggesting that some stops could be racially or ethnically motivated.

T1  - Speaking Out on Immigration Policy in Australia: Identity Threat and the Interplay of Own Opinion and Public Opinion
AN  - 835112672; 201100908
AB  - This article presents a survey of 667 Australian voters examining support for a new conservative social movement in relation to attitudes toward Asian immigration, involvement in an evolving anti-immigration debate, and willingness to speak out politically. Supporters of the new conservatives were motivated to get involved and speak out by perceived threat to White Australians, as well as the perception of a favorable normative climate. In contrast, for opponents, higher education and welcoming attitudes toward Asian immigration were associated with political involvement, as well as the perception that the social climate was changing against them (becoming more conservative). The data show that in a time of changing public opinion, people may speak out more when they perceive that their views are losing ground, providing evidence for active resistance rather than a spiral of silence on the part of the losing side.

T1  - Asian American television activity: Is it related to outgroup vitality
AN  - 818801924; 201072799
AB  - Applying a uses and gratifications and social identity gratifications approach, the present study explores Asian American television viewing. Specifically, Asian Americans report on the quantity of television they watch, what shows they watch, why they watch, and whether their uses are related to their perceptions of Caucasian vitality. The data reveal that using television for entertainment and to escape/relieve boredom were the most important television uses for this group of Asian Americans. At the same time, these two uses were significant predictors of how vital Asian Americans perceived Caucasians. Although selecting and avoiding television for ethnic identity gratifications were not important relative to other gratifications, television selection for identity gratifications was important to Asian Americans who highly identify with their ethnic group.

T1  - Ethnicity Differences in the Completion Rates of Upper Secondary Education: How Do the Effects of Gender and Social Background Variables Interplay?
AN  - 822521847; 201072612
AB  - This article compares completion rates in Norwegian upper secondary education among ethnic minority groups and the ethnic majority. We examine differences by nationality background among the immigrant groups, and between first- and second-generation immigrants, and how the effects of social origin vary between ethnic majority and minority, and between boys and girls. The findings indicate that parents' education level is of less significance for students with a non-Western background than for the ethnic majority. The ethnic majority students benefit more from having parents with high education, but the immigrants seem to lose less from having low-educated parents. There are large gender differences in favour of girls. Among students with a non-Western background, the education level of the mother is of particular significance for girls, as well as the mother and father having employment. Among the minority groups, students with Bosnian, Vietnamese and Sri Lankan background are doing particularly well. Adapted from the source document.

T1  - Projections of the Ethnic Minority Populations of the United Kingdom 2006-2056
AN  - 764419477; 201064706
AB  - The ethnic minority populations in the UK are growing substantially through immigration, a youthful age structure, and in some cases relatively high fertility. Their diverse demographic and socioeconomic characteristics have attracted considerable academic and policy attention, especially insofar as those distinctive characteristics have persisted in the generations born in the UK. No official projections of the UK ethnic populations have been published since 1979. This article provides projections to 2056 and beyond of 12 ethnic groups. Given overall net immigration and vital rates as assumed in the office for National Statistics 2008-based Principal Projection, and the ethnic characteristics estimated here, the ethnic minority populations (including the Other White) would increase from 13 percent of the UK population in 2006 to 28 percent by 2031 and 44 percent by 2056, and to about half the 0-4 age group in 2056. Alternative projections assume various lower levels of immigration. Possible implications of projected changes are discussed. Adapted from the source document.
